        "The salient facts": "3 The relevant facts of this case were\n\nlargely undisputed. On the morning of 11 April 1999 at around 6.30am, the appellant left\n\nher flat on the third storey of Block 31 Dover Road. She walked to the staircase landing\n\nnearest to her flat, and there received a blue travel bag and a large red plastic bag from\n\na man, later ascertained to be one Lim Beng Soon ('Lim'). The blue travel bag had a huge\n\ntear near its zipper.4 After handing over the bags to the\n\nappellant, Lim headed back to the carpark below Block 31 Dover Road while the appellant\n\nreturned to her flat. The appellant brought the two bags into the master bedroom of her\n\nflat, and proceeded to take out its contents which turned out to be eight slabs of opium\n\nwrapped separately in masking tape and weighing a total of some 12kg. The appellant\n\nproceeded to wrap each individual slab of opium neatly with newspapers before placing them\n\none-by-one into separate plastic bags. She then placed the eight plastic bags of opium\n\nslabs under her bed in the master bedroom and pulled the bedspread over so that the bags\n\nwere blocked from view.5 Approximately 15 minutes after the\n\nappellant had returned to her flat, a team of Central Narcotics Bureau ('CNB') officers\n\nraided the unit. The appellant opened the door only after the officers had knocked for\n\naround three to four minutes and after one of them had started to cut the padlock on the\n\niron grill outside the front door. Upon entering the flat, W/Cpl Jessilyn Tan Poh Choo\n\n(PW27) ascertained the appellant's particulars while Sgt Ronie Chua (PW22) proceeded to\n\nsecure the premises during which he discovered the plastic bags under the bed in the\n\nmaster bedroom. The following exchange was then recorded by W/Insp Jenny Tan (PW24) as\n\nhaving taken place between the appellant and herself in the master bedroom of the flat:Q: What are those?A: OpiumQ: How many?A: 8 slabsQ: Belong to who?A: Not mine.Q: Why in your room?A: I brought in from outside my home.Q: Why you bring them into your home?A: (She refuses to answer the question)6 The appellant was taken back to the CNB\n\nwhere various statements were then taken from her over the course of the next few days.\n\nThese statements, which formed the mainstay of the prosecution's case, were admitted by\n\nthe trial judge in the court below without any challenge as to their voluntariness. We now\n\nset out in brief the gist of each of these statements.The s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code or\n\ncautioned statement (P122)7 This statement was recorded by the\n\ninvestigating officer in the afternoon of 11 April 1999. In this statement, the appellant\n\nstated:A Chinese man asked me to keep some\n\n  packets for him. He told me that he would collect the packets from me one or two days\n\n  later. When I took the packets to my master bedroom, I then discovered that the packets\n\n  were opium. I immediately went out of my flat to look for the Chinese man but he had\n\n  already gone. I was thinking whether to call the police or to wait for the Chinese man to\n\n  collect the packets back from me. When the police came, I opened the door and led the\n\n  policemen to my bedroom where the packets were. I do not know the name of this Chinese\n\n  man. I can only recognise him by sight. I do not know why this Chinese man handed these\n\n  packages to me to keep for him.The investigation statementsP124, recorded on 13 April 19998 The appellant stated here that she\n\nreceived a page on the night of 10 April 1999. When she called back, a man speaking in\n\nHokkien introduced himself as 'Ah Tan' and claimed that he was a friend of her late\n\nhusband's. He then asked the appellant to keep something for him. She asked him what the\n\nthing was to which he replied that they were just a few packets of things, and did not\n\ndisclose further. The appellant nevertheless agreed to keep the things for him. The next\n\nmorning on 11 April 1999, she received a telephone call from another Chinese man, who told\n\nher that he had the things with him on the ground floor and was coming up to the third\n\nstorey to pass the things to her but that he did not know her unit number. She then told\n\nhim that she would be standing at the door of her flat. Thereafter, the appellant stood\n\noutside her door and saw a Chinese man come up the stairs with a blue bag and a red\n\nplastic bag. The man placed the bags on the floor and then went back down the stairs again\n\nwithout speaking to the appellant.9 The appellant took the two bags into the\n\nmaster bedroom of her flat. She detected a strong odour of opium upon which she looked\n\ninto the bags and saw several packets of things wrapped in brown masking tape. She\n\nproceeded to wrap the packets in newspapers and put each packet separately into plastic\n\nbags. She then placed all eight bags under her bed. She then contemplated whether to call\n\nthe police or to wait for Ah Tan to come and collect the packets from her.P125, recorded on 15 April 199910 In this statement, the appellant said\n\nthat she had wrapped the packets of opium because the odour emanating from them was\n\nunbearable. After placing the packets under her bed, she waited to see if Ah Tan would\n\ncall her. If he did not call her, she would then tell her sons about the opium when they\n\nwoke up.11 The appellant further stated that Ah\n\nTan never called her at home or at her food stall at the Dover Road hawker centre. She\n\nsaid that she had only contacted him once, and that was at the time when she had returned\n\nhis page on the night of 10 April 1999. He had not offered her any payment for her\n\nassistance in storing the things, but did tell her that he would come and collect the\n\npackets from her in a day or two.12 When shown a photograph of Henry Tan\n\nKok Hwa, the man later ascertained to be the 'Ah Tan' in question, the appellant\n\nrecognised him as a friend of her late husband's but denied knowing his name as her late\n\nhusband never introduced him to her. She further said that she had never spoken to Henry\n\nTan before. Neither did she know if Henry Tan was the person who had called her. She added\n\nthat Henry Tan never came by her house or stall following her husband's death.P126, recorded on 21 April 199913 The appellant said here that Ah Tan had\n\nspoken to her about a week before 10 April 1999. She could not recall however the\n\nsubstance of their conversation.14 On the night of 10 April 1999, she\n\nreturned an earlier page and the person on the line told her that he was Ah Tan, a friend\n\nof her late husband's. He then asked her to keep a few packets of things for him which he\n\nsaid would be delivered to her in one or two days' time. She claimed to have asked him\n\nwhat the packets contained but he did not tell her.D5, recorded on 29 April 199915 In this statement, which was admitted\n\nupon the application of the defence, the appellant stated that when she discovered that\n\nthe packets contained opium, she waited for Ah Tan to call her. If he did not do so before\n\nher sons woke up, she would call the police. She did not however think of calling Ah Tan\n\nalthough she had his telephone number stored on her pager.16 When shown a photograph of Henry Tan\n\nKok Hwa, she again denied knowing if this was the same Ah Tan who had asked her to store\n\nthe packets of opium for him.17 At the close of the prosecution's case,\n\nthe learned trial judge found that the facts as disclosed by the appellant's police\n\nstatements were sufficient to found a prima facie case and called upon the appellant to\n\nenter her defence.",
        "The defence": "18 The appellant elected to give evidence.19 The appellant was a 51-year-old\n\ndivorcee. She could not recall when she divorced her husband, but said that the latter\n\nmoved back in with her subsequently although they never remarried. Her husband was an\n\nopium addict.20 The appellant lived with her two sons\n\nat the Dover Road flat. She ran a seafood stall at the Dover Road hawker centre with her\n\nelder son, Ying Khui Hock (DW2). She met Henry Tan, whom she knew as 'Ah Tan', through her\n\nlate ex-husband. She testified that Ah Tan visited the family very often both at home and\n\nat the stall and was very close to them. In this connection, Henry Tan, his wife and his\n\ndaughter were all invited to Ying Khui Hock's wedding in January 1997 and his daughter's\n\ncar was even lent to the latter for use during the celebration. Meanwhile, Henry Tan also\n\nhelped the appellant's family in various ways over the years. In particular, he lent the\n\nappellant's ex-husband $40,000 to pay off his gambling debts and further gave the family a\n\nloan of $25,000 to renovate their flat. In addition, he also provided the funds for Ying\n\nKee Yeow (DW3), the appellant's younger son's education in Australia. None of these debts\n\nwere ever repaid by the appellant or her family nor did Ah Tan ever demand repayment of\n\nthem. Henry Tan further played a pivotal role in getting the appellant and her husband to\n\nreconcile after their divorce. After the husband's death in February 1998, Henry Tan\n\ncontinued to persuade Ying Khui Hock to enter into a joint venture restaurant business\n\nwith him and also continued to visit the appellant to find out how she was getting on.21 The appellant gave evidence that when\n\nher ex-husband was alive, he often kept things for Ah Tan at their flat. She claimed that\n\nher ex-husband told her that the things were dried foodstuffs from Pasir Panjang and were\n\nkept at their flat as it was closer to Pasir Panjang than Ah Tan's own home. The appellant\n\ndescribed that the things came in boxes of varying sizes and were tightly sealed so she\n\ncould not see their contents. The boxes would be delivered either by Ah Tan himself or one\n\nof his workers and would be collected back either several hours or one or two days later.22 Ah Tan continued to keep things at the\n\nappellant's flat after the husband's death. In February 1999, Ah Tan telephoned the\n\nappellant and told her that he had a few packets of things to be kept at her flat and that\n\nhe would collect them from her two days later. Following this, a sealed-up box was sent to\n\nher by one of Ah Tan's workers. As indicated, Ah Tan himself came and collected the box\n\ntwo days later.23 About a week before her arrest on 11\n\nApril 1999, Ah Tan called the appellant again and told her that he had a few packets of\n\nthings to be kept in her flat. She asked him what the things were to which he replied that\n\nthey were just 'a few packets of things'.24 On the night of 10 April 1999, Ah Tan\n\npaged the appellant again. She was at a wedding dinner that night and did not return the\n\npage until later. The page turned out to have been from Ah Tan, whose voice the appellant\n\nsaid she could recognise when she returned the page a few hours later. Again, Ah Tan told\n\nher that he had a few packets of things to be put in her flat. It was agreed that Ah Tan's\n\nworker would deliver the things and would call the appellant when he arrived at her block\n\nof flats the next morning. Ah Tan further told her that he would collect the things from\n\nher two days later.25 On the morning of 11 April 1999, the\n\nappellant received a telephone call sometime between 6.15am and 6.20am. The caller,\n\nspeaking in Hokkien, told her that someone had left some things with him to be passed to\n\nher. She instructed him to bring the things up to the third storey lift landing, and\n\nthereafter went out of her flat to meet the caller.26 At the third storey lift landing, the\n\nappellant met a Chinese man who had with him a travelling bag and a plastic bag. She\n\nconfirmed that he was sent by Ah Tan to deliver the things and thereafter told him to\n\nleave the things on the floor. She then brought the things into her flat. She testified\n\nthat the things were heavy and that she did not take a good look at them before returning\n\nto her flat.27 At the flat, the appellant took the two\n\nbags into the master bedroom. The travel bag was unzipped. When she placed the bags on the\n\nfloor, she discovered an odour emanating from them, one which she recognised to be the\n\nsmell of opium. Shocked, she ran out of her flat to look for the man who had delivered the\n\nbags to her. Her intention, she claimed, was to find out if he had delivered the wrong\n\nthings to her. She knew that opium was an illegal substance. She failed to locate the man\n\nand after one or two minutes, returned to her room. The smell from the opium became\n\nunbearable. The appellant then went to the living room of her flat and obtained some\n\nnewspapers with which she used to wrap the opium slabs individually. Thereafter, she went\n\nto the kitchen to get several plastic bags in which she placed each slab separately. She\n\nclaimed that all this was done in order to reduce the odour which she said was unbearably\n\nstrong.28 Subsequently, the appellant tried to\n\nwake her elder son Ying Khui Hock but before she could wake him fully, the CNB officers\n\nstarted knocking at her door. Afraid that her grandson would be frightened by the noise,\n\nshe let the officers in. The appellant alleged that it did occur to her to call the police\n\nthe moment she discovered the opium, but that she did not do so as her son's in-laws were\n\nstaying at the flat at that time and she was worried about how involving the police might\n\nappear to them. She further claimed that it also did occur to her to call Ah Tan but that\n\nshe did not do so as she was nervous and frightened.29 When asked by her counsel why she did\n\nnot respond to W/Insp Jenny Tan's question at her flat as to why she had brought the opium\n\ninto her house, the appellant replied that she was frightened and did not know how to\n\nanswer the question. She testified to the effect that as the person making the delivery\n\nwas merely a worker, she could not be sure if the drugs belonged to Ah Tan. As such, she\n\ndid not dare say anything in answer to W/Insp Jenny Tan's final question.30 The appellant confirmed that the charge\n\nagainst her as well as its consequences were read and explained to her after she was\n\nbrought back to the CNB. Thereafter, the notice of warning was also read and explained to\n\nher, after which she was invited to give a statement which she did. She further admitted\n\nthat at the time when she made her cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code (Cap 68) (i.e., P122), she was almost certain that Ah Tan was in fact\n\ninvolved with the opium. Nevertheless, she did not mention his name when giving this\n\nstatement as she wanted him to admit his own involvement. She knew however at the time of\n\ngiving this statement, that Ah Tan had been arrested along with several others as she had\n\nseen them at the CNB when she herself was taken in for questioning.31 When referred to her subsequent\n\ninvestigation statements by her counsel, the appellant corrected various parts of them and\n\nadmitted that several of those parts were incorrect. In particular, the appellant admitted\n\nthat she had lied when she said in her statements that Ah Tan never called her at home or\n\nat her stall but could not explain why she had told such a lie. She further admitted that\n\nshe had not told the truth in her statements when she stated that she did not know Ah\n\nTan's name, or that she had never spoken to him before or that she did not know if the\n\nperson who had paged for her on 10 April 1999 was Ah Tan. As before however, the appellant\n\nwas unable to proffer any explanation for her misstatements.32 When asked why she had not mentioned\n\nthe fact that she had come out of her flat again to look for the Chinese man upon\n\ndiscovering the opium in her investigation statements, the appellant simply said that she\n\nhad forgotten to mention it.33 In response to a question posed by the\n\nlearned trial judge, the appellant testified that she had the intention of calling the\n\npolice the moment she discovered the opium. She further said that had she called the\n\npolice, she would have told them that someone had left things in her flat and that the\n\nthings were opium. She stressed also that she would have given Ah Tan's name, description\n\nand telephone number to the police. When asked why she did not then mention Ah Tan to\n\nW/Insp Jenny Tan during the questioning session in her flat, the appellant simply replied\n\nthat she could not recall the reason for not having done so.34 During cross-examination by the learned\n\nDPP the next day, the appellant retracted her earlier testimony and claimed that it never\n\noccurred to her to call the police at all. She further alleged that her prior allegation\n\nthat she had intended to call the police was untrue. The appellant maintained that\n\nalthough she knew, at least by 12 April 1999, that Ah Tan was definitely involved with the\n\nopium, she nevertheless did not mention his relationship with her family in any of her\n\npolice statements as she wanted him to admit his connection to the drugs himself.35 In re-examination, the appellant again\n\nchanged her testimony and reverted to her original stand that she did in fact intend to\n\ncall the police upon discovery of the opium. She further said that her evidence in\n\ncross-examination about not having intended to call the police was not the truth, and\n\nadmitted that she owed Ah Tan a 'great favour'.36 The appellant's two sons were also\n\ncalled to give evidence for the defence. The gist of their evidence however did not relate\n\nto the main issues of the case. As such, we will not trouble ourselves with it in this\n\njudgment.",
        "The decision below": "37 At the end of the hearing, the learned\n\ntrial judge found that the appellant was indeed in possession of the opium at the time of\n\nher arrest. She knew that the substances were opium as she herself had admitted that she\n\nrecognised its odour. As the quantity of opium in this case exceeded the statutory minimum\n\nof 100g, the presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) ('the MDA') came\n\ninto operation. The appellant was thus presumed to have been in possession of the opium\n\nfor the purpose of the trafficking and unless she could rebut that presumption, would be\n\nfound guilty of trafficking in opium.38 Upon analysing the evidence presented\n\nbefore him, the learned trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the\n\npresumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities and sentenced her to suffer the\n\nmandatory death penalty.",
        "The law": "39 The law relating to the offence of\n\ndrug-trafficking and the operation of the various statutory presumptions contained in the\n\nMDA are clear and well settled. There are, under the MDA, essentially two types of\n\ndrug-trafficking: The first is trafficking by one of the acts as defined in s 2 of the\n\nstatute, while the second is possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The\n\nlatter type, which is that with which we are concerned in this appeal, is created by s\n\n5(2) of the MDA. While the prosecution may rely on the presumptions in ss 18 and 21 when\n\nproving offences of the first type, its burden is heavier where offences of the second\n\ntype are concerned for actual possession of the drugs must then be proved. As such, in\n\nmaking out the charge against the appellant in the present case, the prosecution has the\n\ntask of adducing evidence to show that the appellant was in possession of the opium at the\n\nrelevant time: seeLow Kok Wai v PP[1994] 1 SLR 676;PP v Wan Yue Kong and ors[1995] 1 SLR 417andLim Lye Huat Benny v PP[1996] 1 SLR 253. This it may do by\n\nproving firstly, that the appellant had physical control of the quantity of opium in\n\nquestion at the material time and secondly, that she knew that what she had under her\n\nphysical control was opium: seeFun Seong Cheng v PP[1997] 3 SLR 523;Su Chee\n\nKiong v PP[1999] 1 SLR 782andGulam bin Notam Mohd Shariff Jamalddin and anor v\n\nPP[1999] 2 SLR 181. Once the above is satisfied, s 17 of the MDA then comes into\n\noperation, creating a presumption that the accused was in possession of the offensive\n\nsubstances for the purpose of trafficking in them. The relevant provisions of s 17 read as\n\nfollows:17. Any person who is proved to have had\n\n  in his possession more than –(a) 100 grammes of opium;…..whether or not contained in any substance,\n\n  extract, preparation or mixture shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for\n\n  the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not\n\n  for that purpose.Hence, the mere fact that an accused is\n\nfound to be in possession of 100g or more of opium would automatically trigger the\n\npresumption of trafficking.40 This presumption however is not\n\nirrebuttable. InVan Damme Johannes v PP[1994] 1 SLR 246, it was explained by this\n\ncourt that once the presumption is brought into play, the onus then falls on the accused\n\nto discharge the presumption. It would then be up to the court to decide whether or not to\n\nbelieve him; to assess his credibility and veracity; to observe his demeanour; to listen\n\nto what he has to say; to go through the evidence and determine whether his story was\n\nconsistent and finally to make a judicial decision.41 Hence, once the presumption is\n\ntriggered, the burden falls on the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that he\n\nwas not in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.",
        "Our decision": "The question of possession42 The first issue which needed to be\n\ndetermined in this appeal therefore was the question of whether or not the prosecution had\n\neven succeeded in proving that the appellant was in possession of the opium at the time of\n\nher arrest, for, as mentioned earlier, possession of the drugs must be proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt before the presumption in s 17 of the MDA may be relied upon.43 InFun Seong Cheng v PP(supra),\n\nthis court stated at p 537 that:Physical control is not enough for the\n\n  purpose of proving possession. There needs to bemens reaon the part of the\n\n  accused.In Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner[1969] 2 AC 256, a case where\n\n  the House of Lords was trying to determine the meaning of 'possession' for the purpose of\n\n  s 1 of the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964, Lord Pearce had this to say:One may, therefore, exclude from the\n\n    'possession' intended by the Act the physical control of articles which have been\n\n    'planted' on him without his knowledge. But how much further is one to go? If one goes to\n\n    the extreme length of requiring the prosecution to prove that 'possession' implies a full\n\n    knowledge of the name and nature of the drugs concerned, the efficacy of the Act is\n\n    seriously impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I think that\n\n    the term 'possession' is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing\n\n    itself and not its qualities…InTan Ah Tee v PP[1980] 1 MLJ 49;[1978-1979] SLR 211, a case concerning the meaning of 'possession' in the Misuse of Drugs\n\n  Act 1973, Lord Pearce's dicta was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal. Wee Chong\n\n  Jin CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:In our opinion, the word 'possession' in\n\n    the Act should be construed as that word has been construed by Lord Pearce and we would\n\n    respectfully adopt his reasons as contained in his speech.A long line of cases have since followedTan\n\n  Ah Tee v PPandWarner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner.In the recent case ofGulam bin Notan\n\nMohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP(supra), we confirmed that the above passages fromFun\n\nSeong Cheng'scase are still good law and applied them accordingly. What needs to be\n\nproved in each case therefore is that the accused had knowledge of the existence of the\n\n'thing' in question.44 Applying the law to the facts of the\n\ninstant case, we found that the prosecution had more than amply proven that the appellant\n\nwas indeed in possession of the opium when the CNB officers raided her flat on the morning\n\nof 11 April 1999. Clearly the opium was within her physical possession, for they were\n\nfound in her master bedroom and she had in any case admitted having brought them into her\n\nflat from outside. She further never denied that she knew that the substances contained in\n\nthe two bags were opium. With this knowledge, she proceeded to wrap each slab of opium\n\nneatly with newspapers in her bedroom and thereafter placed each neatly-wrapped slab into\n\nseparate plastic bags and tied them up. She then even bothered to put the things under her\n\nbed and pulled the bedcover over so that they would be hidden from view. Not once did the\n\nappellant ever attempt to reject possession of the substances after she had discovered\n\ntheir true nature. Clearly we found that on the evidence, the prosecution had more than\n\nadequately satisfied its burden of proving that the appellant knew that what she had in\n\nher physical possession was opium and in our view, that is all that is required to trigger\n\nthe presumption of trafficking in s 17.",
        "The presumption of trafficking –\n\nwhether rebutted?": "45 Having found the fact of possession to\n\nhave been proved by the prosecution, the onus then shifted to the appellant to show that\n\nshe was not in possession of the opium for the purpose of trafficking.46 The appellant did not deny that she\n\nknew of the existence and nature of the drugs soon after she had returned to her flat.\n\nNeither did she advance the assertion that the drugs were for her own consumption. Her\n\nonly defence appeared to be that she did not know that the bags contained opium at the\n\ntime when they were passed to her by Lim at the third storey lift landing of her block of\n\nflats, and this, her counsel argued was sufficient to rebut the presumption of\n\ntrafficking.47 In our view, the above argument by\n\ncounsel was wholly misconceived. While the appellant's lack of knowledge of the contents\n\nof the bags when she received them might have the effect of disproving possession of the\n\nopium on her part, it clearly did nothing towards rebutting the presumption of\n\ntrafficking. Quite the contrary, we had no doubt that the appellant's subsequent behaviour\n\nin the flat upon discovering the opium clearly supported the presumption of trafficking\n\nrather than had the effect of rebutting it. The appellant testified that she knew that the\n\nitems contained in the bags were opium when she returned to her master bedroom. She\n\nfurther conceded that she knew that opium was an illegal substance. In these\n\ncircumstances, one would have expected that her immediate reaction would have been to call\n\nthe police, to wake her sons, or to call Ah Tan to find out why he had passed the opium to\n\nher. Yet not one of these courses of action did the appellant adopt. She instead took the\n\ntrouble to individually wrap and pack each slab of opium with newspapers, and even placed\n\nthem into separate plastic bags. Her allegation that she was frightened and anxious and\n\ndid not know what to do clearly did not hold water when one considers the neatness and\n\nmeticulousness with which she had packed each slab of opium. If she had indeed been scared\n\nor worried as she claimed, then in all likelihood the slabs, if wrapped at all, would have\n\nbeen wrapped altogether and haphazardly, rather than individually. The neatly-wrapped\n\nslabs of opium as found by the CNB officers clearly demonstrated the work of a person with\n\na calm and composed frame of mind who knew exactly what she was doing rather than one\n\nfraught with angst and anxiety.48 With respect to the allegation that she\n\nhad wrapped the slabs of opium in order to reduce the odour of the opium, we found that\n\nthis too was a ludicrous suggestion and as such, rightly disbelieved by the learned trial\n\njudge. The appellant had herself admitted that her late ex-husband was an opium addict,\n\nand that was how she came to recognise the odour of the drug. This being the case, it\n\nseemed to us that the appellant must have been quite used to the smell of opium and could\n\nnot possibly have been overly offended by it. As such, it is difficult to see why there\n\nshould be such a pressing need or want for her to reduce the odour of the drugs and her\n\nevidence to the effect that she could not stand the smell of the opium should thus be\n\ntreated with circumspect. If the appellant's reason for wanting to reduce the odour was\n\nbecause her son's in-laws were visiting and staying in the flat at that time and she did\n\nnot want them to notice the smell, which she in any event denied to be the case, this too\n\nwas a flimsy reason which we found to be unbelievable. There was no reason why the\n\nappellant should have been worried about her guests noticing the smell if she herself was\n\ninnocent of the drugs or if the drugs had been wrongly handed to her as she claimed. In\n\nany case, we were of the view that if the smell was indeed bothering the appellant to such\n\na grave extent, the simplest thing for her to do would have been to throw the bags of\n\nopium away for she had no reason to keep them if her claim that she did not have anything\n\nto do with the drugs was true.49 With respect to the appellant's\n\nevidence to the effect that she did not implicate Henry Tan in her statements because it\n\nwas his worker who had delivered the bags to her and as such she could not be sure if the\n\nopium came from Henry Tan, we found this explanation to be similarly devoid of merit. The\n\nappellant herself testified in court that before accepting the bags, she first confirmed\n\nwith Lim if he had been sent by Ah Tan to deliver the things. In the premises, she must\n\nhave known that the things were from Henry Tan. Next, if she was still unsure as to\n\nwhether the opium in fact belonged to Henry Tan, she could have called him to check the\n\nmoment she discovered the drugs. Yet she did not do so despite the time lag of 15 minutes\n\nbetween her discovery and the subsequent raid on her flat. In addition, there was also\n\nconsiderable delay on the appellant's part in opening the door for the CNB officers\n\ndespite the fact that she was already wide awake at that time, as evidenced by the fact\n\nthat one of the officers had even begun to cut the iron grille and padlock before the\n\nappellant came to the door. In these circumstances, the inescapable conclusion once again\n\nappeared to be that the appellant knew beforehand that she was to receive the drugs from\n\nLim that morning and that she knew fully well that she was engaging in some illicit\n\nactivity.50 There was no doubt that the appellant\n\nwas given ample opportunity to relate Henry Tan's involvement with the opium but yet not\n\nonce did she explain his involvement or his relationship to her and her family until the\n\ntrial. It is telling that when W/Insp Jenny Tan questioned her in the flat, the appellant\n\nremained silent when asked why she had brought the opium into her house. She claimed to\n\nhave been confused and frightened and that it did not occur to her to exculpate herself in\n\nany way nor did she wish to implicate anyone. Subsequently however, when her investigation\n\nstatements were taken, the appellant again failed to tell the whole truth about Henry\n\nTan's involvement with the drugs as well as his earlier dealings with her family,\n\npreferring instead to fudge his identity. Bearing in mind the fact that the opium had been\n\nfound in the appellant's bedroom and that she had admitted having brought them into her\n\nflat from outside, one would have expected the appellant to have attempted to explain and\n\nexonerate herself in the face of the extremely compelling evidence against her. The many\n\ninstances of her failure to do so, when taken collectively, clearly fortified the\n\ninference that the appellant was in some way involved with the opium.51 Another factor strongly suggestive of\n\nthe appellant's guilt was the suspicious manner of the delivery of the bags of opium to\n\nher. It will be recalled that the appellant had asked Lim to meet her at the staircase\n\nlanding of the third storey rather than at her flat itself. When queried about this, the\n\nappellant gave the feeble excuse that this was done as Lim did not know her unit number.\n\nWe found this explanation to be unconvincing. There was no reason why the appellant could\n\nnot have given her unit number to Lim or for her to have waited at the entrance of her\n\nflat for him. After all, it appeared that previous deliveries of things to her or to her\n\nlate ex-husband by Ah Tan or his workers had always been done directly to her flat. There\n\nwas no suggestion that the appellant or her husband ever had to come out of the flat to\n\ncollect the things from the workers. Consequently, there was no reason why an exception\n\nhad to be made in the present case, unless the appellant was concerned not to alert the\n\nother occupants of her flat as to what was truly going on. The appellant also stated in\n\nher investigation statements that while at the staircase landing, she saw 'so much things'\n\nin both bags and became frightened. Indeed, it is difficult to see why there was any\n\nreason for her to be afraid if this was but another of Ah Tan's regular deliveries to her,\n\nall of which had hitherto not led her to any trouble. In the premises, it appeared that\n\nthe appellant's fear could only have been derived from her own guilty knowledge that she\n\nwas dealing with drugs. It is further pertinent that the appellant must have felt the\n\nweight of the bags when she started dragging them back to her flat from the corridor.\n\nDespite noticing that the bags were unusually heavy, the appellant's first reaction was\n\nnot to try and look for Lim immediately or to examine the contents then and there.\n\nInstead, she was content to drag the bags all the way from the staircase landing right\n\ninto the master bedroom of the flat first, close and lock the main door, before opening to\n\nsee what the bags contained. Again, such behaviour on her part strongly suggested that she\n\nalready knew what was in the bags when she received them. With regard to the reference in\n\nher cautioned statement to the fact that she had run out of her flat again to look for Lim\n\nupon discovery of the opium, we were of the view that little weight should be given to\n\nthis for the following reasons. Firstly, the only time that this was mentioned was as\n\nsaid, in the appellant's cautioned statement. Thereafter, the appellant failed to mention\n\nthis fact in the rest of her investigation statements to the police. Next, SSgt Yeoh Seng\n\nHock (PW16) who had been observing the appellant that morning from the exit driveway of\n\nthe carpark to Block 31 Dover Road did not notice the appellant re-emerging from her flat\n\nand walking to the stairwell to look for Lim as she claimed to have done. Finally, the\n\nappellant's subsequent behaviour in wrapping each slab of opium neatly and impeccably is\n\nsimply inconsistent with that of a person who did not wish to be in possession of the\n\ndrugs and who was anxious to return them to the person who had given them to her.52 It is further pertinent at this stage\n\nto point out that even if the appellant was unaware that opium would be delivered to her\n\nand that she intended upon their discovery to return the drugs back to Henry Tan when the\n\nopportunity arose, this alone is sufficient to constitute the offence of trafficking under\n\ns 5(1)(a) of the MDA. It was clarified inLee Yuan Kwang & Ors v PP[1995] 2 SLR 349that under s 5(2) of the MDA, a person commits the offence of trafficking if he\n\nhad in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant in this\n\ncase, like the fourth appellant inLee Yuan Kwang, claimed that she had vacillated\n\nupon discovering the drugs about whether to call the police or to return the drugs to\n\ntheir true owner. It will be recalled that her evidence as to whether or not she had\n\nintended to call the police upon discovering the opium was extremely flimsy and that she\n\nhad thrice changed her testimony on this account without offering any reasonable\n\nexplanation for doing so, thus leading the learned trial judge to find that the evidence\n\nsupporting her innocence was not credible. It is clear afterLee Yuan Kwang's case\n\nthat a mere bailee or custodian of drugs may be said to have had possession of the drugs\n\nfor the purpose of trafficking if by a future act, possession of the drugs would have been\n\ntransferred back to their true owner: see alsoLoh Kim Cheng v PP[1998] 2 SLR 315.\n\nAs such, even if the appellant had been waiting for Henry Tan to call her and had intended\n\nto return the drugs back to him or to his worker, this alone would constitute the offence\n\nof trafficking.53 Counsel for the appellant further\n\nadvanced the point that Henry Tan was a close family friend who had often kept things at\n\nher flat without trouble, and as such, there was no reason for her to suspect that he\n\nwould be involved in illegal activities or that he should be passing her drugs to keep for\n\nhim. In our view, this part of the appellant's claim should not be given any weight for\n\naside from the appellant's own testimony, which was found by the learned trial judge to be\n\ngenerally unworthy of credit, there was no other evidence before the court to support the\n\nappellant's assertion. It was in fact pertinent to us that while both Henry Tan and Lim\n\nBeng Soon, the deliveryman, were available as witnesses and were in fact offered as\n\nwitnesses to the defence, the appellant nevertheless chose not to call either of them to\n\ntestify for her. The burden of rebutting the statutory presumption of trafficking having\n\nbeen cast by the legislature upon the appellant, we had no doubt that an adverse inference\n\nunder s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) ought to be drawn against her for her failure\n\nto call both Henry Tan and Lim as witnesses. It may thus be assumed that any evidence\n\ngiven by the two men had they been called would have been unfavourable to the appellant.54 Finally, the defence contended that the\n\nlearned trial judge erred in placing too much weight on the appellant's inconsistencies,\n\ncontradictions and unanswered questions at the trial. In our opinion, even if the learned\n\ntrial judge had in fact placed undue weight on several of the relatively more minor\n\ninconsistencies made by the appellant, the objective evidence as a whole still supported\n\nthe finding that the presumption of trafficking had not been rebutted by the appellant.\n\nThe defence placed great emphasis on the fact that the appellant had only five years of\n\nprimary education and was a simple-minded woman who was easily confused. She was moreover\n\nunder tremendous stress during the trial and broke down several times. While the appellant\n\nmight not have known that being in possession of more than a certain specified quantity of\n\nopium was a capital offence, or that she did not think she was doing anything wrong by\n\nmerely storing the drugs for a few days, this was irrelevant for our purposes as ignorance\n\nof the law or its consequences for that mater, is never a defence to a criminal charge. In\n\nrespect of the appellant's evidence given at the trial, we noted that the learned trial\n\njudge had been extremely indulgent and patient with her and had given her ample\n\nopportunities to explain herself more clearly and to correct her mistakes, whenever any\n\nhad been made. The appellant herself had often asked for time to answer a lot of the\n\nquestions, including those posed by her own counsel, and each time, her request was always\n\ngranted without question. In spite of this however, all that the appellant could come up\n\nwith was usually that she either could not remember, that she did not know how to answer\n\nthe question or that she simply did not know why she had said or done a particular thing.\n\nIn these circumstances, the learned trial judge could hardly be faulted for having made a\n\nnegative assessment of the appellant's veracity and we saw no reason to disturb his\n\nfinding.",
        "Conclusion": "55 In light of the above reasons, we found\n\nthat the learned trial judge was correct in concluding that the appellant was guilty of\n\nthe offence as charged and that she had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the\n\nMDA. We thus felt no hesitation in dismissing the appeal.Appeal dismissed.Yong Pung HowL P TheanChao Hick TinChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
