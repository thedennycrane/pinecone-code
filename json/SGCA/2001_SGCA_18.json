        "The decision below": "19 Ah Fai and Tan were jointly tried before Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck (the\n\njudge) in the High Court under a joint charge. At the end of the trial, the judge formed the view\n\nthat the evidence did not justify a finding that Tan was in possession of all the heroin seized from\n\nthe flat. It was held that she was only guilty of possessing the 5.29g of diamorphine contained in\n\nthe red \"On Cheong Jewellery\" bag she was carrying when she was arrested in the lift. The\n\njudge found that Tan had no intention of trafficking the drugs but was holding the bag for Ah Fai\n\nfor only a brief moment. She was thus sentenced to eight months imprisonment.20 As for Ah Fai, the judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all the\n\nheroin found in the flat and in the red \"On Cheong Jewellery\" bag belonged to him and that\n\nhe was in possession of these drugs for the purposes of trafficking. He found Ah Fai to be a\n\nthoroughly untruthful witness and there were material contradictions between his oral testimony and\n\nthe written statements he had made to the CNB officers. On the other hand, the judge accepted Tans\n\nevidence despite some inconsistencies in her testimony, which he found to be minor. The judge noted\n\nthat both Tan and Hong gave consistent testimony that they had previously seen people coming to the\n\nWoodlands flat to buy heroin from Ah Fai. Tans evidence that Ah Fai had arranged to meet Thomas\n\non the night of 22 June 2000 was also corroborated by Thomass evidence. All these added together\n\nshow very clearly that Ah Fai was actively involved in selling heroin. The judge was also convinced\n\nby the evidence that the financial transactions from the sale of heroin were being effected through\n\nthe UOB bank account opened in Ah Fais mothers (i.e. Hos) name. Ah Fai made use of Tan and\n\nHong to deposit money into that account for him. He also asked his brother, Meng Kip, to pass money\n\nto his heroin supplier, Chua Ah Xiao.21 Based on all the facts and evidence, the judge found Ah Fai guilty of\n\npossessing all the 46 sachets of heroin for the purposes of trafficking. Ah Fai was therefore\n\nsentenced to suffer death.The appeal22 In the appeal before us, it was contended that the judge erred in law and/or\n\nfact in the following ways:(i) Failing to give sufficient consideration to these facts:-(a) the ten sachets of heroin were found in the red \"On Cheong Jewellery\"\n\n    bag which was carried by Tan and Ah Fai had no knowledge of these sachets.(b) Ah Fai had no knowledge of the 36 sachets seized from the master bedroom\n\n    of the Woodlands flat and it was in fact Tan who pointed out to the CNB officers where the drugs\n\n    were kept.(c) Ah Fai was seldom at the Woodlands flat and he did not have the keys to\n\n    the flat.(d) Ah Fai used only handkerchiefs and did not have any use for the pack of\n\n    tissue paper found in the red \"On Cheong Jewellery\" bag.(ii) Failing to give sufficient weight to Ah Fais consistent evidence that\n\n  the drugs did not belong to him and placing undue weight on the contradictions in his testimony\n\n  and statements when these were immaterial or irrelevant.(iii) Failing to give due caution to the fact that Tan was an accomplice and\n\n  had been jointly charged for drug trafficking. Further, giving undue weight to Tans evidence\n\n  when it was self-serving and unsatisfactory as it contained material inconsistencies.(iv) Finding Hong to be a credible witness when there were material\n\n  contradictions and inconsistencies in her evidence.(v) Accepting Thomass evidence when he was shown to be an untruthful\n\n  witness.23 To reiterate, it was Ah Fais defence that he had no knowledge of and no\n\nconnection with the drugs seized from the red bag and from the Woodlands flat. He sought to distance\n\nhimself from the Woodlands flat by showing that he was seldom home and that he did not even possess\n\nkeys to the flat. He claimed that the drugs belonged to his wife and suggested that she was involved\n\nin drug trafficking without his knowledge.24 Whilst it may be true that the red bag containing the ten sachets of drugs was\n\ncarried by Tan when she and Ah Fai were arrested, and that it was Tan who showed the CNB officers\n\nwhere the drugs in the Woodlands flat were kept, this did not automatically absolve Ah Fai of all\n\nconnections with the drugs. Further, even if it was established that Ah Fai was indeed seldom home\n\nat the Woodlands flat and he did not have the keys to the flat, these facts did not mean that the\n\nheroin seized could not be in his possession. These facts must be examined in the context of the\n\nother evidence given by Ah Fai as well as all the other witnesses. As for the contention relating to\n\nAh Fais use of handkerchiefs, we considered this to be an inconsequential factor which did not\n\nadd much weight either way.25 After examining all the evidence, we found that there were many unsatisfactory\n\npoints in Ah Fais defence which could not be properly accounted for. Ah Fais evidence was\n\nself-conflicting in many material aspects and it was further substantively refuted by the evidence\n\nprovided by the other witnesses. Firstly, despite Ah Fais attempts to distance himself from any\n\nassociation with the Woodlands flat, it was apparent that he did live there and conducted his\n\nactivities there. This was so even if he was not home at the Woodlands flat very often. Ah Fai\n\nhimself gave evidence that he had furnished the flat and was the one who paid for its monthly\n\ninstalments and utility bills. His clothes were found in the master bedroom of the flat. When the\n\nI/O asked him who stayed in the master bedroom, his reply was himself and Tan.26 Secondly, Ah Fais contention that he was ignorant of the drugs and was not\n\ninvolved in any drug trafficking activities was baseless. When Ah Fai was questioned by the I/O\n\nwhile they were in one of the bedrooms soon after the drugs in the Woodlands flat were seized, Ah\n\nFai was able to identify the two wrapped bundles found in the red \"On Cheong Jewellery\"\n\nbag as \"Pak Fun\" (i.e. heroin). We found this to be very telling. It showed that he knew\n\nthat heroin was contained in the wrapped bundles and that he knew what it looked like. Ah Fai must\n\nhave realised the significance of this statement later because he then sought to retract it during\n\nhis oral testimony by denying that he gave such an answer. He claimed that he said to the I/O that\n\nhe did not know what the bundles were. This was evidently an attempt to cover up the inconsistency\n\nin his evidence.27 Ah Fais denial that he had drug dealings with one Chua Ah Xiao was also\n\nplainly refuted. Ah Fais own brother, Meng Kip, testified that he was once asked by Ah Fai\n\n\"to pass something to one Ah Xiao\". In Thomass written statement, he stated that Ah Fai\n\nhad told him that the heroin was supplied by one \"Ah Xiao\". Tan also gave evidence that\n\nthe heroin seized belonged to Ah Fai and that he obtained his supply of heroin from Chua Ah Xiao. Ah\n\nFais denial was further contradicted by his own evidence. In his oral testimony, Ah Fai claimed\n\nthat he did not know anybody called Chua Ah Xiao. This was obviously a lie since in his very own\n\nwritten statement, he had admitted that he owed Chua Ah Xiao money but intended to repay him slowly\n\nthrough working. In his anxiety to disclaim all connections with Chua Ah Xiao, Ah Fai overlooked the\n\nevidence that he had given earlier to the CNB officers.28 Next, there was the issue of the UOB account, which, in our view, was a clear\n\nindication of how the financial transactions arising from Ah Fais drug trafficking activities\n\nwere being managed. In his written statement recorded on 29 June 2000, Ah Fai stated that he only\n\nhad one POSB account used for crediting his reservist pay. He claimed that he did not have any\n\npersonal money in any other persons account and he had never asked anyone to open an account for\n\nhim. This was proven false by his mothers (Hos) testimony, that in April 2000 he had asked her\n\nto open a bank account for him, using her name. Ah Fai then sought to explain that the reason for\n\nthis was because he had lost his identity card and could not open an account himself. Ah Fai further\n\ndenied that he held the bank book and the ATM card for the account, claiming that he left the bank\n\nbook with Ho or kept it in the Ang Mo Kio flat and he would ask her to make withdrawals for him\n\nevery time he needed money from the account. He said that Ho did not give him the ATM card for the\n\nUOB account.29 All these contentions were again shown to be false. Ho gave evidence that she\n\nhad passed both the bank book and the ATM card to Ah Fai after she opened the account for him. After\n\ngiving Ah Fai the two items, Ho said she did not know anything about the account after that and what\n\nAh Fai did with it, meaning that she never did make any withdrawals for Ah Fai. Hos evidence was\n\nunchallenged and there was no reason to disbelieve her as she had no reason to lie or to frame her\n\nown son. The relevant bank book of the UOB account was also seized from the Woodlands flat, and not\n\nthe Ang Mo Kio flat, as Ah Fai had sought to claim. It was Tans evidence that Ah Fai kept the\n\nbank book and would pass the book and money to her when he wanted her to deposit money into the\n\naccount for him. Tan, however, never saw the ATM card for the account. Even Hong testified that Ah\n\nFai had once asked her to deposit money into the UOB account. Withdrawals made via the ATM card were\n\nclearly documented in the bank book. Since Ho never saw the ATM card again after she passed it to Ah\n\nFai, the inference must be that the withdrawals were being made by Ah Fai or someone whom he had\n\npassed the card to.30 Another sign which we found to be extremely telling of Ah Fais illicit\n\nactivities, was the large amounts of money that were deposited into and withdrawn from the UOB\n\naccount within a short span of time. From the period May to June 2000, a total of $56,800 was\n\ndeposited into the account in cash. Even more curious was the fact that the bank records showed that\n\nimmediately upon a cash deposit being made, the exact amount would be withdrawn on the same day via\n\nthe ATM card. Ah Fai was not able to offer any credible explanation for these large deposits and\n\ntheir immediate withdrawals. According to Ah Fai, he did odd-jobs which earned him about $420 to\n\n$560 a week, and that was his only source of income. He first sought to explain that he had struck\n\nthe Toto lottery many times and the large deposits were part of his winnings. However, when\n\nconfronted by the evidence of the systematic withdrawals of the deposits, Ah Fai then said that he\n\ndid not know who had deposited the cash sums into the account and withdrawn them on the same day.31 We now move on to consider the evidence given by Tan. It was argued by counsel\n\nfor Ah Fai, Mr Pereira, that the judge erred in failing to give due caution to the fact that Tan was\n\nan accomplice and was jointly charged with Ah Fai for drug trafficking. We interpreted this to be a\n\nreference to s 116, illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97), which states that the courtmaypresume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution.32 The courts treatment of an accomplices evidence is well-established :\n\nseeSharom bin Ahmad & Anor v PP[2000]3 SLR 565,Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP[1998] 2 SLR 592andChua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP[1998] 2 SLR 713. Section 135 of the Evidence\n\nAct has abrogated the common law rule that a court must warn itself of the danger of convicting on\n\nuncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Reading this section with the directory words in s 116,\n\nillustration (b), the effect is that the court may convict an accused person based on uncorroborated\n\naccomplice evidence and there is no requirement that the court must direct itself to treat such\n\nevidence with caution, though such should still be borne in mind. Thus, accomplice evidence should\n\nbe given the same weight as any other evidence if it is proven, from all the circumstances of the\n\ncase, to be reliable evidence.33 Therefore, there was little merit in this argument. In any event, we found\n\nthat the guilt of Ah Fai was not established on Tans evidence alone, but was also based on other\n\nreliable evidence given by the other witnesses, such as Ho, Meng Kip and Hong.34 Mr Pereira then further contended that Tans evidence should not have been\n\naccepted as it was self-serving and there were many material inconsistencies in her testimony. The\n\nfollowing contradictions were listed:(i) Tans admission to CNB officers of the ownership of the ten sachets of\n\n  heroin in the bag and her subsequent denial and assertion that she had said that Ah Fai told her\n\n  to hold the bag.(ii) Tan said in her written statement that Ah Fai obtained heroin from Chua Ah\n\n  Xiao to sell, but later, in her oral testimony, she said that she did not know what Ah Fai did\n\n  with the heroin.(iii) Tan gave evidence that she saw customers coming to the flat to buy heroin\n\n  but subsequently said that she did not know that the heroin seized from the flat was meant for\n\n  sale.(iv) Tan said that Hong slept in the kitchen but Hongs evidence was that she\n\n  slept in one of the bedrooms.(v) Tans evidence was that on 22 June 2000, she banked in the $1,500 for Ah\n\n  Fai at the UOB Woodlands branch when it was later shown that it was at the UOB Ang Mo Kio branch.35 In our view, the above factors (ii) to (v) were all minor inconsistencies\n\nwhich did not undermine the main substance of Tans evidence implicating Ah Fai. The only\n\nsignificant point was probably her admission that the red bag she was carrying and the heroin\n\ntherein belonged to her. As for the drugs found inside the Woodlands flat, there was some confusion\n\nover whether she admitted ownership of these drugs. One of the CNB officers, Cpl S Rajkumar, said\n\nthat Tan was questioned by Insp Neo Ling Sim and Tan admitted that the drugs were hers. Neo,\n\nhowever, said that she did not ask Tan any questions about the drugs found in the flat and she\n\nagreed that Tan never admitted ownership to the drugs or paraphernalia seized from the flat. Tan\n\nexplained in her written statement that she did not know why she said that the drugs belonged to\n\nher. We believed that Tan, in all probability, did admit, at that point in time when she was\n\narrested, that the drugs belonged to her. But we also believed that it was probably due to the state\n\nof shock and confusion she was in at the time. She was holding the red bag and her daughter, who was\n\nwith her then, was crying. It did not escape our attention that, when Tan was questioned by the I/O\n\nin the Woodlands flat, she had replied that the heroin belonged to her husband but she was holding\n\nit. This information was offered soon after her arrest and even while the search of the flat was\n\nstill taking place. In the light of the other evidence, we were prepared to accept it as the truth\n\nand not merely an afterthought on Tans part to shift the blame to her husband, Ah Fai.36 Our assessment of Tan as a witness was that, despite the various\n\ncontradictions in her evidence, she remained a substantially credible witness. This was especially\n\nso with regard to the written statements she made with the CNB officers after her arrest. Her\n\nevidence, in particular her account of the events which took place on 22 June 2000, was supported by\n\nHongs testimony. Indeed, other than her initial admission that the drugs belonged to her, we did\n\nnot find any other significant evidence which showed that she was actively involved in drug\n\ntrafficking activities. Hong testified that when she saw men coming to the flat to purchase heroin,\n\nTan was not around on most occasions and it was Ah Fai who dealt with those customers. Thomas also\n\ngave evidence that, when he purchased heroin, he dealt only with Ah Fai. We were unable to accept Ah\n\nFais allegation that Tan was out to frame him just because he was seldom home and kept a mistress\n\noutside. Taking into consideration all the other evidence, we were of the view that Tans evidence\n\non Ah Fais drug trafficking activities should be accepted.37 As mentioned earlier, Tans testimony was also substantiated in many\n\nmaterial aspects by the evidence given by Hong. Mr Pereira contended that Hong was not a credible\n\nwitness as there were material contradictions in her evidence. However, these alleged contradictions\n\nwere never identified to the court. Hong testified that on 22 June 2000, she overheard Ah Fai\n\ntelling Tan that he was meeting Thomas later that night. We noted that Hong was not exactly specific\n\ninitially in her testimony on whether she had heard that Thomas was coming to fetch \"him\"\n\n(i.e. Ah Fai) or \"them\" (i.e. both Ah Fai and Tan). However, when she was finally asked to\n\nclarify the issue, she stated quite unequivocally that what she had heard was \"him\". The\n\nambiguity was most probably caused by Hong not being sufficiently precise in choosing her words.\n\nHongs evidence was generally consistent with that given by the other witnesses and we saw no\n\nreason to doubt the veracity of what she said, especially with regard to Ah Fais involvement in\n\ndrug trafficking.38 Finally, there was the evidence given by Thomas. Although Thomas turned out to\n\nbe an uncooperative witness during the trial and his evidence was greatly self-conflicting, this did\n\nnot then mean that all his evidence should be totally disregarded. Thomas admitted that the\n\nconditioned statement he gave to the CNB officers was made voluntarily and there were no grounds to\n\ndoubt the truth of what Thomas had said there. In the course of his cross-examination, Thomas made a\n\nwild allegation that he was taught what to say by the CNB officers in his conditioned statement.\n\nThis was plainly a fabrication that was totally unsubstantiated. It was his evidence that, on 22\n\nJune 2000, he had arranged to meet Ah Fai that night. This was corroborated by both Tans and Hongs\n\ntestimonies. Tan said that she was told by Ah Fai of the appointment while Hong overheard Ah Fai\n\nmentioning the appointment to Tan. Ah Fai was clearly on his way to sell the ten sachets of heroin\n\nin the red bag to Thomas when he was arrested.Conclusion39 After assessing the totality of the evidence, the only conclusion that could\n\nbe reached was that Ah Fai was in possession of all the heroin seized and he was in possession of\n\nthe drugs for the purposes of trafficking. This was a fairly straightforward case with overwhelming\n\nevidence stacked against the defence. The numerous discrepancies in Ah Fais evidence exposed the\n\nweaknesses and loopholes in his case. He was not able to properly explain the UOB account, his\n\nconnection with Chua Ah Xiao and the evidence of other witnesses on how he sold heroin to customers\n\nat his Woodlands flat. Even if Tans evidence was disregarded, there was still the overwhelming\n\nevidence provided by Ho (Ah Fais mother), Meng Kip (his brother), Hong (his sister-in-law) and\n\nThomas, and there was no reason why they would give incriminating evidence to frame him. There was\n\nno doubt that Ah Fai was an active dealer in drugs. The large quantities of heroin and the drug\n\ntrafficking paraphernalia (i.e. the digital weighing scale, empty sachets and spoon), that were\n\nfound in the Woodlands flat, went towards further proving this.40 For the above reasons, we agreed with the High Courts decision to convict\n\nAh Fai as charged and to sentence him to suffer death. We therefore dismissed the appeal.Appeal dismissed."
