        "The background": "2.    The facts giving rise to the institution of this Originating\n\nMotion were largely undisputed. The appellant (Garuda), an Indonesian company, and the\n\nrespondent (Birgen), a Belgium company, entered into an agreement dated 20 January 1996\n\nwhereby Birgen agreed to lease one DC 10-30 aircraft to Garuda for use by pilgrims to\n\nSaudi Arabia for the Hajj (the lease agreement). The lease agreement expressly provided\n\nthat the governing law would be the law of Indonesia and that disputes arising therefrom\n\nwere to be referred for arbitration in Jakarta.3.    Subsequently a dispute arose because Birgen proposed to substitute\n\nthe aircraft under the lease agreement and the dispute was referred to arbitration in\n\naccordance with the terms thereof, with Garuda as the claimant and Birgen, the respondent.4.    The arbitral tribunal consisted of Dr Clyde Croft, as Chairman,\n\nand Professor Priyatna Abdurrasyid and Professor Nurkut Inan as co-arbitrators. From\n\nFebruary 1999, the tribunal, through its Chairman, Dr Croft, sought to set dates for the\n\nhearing of the arbitration. As regards the place of hearing, the Chairman informed the\n\nparties on 24 February that the tribunal thought that Jakarta was not an appropriate place\n\ngiven the then situation prevailing in Indonesia and proposed that the tribunal should sit\n\nin Zurich. On 11 and 12 March 1999, Birgen and Garuda respectively responded but neither\n\nmade any comment on the tribunal’s proposal to have the hearing in Zurich. On 30\n\nMarch 1999, Dr Croft proposed that the hearing of the arbitration be carried out in\n\nSingapore rather than in Zurich.5.    On 7 April 1999, M/s Donald H Bunker and Associates (Donald\n\nBunker), the lawyers for Birgen, replied requesting that the tribunal proceed to decide\n\nthe case on the basis of the documents without any hearing but if that request were not\n\ngranted then they were agreeable, inter alia, that \"Jakarta is not an appropriate\n\nplace for the hearing and accepts the tribunal’s proposal to sit in Singapore.\"6.    On 21 May 1999, Dr Croft wrote to the lawyers for the parties\n\nasking for their comments on certain matters, including Birgen’s application for\n\n\"documents only arbitration\". Nevertheless, he also notified the parties that\n\n\"the tribunal had decided that this matter will be heard on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999 in\n\nSingapore\". On 10 June 1999 Gani Djemat & Partners (Gani Djemat), lawyers for\n\nGaruda, wrote indicating, inter alia, that they agreed that \"the hearing to take\n\nplace on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999 in Singapore.\"7.    On 23 July 1999 by another letter to both Donald Bunker and Gani\n\nDjemat, the lawyers for the parties, Dr Croft reiterated that \"a hearing will take\n\nplace in Singapore\" on the appointed dates.8.    The hearing was duly held in Singapore and a Final Award, dated 15\n\nFebruary 2000, was handed down which was signed by two members, Dr Croft and Prof Inan.\n\nThe third member, Prof Abdurrasyid, declined to sign it and rendered a dissenting opinion.9.    The Final Award stated that it was delivered at Jakarta and the\n\ntribunal in 39 also made the following comments:-\"It had not been suggested by either of the parties, nor is it the\n\n  view of the Arbitral Tribunal, that the use of Singapore as a convenient place for the\n\n  hearing had any substantive or procedural impact on the proceedings.\"10.    On 18 May 2000, the majority of the tribunal handed down an\n\nAddendum to the Final Award on account of a computational error.11.    On 3 January 2001, Garuda filed a Notice of Originating Motion\n\n(OM) in the High Court in Singapore to set aside the Final Award and the Addendum, and for\n\nvarious other reliefs. The application was based on s 24 of the International Arbitration\n\nAct (IA Act) and Article 34 of the Model Law. Article 34 sets out the grounds upon which\n\nan award governed by the Model Law may be set aside by the court. Section 24 sets out\n\ngrounds, additional to those in Article 34, upon which the High Court may set aside an\n\naward. In the view of the judge below, s 24 and Article 34 are closely linked – if\n\nArticle 34 is not applicable to an arbitration, then s 24 will also not be applicable. We\n\nagree with this construction. Garuda did not appeal against this determination.12.    On 27 March 2001 Garuda applied ex-parte for leave to serve the\n\nNotice of OM on Birgen out of Singapore and also for leave to serve the Notice by\n\nsubstituted service within Singapore (i.e., on Birgen’s Singapore solicitors). On 30\n\nMarch 2001, the Assistant Registrar made an order substantially in the terms prayed for by\n\nGaruda.13.    On 7 April 2001, Birgen applied to set aside the order of 30\n\nMarch 2001 of the Assistant Registrar. On 26 July 2001, Woo Bih Li JC set aside the order\n\nand all proceedings taken pursuant thereof. Thus, this appeal by Garuda against the\n\ndecision of Woo JC.14.    In coming to his decision, the judge below found –(i) there was material non-disclosure on the part of Garuda and this\n\n  ground alone was sufficient for him to set aside the leave to serve the Notice of OM out\n\n  of jurisdiction. The non-disclosure related to terms in the lease agreement, clauses in\n\n  the Terms of Reference for the arbitration, the exchange of correspondence and the views\n\n  expressed by the tribunal on the question of the place of the arbitration as set out in\n\n  the Award.(ii) this was not a proper case to grant leave to Garuda to serve the\n\n  papers out of jurisdiction as the place of arbitration remained at Jakarta.15.    We should further mention that the judge below had also set aside\n\nthe leave granted to Garuda to serve the papers on Birgen in Singapore by substituted\n\nservice. This aspect of the decision of Woo JC was not appealed against.",
        "Issues on appeal": "16.    Garuda’s application for leave to serve out of jurisdiction\n\nwas made pursuant to Order 69A r 4. Under r 4(2) it is stated that no leave shall be\n\ngranted unless \"it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court that the case is\n\na proper one for service out of jurisdiction.\" This test is almost identical to the\n\ntest prescribed in O 11 r 2, which relates to service in general out of jurisdiction: the\n\ntest of a proper case. Accordingly, in arriving at his decision the judge below relied on\n\ncases relating to O 11 r 2(2) which required that the applicant must show, first, that\n\nthere were merits in the case and, second, that Singapore was aforum conveniens.In\n\nthis regard the judge also adopted the opinion of the Court of Appeal inOverseas Union\n\nInsurance Ltd v Incorporated General Insurance Ltd[1992] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 439.17.    Before us Garuda did not dispute that they must satisfy those two\n\nrequirements. Birgen’s case was that Garuda failed to satisfy both requirements by\n\nreason of the fact that the place of arbitration was not Singapore but Jakarta and thus\n\nSingapore courts did not have jurisdiction in the matter. However, the position taken by\n\nGaruda was that the parties had subsequently agreed to change \"the place of\n\narbitration\" to Singapore.18.    There were, therefore, three main issues before us. First,\n\nwhether there was an agreement between the parties, in the light of the correspondence\n\nreferred to above, followed by the actual hearing of the arbitration in Singapore, to\n\nalter the place of the arbitration from Jakarta to Singapore. Second, whether Singapore\n\nwas the place most clearly connected with the arbitration and whether this was the most\n\nappropriate forum to hear the application in the OM. Third, whether there was a material\n\nnon-disclosure on the part of Garuda in their application for leave to serve out of\n\njurisdiction and, if this were the case, what should be the consequence thereof.",
        "Place of Arbitration": "19.    In filing the OM, Garuda relied upon the International\n\nArbitration Act (IA Act), an Act to make provision for the conduct of international\n\ncommercial arbitrations based on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\n\nadopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (the Model Law) on 21\n\nJune 1985. By s 3(1) of the IA Act, the Model Law (except Chapter VIII thereof) shall have\n\nthe force of law in Singapore. Section 24 empowers the Singapore High Court to set aside\n\nthe award of an arbitral tribunal in certain specified circumstances, other than those\n\ndescribed in Article 34 of the Model Law.20.    Some of the relevant provisions of the Model Law are the\n\nfollowing:-\"Article 1(2): Scope of applicationThe provisions of this Law, except Articles 8, 9, 35 and 36, apply\n\n  only if the place of arbitration is in the territory of this State (\"this State\"\n\n  is defined to mean Singapore).Article 20: Place of arbitration(1) The parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration.\n\n  Failing such agreement, the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral\n\n  tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the\n\n  parties.(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article,\n\n  the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it\n\n  considers appropriate for consultation among members, for hearing witnesses, experts or\n\n  parties, or for inspection of goods, property or documents.\"Article 31: Forms and contents of award(3) The award shall state its date and the place of arbitration as\n\n  determined in accordance with Article 20(1). The award shall be deemed to have been made\n\n  at that place.21.    From Articles 1(2) and 20 it will be seen that unless Singapore\n\nis the \"place of arbitration\" the Singapore courts can only intervene in\n\nrelation to an arbitration governed by the Model Law in the limited instances set out in\n\nArticles 8, 9, 35 and 36. Thus, Article 34 only applies if an arbitration has its\n\n\"place of arbitration\" in Singapore.22.    Garuda did not dispute that the Model Law is only applicable\n\nwhere the place of arbitration is Singapore. Their main plank of argument was that\n\nSingapore was the place of arbitration and not Jakarta and thus, the Model Law applied.23.    It should be apparent from Article 20 that there is a distinction\n\nbetween \"place of arbitration\" and the place where the arbitral tribunal carries\n\non hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, namely, the \"venue of hearing\".\n\nThe place of arbitration is a matter to be agreed by the parties. Where they have so\n\nagreed, the place of arbitration does not change even though the tribunal may meet to hear\n\nwitnesses or do any other things in relation to the arbitration at a location other than\n\nthe place of arbitration.24.    Thus the place of arbitration does not change merely because the\n\ntribunal holds its hearing at a different place or places. It only changes where the\n\nparties so agree. The significance of the place of arbitration lies in the fact that for\n\nlegal reasons the arbitration is to be regarded as situated in that state or territory. It\n\nidentifies a state or territory whose laws will govern the arbitral process. The following\n\npassage of Kerr LJ inNaviera Amazonica Peruana SA v Cia International de Seguros[1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 116, (Amazonicacase), while it did not relate to the\n\nModel Law, is nevertheless germane (at 120):-\"Finally, as I mentioned at the outset, it seems clear that the\n\n  submissions advanced below confused the legal ‘seat’ etc. of an arbitration with\n\n  the geographically convenient place or places for holding hearings. This distinction is\n\n  nowadays a common feature of international arbitrations and is helpfully explained in\n\n  Redfern and Hunter at p.69 in the following passage under the heading ‘The Place of\n\n  Arbitration’:The preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one\n\n  ‘place’ of arbitration. This will be the place chosen by or on behalf of the\n\n  parties; and it will be designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of reference\n\n  or the minutes of proceedings or in some other way as the place or ‘seat’ of the\n\n  arbitration.This does not mean, however, that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its\n\n  meetings or hearings at the place of arbitration. International commercial arbitration\n\n  often involves people of many different countries. In these circumstances,it is by no\n\n  means unusual for an arbitral tribunal to hold meetings -–or even hearings – in\n\n  a place other than the designated place of arbitration, either for its own convenience or\n\n  for the convenience of the parties or their witnesses … It may be more convenient for\n\n  an arbitral tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in another country –\n\n  for instance, for the purpose of taking evidence… In such circumstances, each\n\n  move of the arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of the arbitration\n\n  changes. The seat of the arbitration remains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of\n\n  the parties.\" (emphasis added).It will be seen that the English concept of \"seat of\n\n  arbitration\" is the same as \"place of arbitration\" under the Model Law.25.    While the agreement to change the place of arbitration may be\n\nimplied, it must be clear. This is in the interest of certainty. By choosing the\n\n\"place of arbitration\" the parties would have also thereby decided on the law\n\nwhich is to govern the arbitration proceedings.",
        "The evidence on place of arbitration": "26.    We shall now refer to the relevant provisions of the lease\n\nagreement which have a bearing on the question of the place of arbitration.Clause 16.8: Governing LawThis Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed\n\n  in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of Indonesia, including all matters of\n\n  construction, validity and performance.Clause 16.9: ArbitrationIn the event that a commercial controversy or claim …. such\n\n  controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration held before a board of three\n\n  qualified arbiters.The parties agree that such arbitration shall be held in Jakarta,\n\n  Indonesiaand conducted in the English language in accordance with the Rules of\n\n  Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. (emphasis added).27.    Next we turn to the Terms of Reference of the arbitration which\n\nthe parties had agreed. The following are pertinent:-\"6 Place of Arbitration.6.1The place of arbitration is Jakarta, Indonesia.6.2 The arbitral Tribunal and the Parties may convene at any other\n\n  location if necessary, for example, for a view.6.3 ….(emphasis added).28.    From these two documents, it is clear that the parties had agreed\n\nthat the governing law of the lease agreement was Indonesian law and that the place of\n\narbitration was Jakarta. So was there a subsequent agreement to alter the place of\n\narbitration? We have in 4 to 7 set out the relevant correspondence. It would be\n\nrecalled that in February 1999 the tribunal first suggested, in view of the turmoil in\n\nIndonesia, that it should sit in Zurich. It was on 30 March 1999 that the tribunal\n\nproposed Singapore in place of Zurich. On 7 April 1999 the lawyers for Birgen replied\n\naccepting the tribunal’s proposal to sit in Singapore. There was no reply from Garuda\n\non the proposal. On 21 May 1999, the tribunal informed the parties of the hearing in\n\nSingapore on 4-6 August 1999. It was only on 10 June 1999 that the lawyers for Garuda,\n\nGani Djemat, replied stating that they agreed to the hearing in Singapore on the specified\n\ndates. The hearing was accordingly held here.29.    From these, Garuda contended that there was an implied agreement\n\nto change the place of arbitration, and thus thelex fori, or curial law, from\n\nJakarta to Singapore and they relied upon theAmazonicacase. But this authority is\n\nhardly relevant. InAmazonica, the plaintiffs insured their vessels with the\n\ndefendants. The policy provided that the city of Lima was to have jurisdiction over all\n\ndisputes. However, it also provided that arbitration was to be governed by the conditions\n\nand laws of England. A dispute arose between the parties and the issue for determination\n\nby the court was whether the arbitration was to be held in London or Lima. Quite clearly\n\nthere was ambiguity in the clauses of the policy.30.    At first instance, the High Court ruled that the arbitration was\n\nto be held in Lima but governed by English law as thelex fori.The Court of Appeal\n\nreversed that decision and held that the seat of arbitration should be London where it\n\nwould be governed by English law, thereby avoiding the situation of an arbitration in\n\ncountry X being governed by the law of country Y. The Court of Appeal made the following\n\nproposition:-Prima facie, i.e., in the absence of some express and clear provision\n\n  to the contrary, it must follow that an agreement that the curial or procedural law of an\n\n  arbitration is to be the law of X has the consequence that X is also to be the\n\n  ‘seat’ of the arbitration. Thelex foriis then the law of X, and\n\n  accordingly, X is the agreed forum of the arbitration. A further consequence is then that\n\n  the Courts which are competent to control or assist the arbitration are the Courts\n\n  exercising jurisdiction at X.31.    Also relying onAmazonica,and in view of the fact that\n\nthe parties agreed to the tribunal’s suggestion of having the hearing in Singapore,\n\nGaruda made the alternative contention that it followed that the parties had chosen\n\nSingapore law as the law governing the arbitration, the curial law, and had thereby also\n\nimpliedly chosen Singapore as the \"place of arbitration\". This argument is\n\ncircular and is also flawed because it is based on the false premise that the parties had\n\nchosen Singapore law as the curial law. In fact, the parties made no such choice. By\n\nstating in the lease agreement and the Terms of Reference, that the place of arbitration\n\nwas Jakarta, it must follow that the curial law would be Indonesian law. The curial law\n\nwould be Singapore law only if it was established that the parties had agreed to alter the\n\n\"place of arbitration\" from Jakarta to Singapore.32.    The second case relied by Garuda wasUnion of India v\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation[1933] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 48 where the contract provided\n\nthat the arbitration should be conducted in accordance with the procedures provided in the\n\nIndian Arbitration Act 1940 and that the seat of arbitration proceedings should be in\n\nLondon. The issue was whether the law governing the arbitration proceedings was English or\n\nIndian law. The court was of the view that by specifying London as the seat of\n\narbitration, it was reasonable to assume from that choice that they attached some\n\nimportance to the relevant laws of England. Saville J stated (at p.50):-It is clear from the authorities cited above that English law does\n\n  admit of at least the theoretical possibility that the parties are free to choose to hold\n\n  their arbitration in one country but subject to the procedural laws of another, but\n\n  against this is the undoubted fact that such an agreement is calculated to give rise to\n\n  great difficulties and complexities as Lord Justice Kerr observed in theAmazonicadecision.and concluded,….. it seems to me that by their agreement, the parties have\n\n  chosen English law as the law to govern their arbitration proceedings, while contractually\n\n  importing from the Indian Act those provisions of that Act which are concerned with the\n\n  internal conduct of their arbitration and which are not inconsistent with the choice of\n\n  English arbitral procedural law.33.    The court also felt that the jurisdiction of the English Court\n\nunder the Arbitration Acts over an arbitration in England could not be excluded by\n\nagreement between the parties to apply the laws of another country. We would emphasise\n\nthat the court was there referring to an arbitration where the seat was in England. This\n\nwas not the situation here. Clearly, if it was established that the parties had agreed to\n\nchange the \"place of arbitration\" to Singapore, then it must follow that the\n\ncurial law would be Singapore law.34.    It is incontrovertible that parties are at liberty to change the\n\nplace of arbitration. InABB Lummus v Keppel FELS(1999) 2 Lloyd’s Rep 24,\n\nthere was such an express agreement to alter the place of arbitration from Singapore to\n\nLondon.ABB Lummuscannot help us determine whether the parties here had, in fact,\n\nagreed to change the place of arbitration.35.    We were unable to accept Garuda’s contention that just\n\nbecause the parties eventually agreed with the arbitrators’ suggestion that the\n\nhearing be held in Singapore, there was in consequence such an agreement to alter the\n\nplace of arbitration from Jakarta to Singapore. What was changed was the \"venue of\n\nhearing\". This comes out clearly from the language of the correspondence.36.    In our opinion, Garuda’s argument failed to give effect to\n\nthe provisions of Article 20(2) of the Model Law which expressly authorize the tribunal to\n\nmeet at any place, other than the agreed place of arbitration, to hear witnesses and the\n\nparties. The opening words of Article 20(2), \"notwithstanding the provisions of\n\nparagraph (1) of this Article\", clearly mean that such a hearing by the tribunal at a\n\ndifferent location from that of the place of arbitration does not alter what was the\n\nagreed place of arbitration. Indeed, the tribunal confirmed the hearing to be in Singapore\n\neven before receiving any indication from Garuda: see Dr Croft’s letter of 21 May\n\n1999.37.    This view of the matter is clearly consistent with the views of\n\nthe learned authors ofRedfern & Hunter on International Arbitrations, which\n\nwere cited by Kerr LJ inAmazonicaand which we have quoted in 24 above.38.    Garuda seemed to have placed great emphasis on the fact that the\n\nhearing of the arbitration was held entirely in Singapore and nowhere else. But an\n\narbitration proceeding does not comprise only of the oral hearing and the submission. It\n\nencompasses an entire process, commencing from the appointment of the arbitrator or\n\narbitrators to the rendering of the final award.39.    While bothAmazonicaandUnion Bank of Indiadid\n\nnot involve the Model Law, and could be distinguished on that basis, the real\n\ndifferentiating feature there lies in the fact that in both those cases the relevant\n\nclauses were far from clear. We have alluded to that before. But in the instant case, the\n\nlease agreement was abundantly clear: the lease agreement was to be governed by Indonesian\n\nlaw and the place of arbitration was Jakarta, which must also mean that the arbitration\n\nproceedings were subject to Indonesian law.40.    In the result, Article 34 of the Model Law and s 24 of the IA Act\n\ndid not apply to the Final Award. There was no basis for Garuda to file the OM in the\n\nSingapore High Court.41.    Following from this determination, and bearing in mind that\n\nIndonesian law governed both the lease agreement and the arbitration proceedings (the\n\nplace of arbitration being Jakarta) and the award was rendered in Jakarta, it must\n\nnecessarily follow that Indonesia was clearly the most appropriate forum. Accordingly,\n\nthis was not a \"proper case\" where leave to serve the Notice of Originating\n\nMotion out of jurisdiction should be granted.42.    It is thus wholly unnecessary for us to go into the third issue,\n\non material non-disclosure, set out in 18 above.43.    Before we conclude, we should mention that counsel for the\n\nrespondent submitted that the judge below had perhaps gone a little too far when he stated\n\nin his judgment (at 94) that:-As the place of arbitration is not Singapore, neither Article 34 of the\n\n  Model Law nor, for that matter, Part II of the Act, will apply.Counsel seemed to be suggesting that while the Model Law will not apply to an\n\ninternational arbitration, as far as Singapore courts are concerned, if the place of\n\narbitration is not Singapore, the same does not necessarily follow as regards Part II\n\n(except s 24) of the IA Act. As counsel for the appellant had not submitted on this aspect\n\nand as this point did not really concern the case, and in the absence of full arguments\n\nfrom both counsel, we are not inclined to offer any views on it.Sgd:CHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealSgd:TAN LEE MENGJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
