        "The facts": "2.    On 31 January 2001, pursuant to information received, officers of\n\nthe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) kept surveillance of Norazmi’s flat at #07-06\n\nBlock 109 Bukit Batok West Avenue 6 (the flat). At about 1.50pm Malik was seen entering\n\nthe flat and later was seen leaving it at 2.05pm. He walked down the staircase from the\n\nseventh storey and stopped at the third storey where he looked over the parapet onto the\n\nground. He then made a call on his mobile phone and thereafter made his way up the block.\n\nIn the meantime, Norazmi was also seen coming out of the flat and scanning the area. Soon,\n\nhe went back into the flat.3.    At about 2.15pm, Malik was seen on the tenth floor walking along\n\nthe corridor towards the lift landing. He then walked down the staircase. He got onto a\n\nmotorcycle parked in the carpark adjacent to the block and rode off. Four CNB officers\n\ntailed him. They arrested him at the junction of Block 625 Bukit Batok Central, when he\n\nstopped at a red traffic light.4.    In the meantime, at about 2.20pm, Norazmi left the flat. He was\n\narrested while walking along the void deck of the neighbouring Block 108. Following the\n\narrest of Malik and Norazmi, the CNB officers carried out a search of Block 109 for drugs.\n\nA red plastic bag was found hidden at the side of an abandoned washing machine near the\n\nlift staircase landing on the ninth floor. In the bag there were nine envelopes. In total,\n\nthere were 53 sachets of granular substance in the nine envelopes which, on subsequent\n\nanalysis, were found to contain not less than 31.91g of diamorphine.5.    At the time of the discovery of the red plastic bag at the side of\n\nthe washing machine, Malik was showing Station Inspector Ronnie See (SI See) and his\n\nofficers the grass verge behind Block 109 where Malik claimed that he had thrown down from\n\nBlock 109 a bag containing heroin. But nothing was found there. At that moment, SI See\n\nreceived a call from ASP Marvin Sim informing him of the discovery on the ninth floor,\n\nwhereupon SI See asked Malik, \"Did you go to the 9thstorey of this block\n\nand throw the things there?\", and Malik answered, \"OK, I bring you there.\"\n\nMalik then led SI See and his team of officers to the ninth floor where the disused\n\nwashing machine and the red plastic bag were. On questioning by SI See, Malik admitted\n\nthat the drugs in the bag were his.6.    Malik was subsequently brought to his residence at Block 517,\n\nBedok North Avenue 2, #12-145 where a search was carried out. But nothing incriminating\n\nwas found. Later, he was brought to the CNB, where urine samples were taken from him. On\n\nanalysis, his urine samples were found to be negative.7.    Malik made numerous statements to the CNB officers, and the\n\nfollowing were admitted into evidence at the trial below:-(1) Statement made to SI See at the void deck of Block 625 Bukit Batok\n\n  Central on 31 January 2001 (statement A);(2) Statement made to SI See at the ground floor of Block 109 Bukit\n\n  Batok West Avenue 6 on 31 January 2001 (statement B);(3) Statement made to SI See on the ninth floor of Block 109 Bukit\n\n  Batok West Avenue 6 on 31 January 2001 (statement C);(4) Cautioned statement recorded by Inspector Saherly, the\n\n  investigating officer, on 31 January 2001 (statement D);(5) Statement made to Inspector Saherly on 5 February 2001 (statement\n\n  E);(6) Further statement made to Inspector Saherly on 19 March 2001\n\n  (statement F);(7) Further statement made to Inspector Saherly on 30 March 2001\n\n  (statement G).",
        "Objection to admission of statements": "8.    The admissibility of the second segment of statement B i.e., the\n\nstatement recorded by SI See after he received information from ASP Marvin Sim about his\n\nfind at the abandoned washing machine, and the whole of statement C, were challenged on\n\nthe grounds that they were not made voluntarily. In the main, Malik relied upon the\n\nfollowing specific allegations to substantiate the challenge:-(a) he was assaulted (namely, kicked and punched on his back and side)\n\n  when he was arrested by CNB officers at the traffic light junction.(b) he was slapped by SI See at the void deck of Block 625;(c) he was kicked by Cpl Devan at the grass verge behind Block 109 and\n\n  while being questioned by SI See;(d) he was punched by SI See on the ninth floor9.    Basically what he complained of was that when he signed the\n\nstatements he was in pain and in fear. Besides, he was also hungry. Another aspect he\n\ncomplained of was that the recording of the statements by SI See was not accurate. Counsel\n\nfor Malik canvassed these same points before us.10.    As far as the question of voluntariness of the statements was\n\nconcerned, the evidence tendered by both the defence and the prosecution was carefully\n\nconsidered by the trial judge before he came to the conclusion that the allegations of\n\nassault were unfounded. The judge held that, apart from the denials from the officers, the\n\nmedical evidence, in particular, undermined the veracity of Malik’s complaint that he\n\nwas kicked and punched by the CNB officers, as neither Dr Victor Ong (who examined him\n\nbefore the cautioned statement was taken) nor Dr John Chiam (who examined him after the\n\nstatement) found any injuries associated with kicks and punches. Both doctors testified\n\nthat there was tenderness on his chest wall but no bruising and no visible injuries were\n\nfound. Dr Chiam further elaborated that it was likely that the tenderness on the chest\n\nwall was caused by a fall. This was because when a person suffered a fall the energy would\n\nbe dissipated, resulting in muscular pain but not in bruising. A punch or a kick, however,\n\nwould be a focussed and high impact blow which would cause bruising. The medical forms\n\nwhich were completed during the medical examinations indicated that the tenderness was\n\nconsistent with a fall, like a fall from a motorcycle. Dr Chiam said that Malik told him\n\nthat he had fallen from a motorcycle.11.    The trial judge did not accept Malik’s allegation of\n\nassault. This alone would suffice to dispose of the objection. What was interesting to\n\nnote was that Malik did not challenge the voluntariness and admissibility of statements A\n\nand the first part of statement B. But these were the first two statements that were\n\nrecorded after he had fallen off his motorcycle, and had allegedly been kicked and punched\n\nby CNB officers and slapped by SI See. If statement A and the first part of statement B\n\nwere voluntarily made, it defied logic to allege that only the second part of statement B\n\nand statement C were affected by the fall and the alleged assault. This smacked of\n\nselective objection, brought about not on account of pain caused by the fall or assaults\n\nbut by the incriminating nature of those parts of the statements.12.    Thus, on the evidence, not only was there no basis for us to\n\ndisagree with the trial judge’s finding that the statements were voluntarily made,\n\nwe, in fact, agreed with his conclusion.13.    As regards the allegations that the statements recorded were not\n\naccurate, this went to the question of the veracity of the statements, not their\n\nadmissibility.14.    We now turn to the objection raised as to the admissibility of\n\nstatement D, the cautioned statement recorded by Inspector Saherly also on 31 January\n\n2001. The bases for this objection were that Malik was suffering from pain at his chest,\n\nhe was hungry and was further offered inducement by Insp Saherly when the latter said that\n\nMalik would be taken to see the doctor if the cautioned statement was completed quickly.15.    According to Malik, after his examination by Dr Ong and before\n\nbeing brought to Insp Saherly’s office he told Cpl Anan that he was in pain and was\n\nhungry. But when Cpl Anan was cross-examined in the voir dire this allegation was not put\n\nto him. Insp Saherly denied that Malik told him about his pain. Neither did he know that\n\nMalik was hungry. Nor did he offer any inducement to Malik that he would be allowed to see\n\nthe doctor if he had made the statement quickly. The evidence of Insp Saherly was\n\ncorroborated by Ms Sofia bte Sufri, the Malay interpreter who was present at the recording\n\nof the cautioned statement.16.    These allegations were rejected by the trial judge. In this\n\nregard, we must observe that Malik had just returned from seeing Dr Ong. He told Dr Ong\n\nabout his fall from the motorcycle. He did not complain of any serious pain. Dr Ong merely\n\nnoted that there was \"tenderness\" on his chest. We did not think there could be\n\nany truth in the allegation that Insp Saherly promised to bring him to a doctor if he gave\n\na statement quickly. He was, of course, brought to see Dr Chiam for the normal\n\npost-statement examination. Dr Chiam said there was mild right-sided tenderness on the\n\nchest wall.17.    As regards the allegation of hunger, according to Malik he had\n\nonly a slice of bread at 12 noon that day and he was not offered anything to eat or drink\n\nright up to the time of the cautioned statement. It is pertinent to point out that there\n\nare two requirements which must be satisfied before involuntariness can be successfully\n\nraised. This was addressed by this court inChai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP[1999] 1 SLR 25as follows:-The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly\n\n  objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat\n\n  inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise\n\n  operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of\n\n  punishment connected with the charge.18.    It is difficult to imagine that a person’s will would be\n\nsapped by a mere 10 hours (or eight hours from the time of his arrest) of no food or drink\n\nso much so that he would even admit to a capital charge. Here, we bore in mind the\n\nobservations made by this court inFung Yuk Shing v PP[1993] 3 SLR 421:An accused might be continually grilled for days on end without being\n\n  given food and drink or he might go without such sustenance for a few hours. The failure\n\n  to offer sustenance might be a deliberate ploy to weaken the accused’s will or it\n\n  might be a genuine oversight amidst the flurry of investigative activity. The point is, it\n\n  does not appear to us to be realistic to take the sweeping stand that every failure to\n\n  offer an accused sustenance constitutes a ‘threat’ or an ‘inducement’\n\n  of such gravity as to automatically render any statement he makes involuntary.19.    A statement would be inadmissible if it were obtained under\n\noppression and whether there was oppression is a question of fact. Here everything took\n\nplace well within the day. He was probably very anxious and worried on account of his\n\narrest. But we did not think that a failure to offer Malik food or drink from the time of\n\nhis arrest until the taking of the cautioned statement, a mere eight hours, could\n\nconstitute oppression such as to invalidate a statement made.20.    The trial judge found that even on the basis that the allegations\n\nof Malik as to pain, hunger and inducement by Insp Saherly were true, he did not think\n\nthat Malik was really affected by them when he made the cautioned statement:-Malik was probably frightened when he made his cautioned statement.\n\n  That would be normal for someone in his position who has been ambushed, arrested and\n\n  charged with a capital offence. Such a reaction on the part of an accused person would not\n\n  render any statement that he made involuntarily.His allegation that Inspector Saherly induced him to give his statement\n\n  by promising that if he gave it quickly he would be sent to the hospital and he can then\n\n  rest was denied by Inspector Saherly and the interpreter. Apart from their evidence, I\n\n  found it difficult to believe that he could have yielded to such an inducement, assuming\n\n  that it was made. There was no evidence that he needed medical attention or rest so badly\n\n  so as to succumb to the inducement.I did not find any basis for finding that Malik made the disputed\n\n  statements because of his pain, hunger or fear or that he made the cautioned statement\n\n  because of Inspector Saherly’s offer of medical attention and rest. I therefore ruled\n\n  that the disputed statements he made to SI See and the cautioned statement were\n\n  admissible.21.    In the result, we agreed with the finding of the trial judge that\n\nthe cautioned statement was admissible. Malik had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in\n\nrelation to both the objective and subjective requirements in order to successfully plead\n\nthat the statement was not given voluntarily.",
        "The contents of statements": "22.    In statement A, Malik said that he went to Norazmi’s flat at\n\nBlock 109 that day to collect a gambling debt of $3,000 which Norazmi owed him. When\n\nNorazmi said that he had no money to pay Malik, the latter in anger entered Norazmi’s\n\nroom and grabbed something from a dressing table – two T-shirts, a belt and a plastic\n\nbag containing some envelopes. While he did not see what was inside the envelopes he knew\n\nthey contained heroin. He threw the bag containing the envelopes over the parapet onto the\n\nground.23.    After his arrest and upon being brought to the ground floor of\n\nBlock 109 he was asked to point out where he threw the bag. But nothing was found there.\n\nThese were the questions and answers recorded in the first part of statement B:-\"Q: Where are those things you threw?A: I don’t know.Q: Are you sure this is the place?A: Yes.\"24.    The second part of statement B containing a question posed to\n\nMalik by SI See upon being informed by ASP Marvin Sim of his find on the 9thfloor:-\"Q: Did you go to the 9thstorey of this block and\n\n  throw the things there?A: OK, I bring you there.\"25.    Statement C was given by Malik to SI See soon after he was\n\nbrought to the 9thfloor of Blk 109 to see the bag which was hidden by the side\n\nof the abandoned washing machine. The answers given were clearly incriminating and they\n\nwere as follows:-Q: Is this plastic bag containing the brown envelopes with sachets of\n\n  heroin yours?A: Yes, its mine. I took it away from Boy Kamis (i.e., Norazmi) by\n\n  force as he owes me money.Q: Do you know the envelopes contain heroin?A: Yes, when I decided to leave it here, I opened one envelope to see\n\n  what was inside and discovered it was heroin.Q: Did you pay Boy Kamis any money?A: No.Q: Why did you bring me to the ground floor and not here where you left\n\n  the heroin?A: Because I was afraid as I knew it was heroin and it is an offence.Q: Do you smoke heroin recently?A: No.Q: Then what do you intend to do with the heroin?A: I intend to leave it here at the meantime and think about what to do\n\n  to these heroin later.Q: Do you have anything else to say?A: No.26.    In his cautioned statement (statement D), Malik admitted to the\n\ncharge and asked for forgiveness:-I admit guilty to the charge. This is my first time trafficking heroin.\n\n  Please give me a chance. I do not know what else to say.27.    At this juncture we would also quote the relevant portions of\n\nstatement E (which admission into evidence was not objected to) as it was a document which\n\nthe trial judge took into account in arriving at his verdict:-… In the room, on the carpet, I also saw some aluminium foil and a\n\n  straw of heroin. Boy then offered me the heroin to consume. I refused the offer as I am\n\n  going to report for urine test in the evening. He then opened a box and I noticed some\n\n  sachets of heroin and a few envelopes. He then told me that since I was going to start\n\n  consuming heroin, it was better (sic) push it at the same time. I refused and just asked\n\n  him for 5 sachets for my own consumption only. At that point of time, I also took a look\n\n  at some of the sachets of heroin in the box. Boy then set aside a few envelopes containing\n\n  heroin inside a plastic bag and gave it to me. I did not know the exact amount of heroin\n\n  inside the plastic bag. Boy asked me to take the heroin back and do whatever I want to do\n\n  with them. I told him that I would consume them all. He told me to go ahead and do it. Boy\n\n  did not ask for any payment as he knows that even if I were to consume all of the heroin,\n\n  I would call to pay him back. I left soon after... I took the staircase on the right of the house and went down. As I\n\n  was going down, I look through the envelopes containing the heroin. I began to feel\n\n  confuse and panic when I look at the numerous amount of heroin. At the third floor, I\n\n  decided to throw the heroin away. However, I did not do it as I then have to pay for the\n\n  heroin. I then decided to return the heroin. I then went up the stairs again. I am not\n\n  sure why I went up to the 10thfloor. I then went to the lift landing on the 10thfloor still thinking of what to do with the heroin. I then decided to put the heroin aside\n\n  first. I went down to the 9thfloor to look for a place to keep the plastic bag\n\n  of heroin. I saw a washing machine on the 9thfloor and decided to place the\n\n  plastic bag behind it. I then left the block on my motorcycle to go for my urine test.",
        "Malik’s defence": "28.    Malik said that he first came to know Norazmi in 1997 at the Moon\n\nCrescent Prison when they were both inmates there. After their discharge from prison, they\n\nsocialized occasionally. Sometime two weeks before their arrest, Norazmi borrowed $3,000\n\nfrom him to gamble. On 30 January 2001, when they met at a \"Prata\" shop along\n\nBencoolen Street, Norazmi promised to pay the debt the following day. Norazmi even offered\n\ndrugs to Malik but the latter only said he would think about it.29.    On 31 January 2001, at about 11.00am, Malik called Norazmi and\n\nthe latter asked the former to go to his flat. Malik left on his motorcycle. When Malik\n\narrived at Norazmi’s flat, Norazmi’s mother opened the door to let him in. In\n\nNorazmi’s room, Malik was invited to smoke heroin, but he refused. Norazmi did not\n\noffer or give him any drugs to sell. When Norazmi told Malik that he could not repay the\n\nloan, Malik became very angry. He grabbed a plastic bag on the dressing table and left the\n\nflat, promising to return in two or three days’ time for the money. He did not know\n\nwhat was in the plastic bag.30.    While walking down the staircase, he opened the plastic bag and\n\nfound, among other things, a few envelopes. When he opened them, he saw a yellowish\n\nsubstance which he suspected to be heroin. He was shocked and scared by the large amount\n\nof drugs. He wanted to return the plastic bag to Norazmi and walked back up the block. In\n\nhis haste, he missed the level and it was in this panicked state of mind that he threw\n\naway the plastic bag from the staircase down to the open field behind Block 109. He did\n\nnot want to have anything to do with the drugs.31.    Having thrown away the plastic bag, he walked down and left the\n\nplace on his motorcycle. He did not know that he was being tailed. When he stopped at the\n\njunction of Block 625 Bukit Batok Central, he was knocked from behind and he fell onto the\n\nground. Immediately, he was pounced on and kicked and punched by a group of persons who\n\nlater identified themselves as CNB officers. He suffered pain on his body.32.    After he was arrested, he was brought to the void deck of Block\n\n625 where SI See slapped him on his face. SI See questioned him in English, but he could\n\nnot understand him as SI See was speaking too fast and Cpl Anan Devan had to interpret the\n\nquestions in Malay to him. Malik then led SI See and his officers to the grass verge\n\nbehind Block 109 where he said he had thrown the plastic bag. But nothing was found.33.    At that moment, SI See received a call on his handphone and he\n\nthen asked Malik from where did he throw the things. Malik indicated that it was from the\n\nupper floor of Block 109. SI See asked if that was the block where Norazmi was staying and\n\nthen told Malik to lead them to the floor from where he threw the things. Malik said he\n\nnever mentioned anything about the ninth floor.34.    According to Malik, it was SI See who led the way up the stairs.\n\nMalik thought that they were going to Norazmi’s house. Instead, SI See proceeded to\n\nthe ninth floor. By a disused washing machine on that floor he saw a plastic bag, which he\n\nhad never seen before.",
        "Appeal": "35.    In this appeal, besides reiterating the point that statement B\n\n(second part) and statements C and D should not have been admitted into evidence on the\n\nground that they were not made voluntarily, and which we have dealt with above, what\n\ncounsel for Malik basically argued was that the version of events as recounted by Malik in\n\ncourt was credible, or, at the very least, he had raised a reasonable doubt, particularly\n\nin the light of the fact that Norazmi had admitted at the trial that all the drugs\n\nbelonged to him and that Malik had no connection with drugs. Norazmi also confirmed that\n\nhe did borrow money from Malik for gambling.",
        "Our decision": "36.    We would point out that besides incriminating himself in the\n\nthree statements on which objection as to admissibility was raised, Malik had, as can be\n\nseen from 27 above, also incriminated himself in statement E, the admission of which\n\ninto evidence was not objected to by Malik. However, in the witness box, he retracted some\n\nparts of statements B, C and D which were incriminating and said he made them all up. He\n\nalso claimed that as far as the incriminating parts of statement E were concerned, he\n\nstated those things because he was threatened by Norazmi when they were both in court on 2\n\nFebruary 2001. He also said some parts were made at the suggestion of Insp Saherly.37.    In coming to his decision that Malik was guilty of the charge,\n\nthe trial judge relied in the main upon the following evidence:-(i) Malik’s admission in his cautioned statement as well as in\n\n  statement E;(ii) Norazmi’s statements of 2 February and 19 February 2001 which\n\n  corroborated the admission of Malik; and(iii) the undisputed facts of Malik leaving the flat that day, going\n\n  down to the third floor, making a call on his hand phone and then going up from the third\n\n  floor.38.    In Norazmi’s statement of 2 February, he stated that he gave\n\nMalik about \"50 plus packets\" of heroin and of that lot, \"fifty packets\n\nwere sold to him for S$5,000 while the rest were for his ration.\" He also stated that\n\nafter Malik left, Malik called \"saying that he suspected that there were CNB officers\n\ndownstairs.\" In Norazmi’s statement of 19 February, he stated that he gave Malik\n\n\"about 53 packets of heroin. He (Malik) was quite surprised at the large amount of\n\nheroin and asked me what it was for. I just told him to take the heroin first and we would\n\ntalk about it later.\"39.    The trial judge reviewed the evidence carefully and dealt with\n\nthe various points raised as follows:-(i) the assertion that when Malik gave the cautioned statement, he told\n\n  the interpreter he was not guilty - the trial judge noted that, this being a very serious\n\n  allegation, yet it was not raised in the voir dire and neither was it put to the\n\n  interpreter or Insp Saherly.(ii) the assertion that statement E was made because of threats by\n\n  Norazmi - the trial judge, after observing that the admissibility of statement E was not\n\n  objected to, said:\"I did not believe that he made those admissions because of any\n\n    threat from Norazmi. If there was anything that Norazmi wanted from Malik, it would be\n\n    that Malik not incriminate him with the drugs recovered at the washing machine. It was\n\n    incredible that if Norazmi threatened him, he just instructed him to admit to the drugs\n\n    without also instructing him to leave him out of it. It was equally incredible for Malik\n\n    to implicate Norazmi falsely if he had received the threat. He could not have thought that\n\n    he was appeasing Norazmi by doing that\"(iii) the assertion that Malik panicked when he opened the bag and saw\n\n  the large quantities of drugs - the trial judge commented that Malik’s intention of\n\n  going back to the flat to return the bag to Norazmi, and his making a call to Norazmi on\n\n  the hand phone, did not indicate panic.40.    The trial judge then dealt with Norazmi’s attempt at the\n\ntrial to take the blame totally when he said that it was he who placed the plastic bag of\n\nheroin beside the abandoned washing machine. He held that this was completely inconsistent\n\nwith his two statements given to the CNB and with the objective facts. Norazmi never told\n\nthe CNB during investigations that he had so hidden the plastic bag. Whether the court\n\nshould have believed the evidence of Norazmi given in court must depend on all the\n\ncircumstances and tested against the objective facts. The judge demolished Norazmi’s\n\nclaim, that it was his practice to hide his drugs there because he did not want the drugs\n\nto be found in his own room, with the following observation:-\"He said that he would go to the hiding place when he needed to\n\n  take some drugs for sale or for consumption. He had no way of knowing when the authorities\n\n  responsible for the maintenance of the common areas of the block, the owner of the washing\n\n  machine or the owner of the flat would remove the washing machine or his trove. If he\n\n  wanted to avoid detection he would not conduct his activities such that he would have to\n\n  return to the washing machine each time he needed the drugs. He would also not risk losing\n\n  all those drugs in the event that the washing machine or the bag was taken away. I found\n\n  this part of his evidence to be entirely unworthy of belief.\"There was no reason for us to dissent from this determination.41.    It seemed to us clear that on the basis of statements C, D and E,\n\nthe movements of Malik at Block 109 that fateful afternoon, and the confessions of Norazmi\n\nwhich unequivocally implicated Malik (which statements were admissible against Malik under\n\ns 30 of the Evidence Act, as interpreted by this court inChin Seow Noi v PP[1994] 1 SLR 135), there was ample evidence to warrant the trial judge finding that it was Malik\n\nwho placed the plastic bag with the drugs beside the abandoned washing machine on the 9thfloor and that he was thus in possession of the drugs. Possession having been proven, he\n\nwas presumed under s 17 to have the drugs for the purposes of trafficking. The charge was\n\ntherefore established. In the premises, the findings and the verdict recorded by the trial\n\njudge were correct and should be upheld and which we did.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHIEF JUSTICESgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDGE OF APPEALSgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
