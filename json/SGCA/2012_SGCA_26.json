        "Introduction": "1       The importance of\n     granularly examining the facts in determining the outcome of contested\n     criminal proceedings cannot be overstated. Certainly, the importance of\n     such intense scrutiny needs no reiteration where sexual offences without\n     any objective corroboration are in question. This was indeed the case here\n     and this will also explain the need for meticulous attention to the\n     detailed facts that constitute the core of the present judgment. As a\n     consequence of this scrutiny, significant evidential gaps were revealed.\n     This resulted in the present appeal having to be heard in two tranches\n     whilst further evidence was sought. As we shall see, this exercise was not\n     a wholly successful one although the new facts that were unearthed were\n     significant inconfirmingthe inadequacy of\n     the evidence before this court that (in turn) led to our decision. This,\n     then, was one central strand in the present appeal. It was inextricably\n     connected with a second. 2       The second central\n     strand consisted in that precious and indispensable “golden thread” which\n     runs “[t]hroughout the web of the English Criminal Law” (seeperViscount Sankey LC in the leading House of Lords\n     decision ofWoolmington v The Director of Public\n      Prosecutions[1935] AC 462 at 481) – and, we might add,\n     Singapore Criminal Law as well. That “golden thread” is, of course, the\n     fundamental principle that the Prosecution bears the legal burden of\n     proving its case against the accused (here, the Appellant)beyond a reasonable doubt. This principle has been\n     stated in the local context in far too many cases to be enumerated here.\n     More importantly (and as already mentioned), it is inextricably connected\n     to the first central strand simply because thefactsare anintegralpart of\n     the process by which the court ascertains whether or not the legal burden\n     just referred to has been discharged. 3       Given the crucial\n     importance of the facts in the context of the present appeal and (in\n     particular) the detailed analysis that follows, it would be helpful to\n     first set out a

appropriate. Close to three years ago on\n     30 April 2009, the Appellant was arrested by the police after his daughter\n     (“C1”) dramatically alleged that she had been repeatedly and systematically\n     raped by her father over a period of 10 years. She was then 16 years-old.\n     The rapes allegedly took place at a one bedroom rental flat where the\n     Appellant’s family resided (“the flat”). 5       In the High Court, the\n     Prosecution proceeded against the Appellant on the following five charges\n     (out of a total of nine charges), which will henceforth be referred to as\n     the first to fifth charges, respectively: That you, [Appellant], (1)    sometime in 1999, in [the flat], voluntarily\n       had carnal intercourse against the order of nature with [C1]\n       (DOB: xx March 1993), to wit, by having the said person perform fellatio\n       on you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under\n       section 377 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed). (2)    on one occasion in the period from March 2003\n       to May 2003, in [the flat], committed rape on [C1], while she was under\n       the age of 14 years, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable\n       under section 376(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev\n      Ed). (3)    sometime in June 2003, in [the flat],\n       committed rape on [C1], while she was under the age of 14 years, and you\n       have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 376(2) of the\n       Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed). (4)    sometime in 2004 (1st occasion) which was\n       after 11 March 2004, in [the flat], committed rape on [C1], while she was\n       under the age of 14 years, and you have thereby committed an offence\n       punishable under section 376(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev\n       Ed). (5)    on 29th day of April 2009 at about 2.30pm, in\n       the flat, used criminal force on [C1] intending to outrage her modesty,\n       to wit, by undoing one button at the front of her blouse, and further, in\n       order to facilitate the commission of the said offence, you voluntarily\n       caused wrongful restraint to the said complainant, to wit, by grabbing\n       her right wrist with your hand, and you have thereby committed an offence\n       punishable under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter\n      224. 6       Four other charges for\n     fellatio in 2000 and rape in 2004, July 2006 and November 2006 were stood\n     down by the Prosecution at the start of the trial. The last charge was\n     amended by the trial judge (“the Judge”) at the conclusion of the\n     Prosecution’s case by deleting “undoing” and substituting the words\n     “attempting to undo.” 7       The trial commenced\n     with the Appellant conducting his own defence and speaking through a Malay\n     interpreter. On 27 August 2010, after 12 Prosecution witnesses had\n     testified, including C1, at the first tranche of the trial (“the first\n     tranche of the trial”), the Appellant informed the court that his family\n     wished to engage legal representation for him. The Appellant’s father\n     confirmed that the family would be instructing lawyers to represent the\n     Appellant. The trial was thus adjourned for the family to do\n    so. 8       On 30 August 2010,\n     newly-appointed counsel confirmed that they had been instructed to act for\n     the Appellant and applied for time to study the notes of evidence and to\n     take further instructions. They asked the Judge if they could recall, for\n     the purpose of cross-examination only, four Prosecution witnesses: PW6\n     (SSSGT Mohamed Lathiff) (“Lathiff”), PW9 (Dr Cindy Pang), PW10 (the ex-wife\n     of the Appellant and mother of C1) (“the mother”) and PW12 (“C1”). The\n     Prosecution had no objection to the recall of these witnesses. Accordingly,\n     the Judge acceded to Appellant’s counsel’s request and adjourned the\n     trial. 9       The trial resumed on\n     3 November 2010 and took place over seven days spanning the period of\n     3 November 2010 to 22 November 2010 (“the second tranche of the trial”). On\n     the same day, the Judge convicted the Appellant of all five charges that\n     had been proceeded with. The Prosecution then withdrew the remaining four\n     charges pursuant to s 177 of the previous Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,\n     1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC (Cap 68)”) and the Appellant was granted a discharge not\n     amounting to an acquittal on those charges. 10     On 23 November 2010,\n     the Appellant was sentenced as follows: The section 377 charge (ie, the\n           first charge)5 years’ imprisonmentThe section 376(2) charges (ie,\n           the second, third and fourth charges)12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of\n           the three chargesThe section 354A(1) charge (ie,\n           the fifth charge)2 years’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the\n         cane.   11     The Judge ordered the\n     imprisonment terms for the s 377 charge and two of the s 376(2) charges to\n     run consecutively with effect from the date of the arrest,ie, 30 April 2009, with the other two imprisonment\n     terms to run concurrently with them. The total imprisonment term was\n     therefore 29 years. The Appellant was given the maximum of 24 strokes of\n     the cane. The grounds for the Judge’s decision, which were released on\n     21 December 2010, are to be found inPublic Prosecutor v\n      AOF[2010] SGHC 366 (“the GD”).",

        "The relevant parties": "13     The Appellant was\n     born in November 1975. He is now 37 years old. Prior to his arrest, he was\n     residing in the flat with the wife and three children. He married the wife\n     in 1992. Their three children comprise two daughters and a son. The eldest\n     child, C1, is the complainant in the present charges against the Appellant.\n     She was born in March 1993 and is now 19 years-old. The second daughter\n     (“C2”) was born in 1997 and is now 15 years-old. The son (“C3”) was born in\n     2001 and is now 11 years-old. The marriage appears to have been an unhappy\n     one with the mother having made at least one police report concerning an\n     alleged assault by the Appellant. On that occasion, the Appellant was\n     warned by the investigation officer (“IO”) that his wife could have\n     obtained a Personal Protection Order as a result. By the Appellant’s own\n     admission, he continued to assault his wife even after this police report\n     was made (see below at[30]and[227]). 14     In February 2010, the\n     Appellant divorced his wife by consent in the Syariah Court through\n     matrimonial proceedings commenced by her. The Appellant was in custody in\n     respect of the present case at that particular point in time. 15     Shortly after, on\n     12 July 2010, the mother and Lathiff travelled to Batam together with the\n     mother’s brother where the couple apparently married. Coincidentally,\n     Lathiff, was the Duty Investigation Officer (“DIO”) who attended to the\n     mother and C1 at Ang Mo Kio Police Division when they reported the alleged\n     rapes by the Appellant on 29 April 2009.",
        "The Prosecution’s case at the trial\n    below": "16     The Judge has set out\n     comprehensively the Prosecution’s case in the GD (at [7]–[42]). We therefore set out a summarised version as\n     follows. C1’s testimony at the first tranche of the\n    trial The first charge 17     C1 told the court\n     that the Appellant started engaging in sexual acts with her in 1999 when\n     she was 6 years-old and still in kindergarten. The first alleged incident\n     occurred at around midnight in the living room of the flat when C2 was\n     asleep in the bedroom and the mother was on night shift work. C3 was not\n     yet born. C1 was sleeping with C2 in the bedroom when the Appellant came to\n     wake her up. The Appellant then pulled her up and she followed him to the\n     living room. He told her to sit next to him on the mattress in the living\n     room. C1 was in her pyjama dress. The Appellant lay down on the mattress,\n     wearing only his shorts. The television was on but the house lights were\n     off. A while later, the Appellant pulled down his shorts and told C1 to\n     hold his penis. When she did so, the penis was erect. He then asked her to\n     suck his penis. She complied for a few minutes and noticed “white liquid”\n     coming out from the penis. 18     C1 did not tell\n     anyone, including her mother, about the incident as she did not know at the\n     time that what had happened was wrong and how to tell her mother or anyone\n     about it.[note: 1] The second charge 19     One night, sometime\n     after C1’s tenth birthday, between March 2003 and June 2003, the Appellant\n     asked her to follow him to watch television in the living room. C1 was\n     watching television in the bedroom at the time and both her siblings were\n     asleep. The mother was not at home as she was on night shift\n    work. 20     When C1 went out to\n     the living room, the television screen was showing a naked man on top of a\n     naked woman. C1 did not understand what they were doing. She sat down next\n     to the Appellant while he lay on the mattress, wearing only shorts. C1 was\n     in her pyjama dress. The Appellant then exposed his penis and told her to\n     hold it. As she did so, she felt the Appellant insert his finger into her\n     vagina. She felt pain and tried to push his hand away. He then told her to\n     suck his penis and she complied. After a while, he made her lie down on the\n     mattress and removed her panties. He then held her legs apart and inserted\n     his penis into her vagina. She felt him moving back and forth. She felt a\n     lot of pain and tried to push him away but he was too strong. After he\n     ejaculated on her stomach, he told her to wash up and go to sleep. She\n     followed all the instructions given as she was afraid of the\n     Appellant. The third charge 21     During the school\n     holidays in June 2003, much the same things happened in the living room as\n     in the second charge. C2 and C3 were sleeping in the bedroom and the mother\n     was working the night shift. In the living room, the Appellant got C1 to\n     hold his penis while he inserted his finger into C1’s vagina. He then asked\n     her to suck his penis before inserting his penis into her vagina. C1 tried\n     to resist by pushing him away but he was too strong. He then ejaculated on\n     her stomach and told her to wash up and go to sleep. The day incident 22     C1 also testified\n     about another incident that took place in the flat in 2004 (which was not,\n     however, the subject of any charge). She claimed that one day when she and\n     C2 were in the bedroom, the Appellant went in and asked C2 to go out as he\n     wanted to help massage C1’s back. After C2 left the bedroom, the Appellant\n     closed the room door and latched it. He then asked C1 to perform fellatio\n     on him. She recalled this incident as it happened a few months after her\n     puberty and she was having cramps at that time. The fourth charge 23     After her\n     eleventh birthday in March 2004, the Appellant raped C1 twice that year.\n     She reached puberty around May that year. Consequently, one incident of\n     rape took placebeforeher puberty, which was\n     the subject of the fourth charge, and the other occurredafterher puberty, this was the subject of one of the charges\n     that was stood down by the Prosecution and eventually withdrawn at the end\n     of the trial. Both rapes happened in much the same sequence as the earlier\n     ones described above at[19]–[21]. 24     In 2004, C1 attended\n     sex education classes at school. She claimed that it was then that she had\n     realized that what had happened between her and the Appellant was wrong.\n     She contemplated telling the mother about what the Appellant had done but\n     decided against it as she did not want the mother to be unhappy. This was\n     because she was afraid that the mother would confront the Appellant and\n     that he would beat the mother up, as he had done on other occasions when\n     they quarrelled. C1 also did not know how to explain to the mother about\n     the incidents. She also did not tell her teachers or her classmates as she\n     did not know how to do so and was afraid that they would not believe\n     her. Events in 2006 25     In 2006, when C1 was\n     in secondary one, the Appellant raped her again. In April 2006, she ran\n     away from home. During the three days away from home before the mother\n     found her, she stayed with her friend’s god-sister. She had hoped that her\n     running away from home would show the Appellant that she did not want to\n     continue having sex with him. However, she kept this reason to herself. As\n     a result of this incident, the Appellant punished C1 by having her\n     “grounded” and did not permit her to go to school for some\n    time. 26     C1 also tried to\n     avoid further sexual incidents with the Appellant after the last rape which\n     occurred in 2006. She would return to the flat after school only if the\n     mother was at home. Otherwise, she would go to the Ang Mo Kio library and\n     remain there until 8pm to 10pm. When she went to bed, she would lie next to\n     C2 so that, if the Appellant attempted to pull her away, she would hug C2\n     and cause her to wake up. 27     C1 affirmed\n     unequivocally that she did not have sex with any other person besides the\n     Appellant. This is an issue that goes to her credibility that we will\n     address below (see Issue 1 below, at[111]–[172]). C1’s diary 28     C1 claimed that she\n     used to keep two diaries while she was in primary school. The yellow one\n     was for her general matters while the purple one, bought when she was in\n     primary four or five, was to record the sexual abuse by the Appellant up to\n     2006. She recorded the dates of the incidents, what happened on those days\n     and her feelings about them and would refer to the diary two or three times\n     every fortnight. Both diaries were supposedly lost while she was in\n     secondary two or three, allegedly thrown away with other books by the\n     mother during spring cleaning of the flat. C1’s disclosure of the sexual assaults to\n    C2 29     C1 further testified\n     that she had told C2 about the sexual abuse while they were staying with\n     their grandmother during the school holidays sometime in 2007 or 2008. One\n     night, she asked C2 whether she knew the meaning of “sex”. C2 said that it\n     meant the penis was inside the vagina. C1 then asked her whether she\n     believed that “daddy” had done that to her. C2 appeared shocked and was a\n     little incredulous at first. She asked C1 why she had not informed “mummy”\n     about it. C1 replied that it was not the right time to tell her yet as\n     their parents were quarrelling and she did not want to add to the mother’s\n     problems. C2 asked her whether she would like her to help in telling the\n     mother but C1 said that she would tell the mother when it was time to do\n     so. The fifth charge 30     The fifth charge,\n     along with the arrest of the Appellant, came about in the following manner.\n     A few days before 29 April 2009, the mother and the three children moved\n     out of the flat after the mother and the Appellant had quarrelled over\n     their finances. They went to stay with the children’s maternal grandmother\n     in Yishun. Moving out with the mother after their parents had quarrelled\n     was not something new to the children. In fact, the mother and the\n     Appellant quarrelled frequently over money and the Appellant’s alleged\n     extra-marital affairs with various “Indonesian ladies”. These quarrels\n     would often turn violent with the mother having to make a police report\n     more than two to three years ago. On that occasion, the Appellant was\n     warned by the IO that his wife could have obtained a Personal Protection\n     Order as a result. These bouts of violence went on even after the police\n     report. 31     Sometime after 2pm on\n     29 April 2009, C1 returned to the flat alone to collect some items which\n     she needed for school. According to C1, the Appellant later returned to the\n     flat and, noticing that C1 was in the bedroom, went in to talk to her and\n     sat a few feet away from her. He grabbed her right wrist with his left hand\n     and tried to undo the first button (the one just below the collar button)\n     of her school blouse. During the struggle, C1 managed to use her mobile\n     phone to call the mother to inform her that she was leaving the flat to\n     meet the mother at Ang Mo Kio Central for shopping as had been arranged.\n     The mother recalled that C1 was speaking in a trembling voice and had\n     sounded sad. As a result of this call, the Appellant stopped his actions.\n     C1 then left the flat quickly and went to meet the mother. 32     When they met, the\n     mother noticed that C1 looked like she had been crying although she had\n     earlier sounded delighted to go shopping. C1 burst out in tears when C3\n     asked her why she was crying. She managed to utter only the words, “daddy,\n     daddy” when the mother asked why she was crying. The mother then asked her\n     whether the Appellant had scolded her or had beaten her up. She told the\n     mother in Malay that the Appellant “wanted to do it again”. When the mother\n     asked her to elaborate, she used the Malay word“main”(meaning “play”) to explain that he had wanted sex. The\n     mother asked her whether the Appellant had put his penis into her vagina\n     and she confirmed that he did. The mother then asked her to swear upon God\n     that what she was telling her was true. When C1 did so, the mother brought\n     her to Ang Mo Kio South Neighbourhood Police Centre (“the NPC”) in a taxi.\n     In the taxi, the mother asked C1 to re-affirm that everything she said was\n     the truth and C1 did so. According to the mother’s testimony, she asked C1\n     whether it was“sedap”(or nice) and C1\n     replied that it was not. She asked this question to determine whether C1\n     was a willing participant in the sex acts. 33     At the NPC, they\n     approached a female officer who observed that C1 was crying. The female\n     officer tried to calm her down. C1 informed the female officer that she had\n     been raped by her father and wanted to lodge a police report.[note: 2]The\n     female officer then telephoned Senior Staff Sergeant Lathiff, who was the\n     DIO of Ang Mo Kio Police Division that evening. Lathiff instructed the\n     female officer to lodge a police report for C1 and to ask the mother and C1\n     to go to the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters (“the DHQ”) to meet\n     him. Before leaving for the DHQ, a male police officer at the NPC typed out\n     C1’s First Information Report (“FIR”) which C1 signed. The section,\n     entitled “Brief details” in the FIR, reads as follows: Sometime in year 2006, I was raped by my father one [name of\n      Appellant and his NRIC no.] at [the flat]. 34     Under the heading,\n     “Date/Time of Incident”, it was stated, “12/07/2006 23:55 –\n     12/07/2006 23:55”. The date and time of the said report were stated as\n     “29/04/2009 16:48”. 35     At the DHQ, Lathiff\n     interviewed C1 and her mother separately and recorded their contents in his\n     investigation diary. Later that evening, Station Inspector Chandra Seakeran\n     (“SI Chandra”) of the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch (“SSCB”) arrived and\n     interviewed C1. The next day, the police arrested the Appellant at the\n     flat. He has been in custody since. C1’s testimony at the second tranche of the\n    trial 36     C1 was one of four\n     Prosecution witnesses recalled for cross-examination. C1 agreed that she\n     was not angry with the Appellant for quarrelling with the mother over money\n     matters but was angry over the Appellant’s alleged extra-marital\n      affairs.[note: 3]C1 agreed that while she had three\n     boyfriends since secondary one, she did not have had sexual intercourse\n     with any of these boys.[note: 4] 37     The Appellant’s\n     defence counsel (“defence counsel”) suggested to C1 that her allegations\n     about the incidents of sex were all false. In particular, defence counsel\n     suggested to C1 that she was fabricating the allegations against the\n     Appellant in order to send him to prison, as he was a strict father, had\n     treated C2 better than she, had extra-marital affairs and had beat up the\n     mother. C1 denied that she was lying about the sexual assaults and\n     disagreed with the suggestions made by defence counsel.[note: 5] 38     However, C1 conceded\n     under cross examination that she had lied to the mother on two occasions.\n     On the first occasion, when she ran away from home in 2006 and was located\n     by the mother subsequently, C1 lied that she had been staying outdoors when\n     she was actually in a friend’s home. C1 explained that she did not want to\n     get the friends who sheltered her into trouble as the mother had made a\n     police report about her disappearance. On the second occasion, when the\n     mother told her to return home and not stay in the library, she lied that\n     she had to look for materials there. C1 explained that she did not want to\n     return to the flat earlier as she was afraid of being alone with the\n     Appellant. 39     In respect of her\n     relationship with Lathiff, C1 denied having addressed him as“Baba”or father in Malay. She said that Lathiff had\n     only advised her about school work and her future. C1’s HSA statement 40     In re-examination,\n     the Prosecution brought to the attention of the court the statement C1 had\n     given to Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) officers (“the HSA statement”)\n     regarding a separate, ongoing police investigation into the mother’s and\n     Lathiff’s alleged involvement in the theft of cough syrup from the clinic\n     where the mother used to work as a nurse (“the theft of cough syrup\n     investigation”). It should be noted that Lathiff is the same person who was\n     the DIO in C1’s rape investigation. Of relevance is the fact that this\n     statement was recorded on 22 September 2010, between the first tranche and\n     the second tranche of the Appellant’s trial. It was commendably brought to\n     the court’s attention during the Prosecution’s re-examination of C1 when\n     she was recalled as a witness on 15 November 2010. When questioned by the\n     Prosecution, C1 denied giving the answers recorded in the HSA statement. In\n     contradiction to what the HSA statement recorded, she denied telling the\n     HSA officers that she believed that the mother had married Lathiff in Batam\n     and that, at first, she called the mother’s new husband “uncle” but\n     subsequently called him “Baba”. The HSA\n     statement also recorded C1 as stating that the mother had known Lathiff\n     since June 2009, this was shortly after he had been the (initial)\n     investigating officer looking into C1’s police report. She maintained her\n     position that she did not say those things about the mother and Lathiff\n     despite being repeatedly warned by the Prosecution and the Judge about the\n     consequences of giving false testimony. 41     C1 claimed that she\n     was working as an event coordinator for a fast food outlet and was in the\n     midst of a client’s birthday party at the client’s home when some HSA\n     officers telephoned her and requested to meet her for five minutes. She\n     agreed and went down to the ground floor of the block of flats where she\n     had hurriedly answered some questions and then signed a statement after it\n     was read to her as she had to rush back to the party. She signed that\n     statement (viz, the HSA statement) as the HSA\n     officers had told her that the HSA statement could be of assistance to the\n     mother. She adamantly maintained in court that the contents of the\n     statement were untrue and that she had merely called Lathiff “uncle” and\n     not “Baba”.[note: 6] 42     Both defence counsel\n     and the Prosecution agreed initially that the HSA officers who recorded\n     C1’s statement be called to testify. However, the next day, the Prosecution\n     informed the court that it was not calling the officers but would take the\n     position that the HSA statement was indeed made by C1. The Prosecution did\n     not wish to have the whole statement admitted in evidence as it was the\n     subject of ongoing investigations. On that basis, defence counsel accepted\n     the Prosecution’s position and agreed to confine their questioning to the\n     portion of the HSA statement already on the record.[note: 7]Nonetheless, the Prosecution’s submission\n     was that whether C1 had addressed Lathiff as “Baba” “is clearly a collateral matter, a\n      matter that is not central to the issue before the\n      Court.”[note: 8]Defence counsel disagreed and submitted\n     that it was relevant to discredit C1’s testimony and demonstrate whether\n     there had been any form of collusion among Lathiff, C1 and the\n      mother.[note: 9]When C1 returned to the\n     witness stand, she explained that she was sad and concerned that the\n     investigators were alleging that her mother was involved in the alleged\n     theft of cough syrup. She maintained that she had called Lathiff “uncle”\n     and not “Baba” and that she did not know\n     whether calling him “Baba” would be damaging\n     to her mother’s case or not. She also maintained that she had no reason to\n     fabricate the charges of rape and sexual abuse by the Appellant and that\n     she had not discussed the case with Lathiff.[note: 10] The medical reports 43     On 5 May 2009, the\n     Appellant was examined by a doctor from Changi General Hospital and found\n     not to have been suffering from erectile dysfunction. On 18 and 25 May\n     2009, the Appellant was examined by Dr Seng Kok Han, a psychiatrist from\n     the Institute of Mental Health, and was found to have had no mental\n     illness. The Appellant informed the psychiatrist that he had never had\n     sexual intercourse or any other sexual activity with C1. He also told the\n     psychiatrist that, although he was not close to C1, they did not have major\n     conflicts and he did not know why C1 had accused him of rape. During the\n     second session with the psychiatrist, the Appellant was tearful when he\n     said that he might plead guilty in order not to get C1 into\n    trouble. 44     On 3 June 2009, C1\n     was examined by Dr Cindy Pang (“Dr Pang”) of the Department of Obstetrics\n     and Gynaecology, Singapore General Hospital. C1 informed Dr Pang that she\n     had her menarche at age 11 and provided a general history of the alleged\n     sexual acts between the Appellant and her. Dr Pang noted that C1’s hymen\n     “... was deficient posteriorly, with old tears at the 2 and 9 o’clock\n     position, suggestive of previous penetration.” Dr Pang explained that when\n     she interviewed C1, she had focused on the history pertaining to\n     penetration and not on non-penetrative episodes. She opined that it was\n     unlikely that the tears were caused by sports or dancing and that they\n     could not have occurred unless there had been penetration by some object.\n     In her view, a posteriorly deficient hymen was not more susceptible to\n     tears compared to a normal one. 45     C1 was examined by\n     Dr Lim Choon Guan (“Dr Lim”), a psychiatrist in the Department of Child and\n     Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, on 5 June 2009. C1 gave\n     Dr Lim a general history of the sexual acts allegedly committed by the\n     Appellant on her. Dr Lim noted that C1 was able to give a clear and\n     detailed account of the alleged events. He also noted that she would become\n     teary-eyed at times but was still able to hold her composure, that her mood\n     was not depressed and that her thoughts were coherent and logical. C1 was\n     assessed to be in the average range of intellectual functioning. The\n     psychiatrist opined that C1 was not suffering from any major mental illness\n     and did not exhibit any symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder, was fit\n     to testify in court, and was aware of the nature and quality of the acts\n     she had alleged against the Appellant. Dr Lim also interviewed the mother\n     on the same day. He recorded that she had declined the institute’s request\n     to obtain a report on C1 from her school. C1 was referred for counselling\n     with the Child Guidance Clinic’s medical social worker but did not turn up\n     for the appointment on 25 June 2009. When cross-examined, C1 claimed that\n     her mother did not inform her about this further appointment. When further\n     questioned on why her mother did not accede to Dr Lim’s request for C1’s\n     school report, C1 agreed with defence counsel’s suggestion that the report\n     would perhaps expose her disciplinary problems at school.[note: 11]However, when it was put to her later in\n     cross-examination, C1 denied having discipline problems before and after\n     April 2009.[note: 12] The mother’s testimony 46     In respect of her\n     divorce from the Appellant, the mother testified that she had commenced\n     proceedings in the Syariah Court because she could not tolerate the abuse\n     by the Appellant and his financial irresponsibility towards their family,\n     and also because of the allegations that he had raped their daughter.\n     However, she agreed that the divorce was granted without the court\n     requiring her to prove her allegations and that the Appellant had merely\n     pronounced the “talak” in order to effect the\n     divorce. 47     The mother explained\n     that she had left the flat around 4pm to 5pm for her night shift work\n     during the marriage. She testified that she had changed primary schools for\n     C1 not because C1 had disciplinary problems in the former school but purely\n     because the former school was further away from the flat and that\n     travelling to and from school cost money while the new school was within\n     walking distance. When C1 was missing from home, the mother took leave to\n     search for her and, when someone finally told her where C1 was, her only\n     concern was to bring her home and not to question her about why she had run\n     away from home. 48     The mother was\n     cross-examined about her relationship with Lathiff, a married man. She was\n     asked whether she had asked the Appellant’s sister and her husband to\n     arrange a secret marriage for her and Lathiff in Batam. The mother claimed\n     that she became friends with Lathiff only some two months after C1’s police\n     report was made. Lathiff called to ask how she was coping and had asked her\n     out for a drink. She admitted that she had invited Lathiff to the flat and\n     that he had driven her to Ang Mo Kio Central in a police patrol car before.\n     Lathiff merely advised her children to be obedient and to study hard. He\n     did not try to coach C1 or C2 concerning their testimony in court. She\n     denied being in a romantic relationship. She stated that she told the\n     Appellant’s sister to arrange the secret marriage in Batam merely to anger\n     and hurt the Appellant’s family by letting them know that she was marrying\n     someone better than the Appellant. The mother categorically denied that a\n     marriage had been entered into between her and Lathiff. In July 2010, she\n     did go on a one-day shopping trip to Batam with her brother and Lathiff.\n     Lathiff’s wife was supposed to join them but could not because of work\n     commitments. Lathiff’s testimony 49     Lathiff, who had been\n     transferred to other duties because of the theft of cough syrup\n     investigation, testified that after he had met C1 and the mother on\n     29 April 2009, he interviewed C1 for about an hour and spoke to the mother\n     separately. His role was to ascertain whether the allegations of rape were\n     made out or not. C1 was crying and could hardly speak. After she had calmed\n     down, she narrated her story to Lathiff who then informed the SSCB. When\n     the officers from the SSCB arrived later that evening, they took over the\n     investigations and Lathiff was not involved in the case from then on. It\n     was only some two months later that he had decided to call the mother to\n     befriend her. He claimed that they did not know each other before 29 April\n     2009. He agreed that he had been to the flat but the children were home on\n     those occasions. He merely counselled them and told them to be obedient.\n     His contact with the mother and the children was on a personal basis and\n     had nothing to do with the investigations in this case. He could not recall\n     whether he had given the mother a lift in a police patrol car. On one such\n     visit to the flat, he had met the Appellant’s sister and her husband. The\n     mother told Lathiff that she had informed the Appellant’s sister and her\n     husband about their supposed wedding as a ploy to hurt the Appellant’s\n     family. He too denied that a marriage had been entered into between him and\n     the mother. C2’s testimony 50     C2’s testimony\n     covered three separate episodes which are summarised as\n      follows:[note: 13] (a)     The first\n      episode (“the first episode”) was in 2006 when C2 was about 9 years old.\n      The Appellant went into the bedroom and told her and C3 to go outside. C1\n      was asleep and the mother was not home. C2 was told to close the bedroom\n      door. C2 did so but felt uneasy. She waited in the living room and did not\n      dare to open the bedroom door as she was afraid of the Appellant. He\n      emerged from the bedroom about half an hour later. When C2 entered the\n      bedroom, C1 was seated on the bed watching television. Sometime after that\n      day, C2 asked C1 what was going on in the room that day but received no\n      answer from her. (b)     The second episode (“the second episode”) happened at\n      night in 2006, when the three children were sleeping in the bedroom. C2\n      was awakened by some movement on the bed. She saw the Appellant on top of\n      C1. C2 turned away towards C3 as she was afraid of the Appellant. He was\n      not wearing any shirt but C2 could not see if his shorts were on. The\n      mother was out working that night. Subsequently, the Appellant left the\n      bedroom. C2 did not ask C1, nor did she tell anyone about this\n      incident. (c)     The third episode (“the third episode”) happened one\n      afternoon in 2008. C1 told C2 that, with regard to the first episode when\n      C2 was asked to leave the bedroom, the Appellant had touched C1’s vagina\n      and her body. C2 was shocked to hear this. Both of them cried. C2 told C1\n      she hated the Appellant for this and would treat him as an uncle and not\n      as their father. C1 told her that the mother did not know about all this\n      and that she would tell her when the time was right. It was C2’s testimony\n      that this took place at their home.",
        "The Appellant’s case at the trial\n    below": "The Appellant’s version of events at the\n    trial below 51     The Appellant’s\n     defence to the charges consisted in a complete denial that any sexual\n     contact had taken place. 52     When asked by the\n     Prosecution why he had not challenged C1’s allegations during the first\n     tranche of the trial despite the court’s guidance, he said that he did not\n     know how to challenge her evidence. He explained that when he told the\n     psychiatrist that he might plead guilty in order not to get C1 into trouble\n     (see above at[43]), he meant that his\n     daughter had made a false report against him and he might choose to admit\n     guilt rather than have her prosecuted for making a false report. He was\n     “willing to take over her punishment”.[note: 14]It was\n     not an expression of remorse over what he had allegedly done to her. He was\n     sad when he heard C1’s testimony in court, wondering why she was making\n     such allegations and who might be behind them. 53     The Appellant,\n     through defence counsel, also alleged that the mother and Lathiff were in a\n     romantic relationship and that they had colluded to bring false allegations\n     against him. To support this argument, he referred to the testimony of his\n     sister, his sister’s husband and his father. The sister’s testimony 54     In her\n     examination-in-chief, the Appellant’s sister (“the sister”) testified that\n     the mother previously had a “close” relationship with her and considered\n     the mother her “own sister”.[note: 15]The\n     sister used to send her children to the mother’s flat from 2006 to May\n      2010.[note: 16]This stopped soon\n     after the sister realised that the general atmosphere in the flat had\n     changed. From April to June 2009, the sister had been told that the\n     Appellant was out working whenever she sent her children to the mother’s\n     flat for babysitting on the weekends.[note: 17]The mother finally told the sister about\n     the rape charges sometime in June 2009.[note: 18]The sister stated\n     that the mother apologised to her and had used the Malay word“rogol”(which means rape in English). The mother also\n     told the sister that she did not know how to express it to the Appellant’s\n     parents as she was afraid.[note: 19] 55     On 27 June\n      2009,[note: 20]the sister, the\n     Appellant’s brother and parents (along with C1, C2, C3 and the mother) met\n     at the Appellant’s parents’ flat (“the 27 June 2009 meeting”). The children\n     were sent to a room while the meeting was held in the living room. The\n     sister heard the mother say to the Appellant’s parents that if the\n     Appellant was willing to divorce her, she would withdraw the\n      case.[note: 21] 56     In a separate\n     incident in October 2009, the mother told the sister that she had first met\n     Lathiff when she reported the loss of her Identity Card (“IC”) to the\n     police. When asked when this took place, the sister replied that the mother\n     “did not say”.[note: 22]The mother also\n     shared that Lathiff was a married man who lived with his four children and\n     wife. The mother asked the sister for her advice on whether she should\n     become Lathiff’s second wife[note: 23]and asked if the sister’s husband could\n     speak to Lathiff about the prospect of the mother and him getting married\n     in Batam. Shortly after, the sister’s husband made arrangements for the\n     marriage in Batam to take place on 25 December 2009.[note: 24]Subsequently, though, the mother\n     telephoned the sister to inform her that the marriage was cancelled because\n     Lathiff and the mother had a “misunderstanding.”[note: 25] 57     In March 2010, the\n     sister and her husband met Lathiff, for the first and only time at the\n     mother’s flat. C1 and C3 were also present.[note: 26]As Lathiff, the mother, the sister and her\n     husband were all leaving the flat at the same time, the sister and her\n     husband offered the mother a lift in their car. The mother declined, saying\n     that Lathiff had brought his police car. The sister later saw the mother\n     being driven by Lathiff in his police car.[note: 27]The sister testified that the mother, C1,\n     C2 and C3 had a close relationship with Latiff. They conversed over the\n     telephone and C1 would sometimes ask Lathiff to buy chocolate while C2\n     would ask for ice-cream. C2 and C3 addressed Lathiff asBaba.The sister knew that the Appellant’s children spoke to\n     Lathiff over the phone because she had overheard one such telephone\n     conversation while she was staying over at the flat.[note: 28] 58     Sometime in May 2010,\n     the mother informed the sister that Lathiff and she had gone through with\n     the Batam marriage on 3 May 2010 with the help of the mother’s\n      brother.[note: 29]The sister asked the\n     mother whether she had obtained the consent of Lathiff’s first wife. The\n     mother said that the first wife had not given her consent.[note: 30]The sister was shown the wedding ring,\n     photograph and marriage certificate which had been issued in Batam. The\n     mother also told the sister that she had received her divorce certificate\n     in March 2010.[note: 31] 59     The Prosecution began\n     its cross-examination by expressly stating that it was not accepting these\n     aspects of the sister’s testimony:[note: 32] The prosecution is not, okay, accepting what you are telling the\n      Court to be the case, you know, aboutyour interactions\n       with your sister-in-law, about Lathiff and all, okay.But I’m\n      proceeding, all right, with my questions and assuming what you are telling\n      the Court is true, okay? [emphasis added] 60     Nonetheless, the\n     Prosecution failed to specifically challenge the precise allegations in the\n     sister’s evidence on her observations of the interactions between the\n     mother, her children and Lathiff. At this juncture, we pause to note\n     parenthetically that the sister clarified during cross-examination that at\n     no time did C1 or the mother state that the allegations against the\n     Appellant were false. 61     The Judge, however,\n     did not adequately evaluate this evidence contextually (see below at[81]). Pertinently, the further\n     evidence that has surfaced in the course of this appeal confirms the\n     accuracy of the sister’s testimony on some of these points. The sister’s husband’s testimony 62     The sister’s\n     husband’s testimony was that Lathiff and the mother had an established\n     romantic relationship. Sometime at the end of 2009, the sister told him\n     that the mother had wanted him to make preparations for her marriage to\n     Lathiff in Batam. He had agreed to do so and contacted his friends to make\n     the necessary preparations. Some months later, Lathiff and the mother told\n     him that they were not able to perform the marriage there. A few months\n     later, he heard from his wife that Lathiff and the mother had been married\n     in Batam.[note: 33] 63     In relation to the\n     March 2010 meeting at the mother’s flat (see above at[57]), he observed that “... Lathiff was sort of\n     a strong person, influential, and [C1] was afraid of him. And he appeared\n     to be very instructive [to C1]”.[note: 34]He also mentioned that Lathiff had referred\n     to himself asBabato the children. He\n     corroborated the sister’s account that he had, together with the sister,\n     seen Lathiff ferry the mother in his police car.[note: 35] 64     He had asked for\n     permission from the mother to speak to C1 about the allegation against the\n     Appellant but the mother had refused to allow him to talk to C1. Upon\n     cross-examination, the sister’s husband clarified that the mother and C1\n     had never said that the police report was false. The Appellant’s father’s testimony 65     The Appellant’s final\n     witness was his father. The Appellant’s father claimed that he first came\n     to know about the allegations of rape during the 27 June 2009 meeting at\n     his flat (see above at[55]). At the\n     meeting, the mother wanted to tell those present why the Appellant had been\n     arrested. The Appellant’s father was not allowed to ask her questions but\n     was only permitted to listen to what she had to say. The mother said that\n     her elder brother had taken both the mother and C1 to make the police\n      report.[note: 36]The mother had a copy of the\n     Appellant’s birth certificate and, with that, she had access to the\n     Appellant in prison. The mother also stated that, if the Appellant divorced\n     her, she would withdraw all the charges against him.[note: 37]The Appellant’s father asked the mother\n     whether it was true that the Appellant had raped C1. The mother kept silent\n     and told the Appellant’s father that he could not ask C1 about this because\n     “[b]eing the mother, she knew what it’s all about.”[note: 38] 66     The Appellant’s\n     father testified that, he found the mother to be “very aggressive” against\n     and “cruel” to the Appellant during their marriage. The mother would come\n     to see the Appellant’s father every month for financial help as the\n     Appellant was unemployed. The Appellant’s mother would give between $30 and\n     $50 whereas the Appellant’s father would not give her any money as he was\n     not on good terms with the mother and did not like to see her.[note: 39] 67     The Appellant’s\n     father also testified that even before the Appellant’s arrest, he would\n     only be able to talk to C1 for about 10 minutes before the mother would\n     take her away. 68     During\n      cross-examination,[note: 40]the Appellant’s\n     father stated that the mother had told him during the 27 June 2009 meeting\n     that she wanted to send the Appellant to prison.[note: 41]The Prosecution noted that the\n     Appellant’s father did not mention this during his examination in-chief and\n     neither had the mother claimed to have made such a statement. Nevertheless,\n     the Appellant’s father conceded that the mother or C1 did not at any time\n     say that the police report was false.",
        "The decision below": "69     The Judge’s detailed\n     reasons are set out in his GD (at [60]–[73]). To begin\n     with, the Judge was mindful that the allegations in this case were based\n     solely on the testimony of the Appellant. He observed (see the GD at\n      [60]) that: … [With] allegations of this nature, the crucial evidence often comes\n      from the alleged victim only and the court must be aware of the dangers of\n      convicting solely on that testimony, bearing in mind the ease with which\n      allegations of sexual assault may be fabricated and the concomitant\n      difficulty of rebutting such allegations (see the Court of Appeal’s\n      decision inPP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed\n       Mallik[2008] 1 SLR 601).",
        "C1’s testimony": "70     The Judge then\n     proceeded to give his evaluation of the demeanour and testimony of C1 (see\n     the GD at [62]–[64]). In particular, he noted (see the GD\n     at [62]) that: C1 appeared to me to be a forthright person, not\n       given to exaggerations or embellishments.She spoke simply and\n      did not appear to have been coached or “tutored” (the word used by defence\n      counsel in reference to Lathiff) in her evidence at all, whether during\n      the first or the resumed hearing. I was satisfied that she understood the\n      gravity of what she was saying in court about her father and knew the\n      importance of telling the truth. Allowance must obviously be given for the\n      fact that some of the alleged incidents occurred many years ago when she\n      was much younger. It would therefore not be possible to recall with\n      precision every detail of each occurrence. [emphasis added] The Judge went on to state (see the GD at [64]) that C1’s account of the events on 29 April 2009: … [w]as particularly clear and cogent, probably due to the fact that\n      it was the most recent incident involving the Appellant and she was more\n      mature by then. It was also the trigger event that led to the police\n      report. 71     However, the Judge\n     identified two concerns regarding C1’s testimony. The first related to the\n     two diaries that C1 alleged she kept but were somehow lost around 2007 or\n     2008 (see above at[28]). Defence\n     counsel argued that these diaries did not exist because the mother could\n     not have discarded them without so much as browsing through them. The Judge\n     did not think C1 was lying about the loss of the diaries and suggested that\n     perhaps the mother was careless in disposing of them without much thought.\n     However, as both diaries were missing, the Judge did not place any weight\n     on C1’s evidence that the alleged sexual assaults were detailed by her in\n     one of them (see the GD at [69]). 72     The second and much\n     more important concern related to the HSA statement regarding the ongoing\n     police investigation into the mother’s and Lathiff’s involvement in the\n     theft of cough syrup investigation (see above at[40]–[42]). The Judge’s\n     findings on this issue (see the GD at [70]–[72]) are highly\n     pertinent to our later discussion on the possibility of collusion as well\n     as C1’s credibility and we therefore reproduce it, as follows: ... This was the only time in C1’s testimony in court that she paused\n      hard and long before answering any questions, including those posed by the\n      court. Despite her denials about the accuracy of the said statement\n      regarding how she addressed Lathiff, the prosecution has accepted that she\n      did give the answers as recorded and that she did refer to Lathiff in more\n      recent times as “Baba”or father. … A quick perusal of the questions and answers from question 8\n      onwards [of the HSA statement] would show that the answers purportedly\n      made by herwere clearly detrimental to her mother in\n       the investigations regarding the cough syrup. I need not rule\n      on the voluntariness or the accuracy of this statement in this trial in\n      view of the position taken by the prosecution regarding its own witness’\n      previous statement.I highlighted the rest of the\n       contents of this statement merely to explain why I believed C1 was not\n       willing to acknowledge her own statement. By this time, C1\n      obviously realized that if her mother were to get into any trouble with\n      the law, she and her siblings would be left to fend for themselves. She\n      was thus extremely reluctant to accept the statement as having been made\n      by her. I reconsidered her veracity in the light of this\n       new development and concluded that while she was not entirely forthright\n       on this score, she was completely truthful in her testimony regarding the\n       charges. As explained above, it was perfectly understandable\n      why she sought to disavow the statement. This of course attracted the\n      criticism that she was capable of telling an untruth where it suited her\n      purposes.Nevertheless, bearing in mind the serious\n       charges that the Appellant faced and the burden on the prosecution to\n       prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, I still held the firm belief that\n       C1 was telling the truth about the sexual assaults. This was so even if\n       the mother and Lathiff were not completely upfront about their\n       relationship.... [emphasis added]",
        "Collusion": "73     The Judge also\n     proffered a number of reasons for rejecting the case by the defence that C1\n     had colluded with her mother, and possibly Lathiff, to bring a false\n     complaint against the Appellant. 74     First, it was not as\n     if C1 had returned to the flat on 29 April 2009 in order to set a trap for\n     the Appellant. After all, as the Appellant testified, C1 was also back at\n     the flat on the two days immediately before that date and nothing happened\n     (see the GD at [64]). 75     Secondly, C1’s\n     genuine distress after the confrontation with the Appellant in the flat was\n     also noted by the police officers who saw her that day (see the GD at\n      [64]). 76     Thirdly, although the\n     prosecution accepted that C1 did refer to Lathiff in more recent times as\n      “Baba”, her “extreme reluctance” to\n     acknowledge this at trial could be explained by the fact that “if her\n     mother were to get into any trouble with the law [over the HSA\n     investigation], she and her siblings would be left to fend for themselves”\n     (see the GD at [71]). 77     Fourthly, even if the\n     mother and Lathiff were not completely upfront about their relationship,\n     the Judge accepted that any relationship between them developed only a\n     couple of months or so after the police report had been made by C1 (see the\n     GD at [72]). 78     Fifthly, the Judge\n     did not detect any hint that Lathiff, despite being the apparent father\n     figure to the Appellant’s children, had sought in any way to influence C1\n     or C2 in their testimony in court (see the GD at [72]).",
        "The Appellant’s cross-examination of\n    C1": "79     The Judge appeared to\n     place considerable weight on the fact that the Appellant, who at the time\n     was appearing in-person, was unable to put any questions to C1 about the\n     alleged sexual assaults. The Judge observed (at [65]) that: The accused’s inability to put any questions to C1 about the alleged\n      sexual assaults during the first hearing was intriguing. He was not highly\n      educated but was certainly no moron. When invited by the court to\n      challenge C1’s testimony and to suggest to her that perhaps she was lying\n      about all or some of the allegations in the charges, he chose not to do so\n      or to ask her any questions regarding the crucial matters. 80     Accordingly, the\n     Judge agreed with the Prosecution that the Appellant’s subsequent evidence,\n     which emerged after he was represented by counsel, about all the possible\n     reasons why C1 could be fabricating evidence against him “invited\n     scepticism” (see the GD at [65]). 81     It should be noted\n     that the Judge did not make any reference to, or findings on, the veracity\n     of the Appellant’s testimony or the witnesses that were called by the\n     defence.",
        "Corroborative evidence": "82     The Judge also found\n     that there were two pieces of corroborative evidence. 83     The first was C2’s\n     testimony that C1 had confided in C2 about the sexual assaults by the\n     Appellant. At [67] of the GD, the\n     Judge noted that: Corroborative evidence may be found in C2’s\n       testimony.C1 had confided in C2 about the sexual assaults by\n      the Appellant and that caused C2 to have such poor regard for their father\n      that he was downgraded to being an uncle in her eyes. No reason has been\n      proffered by the Appellant why C2 would also turn against him unjustly.\n      She certainly did not appear to have been manipulated by anyone in her\n      evidence despite her age. [emphasis added] 84     The second was the\n     medical evidence. At [68] of the\n     GD, the Judge noted as follows: Corroborative evidence may also be found in the medical evidence.\n      What C1 told the doctors was by and large consistent with her evidence in\n      court. Naturally, while the hymenal tears indicated previous sexual\n      penetration of the vagina, they did not point to the Appellant being the\n      perpetrator.",
        "Sentence": "85     On these grounds, the\n     Judge found the Appellant guilty of the five proceeded charges and\n     sentenced the Appellant to 29 years’ imprisonment and to a maximum of\n     24 strokes of the cane (see above at[10]–[11]).",
        "The appeal": "86     The Appellant in his\n     Notice of Appeal dated 2 December 2010 stated that he wished to appeal\n     against his sentence and conviction. On 8 February 2011, the Appellant\n     confirmed that he would not be engaging counsel to act for his appeal. Soon\n     after, on 2 March 2011, the Appellant’s filed his Petition of Appeal, which\n     at paragraph 2 and 3 states as follows: 2.Your Petitioner is dissatisfied with the said\n        judgment on the groundsthe sentence is\n        manifestly excessive and unreasonable 3.Your Petitioner prays that such Judgment or sentence may be\n        reversed annulled or that such order made thereon as Justice may\n        require. [emphasis in italics and bold in original]",
        "The first Court of Appeal hearing (“the first\n    CA hearing”) on 29 July 2011": "87     Two preliminary\n     issues took centre stage at the first hearing before this court on 29 July\n     2011. 88     First, was the issue\n     of whether the Appellant was appealing against only his sentence or his\n     conviction as well. This confusion arose from the different grounds of\n     appeal stated in the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal and subsequent Petition\n     of Appeal (see above at[86]).\n     Clarifications were thus sought from the Appellant who confirmed at the\n     hearing that he wished to appeal against his sentenceandconviction. The Prosecution did not object. Accordingly,\n     the appeal proceeded on that basis. 89     Secondly, there were\n     a number of issues which arose from a perusal of theOfficial Transcriptand exhibits in the proceedings in the\n     court below which we felt the Prosecution ought to address this court on.\n     Accordingly, we ordered that the appeal be adjourned for: (a)Pro bonocounsel to be appointed to assist the\n      Appellant; and (b)     The Prosecution to reply to this court’s request for\n      further information (“the CA’s first round of requests”) on: (i)The mother’s, Lathiff’s and C1’s phone\n        recordsin order to verify their testimony on when the couple\n       first met and the sequence of events on 29 April 2009 (“the phone\n       records”); (ii)The police report that the mother allegedly\n        lodged for the loss of her ICin order to verify the sister’s\n       testimony that Lathiff and the mother had met on that occasion (“the loss\n       of IC police report”); (iii)The relevant pages of Lathiff and the mother’s\n        passports for all travels they undertook in 2009 and 2010to\n       determine whether the couple had indeed travelled to Batam together and\n       if they had undertaken other travels together prior to 29 April 2009\n       (“the passport pages”); (iv)C1’s school reportto determine the\n       extent of C1’s “disciplinary problems” that caused the mother to decline\n       Dr Lim’s request for the said report (“C1’s school report”);\n      and (v)C1’s full HSA statementto ascertain\n       the context of the answers which C1 had later disavowed at trial and\n       whether the statement contained further relevant information (“C1’s HSA\n       statement”). We also ordered that a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) be held in a\n     month’s time, for the purpose of allowing the court to receive updates on\n     the CA’s first round of requests.",
        "The events between the first and second CA\n    hearing": "The first PTC 90     On 23 August 2011,\n     the Prosecution furnished the following information to this court: (a)     The ICA travel\n      records of Lathiff, the mother and her brother; (b)     C1’s school report;\n      and (c)     C1’s full statement in relation to the HSA investigation (“C1’s HSA\n      statement”). 91     The Prosecution also\n     informed this court that the mother had not lodged a police report for the\n     loss of her IC and it would need more time for the service providers to\n     furnish the phone records. 92     The ICA travel\n     records revealed that Lathiff and the mother had made six overseas trips\n     together in 2010. On one of these occasions, they were also accompanied by\n     the mother’s brother. 93     However, the\n     production of the ICA records was not in strict compliance with our request\n     for all the relevant pages in Lathiff and the mother’s passports for all\n     travels they undertook in 2009 and 2010 (see above at [89(b)(iii)]). This\n     was not an insignificant difference since the ICA travel records only\n     highlighted the fact that the couple had gone on joint overseas trips\n     without stating the precise destinations where they had travelled\n     to. 94     C1’s school report\n     dated 17 August 2011 raised serious concerns about the credibility of her\n     trial testimony. The school report was authored by the school’s counsellor\n     and discipline co-ordinator (“the school counsellor”). In the report, the\n     school counsellor noted that C1 was always “a very quiet and well-behaved\n     girl” who “adhered to school rules and did the her [sic] school work.”[note: 42]However, the school counsellor went on to\n     state that: It was when a group of Malay boys from the Technical stream of the\n      same level was heard boosting [sic] oftheirsexual endeavors with her[ie, C1]that a few issues came\n      to light. Upon asking [C1]she admitted that she was at the\n       park next to may flower primary and dida\n       few adult acts – willingly. The mother was informed and was asked to do the needful. On the\n      school side she was counselled and daily monitoring was rendered.\n      Arrangements were even made by the DM to give her different recess time,\n      so as not to come in contact with the boys or his friends. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 95     Accordingly, the\n     school report raised even more questions. Firstly, it did not state exactly\n     when these “sexual endeavours” took place, although one can only infer that\n     they must have happened sometime between January 2005 and October 2009,\n     when C1 was in secondary school. 96     Additionally, the\n     school report did not detail the precise nature of the “adult acts” or\n     “sexual endeavours” that C1 had engaged in. This is significant in light\n     C1’s evidence that she never had voluntary sexual intercourse.[note: 43] 97     The final item that\n     was disclosed by Prosecution at the first PTC was C1’s HSA statement. In\n     addition to the fragments of the HSA statement that could be read off theOfficial Transcript(see above at[40]), the full statement also revealed that the\n     mother had told C1 sometime in April 2010 that if the mother was ever\n     caught for stealing cough syrup,Baba(Lathiff) would not admit to being the mastermind. The mother was also\n     afraid to stop stealing because she was afraid thatBabawould scold her.[note: 44] The CA’s second round of requests from the\n    Prosecution 98     In light of these new\n     facts emerging, the Prosecution was directed by this court (on 25 August\n     2011) to provide details with regard to: (a)     The travel\n      destinations of Lathiff, the mother and her brother for the six\n      overlapping travel dates; and (b)     The precise nature of the “sexual\n      endeavours” and “adult acts” disclosed in the school\n    report. 99     The Prosecution were\n     also invited to produce: (a)     All the\n      statements made by C1, the mother and Lathiff to the police;\n     and (b)     All the statements made by the Appellant to the\n     police. The Prosecution’s reply 100    By a letter dated\n     31 August 2011, the Prosecution updated this court, as follows: (a)     It would\n      obtain the relevant travel records; (b)     The information as to the “adults\n      acts” “is not available from those who prepared the\n     report”; (c)     C1, the mother and Lathiff’s statements recorded by the\n      police and HSA in relation to the theft of cough syrup investigation would\n      be disclosed to Appellant’s counsel under the rules for disclosure set out\n      inMuhammad bin Kadar and another v Public\n       Prosecutor[2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“Muhammad bin\n       Kadar”); (d)     The statements made by C1, the mother\n      and Lathiff to the police in relation to the rape investigation could not\n      be disclosed without a prior request from Appellant’s counsel under\n      section 122(2) of the CPC (Cap 68). Furthermore, the Prosecution were not\n      obliged to disclose these statements according to theMuhammad bin Kadarrules of disclosure; (e)     Barring any\n      objections from the Appellant, the Appellant’s police statements would be\n      made available to this court; and (f)     The Prosecution’s position was that\n      if this court considered the conviction unsafepurely\n       on the basis that the new information was not adequately explored at the\n       trial below, then the proper course would be to set aside the\n      conviction and remit the matter to the Judge for further evidence to be\n      led. 101    In response to the\n     Prosecution’s s 122(2) CPC (Cap 68) objection (see above, at [100(d)]), the\n     Appellant, on 17 January 2012, made a formal request to the Prosecution for\n     all the police statements of C1, the mother and Lathiff recorded in\n     relation to the rape investigation to be produced to this\n    Court. The second and third PTC 102    Subsequently, two\n     more PTCs were held. The second PTC on 21 September 2011 was an uneventful\n     affair with the Prosecution updating the court that the phone and travel\n     records were not available yet. 103    At the third PTC on\n     28 October 2011, the Prosecution updated the court that: (a)     The phone\n      records received thus far from the service providers was of no use as it\n      related to pre-paid SIM cards. As such, more time was required to uncover\n      the phone records for the remaining phone lines; and (b)     The mother’s\n      passport revealed that five of the six trips with Lathiff were to Malaysia\n      while one trip on 12 July 2010 was to Batam. Lathiff’s passport was\n      reported lost in September 2010 and was unavailable for verification. The\n      couple’s last overlapping trip on 12 October 2010 was captured in his\n      replacement passport. This was to Malaysia. 104    The Appellant’s\n     counsel updated the court that they: (a)     Intended to\n      interview the school counsellor in the presence of the\n     police; (b)     Wished to apply to refer to the statements made by C1,\n      the mother and Lathiff to the police in relation to the rape charges under\n      s 122(2) CPC (Cap 68); (c)     Had been instructed that the\n      Appellant had no objections to having his police statements produced to\n      this court; and (d)     Would be requesting from the Prosecution: (i) the\n      mother’s CPF/employment records; (ii) the status of proceedings in\n      relation to the theft of cough syrup investigation; and (iii) the police\n      report relating to C1’s running away from home in 2006. A formal request\n      to this effect was made by letter to the Prosecution on 4 November\n      2011. The fourth PTC 105    At the fourth PTC\n     on 16 January 2012, the Prosecution updated the court that: (a)     The only\n      available phone records for the mother and Lathiff were from 1 September\n      2009 to 31 December 2010. All phone records prior to 1 September 2009 had\n      been purged from the service provider’s records; (b)     All the five trips\n      to Malaysia made by the mother and Lathiff were through the Woodlands\n      Checkpoint; and (c)     The school counsellor was able to recall the details of\n      the “adult acts” and “sexual endeavours” even though the school records\n      had been purged. This would be set out in a conditioned statement to be\n      exhibited to the court. 106    Meanwhile, the\n     Appellant’s counsel updated the court that theywould\n      notbe pursuing their requests which were set out in their\n     letter to the Prosecution dated 4 November 2011 (see above at\n     [104(d)]). Summary of the status of the CA’s requests\n    before the second CA hearing 107    To summarise, at\n     the commencement of the second CA hearing on 8 February 2012, the status of\n     all the requests to the Prosecution was as follows: (a)The phone recordsof the mother and Lathiff prior to\n      1 September 2009 had been purged. However, more time was required to\n      provide the phone records for the mother’s last mobile phone number and\n      her mother’s home at Yishun; (b)The loss of IC\n       report, according to the Prosecution, does not\n     exist; (c)The mother’s passport\n       pagesreveal that five of the six trips she took with Lathiff\n      were to Malaysia (viathe Woodlands\n      checkpoint) while one trip on 12 July 2010 was to\n     Batam; (d)Lathiff’s passportwas\n      reported lost in September 2010 and was unavailable for verification.\n      However, the couple’s last joint trip on 12 October 2010 is captured in\n      his replacement passport. This was to Malaysia; (e)C1’s school reportand the school counsellor’s conditioned\n      statement dated 19 January 2012 were submitted; (f)C1’s full HSA statementin relation to the HSA investigation\n      was submitted; (g)The mother, Lathiff and C1’s police\n       statements in relation to the theft of cough syrup\n       investigationwere submitted; (h)The\n       mother, Lathiff and C1’s police statements in relation to the rape\n       investigationwould be submitted pending the Appellant’s\n      formal request under s 122(2) CPC (Cap 68); and (i)     The Appellant’s\n      police statements were submitted.",
        "Parties’ submissions at the second hearing\n    before the Court of Appeal (“the second CA hearing”) on 8 Feb 2012": "108    At the second CA\n     hearing, the Appellant’s counsel submitted that:[note: 45] (a)     Even without\n      taking into account the fundamental problems caused by the additional new\n      materials, the conviction in this case is totally unwarranted. Given the\n      suspect credibility of C1, the material inconsistencies in her evidence\n      and various aspects of her evidence which were simply inherently\n      incredible, the Prosecution’s case fell woefully short of proof beyond a\n      reasonable doubt. Quite apart from that, independent corroborative\n      evidence was totally absent; (b)     The new material, should this court\n      be inclined to consider it, compounds the Prosecution’s difficulties even\n      further; (c)     Accordingly, the conviction is plainly unsafe and ought\n      to be quashed, without the need to remit this matter back to trial to be\n      reconsidered in light of the fresh evidence; and (d)     In the\n      alternative, a retrial should be ordered before a new\n    judge. 109    In response, the\n     Prosecution argued that:[note: 46] (a)     Based on the\n      new material there is no basis to conclude that the finding of guilt has\n      been arrived at against the weight of the evidence or is plainly wrong;\n      and (b)     However, if this court considers that the conviction is unsafe on\n      the basis that the matters which the court seeks to verify were not\n      adequately explored in the trial below, then the proper course is for this\n      court to remit the matter to the Judge for further evidence to be\n      led.",
        "Issues before this court": "110    The questions to be\n     resolved in the appeal are as follows: (a)     Was C1’s\n      testimony “unusually convincing”? (b)     Was there any corroborative evidence,\n      which would make up for any deficiencies in C1’s\n     testimony? (c)     Did the Prosecution at the trial below prove beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that the complaint was not the result of collusion\n      between the mother, C1 and Lathiff? (d)     If the conviction is unsafe, should a\n      retrial before a new judge, remittance on an issue before the Judge or an\n      acquittal be ordered?",
        "Issue 1: Was C1’s testimony “unusually\n    convincing”?": "",
        "The law": "210    In the House of\n     Lords decision ofRegina v H[1995] 2 AC 596\n      (“R v H”), Lord Mustill (at 616)\n     distinguished between two forms of “collusion”: ... the word ‘collusion’ ... may denote a wicked conspiracy in which\n      the complainants put their heads together to tell lies about the defendant\n      ... [and is also] wide enough to embrace any communications between the\n      witnesses, even without malign intent, which may lead to the transfer of\n      recollections between them, and hence to an unconscious elision of the\n      differences between the stories which each would independently have told\n      ... the two situations may be labelled‘conspiracy’and ‘innocent infection’... ‘conspiracy’ [is] the deliberate and\n       malicious fabrication of untrue stories whose details chime because that\n       is what they are designed to do ... such cases ... must surely be a small\n       minority by comparison with those where the witness statements show no\n       more than the opportunity (although not necessarily the reality) of\n       ‘innocent infection’.[emphasis added in italics and bold\n      italics] 211    Where the\n     allegation is one ofinnocent infection, as\n     opposed to conspiracy or collusion, and there is some evidence suggesting\n     the opportunity for contamination arising, for example, from the transfer\n     of recollections between witnesses leading to an unconscious elision of the\n     differences between their accounts, the court must always be alive to that\n     possibility even if it considers the possibility to be slight. In such\n     instances, the accused is objecting to the weight and not the relevance of\n     the prosecution witness’s testimony. To put it another way, the accused is\n     not challenging the evidence as an outright lie, but is saying that the\n     degree of veracity of the evidence and the strength of recollection of the\n     witness must be subject to scrutiny (seeLee Kwang\n      Pengat [95]). 212    When the allegation\n     is one ofcollusionproperly so called, the\n     burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there\n     was in fact no collusion to make a false complaint because motive and\n     conduct are “legally distinct concepts which ought not to be conflated”\n     (seeXPat [21]). 213    InXP, charges of outrage of modesty were brought against\n     a teacher-in-charge of a water polo team by seven of his students under\n     s 354 of the PC. Rajah JA found (at [23]–[26]) that the\n     teacher’s allegations of collusion, which were based on the students’ close\n     friendship and their obvious resentment towards him for being a harsh,\n     interfering disciplinarian who was strict with training and took upon\n     himself the task of overseeing their studies, revealed a“plausible”motive (seeXPat\n      [24]). Accordingly, the evidential\n     burden of proof should have shifted to the Prosecution to prove beyond a\n     reasonable doubt that there was in fact no collusion. However, the trial\n     judge inXPhad erred in failing to\n     satisfactorily explain the absence of collusion. As Rajah JA noted (at\n      [25]): … [The trial judge] took a broad-brush approach without condescending\n      into the very specific charges levelled against the boys by the appellant.\n      This lack of reasoning does seem to subtly suggest that she could have\n      unconsciously erred in placing the burden of proof of collusion on the\n      Defence, contrary to the stated rule.... 214    In contrast, inLee Kwang Peng, where three students brought\n     nine charges against their taekwondo instructor for outrage of modesty\n     under s 354 of the PC, Yong CJ held (at [104]) that: Counsel for the appellant both in this appeal and in the lower court\n      also did not elaborate on how the second complainant could have persuaded\n      the first and third complainant to bring false charges, nor did the\n      appellant make any suggestions as to why the latter two boys might have\n      been motivated to undertake this ordeal. This fact alone — the absence of\n      a unifying motive amongst the complainants — eliminated any doubts that\n      may have arisen out of the second complainant’s evidence and the evidence\n      adduced by the appellant’s witnesses in contradiction of it. Accordingly, Yong CJ found that there had been no collusion on the\n     part of the complainants since they did not have a “unifying\n     motive.” 215    It is\n     uncontroversial thatthe defencehasfirstto establish that the complainant has\n     amotiveto falsely implicate the accused. As\n     Yong CJ explained in the Singapore High Court decision ofGoh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor[2003] 4 SLR(R) 374\n     at [33]: [W]here the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to\n      falsely implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to\n      disprove that motive.This does not mean that the\n       Appellant merely needs to allege that the complainant has a motive to\n       falsely implicate him.Instead, the\n       Appellant must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a\n       reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.Only then would\n      the burden of proof shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no\n      such motive. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 216    We would agree with\n     the general thrust of the statement quoted in the preceding paragraph in so\n     far as the Prosecution ultimately bears the legal burden of disproving\n     beyond a reasonable doubt the fact of collusion. However, the statement\n     should not be interpreted as suggesting that the Prosecution bears the\n     legal burden to disprove the allegation of collusiononly afterthe accused has discharged his evidential burden by\n     proving a motive for collusion to a standard that is sufficient to create areasonable doubtin the Prosecution’s case.\n     This would admittedly set the standard of proof too high. It is preferable\n     to frame the accused’s evidential burden in terms of whether the\n     complainant had aplausiblemotive to collude\n     to bring false charges against him. Furthermore, the term“plausible”(seeXPat\n      [24] and [26]) should be preferred to “reasonable”in so far as it prevents the court from\n     conflating the separate, and admittedly irrelevant, question of whether\n     complainant’s motive to bring a fabricated complaint against the accused is“reasonable”in the sense of being legally\n     and/or morally justified.",
        "Application of law to the facts": "Remitting the new materials to the\n    Judge 299    The Prosecution\n     maintains that the new materials, particularly, the school report, school\n     counsellor’s statements, and C1, the mother and Lathiff’s police\n     statements, should be remitted tothe same trial judge,\n      ie, the Judge, for his consideration because:[note: 174] (a)     The Appellant\n      is relying on a large amount of new material that has only emerged on\n      appeal thereby denying the relevant Prosecution witnesses the opportunity\n      to respond to the new material. For instance, C1 ought to be given an\n      opportunity to respond to the school counsellor’s statement so as to\n      enable the Judge to determine the proper weight that should be attached to\n      it; and (b)     The Appellant has relied on a new point that was not\n      canvassed or pursued in the trial below,viz, the discrepancies in C1’s account of the frequency of the\n      alleged assaults. 300    Regarding the\n     Prosecution’s first submission,viz, the\n     Prosecution witnesses should be given an opportunity to respond to thenew material; remitting these issues to the\n     Judge would, in our view, be redundant and inappropriate. 301    It is redundant\n     because the relevant facts contained in the school report and school\n     counsellor’s statements can be clearly and objectively ascertained by this\n     court without the need for a retrial. In this respect, it bears reiterating\n     that the Appellant is only relying on these new materials for the very\n     limited purpose of undermining C1’s trial testimony that she was not\n     sexually active and that C1’s hymenal tears may not have been caused by the\n     Appellant (see above at[169]–[172]). 302    It is inappropriate\n     because remitting the matter would put the Judge in an invidious position\n     as the new materials, particularly the school report and school\n     counsellor’s statement, have the potential to unravel most of the Judge’s\n     favourable findings on C1’s testimony. Moreover, it might be prudent, for\n     the sake of completeness, to recall other witnesses other than C1 and the\n     school counsellor. For example, Dr Lim and Dr Pang may have to be recalled\n     to re-examine C1 in light of the newly disclosed school report. Thus, it is\n     self-evident that the issues that would be remitted back to the Judge are\n     not discrete – and limited – ones that, once decided, would enable the\n     Judge to automatically arrive at a final decision, having regard to the\n     findings already made at the original trial. On the contrary, all these\n     issues are inextricably connected not only amongst themselves but also with\n     the findings hitherto made by the Judge. Put simply, they are all of a\n     piece – and an integrated piece at that. In these circumstances, to expect\n     the Judge to disregard some of the findings he had made at the original\n     trial whilst retaining other findings which are not impacted by the issues\n     remitted to him, and then to make new findings on the issues remitted to\n     him and to arrive at a final decision once again, would be to place him in\n     an invidious (and, we dare say, impossible) position. We must express our\n     puzzlement that the Prosecution would suggest such a course of action – let\n     alone in the very strong terms they have advocated it. Indeed, in their\n     further written submissions on this particular issue, the Prosecution\n     argued that it would be “unprincipled and unjust” for the court not to\n     adopt this proposed course of action and to acquit the Appellant\n      instead.[note: 175]On the contrary, given our findings above,\n     it would be theprecise opposite. Given (as\n     we have explained above) that the Prosecution has fallen short of the mark\n     in its attempt to prove its case against the Appellant beyond a reasonable\n     doubteven basedon the evidence before the\n     Judge,notto acquit the Appellant would be\n     “unprincipled and unjust”. 303    Regarding the\n     Prosecution’s second submission,viz, that C1\n     should now be given the opportunity to explain the inconsistencies in her\n     various statements and her testimony in court as such opportunity wasnot available at trial, we find that any\n     failure to resolve this inconsistency at trial is attributable to the\n     Prosecution’s conduct of the trial below. The Prosecution at the trial\n     below led evidence from both Dr Pang and Dr Lim that C1 had told them that\n     the rapes had taken place four to five times a month. This was neither\n     challenged by the Prosecution during re-examination nor put to the two\n     doctors that their reports may have been influenced by the CID Report or\n     SOF which had been given to them prior to the interview. In this respect,\n     it is paradoxically the Prosecution, not the Appellant, which has relied on\n     a new point,viz, the innocent explanation\n     thesis, which was not canvassed or pursued in the trial below (see above at[139]–[146]). At the very least, both parties have been remiss in\n     this particular regard. 304    Further, C1’s\n     account to the doctors of thefrequency of the alleged\n      rapesconflicted glaringly with a number of C1’s earlier police\n     statements – a fact which only the Prosecution would (or ought reasonably\n     to) have been aware of, since these statements were not disclosed to the\n     Appellant either at the Preliminary Inquiry, the trial below, or during the\n     period leading up to the second CA hearing (see above at[130]–[146]). 305    Admittedly, defence\n     counsel below did not expressly draw C1’s attention to the inconsistent\n     account she had given to the doctors regarding the frequency of the rapes.\n     However, the Prosecution at the trial below were equally remiss in failing\n     to clarify this point with C1 during re-examination especially given the\n     marked inconsistency with Dr Lim and Dr Pang’s earlier testimonies. At any\n     rate, as Mr Singh persuasively put it: “it is difficult to comprehend what\n     reasonable explanation C1 could possibly give to explain away the vast\n     difference in the frequency in her different accounts of the alleged\n      rapes”.[note: 176] A retrial or acquittal? 306    We did, in the\n     first instance, consider whether there ought to be a retrial before another\n     trial judge instead of an acquittal. However, having carefully considered\n     all the arguments and evidence as set out above, it was clear to us that\n     the Prosecution at the trial below had failed to prove its case against the\n     Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, as it had failed to adduce sufficient\n     evidence to justify a conviction. Since this is a “category one case”, it\n     would be wholly unjust to the Appellant to order a retrial before another\n     trial judge (seeDennis Reidat 349H, cited\n     above at[276]and[296]). 307Even ifit can be argued that the Prosecution at the trial\n     below did not fail to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that\n     this is in fact a “category three case”, falling between the two extremes\n     enunciated above at[296], three\n     factors militate against the ordering of a retrial. 308    First, close to\n     three years have elapsed since the Appellant’s arrest on 29 April 2009. The\n     Appellant has been incarcerated during this entire period. Should the\n     Appellant be acquitted after a retrial, he would have been unjustifiably\n     detained for a prolonged period of time. This would be a grave injustice to\n     the Appellant. Moreover, the delay is not of the Appellant’s own doing. The\n     phone records were requested from the Prosecution during the CA’s first\n     round of requests on 29 July 2010. However, it was not until we pressed the\n     Prosecution for a conclusive response on their status at the second hearing\n     before this court that we were informed on 9 February 2012 that the\n     remaining phone records were unavailable. In these circumstances, the\n     consequences for any delays in the disposal of this appeal should not be\n     borne by the Appellant. 309    Secondly, the\n     Appellant has been – and will be –\n     irretrievably prejudiced in a retrial because crucial exculpatory evidence,\n     in the form of the pre-September 2009 phone records, is no longer\n     available. In response, the Prosecution submits that:[note: 177] It seems unprincipled and extremely prejudicial to the prosecution\n      for the appellant to now assert that he is prejudiced by the\n      non-availability of the call records whenhe did not\n       request for the records at the trial below to pursue the point he was\n       seeking to raise in his defence.[emphasis added] 310    With respect, this\n     is a flawed argument. The Appellant was under no obligation to request for\n     the phone records at the trial below. The law on collusion is well settled:\n     so long as the Appellant is able to raise a plausible motive for collusion\n     it is for the Prosecution to rebut this allegation beyond a reasonable\n     doubt. Accordingly, the onus was on the Prosecution at the trial itself to\n     adduce the phone records. 311    Thirdly, to order a\n     new trial would be to give the Prosecution a second chance to make good the\n     evidential deficiencies in its case. To name but a few examples, the\n     Prosecution could have, with reasonable diligence, located C1’s\n     ex-boyfriend and called him as a witness at the trial to confirm that he\n     was told by C1 about the alleged rapes (see above at[162]). He could have also confirmed that he\n     did not have an intimate relationship with C1. Similarly, given the wholly\n     inconsistent testimonies of Lathiff and the mother on certain material\n     issues, it is not too much of a stretch to postulate that they may tailor\n     their testimonies at the retrial in a manner that would be expedient to\n     them.",
        "Issue 2: Was there any corroborative\n    evidence?": "",
        "Issue 3: Did the Prosecution at the trial\n    below prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complaint was not the result of\n    collusion?": "",
        "The new material": "249    In the absence of\n     any clear evidence on the issue of collusion, this court therefore\n     requested fresh evidence. The new material that was disclosed by the\n     Prosecution before the second CA hearing (see above at[107]) also raises serious misgivings on making\n     a conclusive finding on the issue of collusion. C1’s full HSA statement 250    Of relevance to the\n     present case is C1’s HSA statement which reveals that: (a)     C1 believed\n      that the mother married Lathiff in Batam and that, at first, she called\n      the mother’s new husband “uncle” but subsequently called him “Baba”; and (b)     The mother had told C1 sometime in\n      April 2010 that if the mother was ever caught for stealing cough syrup,\n       “Baba” (Lathiff) would not admit to being\n      the mastermind. The mother was also afraid to stop stealing because she\n      was afraid thatBabawould scold\n       her.[note: 159] 251    The first piece of\n     information serves to corroborate Lathiff’s and the mother’s 6 September\n     2010 police statements in relation to the theft of cough syrup\n     investigation where the couple had admitted to have been married in Batam\n     (see below at[258]–[261]). Meanwhile, the second piece of\n     information casts doubts on the Judge’s finding (see the GD at [72]) that: [I] did not detect any hint that Lathiff, despite being the apparent\n      father figure to the Appellant’s children, had sought in any way to\n      influence C1 or C2 in their testimony in court. In light of the fact that the Judge had sight of thefullHSA statement, the question as to why Lathiff’s\n     alleged domineering influence, did not extend to him exerting an influence\n     over C1’s, C2’s and the mother’s testimony at trial in this case, ought to\n     have been closely explored. Moreover, the Judge ought not to have ignored\n     C1’s HSA statement given the Prosecution’s uncontested position that it had\n     been voluntarily made by C1. The phone records 252    Unfortunately,\n     because of the initial oversight in securing the relevant phone records\n     earlier, the phone records currently provided by the Prosecution are of\n     limited relevance. Lathiff’s only mobile line and one of the mother’s four\n     mobile lines only have call records dating back to 1 September 2009. All\n     records before that have been purged by the service provider. Further, two\n     of the mother’s other mobile phone lines are pre-paid SIM cards for which\n     call records are not available. Nevertheless, the available call records\n     reveal that Lathiff and the mother were in frequent contact from the\n     earliest date the call records started from (ie1 September 2009). 253    At the time of the\n     second hearing before this court, the call records for the mother’s final\n     mobile phone line were still pending and we were informed by the\n     Prosecution that this number had initially been overlooked. This was\n     surprising since this was, by the Prosecution’s own admission, precisely\n     the mobile phone line that the mother had given to the police when she\n     accompanied C1 to lodge the police report against the\n      Appellant.[note: 160]Therefore, this\n     was most likely the mobile phone line that Lathiff had initially contacted\n     the mother on. As a matter of logic, obtaining the records for this\n     particular mobile phone line should, in our view, have been a\n     priority. 254    Consequently, there\n     is no objective evidence to corroborate Lathiff and the mother’s testimony\n      that:[note: 161] (a)     They had\n      first met when the mother and C1 went to lodge the rape report on 29 April\n      2009; and (b)     Lathiff had only initiated communications with the\n      mother by calling her on her mobile phone in June\n    2009. 255    Not only does this\n     cast doubt on the Prosecution’s attempts to rebut the allegation of major\n     collusion beyond reasonable doubt, it also irretrievably prejudices the\n     Appellant’s ability to mount a defence should the issue be remitted before\n     the Judge or a retrial ordered, an issue which will be considered in\n     greater detail below (see Issue 4, at[269]–[309]below). Alleged police report for loss of the\n    mother’s IC 256    At the first PTC on\n     23 August 2011, the Prosecution updated the court that the mother had not\n     reported the loss of her IC to the police. In their further arguments for\n     the second CA hearing, they elaborated that the IO had performed a\n     screening for all police reports lodged by the mother and found no reports\n     relating to the loss of her IC.[note: 162]However,\n     this could equally mean that the mother had told the sister a lie (see\n     above at[56]). Lathiff and the mother’s passports for all\n    travels they undertook in 2009 and 2010 257    The travel records\n     reveal that Lathiff, the mother and her brother had travelled to Batam for\n     a day trip on 12 July 2010.[note: 163]This\n     corroborates Lathiff and the mother’s testimony that they had all visited\n     Batam together. However, thepurposeof the\n     12 July 2010 trip remains unanswered. Was it, as the mother testified, for\n      “sight-seeing”,[note: 164]or to get secretly\n    married? Lathiff and the mother’s police statements\n    recorded for the theft of cough syrup investigation 258    In this respect,\n     the new information from Lathiff and the mother’s police statements for the\n     theft of cough syrup investigations shed some light on the true purpose of\n     the Batam jaunt on 12 July 2010. 259    In Lathiff’s\n     statement recorded on 21 September 2010 at 2.51pm, he stated that their\n     marriage was solemnised in Batam on 12 July 2010. Similarly, the mother’s\n     statement recorded on 21 September 2010 at 1.00pm stated that:[note: 165] On12thJuly 2010, Mohammed Lathiff and I went to Sekupang,\n      Indonesiafor our wedding solemnisation. I\n      am aware that Mohammad Lathiff is legally married in Singapore. His wife\n      and 4 children are staying somewhere in Woodlands. We had planned to get\n      married somewhere in June 2010. [emphasis added] 260    This is echoed, in\n     the mother’s statement recorded on 21 September 2010 at 5.35pm:[note: 166] On 12 July 2010, Lathiff, my elder brother, Noorizan and I went to\n      Sekupang, Indonesia. Before we left for Sekupang, Lathiff and I had\n      already [sic]to get marriedthere since we\n      are not allowed to get married in Singapore. My elder brother was the\n      witness for the marriage. Since 12 July 2010, both Lathiff and I consider\n      ourselves as husband and wife. [emphasis added] 261    The mother repeated\n     this position in another statement she recorded later that same day at\n      6.45pm:[note: 167] Since my marriage with Mohammed Lathiff on 12 July\n       2010, I had decided to put a stop to my theft of the Dhasedyl\n      cough syrup because I know that it is a crimes [sic] and I also do not\n      want to Mohammed Lathiff to continue making mistake. [emphasis\n      added] 262    However, Lathiff’s\n     and the mother’s account of their relationship underwent a dramatic and\n     disturbingvolte facewhen they were recalled\n     by the police on 6 October 2010. The mother’s statement, recorded on\n     6 October 2010 at 10.31am, claimed that while she had gone to Sekupang (a\n     town in Batam) on 12 July 2010 with her brother and Lathiff, this was only\n     to“jalan jalan”and not solemnise their\n      wedding:[note: 168] ....Lathiff and I did not solemnise any wedding\n       in Indonesia. I wish to state that I had lied that Lathiff was my husband\n       because I was threatened by the investigation officer recording my\n       statement as he said that he would remand me in the lock-up if I did not\n       co-operate with him and that I would not be seeing my children that\n       day.As I know that Lathiff is an investigation officer from\n      Ang Mo Kio Police Station, I thought that if I used Lathiff’s name, I\n      would get sympathy from the police from Bedok Police Station. However, I\n      did not know what I did would get him into trouble. As such, I made a\n      story that Lathiff and I were married in Indonesia ... [emphasis\n      added] 263    Somewhat\n     coincidentally, Lathiff also retracted his earlier position. In his\n     statement, recorded at 1.20pm that same day, Lathiff claimed that the\n     mother and him were just “close friends” and they did not have their\n     marriage solemnised in Indonesia. Lathiff also explained that:[note: 169] I [Lathiff] said that I was the husband of [the mother] in my first\n      statement because we had an agreement between both of us to let me act as\n      a father to [the mother’s] three children. 264    Furthermore,\n     Lathiff claimed to have forgotten when he had gone to Indonesia with the\n     mother – a surprising turn given that he seemed to be able to recall the\n     date without much hesitation a month later during his testimony at the rape\n     trial on 3 November 2010.[note: 170] 265    It is significant\n     that both the mother and Lathiff admitted to their romantic relationship\n     and Batam marriage when they were initially questioned by the police on\n     21 September 2010. This was before they had had the opportunity to agree on\n     what they should say to the police. It was only later, on 6 October 2010\n     that these statements were retracted. However, the Prosecution in its\n     Further Arguments has glossed over this by suggesting that:[note: 171] The account given by the mother and Lathiff in their statements\n      recorded on 21 September 2010, as to how they first met during the lodging\n      of the rape report and subsequently developed a closer relationship, isspontaneous and therefore reliable.\n      [emphasis added] 266    Admittedly, Lathiff\n     has consistently maintained that he first met the mother when the rape\n     report was lodged and only established contact two months\n      later.[note: 172]However, it still leaves unanswered why the couple would lie about their\n     relationship in their 6 October 2010 police statements when this issue\n     would appear to have had no bearing on their guilt or innocence vis-à-vis\n     that particular investigation. It is not inconceivable that, by this time,\n     they might have realised its significant ramifications for the rape trial,\n     which was still ongoing at the time. 267    Moreover, it is\n     inaccurate for the Prosecution to suggest that the 21 September 2010\n     statements were completely spontaneous and do not carry the possibility of\n     contamination or collusion. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, by\n     this time, the rape trial had already commenced on 23 August 2010. Lathiff\n     and the mother had already testified as Prosecution witnesses on 23 and\n     24 August 2010, respectively. At this stage of the trial, the Appellant was\n     not represented and had yet to raise the possibility of collusion. However,\n     defence counsel was appointed on 30 August 2010, and when the trial resumed\n     on 3 November 2010, the revelation of Lathiff and the mother’s romantic\n     relationship came to the fore when they were cross-examined that day,\n     albeit with both denying having gotten married in Batam.[note: 173]This might also explain why, in light of\n     the growing scrutiny into the couple’s relationship, the mother and Lathiff\n     were able to maintain a consistent position in their 21 September 2010\n     statements that they had only become fast friendstwo\n      months after the rape report was lodged.In fact, the only\n     thing that had changed in their 6 October 2010 statements was thenatureof their relationship. 268    At this juncture it\n     should be pointed out that the Prosecution at the trial below ought to have\n     been aware, by the second tranche of hearings, that Lathiff and the mother\n     had admitted in their 21 September 2010 statements to their Batam marriage.\n     However, this was not revealed to the court either during their\n     re-examination of Lathiff and the mother on 3 and 4 November 2010 or at any\n     time after that. This meant that defence counsel was denied the opportunity\n     to cross-examine the couple on this evidence and the Judge was not alerted\n     to this disturbing development (see above at[224]). Had Lathiff and the mother’s 21 September 2010\n     statements been brought to the attention of the Judge and defence counsel,\n     the line of enquiry in the rape trial would likely have taken a different\n     turn and might have even led to the timely disclosure of the phone records.\n     We also note that the Prosecution, on 15 November 2010, had rightly brought\n     C1’s HSA statement to the court’s attention to contradict her trial\n     testimony (see above at[40]). This\n     fact alone demonstrates that the Prosecution at the trial below ought to\n     have been aware of the ongoing investigation into the theft of cough syrup\n     although it appeared not to havefullyappreciated its implications on the rape trial.",
        "Summary of findings on collusion": "269    To summarise our\n     findings on the issue of collusion: (a)     In our view,\n      based on the available facts, there appears to be a case for alleging the\n      existence of a motive for C1 and the mother to bring a false complaint\n      against the Appellant – not least because of the close (and, indeed,\n      romantic) relationship between the mother and Lathiff on the one hand and\n      between Lathiff and the children (including C1) on the other. The issue\n      then is when this relationship developed. (b)     However, the evidence\n      adduced at trial was, in this regard, problematic. For an issue as serious\n      as that of collusion the courts always seek clarity of facts. This court\n      therefore requested fresh evidence. In this regard, given that a crucial\n      issue (in so far as the major collusion argument is concerned) relates to\n      thetimeat which the mother and Lathifffirstestablished their relationship,the phone recordswere ofcriticalimportance – in particular, whether the\n      mother and Lathiff had known each otherprior\n       to29 April 2009 (when the mother and C1 lodged the rape\n      report), in which case the major collusion argument would have been made\n      out. Unfortunately, in the absence of the couple’s pre-1 September 2009\n      phone records, there isinsufficient\n      evidence to enable this court to ascertain whether or not the major\n      collusion argument had in fact been established or disproved. It would, in\n      our view, be unfair for this court (or, indeed, the trial court) to make a\n      conclusive determination in relation to this particular issue simply\n      because it was imperative, in the specific circumstances of the present\n      case, that both parties be given an opportunity to address (through\n      examination, cross-examination, re-examination as well as the relevant\n      submissions)allthe evidence (especially\n      the crucial evidence, which, however, as just mentioned, was not (and is\n      not presently) available). (c)     For the same reasons, the evidence in\n      relation to the minor collusion argument was also problematic and, hence,\n      no conclusive determination could be made in relation to this particular\n      issue as well. This would be an even greater exercise in speculation given\n      that the minor collusion argument was only tangentially traversed by the\n      Appellant’s witnesses’ testimonies, as evidenced by the sister and her\n      husband’s evidence that Lathiff was a father figure to the children whom\n      they addressed as“Baba”. Furthermore,\n      defence counsel’s cross-examination of Lathiff, the mother and C1 was\n      equally unfruitful with all three Prosecution witnesses maintaining that\n      Lathiff did not facilitate any possible fabrication, during investigation\n      and at the trial by tutoring C1, C2 and the mother on to how to prepare\n      for their police statements and testimony at the trial. What we can say is\n      that it is entirely unsatisfactory for an enforcement official who was\n      plainly involved in the rape investigation at the outset to have developed\n      a familial relationship with the two key witnesses while proceedings were\n      ongoing. This has in turn raised many questions about the reliability of\n      these individuals as they have quite clearly been selective in testifying\n      on a number of key issues (see above at[164],[245],[248]and[265]).",
        "Issue 4: Should the Appellant be retried,\n    acquitted or have the new materials remitted before thesametrial judge,ie, the\n    Judge?": "270    In light of the\n     above findings, parties were asked at the close of the second CA hearing to\n     file written submissions on whether a retrial, remittance to the Judge for\n     him to consider the new material or acquittal should be ordered.\n     Accordingly, we now turn our attention to this question.",
        "Applicable law": "271    The power to order\n     a retrial when a conviction is quashed owes its origin not to the common\n     law, but to the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1861 (Act No 25 of 1861)\n     more than one hundred years ago. A similar power, albeit with minor\n     linguistic differences, has subsequently been incorporated in the criminal\n     procedure codes of a number of Commonwealth jurisdictions (see the Hong\n     Kong Privy Council decision ofAu Pui-Kuen v\n      Attorney-General of Hong Kong[1980] AC 351 (“Au Pui-Kuen”) at 356). 272    In Singapore, the\n     powers which this court may exercise upon quashing a conviction were\n     previously found in s 54(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act\n     (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) which reads as follows: Powers of Court of\n       Appeal 54. —(1) At the hearing of an appeal, the Court of Appeal shall hear\n      the appellant or his advocate and solicitor, if he appears, and, if it\n      thinks fit, the respondent or his advocate and solicitor, if he appears,\n      and may hear the appellant or his advocate and solicitor in reply. (2)    The Court of Appeal may thereupon confirm,\n       reverse or vary the decision of the trial court, or may order a retrial\n       or may remit the matter with the opinion of the Court of Appeal thereon\n       to the trial court, or may make such other order in the matter as it may\n       think just, and may by such order exercise any power which the trial\n       court might have exercised. … 273    Section 54 of the\n     SCJA, along with the rest of Pt V of the pre-amended SCJA which concerned\n     the Court of Appeal’s criminal jurisdiction, were repealed with effect from\n     2 January 2011. Nevertheless, the (now repealed) s 54 of the SCJA remains\n     the applicable provision in the present appeal by virtue of the fact that\n     the Appellant was charged before 2 January 2011. Presently, the repealed\n     s 54(2) is found in s 390(1)(b)(i) of the\n     Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”), which is\n     identical in all material aspects. Section 390(1)(b)(i) of the CPC 2010 reads as follows: Decision on\n      appeal 390.—(1) At the hearing of the appeal,\n      the appellate court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for\n      interfering dismiss the appeal, or may — … (b)    in an appeal from a conviction\n      — (i)reverse the finding and\n         sentence and acquit or discharge the appellant or order him to be\n         retried by a court of competent jurisdiction, or remit the matter, with\n         the opinion of the appellate court, to the trial\n        court; (ii)   alter the finding, maintaining the sentence\n        or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the\n        sentence; or (iii)   with or without reducing or enhancing the\n        sentence, and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of\n        the sentence; ... (2)    Nothing in subsection (1) shall be taken to\n       prevent the appellate court from making such other order in the matter as\n       it may think just, and by such order exercise any power which the trial\n       court might have exercised. [emphasis added] 274    The most extensive\n     statement of the applicable principles in determining whether a retrial or\n     acquittal should be ordered can be found in the Jamaican Privy Council\n     decision ofDennis Reid v The Queen[1980] AC\n     343 (“Dennis Reid”). 275    InDennis Reid, the appellant was charged with murder. At\n     his trial the appellant was convicted on the basis of an identification of\n     him by a single eye-witness. The appellant’s conviction was quashed on\n     appeal by the Jamaican Court of Appeal and a retrial was ordered on the\n     grounds that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and unsupported by the\n     evidence. The appellant then successfully appealed to the Privy Council\n     against the order for a retrial. Crucially, Lord Diplock, delivering the\n     unanimous opinion of the Board, held (at 348E–F) that: It would conflict with the basic principle that in every criminal\n      trial it is for the prosecution to prove its case against the defendant,\n      if a new trial were orderedin cases where at the\n       original trial the evidence which the prosecution had chosen to adduce\n       was insufficient to justify a convictionby any reasonable\n      jury which had been properly directed...[T]he governing reason why the\n      verdict must be set aside is because the prosecution having chosen to\n      bring the defendant to trial had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to\n      justify convicting him of the offence with which he has been charged.To order a new trial would be to give the prosecution\n       a second chance to make good the evidential deficiencies in its case -\n       and, if a second chance, why not a third?[emphasis\n      added] 276    Having disposed of\n     the substance of the appeal, Lord Diplock went on to consider (at\n     349D–351C) the principles which should apply in considering whether a\n     retrial should be ordered: Their Lordships would be very loth to embark upon a catalogue of\n      factors which may be present in particular cases and, where they are, will\n      call for consideration in determining whether upon the quashing of a\n      conviction the interests of justice do require that a new trial be held.The danger of such a catalogue is that, despite all\n       warnings, it may come to be treated as exhaustive or the order in which\n       the various factors are listed may come to be regarded as indicative of\n       the comparative weight to be attached to them;whereas there\n      may be factors which in the particular circumstances of some future case\n      might be decisive but which their Lordships have not now the prescience to\n      foresee, while the relative weight to be attached to each one of the\n      several factors which are likely to be relevant in the common run of cases\n      may vary widely from case to case according to its particular\n      circumstances.The recognition of the factors relevant\n       to the particular case and the assessment of their relative importance\n       are matters which call for the exercise of the collective sense of\n       justice and common senseof the members of the Court of Appeal\n      of Jamaica who are familiar, as their Lordships are not, with local\n      conditions. What their Lordships now say in an endeavour to provide the\n      assistance sought by certified question (4) must be read with the\n      foregoing warning in mind. Their Lordships have already indicated in disposing of the instant\n      appeal that the interest of justice that is served by the power to order a\n      new trial is the interest of the public in Jamaica that those persons who\n      are guilty of serious crimes should be brought to justice and not escape\n      it merely because of some technical blunder by the trial judge in the\n      conduct of the trial or in his summing up to the jury.Save in circumstances so exceptional that their Lordships cannot readily\n       envisage them it ought not to be exercised where, as in the instant case,\n       a reason for setting aside the verdict is that the evidence adduced at\n       the trial was insufficient to justify a conviction by a reasonable jury\n       even if properly directed.It is not in the\n       interests of justice as administered under the common law system of\n       criminal procedure that the prosecution should be given another chance to\n       cure evidential deficiencies in its case against the defendant.At the other extreme, where the evidence\n       against the defendant at the trial was so strong that any reasonable jury\n       if properly directed would have convicted the defendant, prima facie the\n       more appropriate course is toapply the proviso to section 14\n      (1) anddismiss the appeal instead of incurring the\n       expense and inconvenience to witnesses and jurors which would be involved\n       in another trial. In cases which fall between these two\n       extremesthere may be many factors deserving of consideration,\n      some operating against and some in favour of the exercise of the power.The seriousness or otherwise of the offence must\n       always be a relevant factor: so may its prevalence; and where the\n       previous trial was prolonged and complex, the expense and the length of\n       time for which the court and jury would be involved in a fresh hearing\n       may also be relevant considerations. So too is the consideration that any\n       criminal trial is to some extent an ordeal for the defendant, which the\n       defendant ought not to be condemned to undergo for a second time through\n       no fault of his own unless the interests of justice require that he\n       should do so. The length of time that will have elapsed between the\n       offence and the new trial if one be ordered may vary in importance from\n       case to case, though having regard to the onus of proof which lies upon\n       the prosecution lapse of time may tend to operate to its disadvantage\n       rather than to that of the defendant. Nevertheless there may be cases\n       where evidence which tended to support the defence at the first trial\n       would not be available at the new trial and, if this were so, it would be\n       a powerful factor against ordering a new trial. The strength of the case\n       presented by the prosecution at the previous trial is always one of the\n       factors to be taken into consideration but, except in the two extreme\n       cases that have been referred to, the weight to be attached to this\n       factor may vary widely from case to case according to the nature of the\n       crime, the particular circumstances in which it was committed and the\n       current state of public opinion in Jamaica. On the one hand there may\n       well be cases where despite a near certainty that upon a second trial the\n       defendant would be convicted the countervailing reasons are strong enough\n       to justify refraining from that course. On the other hand it is not\n       necessarily a condition precedent to the ordering of a new trial that the\n       Court of Appeal should be satisfied of the probability that it will\n       result in a conviction. There may be cases where, even though the Court\n       of Appeal considers that upon a fresh trial an acquittal is on balance\n       more likely than a conviction, “It is in the interest of the public, the\n        complainant, and the [defendant] himself that the question of guilt or\n        otherwise be determined finally by the verdict of a jury, and not left\n        as something which must remain undecided by reason of a defect in legal\n        machinery.” This was said by the Full Court of Hong Kong when ordering a new\n      trial inNg Yuk-kin v. The Crown(1955) 39\n      H.K.L.R. 49, 60. That was a case of rape, but in their Lordships' view it\n      states a consideration that may be of wider application than to that crime\n      alone. Their Lordships in answer to the Court of Appeal's request have\n      mentioned some of the factors that are most likely to call for\n      consideration in the common run of cases in Jamaica in which that court is\n      called upon to determine whether or not to exercise its power to order a\n      new trial. They repeat that the factors that they have referred to do not\n      pretend to constitute an exhaustive list.Save as\n       respects insufficiency of the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the\n       previous trial, their Lordships have deliberately refrained from giving\n       any indication that might suggest that any one factor is necessarily more\n       important than another.The weight to be attached to each of\n      them in any individual case will depend not only upon its own particular\n      facts but also upon the social environment in which criminal justice in\n      Jamaica falls to be administered today. As their Lordships have already\n      said, this makes the task of balancing the various factors one that is\n      more fitly confided to appellate trial judges residing in the\n      island. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 277    The relevant\n     propositions from Lord Diplock’s observations can be summarised as\n     follows: (a)     First, the\n      recognition of the factors relevant to the particular case and the\n      assessment of their relative importance are matters which call for the\n      exercise of the “collective sense of justice and common sense” of the\n      appellate court (Dennis Reidat\n      349D); (b)     Secondly, the danger of such a catalogue is that,\n      despite all warnings, it may come to be treated as exhaustive or the order\n      in which the various factors are listed may come to be regarded as\n      indicative of the comparative weight to be attached to them (Dennis Reidat 349F); (c)     Thirdly, the cases can be\n      classified according to two extremes. At one extreme are cases where the\n      evidence adduced at the original trial was insufficient to justify a\n      conviction (“category one” cases). In such cases, “save in circumstances\n      so exceptional that ... cannot be readily envisaged” an acquittal and not\n      a retrial should be granted. At the other end of the extreme, are cases\n      where the evidence against the appellant at the original trial was so\n      strong that a conviction would have resulted (“category two” cases). In\n      such cases, prima facie, the more appropriate course is to dismiss the\n      appeal and affirm the conviction (Dennis\n       Reidat 349H–350A); and (d)     Fourthly, in cases that fall between\n      the two extremes (“category three” cases), the relevant factors include,\n      but are not limited to the following (Dennis\n       Reidat 350D–G): (i)       The seriousness and prevalence of the offence; (ii)       Where the original trial was prolonged and complex, the expense and\n       the length of time for a fresh hearing; (iii)       An appellant ought\n       not to be condemned to undergo a trial for the second time through no\n       fault of his own unless the interests of justice require that he should\n       do so; (iv)       The length of time that will have elapsed between the offence and\n       the new trial if one is to be ordered. Owing to the onus of proof which\n       lies upon the prosecution, a lapse of time may tend to operate to its\n       disadvantage rather than to that of the appellant; (v)       Whether there was evidence which tended to support the appellant at\n       the original trial which would no longer be available at the new\n       trial; (vi)       The relative strengths of the case presented by the prosecution and\n       appellant at the original trial, but, except in the two extreme cases\n       that have been referred to (see above, at [277(c)]), the weight to be\n       attached to this factor may vary widely from case to\n      case; (vii)       There may well be cases where despite a near certainty\n       that upon a second trial the appellant would be convicted the\n       countervailing reasons are strong enough to justify refraining from that\n       course. Conversely, it is not necessarily a condition precedent to the\n       ordering of a new trial that the appellate court should be satisfied of\n       the probability that it will result in a conviction;\n      and (viii)       There may also be cases where, even though the\n       appellate court considers that, upon a fresh trial an acquittal is on\n       balance more likely than a conviction, it may be still be in the interest\n       of the public, the complainant and the appellant that the question of\n       guilt or innocence be determined finally by a trial court and not left as\n       something which must remain undecided by reason of a defect in legal\n       machinery. 278    It should be noted\n     that Lord Diplock was at pains to stress that this list of propositions is\n     non-exhaustive (seeDennis Reidat 351A and\n     349D–F). Indeed, as this appeal has vividly demonstrated, it would be\n     churlish to attempt to set out a definitive list of factors that would\n     comprehensively address all manner of scenarios that could arise. Simply\n     put, the exercise of the court’s discretion, upon quashing a conviction,\n     is, in the final analysis, a matter that calls for the exercise of “the\n     collective sense of justice and common sense” of the court (seeDennis Reidat 349F andAu\n      Pui-Kuenat 357D). 279Dennis Reidwas referred to in the Singapore High Court\n     decision ofNg Chee Tiong Tony v Public\n      Prosecutor[2008] 1 SLR(R) 900 (“Ng Chee\n      Tiong Tony”) at [28].Dennis Reidwas also implicitly endorsed in\n     the Singapore High Court decision ofBeh Chai Hock v\n      Public Prosecutor[1996] 3 SLR(R) 112 (“Beh\n      Chai Hock”) where Yong CJ at [38] cited the Ipoh High Court decision ofChee Chiew Heong v Public Prosecutor[1981] 2 MLJ 287 which\n     had itself referred toDennis\n    Reid. 280    InNg Chee Tiong Tony, the appellant was convicted in the\n     district court of voluntarily causing hurt as a result of an altercation at\n     a traffic junction and was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. He then\n     appealed against both his conviction and sentence on the grounds that,inter alia, the trial judge had unreasonably\n     and unfairly entered the arena of conflict by excessively questioning the\n     appellant through a total of 76 continuous questions covering 12 pages of\n     the notes of evidence thus rendering the conviction unsafe. Lee Seiu Kin J\n     quashed the appellant’s conviction and acquitted him on the basis\n     that: (a)     The offence\n      of voluntarily causing hurt is a non-seizable one and may be compounded by\n      the victim (Ng Chee Tiong Tonyat [30]); (b)     It was far from clear that a\n      retrial would likely lead to a conviction because the case essentially\n      turned on the evidence of the victim and the appellant (Ng Chee Tiong Tonyat [31]); and (c)     The trial had taken place over a\n      period of five months and the appellant had had his conviction hanging\n      over his head for another eight months leading up to the appeal. As such,\n      ordering a retrial would give the Prosecution a second bit of the cherry\n       (Ng Chee Tiong Tonyat [33]). 281    In support of these\n     findings, Lee J referred to the decision of this court inRoseli bin Amat and others v Public Prosecutor[1989]\n     1 SLR(R) 346 (“Roseli”). InRoseli, the four appellants were convicted of rape. On\n     appeal, the appellants claimed that the trial judge had: (a) excessively\n     interrupted and hampered the appellants’ counsel in their examination and\n     cross-examination of witnesses; (b) unfairly and improperly cross-examined\n     the appellants in a hostile manner including disallowing them to give\n     evidence in their own way; and (c) made adverse comments of the appellants\n     which strongly indicated that the trial judge had predetermined the guilt\n     of the appellants even before he had considered all the available evidence.\n     The Court of Appeal quashed the rape convictions on the ground that the\n     trial judge had failed to keep an open mind and had adversely determined\n     issues against the accused prior to the presentation of the case. Having\n     regard to the long lapse of time since the alleged offences and the fact\n     that the appellants had already served a term of imprisonment of over three\n     years, the Court of Appeal decided against ordering a retrial (at [23]): With great reluctance, we have reached the unavoidable conclusion\n      that the convictions should not be allowed to stand. Accordingly, we allow\n      the appeal and quash the convictions and the sentences.We have considered whether we should now order a new trial. In our\n       judgment, having regard to the long lapse of time since the alleged\n       offence and the fact that the appellants have by now served a term of\n       imprisonment of over three years it would be unfair to subject them again\n       to a long trial on the same charges. We therefore do not propose to make\n       such an order.[emphasis added] 282    InRoseli, the trial judge sentenced the four appellants\n     to, respectively, imprisonment terms of between ten to 14 years and ten to\n     15 strokes of the cane. It was with this reference point in mind that the\n     Court of Appeal held that it would be unfair to the appellants to subject\n     them to a lengthy retrial since they had already been imprisoned for over\n     three years. As should be clear, the facts ofRoselibear some resemblance to those in the present appeal in\n     so far as they both involved rape convictions, the imposition of lengthy\n     sentences and a concomitantly lengthy period of imprisonment prior to the\n     disposal of the appeal. 283    InBeh Chai Hock, the appellant was convicted of\n     knowingly furnishing false information to a police officer under s 182 PC\n     in his statement to a Staff Sergeant Goh (“SSgt Goh”). The appellant\n     alleged that the statement was given to a Corporal Lee (“Cpl Lee”) instead\n     and as a result of inducement. The trial judge was of the view that the\n     identity of the recorder was a question of fact and that there was no issue\n     of voluntariness to be determined by way of avoir\n      dire. If the statement had in fact been recorded by Cpl Lee, it\n     would be excluded anyway because it was made to a police officer not of the\n     rank of sergeant or above. On the other hand, if the statement was recorded\n     by SSgt Goh, then thevoir direwould also\n     not be necessary since the appellant had only made allegations against\n     Cpl Lee and not SSgt Goh. 284    On appeal, Yong CJ\n     quashed the appellant’s conviction but did not find that this was a\n     suitable case for an acquittal and, therefore, ordered a retrial. Yong CJ\n     explained (at [39]) that: Considering the circumstances of this case, however, one can clearly\n      see that ordering a retrial would not be tantamount to letting the\n      Prosecution have another bite at the cherry because it was really not any\n      failing on the part of the Prosecution that caused the trial judge to err\n      in law.It is not that the Prosecution had relied on\n       unsatisfactory evidence to prove its case. The trial judge had come to\n       his own conclusion, without any submission as to its necessity or\n       otherwise, that it would be unnecessary to hold a voir dire to establish\n       the identity of the recorder of the statement.At the same\n      time, it is also clear, from the totality of the evidence adduced and the\n      findings of the trial judge on the evidence, that the appellant's\n      conviction is being overturned even thoughhis defence,\n       which consisted mainly of a denial of the Prosecution's case, was not\n       credible to any degree.Therefore, this would be a suitable\n      case to order a retrial. [emphasis added] 285    In contrast to the\n     facts inDennis Reid, the Prosecution inBeh Chai Hockwere not to blame for the\n     unsafe conviction at the trial below. Rather, it was the trial judge’s\n     failure to hold avoir direthat had\n     compromised the safety of the appellant’s conviction. In this respect, the\n     facts inBeh Chai Hockbear a closer\n     resemblance to those inRoseliandNg Chee Tiong Tonyin so far as they were all cases\n     where the fairness of the trial below had been compromised by the conduct\n     of the trial judge. Nevertheless, Yong CJ’s holding inBeh Chai Hock, that a retrial and not an acquittal should be\n     ordered, was entirely justified because, unlike inRoseliandNg Chee Tiong Tony,\n     this would not amount to giving the prosecution a second bite of the cherry\n     since the appellant’s defence at the trial below “was not credible to any\n     degree”. Moreover, although not expressly stated in the judgment inBeh Chai Hock, there was no issue, unlike inRoseliandNg Chee Tiong\n      Tony, of prejudice to the appellant arising from a prolonged\n     delay in the proceedings. 286    As can be distilled\n     fromDennis Reid(at 350D, cited above at[276]), a lengthy interval between\n     the commission of the alleged crime, the date of the complaint or the date\n     of the charge and a putative retrial can operate to the detriment of the\n     Appellant in two ways. 287    First, as\n     demonstrated inRoseliandNg Chee Tiong Tony, the length of time that will have elapsed\n     may be disproportionate to the Appellant’s sentence and/or ongoing period\n     of incarceration. 288    Secondly, there is\n     also the separate issue of whether the Appellant would be irretrievably\n     prejudiced by the fact that exculpatory evidence would no longer be\n     available at the retrial. This latter point has been discussed at some\n     length in two English Court of Appeal decisions,viz,R v B[2003] 2 Cr App R 13\n      (“R v B”) andKhalid Ali\n      Mohammed Altaf v The Crown Prosecution Service, West Midlands[2007] EWCA Crim 691 (“Khalid Ali”), to which\n     we now turn. 289R v Bwas another rape case where the appellant’s guilt or\n     innocence turned on the complainant’s testimony. The appellant was charged\n     with sexually abusing his step-daughter. An application was made before the\n     start of the trial that the proceedings be stayed as an abuse of process\n     based on the 30 year delay between the alleged incidents and the complaints\n     made. The trial judge refused the application and at the end of the trial,\n     the appellant was convicted. The appellant appealed against his conviction\n     on the ground that the evidence relied on was unreliable and unsupported by\n     any independent evidence. 290    In allowing the\n     appeal and acquitting the appellant, Lord Woolf CJ emphasised (at [18]) that “the passage\n      of time in this jurisdiction has never been a ground in itself for the\n      staying of a prosecution”. Nevertheless, the appellant was put\n     in an impossible position to defend himself owing to the delay. As\n     Lord Woolf observed (at [28]): In this case it has to be recognised that because of the delay that\n      occurred, in our judgment the appellant was put in an impossible position\n      to defend himself.He was not, as Mr Jenkins[counsel for the appellant]says with force, able to\n       conduct any proper cross-examination of the complainant. There was no\n       material he could put to the complainant to suggest that she had said\n       that something had happened on one occasion which could be established to\n       be incorrect. There was no material in the form of notes that were given\n       to the doctors which showed that she had changed her account. All that\n       the appellant could do was to say that he had not committed the acts\n       alleged against him. Mr Jenkins says that to say to a jury, when faced\n       with allegations of the sort that were made here, “I have not done it” is\n       virtually no defence at all.[emphasis added] 291    InKhalid Ali, two appellants were convicted of various\n     sexual offences against two complainants involving an incident in December\n     1995. However, the first appellant was not arrested until 2004 while the\n     second appellant, who was originally arrested in 1997, was only rearrested\n     in 2004. The trial took place in April 2006 with the first appellant being\n     convicted of two offences of false imprisonment and one offence of aiding\n     and abetting rape but acquitted of another offence of rape. The second\n     appellant was convicted of one offence of rape. Both appellants appealed on\n     the grounds that important documents had been destroyed during the period\n     of unjustified delay between the reporting of the alleged incident in\n     December 1995 and the appellants’ being rearrested and charged in 2004.\n     Absent such documents, they argued, the verdicts were unsafe. The\n     appellants were acquitted due to three main factors in their favour, which\n     will be discussed in turn below. 292    First, both\n     complainants (ie, T and S) had, after they\n     had complained to the police, made applications to the Criminal Injuries\n     Compensation Authority (“CICA”). S’s application still existed but T’s was\n     no longer available. At the trial below, S accepted that her account in the\n     CICA application was untrue and exaggerated. For example, she had falsely\n     accused the second appellant of raping her “every five minutes of the day\n     and nights with lots of different ones” (at [16]). In this respect, Moses LJ (delivering the unanimous\n     opinion of the English Court of Appeal) acknowledged (at [34]) that while: It was, of course, a matter of speculation as to whether it\n       [ieT’s CICA application] was consistent\n      with the account T gave, both at the time when being interviewed on video\n      by the police and subsequently, to the court.But the\n       fact that S’s account was untrue and exaggerated is relevant. Both girls\n       were still friends, living near each other, so we were told. It is\n       unlikely that they did not discuss their applications to the\n       CICA.[emphasis added] 293    Accordingly,\n     Moses LJ noted that the delay, had irretrievably removed any opportunity\n     for the appellant to investigate whether T had similarly lied in her CICA\n     form, short of cross-examining T about it (seeKhalid\n      Aliat [17]). In this\n     respect, Moses LJ held (at [39])\n     that: In the instant appeal there was no credible evidence which could be\n      distinguished from the missing material.T’s\n       credibility depended, in part, upon the reliability of her account to the\n       CICA. The mere fact that S’s account had proved to be false did not\n       establish that T’s was similarly untrue, but it does cause us concern, as\n       it seems to have done to the trial judge at the time of the\n       ruling.[emphasis added] 294    Secondly, the delay\n     led to the destruction of the pocketbook belonging to one of the two Police\n     Officers who initially attended to the complaints. This deficiency in the\n     evidence was compounded by the fact these two Police Officers had, by their\n     own testimony, erroneously interviewed the complainants together, thereby\n     presenting the opportunity for contamination. Accordingly, the delay\n     deprived the appellant of the opportunity of seeing whether any greater\n     clarification was contained in the missing pocketbook. Such clarification\n     was required given the other Police Officer (whose pocketbook was still in\n     existence for the purposes of the trial) could not explain why his\n     pocketbook referred to an unidentified “Aktar” and not the first appellant\n     (seeKhalid Aliat [19]–[20]). 295    Thirdly, the\n     telephone records that could corroborate the prosecution’s case were no\n     longer available. T and S were said to have found a telephone box and S had\n     called a friend and told her to let S’s mother know where they were.\n     Moses LJ expressed dissatisfaction (at [22]) that: … [T]he girls’ friend, to whom the initial telephone call was made,\n      once traced by the defence, could no longer assist. The prosecution made\n      no attempt to trace her at all. Consequently, Moses LJ acquitted the appellants on the basis that the\n     cumulative effect of the missing documents meant that the appellants could\n     not be fairly tried. Put simply, “there was no credible\n      evidence which could be distinguished from the missing\n      material”(seeKhalid Aliat\n      [39]). 296    To summarise, from\n     the cases referred to above, it is clear that where the evidence adduced at\n     the original trial was insufficient to justify a conviction, such as inDennis Reid, an acquittal, as opposed to a\n     retrial, should ordinarily be ordered (“category one cases”). At the other\n     end of the extreme, where the evidence adduced at the original trial was so\n     strong that a conviction would have resulted, the more appropriate course\n     would be to dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction (“category two\n     cases”). 297    Between the two\n     extremes, the residual category of cases would include the following,\n     non-exhaustive situations (“category three cases”): (a)     Critical\n      exculpatory evidence is no longer available(see, for example,R v B; Khalid\n       Ali); (b)     The fairness of the trial below is compromised by the\n      trial judge’s conduct (see, for example,Roseli;Ng Chee Tiong Tony;andBeh Chai Hock); and (c)     The length of time\n      before the putative retrial is disproportionate to the appellant’s\n      sentence and/or ongoing period of incarceration (see, for example,Roseli; Ng Chee Tiong\n    Tony). 298    In so far as\n     “category three cases” are concerned, the appropriate course would be for\n     the appellate court to weigh the non-exhaustive factors enunciated by\n     Lord Diplock inDennis Reid(see above at[276]), while at all times exercising\n     its “collective sense of justice and common sense”, in order to determine\n     whether a retrial should be ordered. With the above principles in mind, we\n     now turn to consider the parties’ submissions on this particular\n     point.",
        "Conclusion": "312    As mentioned at the\n     outset of this judgment (at [1]–[2]), the vital importance of examining the facts in a\n     granular and meticulous manneras well asthe\n     closely related need for the Prosecution to prove its case against the\n     Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be emphasised enough. In our\n     view, having regard to all the relevant facts, we find that the Prosecution\n     hasnotproved its casevis-a-visall the five charges against the Appellant beyond a\n     reasonable doubt. The reasons for our decision have been set out in great\n     detail above. In summary, we found as follows: (a)     The evidence\n      of C1 wasnot– as required by the\n      established legal principles –unusually\n       convincingand therefore couldnot, in and of itself,constitute\n       sufficient evidenceto establish the charges against the\n      Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt (see generally above at[111]–[172]). (b)     The evidence of C1 referred to at (a)\n      above hasnotbeencorroboratedbyeitherthe\n      evidence of C1’s sister, C2,orthe medical\n      evidence (see generally above at[173]–[209]). This is\n      crucial, given our finding at (a) above (viz, that C1’s evidence wasnot,\n      in and of itself, unusually convincing). (c)     There was, however,\n      insufficient evidence for us to decide on the issue of alleged collusion –\n      whether stemming from a pre-existing romantic relationship between Lathiff\n      and the mother which led to the manipulation of C1 to make a false\n      complaint against the Appellantorfrom a\n      relationship existing after C1’s complaint had been made which led Lathiff\n      to tutor the mother, C1 and C2 as to how to prepare for the police\n      statements and their testimony at the trial itself (see generally above at[217]–[269]). What we can say, however, is that it is troubling\n      that the trial process may have been compromised by the development of\n      familial relationships among Lathiff, C1 and the mother (see above at[251],[261]–[269]).\n      Nevertheless, this did not impact the decision of this court as, based on\n      our findings as summarised above at (a) and (b), it is clear that the\n      Prosecution had not proved its case against the Appellant beyond a\n      reasonable doubt. (d)     In the circumstances, ordering a new trial before a\n      different trial judge or remitting the new materials to the Judge is\n      inappropriate because the aforementioned findings were based on clear\n      evidence from the record with the new evidence only confirming this\n      conclusion – with the result that the Prosecution at the trial below had\n      not only failed to prove its case against the Appellant beyond a\n      reasonable doubt but had failed to do so by no small measure (see above at[300]–[306]). Further, as explained above, the fact that close to\n      three years have elapsed since the Appellant’s arrest as well as the fact\n      that the Appellant would be irretrievably prejudiced because crucial\n      potentially exculpatory evidence is no longer available would,in any event,alsohave\n      led to the conclusion that a retrial oughtnotto be ordered (see above at[307]–[310]). 313    In the\n     circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the Appellant is acquitted of all\n     the charges brought against him. 314    It cannot be\n     overemphasised that the need to convict an accused person (such as the\n     Appellant) based on the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is – as\n     pointed out above – a time-honoured and integral part of our criminal\n     justice system (and, to the best of our knowledge, all other criminal\n     justice systems as well). In this respect, we adopt Lord Woolf’s comments\n     inR v Bat [27]: ...We must do justice to the\n       prosecution, whose task it is to see that\n       the guilty are brought to justice.We must\n       also do justice to the victim.In this case we are particularly conscious of the position of the victim.\n      If she is right, she was treated in a most disgraceful way by someone whom\n      she should have been entitled to trust: her stepfather. For years, for\n      understandable reasons, as we have already indicated, she felt unable to\n      make public what had happened. She is entitled to justice as well.But we also have to do justice to the appellant.At the heart of our criminal justice\n       system is the principle that while it is important that justice is done\n       to the prosecution and justice is done to the victim, in the final\n       analysis the fact remains that it is even more important that an\n       injustice is not done to a defendant. It is central to the way we\n       administer justice in this country that although it may mean that some\n       guilty people go unpunished, it is more important that the innocent are\n       not wrongly convicted.[emphasis added in italics and bold\n      italics] 315    Indeed, any\n     approach to the contrary would be wholly inconsistent with the presumption\n     of innocence that is thenecessaryhallmark\n     of any criminal justice system. It is precisely this presumption that\n     underlies the fundamental principle set out at the outset of this Judgment\n     (see above at[2]) – that the\n     Prosecution bears the legal burden of proving its case against the accused\n     (here, the Appellant)beyond a reasonable\n      doubt. In this regard, the following observations by\n     V K Rajah J in the Singapore High Court decision ofJagatheesan s/o Krishnamsamy v Public Prosecutor[2006]\n     4 SLR(R) 45 (at [58]–[60]) ought to be noted: 58    In deciding whether the evidence supports a\n       conviction beyond reasonable doubt, it is not only necessary to clarify\n       the conceptual dividing line between reasonable doubts and mere or\n       fanciful doubts.It is also vital to appreciate that\n        the principle that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case\n        beyond reasonable doubt embodies two important societal\n        values. 59    First, it “provides concrete substance for the\n       presumption of innocence”:Winship[In re Winship397 US 358 (1970)] at 363.It is axiomatic that the presumption of innocence is\n        a central and fundamental moral assumption in criminal law. It cannot be\n        assumed that an individual is guilty by mere dint of the fact that he\n        has been accused of an offence, unless and until the Prosecution adduces\n        sufficient evidence to displace this presumption of innocence. That\n        threshold below which society will not condone a conviction or allow for\n        the presumption of innocence to be displaced is the line between\n        reasonable doubt and mere doubt.Adherence to this\n       presumption also means that the trial judge should not supplement gaps in\n       the Prosecution's case. If indeed gaps in the evidence should prevail so\n       that the trial judge feels it is necessary to fill them to satisfy\n       himself that the Prosecution’s burden of proof has been met, then the\n       accused simply cannot be found legally guilty. In short, the presumption\n       of innocence has not been displaced. 60Second,the principle of reasonable doubt connotes and conveys the\n        gravity and weightiness that society equates with punishment. It would\n        be wrong to visit the indignity and pain of punishment upon a person\n        (and his family) unless and until the Prosecution is able to dispel all\n        reasonable doubts that the evidence (or lack thereof) may throw\n        up.Therefore, it is critical that trial judges appreciate\n       that inasmuch as fanciful conspiracy theories, often pleaded by the\n       Defence, will not suffice to establish reasonable doubt, the\n       Prosecution's theory of guilt must be supportable by reference to the\n       evidence alone and not mere conjecture that seeks to explain away gaps in\n       the evidence.
