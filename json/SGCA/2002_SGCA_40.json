        "Background": "3.\n\n        At around 11 pm on 4 November 2001, the\n\nrespondent returned to his flat at Block 38, Bedok South Road, #02-653. He could not enter\n\nhis flat because there was a padlock on his gate. He called his mother, the deceased, to\n\nopen the gate. When his mother, who was lying on her bed in the front bedroom, did not\n\nrespond to his shouts, the respondent took a brick and threw it at her though the window\n\nlouvres. Although the brick landed on his mother’s shoulder, she did not stir. The\n\nrespondent, who became more angry, threw another brick at her but she still did not get\n\nup. The respondent then rolled some newspapers into a ball and threw the lighted object at\n\nhis mother. It landed on her mattress, which caught fire.4.\n\n        A police officer, Sergeant Rohaizad bin Majnen,\n\nwho lives five floors above the respondent’s flat, rushed down to investigate after\n\nhe saw smoke emitting from a unit below. He saw the respondent standing outside his flat,\n\nsmoking a cigarette. When questioned, the respondent said that his flat was on fire and\n\nthat his mother was inside the flat.5.\n\n        The respondent’s mother’s body was\n\nfound badly charred and lying on her burnt bed frame. The autopsy report stated that the\n\ncause of her death was unascertainable. All the same, fire was ruled out as the cause of\n\nthe death of the respondent’s mother, who was 77 years old and suffering from\n\ndiabetes, a lung infection and ischaemic heart disease with interstitial fibrosis, which\n\ncould cause her to die suddenly.6.\n\n        The fire started by the respondent damaged the\n\nflat and the common corridor outside it. Repairs costing around $3,000 were carried out by\n\nthe HDB and the East Coast Town Council.",
        "The trial": "7.\n\n        The prosecution urged the trial judge to impose\n\nan order of preventive detention under section 12(2)(a) of the CPC on the respondent in\n\nview of his numerous previous convictions. The trial judge initially agreed that such an\n\norder was appropriate and sentenced the respondent to 14 years of preventive detention. At\n\nthis juncture, the prosecution pointed out that section 12(3) of the CPC requires the\n\ncourt to consider the physical and mental condition of the offender and his suitability\n\nfor preventive detention before imposing such a sentence. The trial judge accordingly\n\ncalled for a preventive detention report and the matter was adjourned for three weeks. The\n\nreport concluded that this was a case where an order for preventive detention was\n\nappropriate.8.\n\n        After studying the report in question, the\n\ntrial judge noted that the respondent’s terms of imprisonment ranged in the main from\n\neight weeks to six months and were mostly for theft. He said that an order for preventive\n\ndetention should not be made as it was too great a jump from sentences of six months to a\n\nperiod of incarceration ranging from seven to 20 years under a preventive detention order.\n\nHe then sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for four years.The appeal9.\n\n        To determine whether or not the appeal ought to\n\nbe allowed, reference must first be made to section 12(2) of the CPC, which sets out the\n\nregime for preventive detention and provides as follows:(2) Where a person who is not\n\n    less than 30 years of age —(a) is convicted before the High\n\n    Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years\n\n    or upwards, and has been convicted on at least 3 previous occasions since he attained the\n\n    age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least two of\n\n    those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; ….then,if the Court is\n\n    satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained\n\n    in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if\n\n    released before the expiration of his sentence, the Court, unless it has special reasons\n\n    for not so doing, shall pass, in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, a sentence of\n\n    preventive detention of such term of not less than 7 nor more than 20 years as the Court\n\n    may determine.(Emphasis added)10.\n\n        A sentence of preventive detention is intended\n\nfor habitual offenders, aged more than 30 years, whom the court considers to be too\n\nrecalcitrant for reformation (seePP v Wong Wing Hung[1999] 4 SLR 329). Preventive\n\ndetention ought to be imposed if the accused has shown that he is such a menace to society\n\nthat he should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time (seePP v Perumal s/o\n\nSuppiah[2000] 3 SLR 308). While the court will consider the need for the public to be\n\nprotected from physical bodily harm, offences against property, such as theft, offences\n\nagainst the peace, such as affray, and offences against society in general, such as the\n\nconsumption and possession of drugs, may also be taken into account for the purpose of\n\ndetermining whether it is appropriate for an order of preventive detention to be made. InTan\n\nNgin Hai v PP[2001] 3 SLR 161, 163, Yong Pung How CJ explained:In my view, there is no rule of\n\n    law which states that protection of the public necessarily refers to protecting them only\n\n    from physical harm…. As such, the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be\n\n    restricted only to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited though the\n\n    commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the degree of\n\n    propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to\n\n    be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest\n\n    opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again.11.\n\n        The respondent is 41 years old. The offences\n\npreviously committed by him are numerous. In 1976, he was put on probation for two years\n\nfor theft. He did not turn over a new leaf as he was fined $300 in 1981 for committing\n\ntheft again. In 1982, he was imprisoned for a year for housebreaking and theft by night.\n\nIn 1984, he was fined $2,500 for theft and fraudulent possession of property. He was\n\nimprisoned for 5 months as he failed to pay the fine. In 1986, he was fined $500 for\n\ncriminal trespass and was imprisoned for one month after he failed to pay the fine. In\n\n1986, he was imprisoned for a day and fined $400 for committing theft. As the fine was not\n\npaid, he was imprisoned for an additional month. By 1987, he had turned to drugs and was\n\nsent to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 6 months. In 1988, he was placed under drug\n\nsupervision. In the same year, he committed theft for yet another time and was imprisoned\n\nfor 8 weeks. In 1990, he was found guilty of unlawful possession of an offensive weapon\n\nand three counts of theft. He was imprisoned for 8 months and given 6 strokes of the cane.\n\nIn 1990, he was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 6 months and was subjected to\n\ndrug supervision for 24 months. In 1993, he was once again sent to the Drug Rehabilitation\n\nCentre for 6 months and was subjected to drug supervision for 24 months. He could not get\n\nhimself off drugs and in 1996, he was imprisoned for a total of six months for possession\n\nand consumption of drugs. In 1997, he was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for a\n\nthird time and was again subjected to drug supervision. Finally, in 2000, he was\n\nimprisoned for 12 months for failing to report for a urine test on three occasions. Within\n\na few months of his release from prison, he threw a lighted projectile at the mattress on\n\nwhich his mother was lying and was found guilty of committing mischief by fire, an offence\n\nfor which the punishment prescribed in section 436 of the Penal Code includes life\n\nimprisonment or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years.12.\n\n        The respondent’s string of previous\n\nconvictions and the circumstances of his latest offence reveal his propensity for criminal\n\nactivity. In our view, there is a real danger that the respondent will commit more\n\noffences in the future. As such, this is a case where the trial judge should have made an\n\norder for preventive detention.13.\n\n        As for the period of detention, we were minded\n\nto have the respondent detained for a very long time. The respondent pointed out to us\n\nthat although he had committed numerous offences in the past, he had never been imprisoned\n\nfor a long period of time. However, inPP v Perumal s/o Suppiah[2000] 3 SLR 308,\n\n316,Yong Pung How CJ made it clear that any comparison between the sentences\n\npreviously imposed on the offender and the minimum period of preventive detention is\n\nmisconceived and constitutes a misreading of the law and objective of preventive\n\ndetention. He explained as follows:The criteria for the imposition\n\n    of preventive detention is that set out in s 12(2)(a) or s12(2)(b) CPC. The provision does\n\n    not stipulate a minimum term for an offender’s previous sentences and does not\n\n    require the previous sentences to correspond to the minimum period of preventive\n\n    detention. Indeed an offender who has committed a perpetual string of offences for which\n\n    he was sentenced to varying imprisonment terms of under one year is precisely the type of\n\n    offender targeted by the provision.14.\n\n        We considered two cases where the maximum\n\nperiod of 20 years’ preventive detention was imposed. In the first case,PP v Wong\n\nWing Hung[1999] 4 SLR 329, the appellant, who was 35 years old, pleaded guilty to a\n\ncharge under section 332 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to a public\n\nservant. He had been previously charged and convicted a total of 16 times since 1980 and\n\nhad been sentenced to a total of 15 years of imprisonment. In addition, he had received as\n\npunishment a total of 25 strokes of the cane. His previous convictions were in respect of\n\noutrage of modesty, rape, causing grievous hurt, criminal intimidation, armed robbery and\n\nusing an offensive weapon. The court was of the view that the appellant’s large\n\nnumber of criminal convictions and his apparent lack of repentance proved that an order of\n\npreventive detention for the maximum possible period should be imposed.15.\n\n        In the second case,Heng Jong Cheng v PP[1999] 2 SLR 345, the appellant, who pleaded guilty to a charge of affray, was found guilty of 23\n\ncounts of abetment of cheating and one charge of abetment of attempted cheating. He had\n\nmany previous convictions involving dishonesty over a period of more than three decades.\n\nFor instance, in 1991, he was convicted of two charges of housebreaking and theft by night\n\nand was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 24 months’ imprisonment. Shortly after\n\nhe was released from prison, he was found guilty of three counts of assisting in the\n\nconcealment or disposal of stolen property and sentenced to three terms of imprisonment,\n\neach of a duration of two years and six months, with two of the terms running\n\nconsecutively. After his release from prison, he was charged with, inter alia, 23 counts\n\nof abetment of cheating. He was sentenced by the district judge to 9 years of preventive\n\ndetention. On appeal, the period of detention was increased to 20 years. Yong Pung How CJ\n\nsaid that faced with an offender who had evinced a complete lack of remorse and whose\n\nrecord indicated that he was highly likely to return to a life of crime once he was\n\nreleased from detention, 9 years of preventive detention was manifestly inadequate to\n\nprotect the public.16.\n\n        The respondent’s position is not better\n\nthan that of the offenders in the two cases referred to above. His first crime was\n\ncommitted way back in 1976, when he was merely 15 years old and he has gone from bad to\n\nworse over the years. He has been convicted on innumerable occasions over a period of 26\n\nyears and has been imprisoned for a total of 49 months. The imposition of a punishment of\n\nsix strokes of the cane has had no effect whatsoever on his bent for criminal activity. In\n\nregard to his latest offence, it is rather alarming that he displayed such a blatant\n\ndisregard for his own frail and aged mother when he threw bricks at her and when he threw\n\na lighted ball of newspaper onto the mattress on which his mother was lying. He also\n\nshowed how callous he was about the safety of his neighbours as the fire could easily have\n\nspread to other flats and could have caused death and injury but for the timely\n\nintervention of the civil defence force. When the fire started, the respondent took no\n\nsteps whatsoever to put out the fire or to call the fire brigade even though his mother\n\nwas trapped in the flat. He merely stood outside his house and smoked a cigarette. Indeed,\n\nin his skeletal submissions, he stated that he was \"unable to do anything except to\n\nwatch while waiting for the arrival of the police and fire brigade … and he could\n\nonly prevent himself from getting caught in the raging fire\".17.\n\n        The respondent’s dependence on drugs and\n\nalcohol should not be overlooked. He has not been able to hold a steady job and many of\n\nthe offences committed by him stemmed from the need to find money for drugs. Taking all\n\ncircumstances into account, detaining the respondent for a long period of time would be in\n\nthe interest of the public. As such, we sentenced the respondent to preventive detention\n\nfor a period of 20 years.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHAO HICK TINTAN LEE MENGChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
