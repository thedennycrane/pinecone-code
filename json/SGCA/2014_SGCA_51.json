        "Background Facts": "2       The\nrespondent in this reference (“the Respondent”) was the food and beverage\nmanager at IKANO Pte Ltd, a Singapore company that operates the\nIKEA furniture stores in Singapore (“IKEA”). 3       AT35\nServices (“AT35”) was a sole proprietorship registered by Andrew\nTee Fook Boon (“Andrew”). Initially, AT35 was a waste management\ncompany. 4       Sometime\nin October, Andrew was approached by Gary Lim Kim Seng (“Gary”)\nto convert AT35 into a food supply business. Later in the same month,\nAndrew met Gary and the Respondent in a coffee shop in the Bishan\narea and a plan was hatched to supply food to IKEA through AT35. Gary\nand Andrew each contributed $30,000 in cash to start AT35’s new food\nsupply business but the Respondent made no direct cash contribution. Andrew\nwas the primary manager of AT35. Later, when the value of AT35’s sales\nto IKEA Singapore increased, Gary and Andrew decided to set up Food\nRoyal Trading (“FRT”), which was intended as a means to reduce the tax\nburden on the sales made to IKEA. 5       AT35\nand FRT became the exclusive suppliers of chicken wings and dried\nfood products to IKEA. The two entities had no other business or clients\nbesides IKEA. Themodus operandiof\nAT35 and FRT was as follows: they obtained food supplies from a\nfood supplier with instructions for that supplier (Tenderfresh,\nin AT35’s case) to package its products in unmarked clear plastic\nbags and sold them to IKEA at a marked up rate. AT35 and FRT did\nnot add value to the products: they merely transported the products\nstraight from its supplier to IKEA. Where storage of the products was\nnecessary, AT35 stored the products in rented cold rooms in Jurong and\nDefu industrial estates. AT35 did not have any cold rooms or storage facilities\nof its own. AT35 and FRT were effectively special purpose vehicles to\ncarry out a scheme which allowed Gary and Andrew to skim money off the\ntop of food contracts with IKEA and share it with the Respondent.\nOver a period of seven years, AT35 and FRT made a profit of $6.9m\nand the Respondent was given a one-third share of it,ie, $2.3m. 6       The\nRespondent was charged with 80 counts of corruptly accepting gratification\nunder s 6(a) of the PCA. The first\ncharge is reproduced below: You, … are charged that you, on or about\nthe 24th day of January 2003, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit,\na Manager in the employ of IKANO Pte Ltd, did corruptly obtain for\nyourself a gratification of a sum of about $14,125 (Fourteen Thousand\nOne Hundred and Twenty-five Dollars) from one [Gary] Lim Kim Seng,\nas a reward for showing favour in relation to your principal’s affairs,\nto wit, by being partial in placing orders for food products with\nAT35 Services and Food Royale Trading, and you have thereby committed\nan offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption\nAct, Chapter 241. The other charges were similarly framed but pertained to different\namounts of gratification the Respondent received over the course\nof the seven years. 7       At\na trial before a district judge, the Respondent was convicted on\nall 80 charges and was sentenced to 14 weeks’ imprisonment per charge.\nThe district judge ordered seven out of the 80 sentences of imprisonment\nto run consecutively for a total sentence of 98 weeks’ imprisonment.\nThe Respondent appealed against conviction and sentence, and on\nappeal, the Judge reversed the district judge’s finding that the\nPP had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Judge allowed\nthe appeal, and accordingly acquitted the appellant of the charges.",
        "The Judge’s decision": "8       In\nreversing the district judge’s decision, the Judge did not disturb\nthe former’s findings in relation to the Respondent’s role in the\narrangements with AT35 and FRT to supply goods to IKEA. What was\nof concern to the Judge were the district judge’s findings in relation\nto the corrupt element of the transaction and the Respondent’s corrupt\nintent or guilty knowledge (at [6] of the Judgment). 9       The\nJudge’s decision centred on the interpretation of s 6(a) of the PCA (“s 6(a)”)\nas to whether there was in fact any inducement of the agent (ie, the Respondent) by a third party (ie, AT35 and FRT). His starting premise\nwas that under s 6(a), there had\nto be at least three parties for a corrupt transaction to take place:\nfirst, there must be a principal whose loss is at issue; second,\nan agent of the principal whose corrupt intention is in issue; and\nthird, the third party, who induced the agent to act dishonestly\nor unfaithfully in relation to his principal’s affairs. In relation\nto s 6(a), the Judge was of the\nview that it was not sufficient that a person convicted under that\nprovision was dishonest: theremust be an inducementon\nthe part of the third party to the agent, for the agentto act in a certain way, that is, the\nthird party must seek “to prevail on, make, cause, encourage (the agent\nto do something)” (see [8] of the Judgment). Therefore, an agent\nwho has acted with dishonest intent and has interfered with the\naffairs of his principal, buthas not been\ninducedto do so by a third party may be guilty of some\nother crime of dishonesty, but would not be guilty of corruption\nas defined under the PCA. If, and as in fact was the case, the nature\nof the arrangements which the Respondent made with AT35 and FRT\nwere such that the Respondent was the master mind, or a co-conspirator,\nthen it can hardly be said that the Respondent had been induced\nor bribed to do the allegedly corrupt acts. 10     The\ndistrict judge found that Andrew had not explicitly stated the reason\nwhy the Respondent was paid huge sums of money by AT35 and FRT.\nAndrew had denied, at trial, the existence of a legitimate reason\nto pay the Respondent, and from this the district judge drew the\ninference that the Respondent was paid for the illegitimate reason\nof showing favour and allowing the arrangement with IKEA to continue.\nOn the other hand, the Judge found that Andrew was not the master\nmind of the scheme and came to partake in the scheme late. Andrew\ndid not understand the full relationship between Gary and the Respondent\neither. This explained why Andrew could not state the reason why\nthe Respondent was paid huge sums of money (at [11] of the Judgment). 11     The\nJudge disagreed with the district judge’s inference that there was a\ncorrupt element to the arrangement between Gary and the Respondent where\nthe latter would be paid in order for AT35 to be given “business”\nby IKEA. The circumstances showed that the agreement for AT35 and\nFRT to be given “business” by IKEA was initiated by the Respondent\nor by both the Respondent and Gary (at [12] of the Judgment). Given\nthe following considerations, the Judge found it unlikely that Gary\nhatched the scheme himself. First, the Respondent had discussed\nsplitting profits “from day 1” with Gary. Second, Andrew was merely\na participant who came into the picture late when the scheme had\nalready been formed. Third, the scheme was an elaborate one which\ninvolved the use of special purpose vehicles and profiteering from\ncontracts with IKEA, with the Respondent keeping his distance from\nthe vehicles used to carry out the scheme. Fourth, the Respondent\nwas also crucial as an insider that enabled the scheme to be implemented.\nIn truth, it was likely that Gary and the Respondent had “landed\non the idea together” and used AT35 (and later also FRT) as vehicles\nfor the scheme to be carried out. The Judge thus found that the district\njudge’s finding that the Respondent was not involved in the original scheme\nbut was being induced to participate was, at best, “ambiguous”.\nIn his words, there was “a reasonable chance” that the Respondent\nwas effectively paying himself in a profit-sharing scheme where\nhe received a third of the profit and which also indicated some\nelement of equal ownership over the scheme (at [13] of the Judgment). 12     In\nthe result, the Judge found that the Prosecution had not proven beyond\na reasonable doubt that there were three separate parties and that the\nRespondent was being induced as IKEA’s agent by a third party to\nact in a particular way in relation to his principal’s affairs.\nThe Judge held that the district judge was wrong in finding that\nthere was a corrupt element in the Respondent being induced to participate\nin the arrangement rather than coming up with the arrangement himself\n(at [13] of the Judgment). Instead, the Judge viewed the entire\narrangement as one where the Respondent had come up with the idea\nof making use of his position within the principal in order to earn\nsecret profits which he would share with the partners he intended\nto bring in to carry out the scheme. The profits from AT35 and FRT\nwere not rewards given to him as a form of gratification, but rather secret\nbenefits he had made from the scheme he had hatched; the profits made\nby the Respondent were not unlike those made in the situation where a\ndirector acted in conflict with the interest of his company and\nobtained a secret profit for himself and thereby giving rise to\na civil claim by the company against him (at [14] of the Judgment).\nTherefore, the appellant was not induced by another party to carry\nout the alleged acts against his principal. As that element of the\ncharge had not been made out, the Judge acquitted the Respondent\nof the charges.",
        "The criminal reference": "13     After\nthe Judge gave his decision, the PP filed a criminal reference on 16\nOctober 2013 pursuant to s 397 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,\n2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) to refer two questions of law of public\ninterest for the opinion of this court: (a)     For\nthe purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where an agent initiated, master\nminded or co-conspired in the payment of a gratification to himself,\ndoes thisipso factomean that he\nwas not induced or rewarded in respect of his principal’s affairs?\n(“Question 1”) (b)     For\nthe purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where an agent used his position\n(vis-à-vis, his principal) to create\nan arrangement for the payment of a gratification that conflicts\nwith the interests of his principal, does thisipso\nfactomean that the agent was not, by such arrangement,\ninduced or rewarded for showing favours in respect of his principal’s\naffairs? (“Question 2”) 14     While\nMr S K Kumar did not contest the propriety of the PP’s invocation\nof s 397 for a criminal reference, for completeness we will nevertheless\nconsider it. We first turn to examine briefly the recent precedents\ndiscussing this area of the law. According toPublic\nProsecutor v Goldring Timothy Nicholas and others[2014]\n1 SLR 586, the prosecution can refer any question that it wishes\nto refer to the Court of Appeal without having to obtain leave to\ndo so. However, this only leapfrogs the leave stage and not the\nsubstantive stage where the Court of Appeal can still consider whether\nthe case before it falls within the scope of s 397. In the subsequent case\nofPublic Prosecutor v Li Weiming and others[2014]\n2 SLR 393, this court reiterated that it would be well within its\njurisdiction and powers to consider whether the requirements in\ns 397 were satisfied before deciding whether the court should answer\nthe substantive questions posed to it. 15     The\nfour requirements were stated inMohammad Faizal\nbin Sabtu and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter[2013]\n2 SLR 141 at [15]: (a)     The\nreference must be made in relation to a criminal matter decided\nby the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary\njurisdiction (“Requirement 1”); (b)     The\nreference must relate to questions of law and those questions of\nlaw must be questions of public interest (“Requirement 2”); (c)     The\nquestion of law must have arisen from the case that was before the\nHigh Court (“Requirement 3”); and (d)     The\ndetermination of the question of law by the High Court must have\naffected the outcome of the case (“Requirement 4”). 16     We\nare of the view that Requirement 1 is fulfilled as the case was\nthe Respondent’s appeal against his conviction and sentence, and\nso the Judge was exercising his appellate jurisdiction when hearing\nthe case. Requirement 2 was also fulfilled as the questions of law\nrelated to the interpretation of s 6(a)\nand as mentioned by this court in the recent judgment ofPublic Prosecutor v Teo Chu Ha @ Henry Teo[2014]\nSGCA 45 at [35], there is great public interest in ensuring that\nthe principles of law relating to corruption, a huge social evil,\nare correctly and authoritatively decided for future cases. The\nprinciples of law will be delineated later when the questions are\naddressed. In respect of Requirement 3, Question 1 relates to whether\ninducement by a third party need be established in considering the\nobjective corrupt element of the transaction, and hence the roles\nof the agent and the third party in the conception of the transactions\nare called into question. Question 2 relates to the Judge’s finding\nthat the payment of “secret profits” could not amount to a “gratification”\nfor the purposes of s 6(a) and raises\nlegal questions in circumstances where the agent has a beneficial\nor legal interest in the third party. We are of the view that Requirement\n3 was fulfilled as the questions related to the Judge’s interpretation\nof s 6(a) as well as the essential\nelements of a charge of corruption. As for Requirement 4, in the\nlight of the foregoing, it was undoubtedly fulfilled. The Judge’s\ninterpretation of s 6(a) and his application\nto the facts before him caused him to overturn the decision of the\ndistrict judge. 17     Before\nconsidering the two questions of law of public interest that has been\nposed to us, we will address the PP’s attempt in its submissions\nto re-characterise the two questions as three distinct questions\nfor us to consider. While s 397 of the CPC may allow for the prosecution\nto refer questions of law of public interest to this court without\nhaving to obtain leave to do so, we do not think that this gives\nthe prosecution the ability to submit new or revised questions of\nlaw to the court by way of submissions. The proper procedure would\nhave been to refer these new questions to this court for our consideration.\nTherefore, we do not regard the three questions as stated in the\nsubmissions as the criminal reference for our present purposes,\nand will confine our analysis to the two questions initially referred.",
        "Influence and the paradigm of\ncorruption": "18     While\nthe PP had referred the two questions of law of public interest in\nrelation to s 6 of the PCA, the charges preferred against the Respondent were\nbrought under s 6(a), so our discussion\nwill be limited only to the latter provision. We thus begin our\nanalysis by considering the offence of corruption under s 6(a), which states: 6.    If — (a)    any agent corruptly accepts\nor obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any\nperson, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as\nan inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having\ndone or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs\nor business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour\nto any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business; … he shall be guilty of an offence and shall\nbe liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment\nfor a term not exceeding 5 years or to both. For clarity, we will refer to “gratification as an inducement\nor reward” as the “gift”, and the “doing or forbearing to do … any\nact”, “or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour”\nto any person in relation to the agent’s “principal’s affairs or\nbusiness” would be treated as the conferment of a dishonest advantage\nor benefit by the agent on the third party. The use of these words\nand phrasesare not to be treated as definitionsfor\nthe provision or relate to the definitions found in s 2 of the PCA,\nbut are meant to be convenient terms to encapsulate concepts in\nthis judgment without utilising the same phraseology as used in\nthe provision. 19     The\ndefinition of “corrupt” was considered for the first time inChan Wing Seng v Public Prosecutor[1997]\n1 SLR(R) 721 (“Chan Wing Seng”)\nby Yong Pung How CJ in the following manner (at [26]–[27]): 26    I\nhave been very hesitant to define what “corrupt” means because the factual\npermutations of corruption can be endless. Any definition may thus unnecessarily\ncircumscribe the effect of the section. However, as a starting point,\nit is useful to keep in view the natural and ordinary meaning of\nthe word “corrupt” as a working guide. In this regard, one of the\nmeanings of “corrupt” as given inThe New Shorter\nOxford Dictionary(1993 Ed) is: Induce to act dishonestly or unfaithfully;\nbribe. And, in further ascribing a meaning to\n“corruption”, it states: Perversion of a person’s integrity in the\nperformance of (especially official or public) duty or work by bribery\netc. 27    The\nabove is probably already what most laypersons understand by corruption.\nHowever, I stress once again that this is no more than a preliminary\nguide to what “corrupt” means and is clearly not definitive or exhaustive.\nEach case must still be examined on its own facts. While attempting to define “corrupt”, Yong CJ was also careful\nin emphasising that the word should not be construed only in that\none manner and that his remarks were not intended to be exhaustive. 20     The\nelements of an offence under s 6(a)\n(where the agent has already obtained the gift) are set out inKwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor[1998]\n2 SLR(R) 211 (“Peter Kwang”) at\n[32] as follows: (a)     Acceptance\nof gratification. (b)     As\nan inducement or reward (for the conferment of a benefit). (c)     There\nwas an objective corrupt element in the transaction. (d)     The\nrecipient accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge. The first element is theactusreusof the offence. The other three pertain\nto themens reaof the recipient. 21Chan Wing Sengis instructive in the application\nof these elements. In that case, Yong CJ held that the fourth element\nof guilty knowledge refers to whether the accused knew or realised\nthat what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard,\nand is a subjective test (at [23]). On the other hand, the third\nelement of whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective\ninquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the\nreasonable man and the question is to be answered only after the\ncourt has found or inferred what the accused intended when he entered\ninto the transaction. 22     With\nregards the second element of corruption under s 6(a),\nthis is normally part of the same factual enquiry as the third element,\nas stated inChan Wing SengandYuen Chun Yii v Public Prosecutor[1997]\n2 SLR(R) 209 (“Yuen Chun Yii”) and\nas recently followed inTeyTsun Hang v Public Prosecutor[2014] 2\nSLR 1189 (“TeyTsun\nHang”). As stated by Woo Bih Li J inTeyTsun Hangat [17]: Although the second and third elements\n[as stated inPeter Kwang] are conceptually\ndifferent, they are part of the same factual enquiry.The question is whether the recipient received the\ngratification believing that it was given to him as a quid pro quo\nfor conferring a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver in relation\nto his principal’s affairs.The court has treated these\ntwo elements together in its assessment of whether an offence is\nmade out. Thus,the causal, or consequential,\nlink between the gratification and the act of favour alleged to be\nprocuredwas examined …under the\nrubric of an objective corrupt element. [emphasis added] 23     Keeping\nthese elements in mind, we consider the paradigm of corruption under\ns 6(a). As pointed out in the passages\nfrom Tan Boon Gin,The Law of Corruption in\nSingapore(Academy Publishing, 2007) (“The Law\nof Corruption”), and by the Judge at [8] of the Judgment,\nthe starting premise for the paradigm in s 6(a)\nis that it involves at least three parties for a transaction to\nbe corrupt: the principal, the agent, and the person who gives the\ngift (henceforth referred to as “the third party”). The purpose\nof the third party in giving the agent the gift is to cause the\nagent to act in the third party’s interest, and against the interest\nof the principal, in breach of the agent’s duty (The\nLaw of Corruptionat paras 3.4–3.5).The\nLaw of Corruptionproceeds to explain that this paradigm\nof corruption could be found in s 6 of the PCA (at para 3.5): … where the intent behind the transaction\nis to cause an agent to act against his principal’s interest in\nbreach of the duty he owes to his principal, this taints the transaction\nwith an objectively corrupt element for the purposes of s 6 of the\nPCA. … 24     Taking\nthe cases and authorities cited above together, the paradigm of corruption\nunder s 6(a) brings to fore the\ncharacterisation of the gift as being intrinsically tied to the\nthird party’s intention of giving the gift for the purpose of obtaining\na benefit conferred by the agent at the expense of the principal’s\ninterest. In the prosecution of the agent under s 6(a),\nthe intention of the third party would inform the presence of an\nobjective corrupt element in the transaction and the agent’s subjective\nguilty knowledge. The third party’s intention, or ulterior motive,\nis to be considered not only from the third party’s point of view\nbut also from the agent’s (seeChan Wing Sengat\n[41] in relation to the third party; andYuen Chun\nYiiat [93] in relation to the agent). 25     From\nthe perspective of the agent, the reason why an agent’s actions can\nbe considered as being corrupt in a transaction is because the nature\nof the gift or a promise of it is such that it seeks toinfluencethe agent to act improperly,ie, for the benefit of that third party\nwho gave the gift or the promise of it, at the expense of the principal’s\ninterests. This is the objective corrupt element of the transaction.\nWhere the agent recognises the gift or the promise of it as having\nsuch a connection to the conferment of an advantage upon the third\nparty and then goes on to act against the interests of the principal\nfor the benefit of the third party, he would have done so because\nhe had beeninfluencedby the gift\nor the promise of it from the third party. This is the agent’s subjective\nguilty knowledge. Together, they form the agent’smens\nreain a corruption offence under s 6(a). 26     In\neach case, it must be established that there is, first, aquid pro quobetween the gift received\nor promised and the dishonest benefit or gain conferred against\nthe principal’s interests and, second, that the agent perceives\nthis to be so. The agent’s recognition that his actions were objectively\ncorrupt, his subjective knowledge, is crucial becausethe agent must recognise that the gift is meant to\nact as an improper influence on his actions. If the agent\nreceives a gift but does not perceive it to be somehow linked to\nor intended to influence his actionsvis-à-vishis\nprincipal, but does end up benefitting the third party, it would\nbe difficult to see how that gift would have affected the agent’s\nrelationship with the principal, and any benefit conferred upon\nthe third party would be unrelated to the agent’s performance of\nhis duties to the principal.Yuen Chun Yiiprovides\na negative example where the gift was not an influence on the agent.\nYong CJ noted (at [97]) that the $5,000 received by the agent did\nnot affect the performance of the agent’s duties in relation to\nthe principal, and the agent’s actions for the third party were\ndone with the due expedition he would normally have done in performing\nhis dutiesvis-à-vishis principal. There\nwas also no ulterior motive in the receipt of the $5,000 that could\nbe said to be a gratification that was an “inducement or reward”\nand was therefore not caught by the PCA. 27     Woo\nJ had raised inTeyTsun\nHangthe possibility of the fourth element of subjective\nknowledge causing arbitrary results (at [325]): Allowing the recipient’s subjective knowledge\nto come into play could lead to arbitrary results. For example,\na recipient who is a police officer who genuinely believes that\nit is acceptable to receive a sum of money from a suspect because\nthe recipient comes from a society that believes that this is lawful\nconduct may validly claim that the fourth element is not made out.\nI doubt that this is the law in Singapore but I will say no more. We have some reservations with regard to these obiter remarks\nby Woo J. Where the recipient police officer believes that it is\nlawful conduct to receive money from a suspect, the real issue at\nhand is still whether that money from the suspect affected the policeman’s\ndutiesvis-à-vishis principal,\nand in the conferment of a dishonest benefit or advantage upon the\nsuspect. It is not so much the belief in the lawfulness of the conduct. Ultimately,\nit is the influence the gift has on the policeman and his discharge\nof his dutiesvis-à-vishis principal\nthat matters. The policeman may very well recognise that it is lawful\nto receive money, but that should not be the end of the inquiry;\nthe court should go further to determine whether the money did in\nfact improperly influence his actions in a manner that conflicted\nwith his principal’s interests and that the policeman recognised\nthis influence the money would have. 28     We\nfind support for such an analysis from the English understanding of\ncorruption. The offence of corruption in the form of s 6(a) has its roots in the common law offence\nof bribery. “Bribery” was defined in J W Cecil Turner,Russell on Crime(Stevens & Sons,\n1964, 12th Ed) at p 381 as: … the receiving or offering [of] any undue\nreward by or to any person whatsoever, in a public office, in order\nto influence his behaviour in office, and incline him to act contrary\nto the known rules of honesty and integrity. In this definition, the objective of the third party with\nthe gift isto influence behaviour,\nand allow for an agent toform an inclinationto\nact contrary to his principal’s interest. 29     The\nEnglish statutory offence of corruption was created in three statutes\nthat were collectively known as the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889\nto 1916 (perPrevention of Corruption\nAct 1916 (c 64) (UK), s 4(1)), and were targeted at offences within\npublic bodies. Section 6(a) isin parimateriawith\ns 1(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 (c 34) (UK). Section\n1(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 read as follows: If any agent corruptly accepts or obtains,\nor agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for\nhimself or for any other person, any gift or consideration as an\ninducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having\nafter the passing of this Act done or forborne to do, any act in relation\nto his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing\nto show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s\naffairs or business; … he shall be guilty [of an offence] … Notably, the word “corruptly” appeared in the Prevention of\nCorruption Acts 1889 to 1916 but was not defined therein. 30     Subsequently,\nthe Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life, chaired\nby the Rt Hon Lord Salmon from 1974 to 1976 (hereinafter referred\nto as “the Salmon Commission”), recommended that the Prevention\nof Corruption Acts 1989 to 1916 be consolidated and amended. In\nits report, the Salmon Commission analysed the offence of corruption\nas containing three main ingredients (at para 51): (a)     That\na gift or consideration was given or offered by one party to another; (b)     That\nthe gift or consideration was given, or received, as an inducement\nor reward for services to be rendered or already rendered in relation\nto official duties; and (c)     That\nthe transaction took place corruptly. In relation to the second and third ingredients, the Salmon\nCommission considered them as involving themens\nreaof the corrupt act (at para 53): … The prosecution have to establish a particular\nintention on the part of the person giving or receiving a gift –\nnamely that matters relevant to the affairs of a third party (the\npublic body or principal) should beimproperly influenced.\nIt is an offence corruptly to accept a gift offered as an inducement even\nif the recipient has no intention of letting the gift influence\nhis conduct:it is the recipient’s perception\nof the gift as an intended inducement that counts. [emphasis\nadded] In this statement, there is a refinement of the definition\nof “bribery”, and especially so in relation to the establishment\nofmens reain a corrupt act:it is the influence that the received gift would\nhave on the agent and his conduct that matters, and the\nuse of the word “inducement” seems to be synonymous with an improper\ninfluence which the gift would exert on the agent. While the offence\nwas delineated, the definition of “corruptly” was left out on the\nbasis that a statutory definition would fail to capture a corrupt\nintent in all cases. The Salmon Commission’s conclusion was that the\n“law should continue to rely on the ordinary English word ‘corruptly’\nto speak for itself” (at para 56). 31     We\nnote that the elements which Yong CJ had enumerated inPeter Kwang(see [20] above) bear a close\nsimilarity to the three main ingredients that the Salmon Commission\nidentified. Additionally, the reservations that Yong CJ had in defining\n“corrupt” and “corruptly” (seeChan Wing Sengat [26]–[27])\nare similarly alluded to in the report by the Salmon Commission. 32     Twenty\nyears on, the Law Commission published a consultation paper,Legislating the Criminal Code: Corruption (Consultation\nPaper), [1997] EWLC C145 (15 January 1997) followed by\nthe Law Commission Report in 1998,Legislating\nthe Criminal Code: Corruption, LCR 1998, Law Com No 248\n(“the 1998 Report”) in an attempt to codify the law as it stood. The\nLaw Commission similarly stated the essential character of corruption as\nthat set out above at [23]. In the reports, the Law Commission was\nof the view that the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 1916\nconcerned itself not with the breach of duty by the agent but with\nthe influence which the gift had on an agent’s performance of his\nor her functions as an agent (at para 5.73). The 1998 Report took\nthe position that the law of corruption, as it stood, was meant\nto protect the agency relationship of trust and loyalty which is\nbroken by the tempting of the third party; the agent has an obligation\nas the person entrusted to act in the best interests of the principal who\nhas entrusted him or her (at paras 5.22–5.23). Thereal\ncriminality of the agent’s conductlies in the fact that\nthe agent has allowed his or herjudgment to\nbe influencedby a gift or future hope of obtaining oneand thereby performs his or her functions corruptly(at\nparas 5.54 and 5.109). 33     Based\non the approach of the Law Commission, it is evident that the corrupt\nact performed by the agent must be a cause or consequence to the gift\nhe obtains or hopes to obtain, and this is very much the same as\nthequid pro quonature of the gift\nthat Woo J had highlighted inTeyTsun Hang. Moreover, in considering the\nelements of an objective corrupt element to the transaction and\nthe agent’s subjective knowledge, the focus of the enquiry of the\nagent’s intention is not so much on the act of inducement by a third\nparty or the actual receipt of the gift but, more importantly, on\ntheinfluencethat the gift from\nthe third party has on the agent. 34     From\nthe discussion of the various reports above, it is clear that the cornerstone\nof the s 6(a) offence is that the\nagent has been influenced or tempted by the gift given or promised\nby a third party and proceeds to or intends to perform his acts\ncorruptly, and it isthatinfluence\nwhich the law of corruption aims to criminalise. 35     This\nmakes sense when we consider that there is neither a need for any\ngift to have actually passed hands, nor a need to find that the\nfidelity of the agent’s duty has actually been breached before an\nobjective corrupt element is established. In most cases, the breach\nof duty would have occurred, but it is foreseeable that in some\ninstances, there is a possibility that an agent can be prosecuted\nfor corruption when the breach of duty has not yet occurred. For\nexample, where the agent asks for a gift and promises to confer\na benefit or advantage upon the third party which is against the interests\nof the principal and is apprehended before he actually acts, such\na situation would still be caught by s 6(a)\nas seen from the permutation that the offence of corruption is established\nwhen an agent attempts to obtain a gift for “forbearing to show\nfavour” to the third party in relation to his principal’s affairs\nor business. The broad scope of s 6(a)\nis meant to protect the fidelity of the agent/principal relationship\nwhich through the gift (or a promise of it) the third party intends\nto subvert and this is an underlying theme found in the case law\n(seePublic Prosecutor v Mohamed Abdul Gofar[1997] 1 SLR(R) 23\nat [33]). 36     From\nour discussion of the case law and interpretation of s 6(a), it is plainly obvious that under s\n6(a), the gift, or a promise of\nit, must come hand in hand with the third party. It is conceptually\nflawed to say that an agent can influence himself to act contrary\nto the principal by giving a gift to himself. There is also the\nquestion of whom the benefit has been conferred upon if there is\nno third party on whom such a conferment can be made. Without a\nthird party present, s 6(a) is not\nengaged. The provision requires that the agent receives the gift\nor a promise of it “from any person” which in the paradigm is the\nthird party. However, the mere presence of a third party alone would\nnot suffice; it must play the role as the giver of the gift or the\npromisor of the gift to the agent and who has the intention of using\nthe gift to obtain a benefit for himself – this much is also encapsulated within\nthe words of the provision itself where the agent obtains the giftfromthe third partyforthe\nconferment of the benefit. 37     Therefore,\nhaving regard to the paradigm as stated above, it must be kept in\nmind that in considering what constitutes an objective corrupt element\nand the subjective guilty knowledge of an agent, it is crucial to establish\nthat the gift from that third party (given or promised) exerted\naninfluenceover the agent such\nthat he would act corruptly by conferring a dishonest benefit or\nadvantage upon the third party and at the expense of the interests\nof his principal, and the agent recognises that influence to be so.\nThe focus of s 6(a) thus remains\non the possibility of the weakening of the agent/principal relationship\ngiven this external influence. 38     With\nthis understanding, we will now consider the two questions referred\nto us.",
        "Question 1": "39     Question\n1 states: For the purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where\nan agent initiated, master minded or co-conspired in the payment\nof a gratification to himself, does thisipso factomean\nthat he was not induced or rewarded in respect of his principal’s affairs? 40     The\nquestion pertains to whether an agent could be “induced or rewarded”\nin respect of his principal’s affairs where the idea of receiving\na gratification from the third party did not come from the third\nparty but from the agent himself. The focus of the question is on\nthe roles of the agent and the third party in the conception of\nthe transactions and whether they matter to establishing a “gratification”\nfor the purposes of s 6(a). 41     According\nto the Judge, the agent in this case was the master mind or co-conspirator,\nand that he had conceived of the plan with Gary. If so, he could\nnot be said to have been induced to act in the way he did by a third party.\nTo the Judge, the role of the agent mattered to the question of whether\nthe third party could be said to have induced the agent into acting the\nway that he did. If it could not be found that the agent had been\ninduced to act in that manner, the dishonest intent of the agent\nand the objective corrupt element of the transaction could not be\nestablished.",
        "Acts of inducement and “gratification\nas an inducement”": "42     It\nseems to us that the Judge, as well as the PP, conflated the idea\nof inducement as anact of persuasionwith\n“inducement” as adescriptor of a “gratification”\nwithin s 6(a). In the\nJudgment, inducement for the agent to act in the way he did by the\nthird party requires the third party “to prevail on, make, cause,\nencourage (to do something)”. We do not disagree with such a definition\nof an act of inducement. On the other hand, “inducement” is used\nin s 6(a) as constituting “gratification”\nand must be read in that manner. The phrase in the provision is\n“any gratificationas aninducement or\nreward” [emphasis added]. What acts as the inducement or a rewardisthe gratification (and which we have\nreferred to above as “the gift”). This way of considering the elements\nof corruption was accepted inPeter Kwang(see\nabove at [20]) as well as by the Salmon Commission (at para 51): … that the gift or consideration was given,\nor received, as aninducementorrewardfor services to be rendered or\nalready rendered … [emphasis in original] 43     Establishing\nthe gratification as an inducement or reward is only part of the\nfactual enquiry. It must be linked as the cause or consequence of\nthe conferment of the benefit upon the third party as an analysis\nunder the rubric of an objective corrupt element (see above at [25]).\nThus, the correct approach is to ask the question: was there a gratificationbyinducement or reward to the agentthatled to a dishonest or improper gain\nor advantage being conferred by the agent on the third party? This\nretains the importance of establishing the influence the gift has\non the agent and its relation to his acts of conferring the benefit\nupon the third party and at the expense of the interests of his\nprincipal (see above at [37]). The inquiry in relation to an “inducement”\nin the context of s 6(a) isnotabout the presence of an act of inducement\nby the third party. As a matter of principle, whether an objective\ncorrupt element exists, and which is related to a finding of a “gratification”,cannotbe dependent on who initiated the promise\nof a gift. 44     If\nthe finding of an act of inducement by the third party is always necessary\nto establishing a “gratification”, then s 6(a)\nwould be rendered potentially ineffective in certain scenarios and\nlead to absurd outcomes. Should the agent be the first in time in\nasking for the gifteg, because\nthe agent had conceived of the intended transaction and had asked\nfor the gift, he would not be considered corrupt as he was not influenced\nby the third party who agrees with his suggestion to give the gift,\nand does not make the offer in the first place. This would also\nmean that the more outrageously an agent behaves in soliciting for\nthe gift the less likely he would be guilty of the offence of corruption.\nIf “inducement” is interpreted to mean the act of the third party\nin persuading the agent, then such scenarios will not fall within\ns 6(a). That is not only an unsatisfactory\noutcome but also undermines the entire object of PCA. Indeed, common\nsense would suggest that an agent who solicits a “gratification”\nis equally, if not more culpable than one who responds positively\nto receiving a “gratification” by the third party. In addition,\ntwo vital words in s 6(a) – “accepts”\nor “obtains” – clearly point to the passive or active role which\nthe agent could have played in receiving the “gratification” from\nthe third party. This was not considered by the Judge. In our opinion,\nthe initiation of the transaction by a third party does not necessarily\nhave to be found as a fact in all cases in order to establish “gratification”\nunder s 6(a). 45     The\ncase law has also shown that an active procurement of a gift by the\nagent would also be evidence of “gratification”. InTan\nTzeChye v Public Prosecutor[1996] 3 SLR(R) 357,\nthe offender was the managing director of a company in the business\nof property consultancy. He was instructed to sell an industrial\nproperty and was also to secure the printing of publicity brochures\nto promote the sale of the property. The offender approached one\nAng from Akira Advertising Pte Ltd to do the printing, and asked\nAng for a 10% commission. Ang agreed and made the payment out to a\nsole proprietorship managed and run by the offender which was recorded as\nconsultancy services. The offender was charged and convicted with accepting\n$383 as a reward for showing favour to Ang by engaging Akira Advertising\nPte Ltd to do the printing of the brochures. InWong\nTeck Long v Public Prosecutor[2005] 3 SLR(R) 488 (“Wong Teck Long”), the offender who was\na manager of private banking in a Singapore branch of an international\nbank was approached by a borrower to arrange for a quick loan of\nRM100m. The accused suggested to the borrower to open more accounts\nin the name of other high-net-worth individuals thereby circumventing\nthe need to comply with the required approval procedure for a large\nloan. The offender colluded with the borrower in submitting false\ninformation on the net worth of individuals and the loan was approved.\nPursuant to hints to the borrower, the offender obtained a sum between\nRM300,000 and 400,000 as a reward for the help he rendered to the borrower\nand was convicted under s 6(a).\nInPandiyanThanaraju\nRogers v Public Prosecutor[2001] 2 SLR(R) 217, one Manjit\nSingh who needed assurances and wanted to be kept apprised of the\ndetails of his assault case approached the accused who was a police\nofficer. The accused constantly assured Manjit and made representations\nto the effect that he could assist Manjit with police matters. The\naccused later asked for a sum of $2,000 from Manjit, and Manjit\nagreed to it. The accused was charged and convicted for accepting\na sum of $2,000 as an inducement. In the above cases, the third\nparty’s act of inducement of the agent could not have arisen on\nthe facts as it was the agent who had first asked or hinted at a gratification\nto be made. Section 6(a) of the\nPCA therefore allows for a breadth of factual matrices where either\nparty,ie, the agentorthe third party, can initiate the procurement\nof a gift for a benefit to be conferred when establishing the objective\ncorrupt element of the transaction. 46     We\nrecognise, and as also correctly noted by the Judge, where an agent\nplays an equal or greater role in creating the corrupt scheme, it cannot\nbe said that he was persuaded or induced by another to join in the scheme.\nSaying so would be to understate and, indeed, even distort the agent’s\nactual role. That said, and given our foregoing analysis, it is incorrect\nto determine “gratification” based on the act of inducement of the agent\nby the third party as that is not the basis of inquiry when considering whether\nan objective corrupt element exists. Instead, the focus should be\non the nature of the gift and the influence it has on the agent\nand his subsequent actions, which as we mentioned above is key to\nestablishing the objective corrupt element of the transaction and\nthe agent’s subjective guilty knowledge. With respect, we hold that\nthe Judge had erred in defining “inducement” in the context of s\n6(a) in the way that he did, and find\nthat the fact that an agent had not been induced by the third party\ninto entering the scheme is not fatal to establishing the “gratification”\nin the transaction. 47     However,\nwe should add that this isnotto\nsay that the initiation of a scheme is not relevant to the inquiry.\nActive solicitation or acts of inducement by a third party would\ngo towards establishing the circumstances before or after the gratification\nis given and would go some way to show that the agent believed that\nthe gratification that was promised or given to him was so that\nan advantage would be conferred upon the third party or another\nand thereby show that the agent was influenced by the receipt of\nthe gratification or promise of it. To that extent, where it was\nthe third party who initiated the scheme, the third party’s role\nas the initiator will be an important fact to consider, and would\nalso go to establishing the objective corrupt element of the transaction\nand the agent’s guilty knowledge. Of course, evidence that the third\nparty was not corrupt in making the gift (eg,\nbecause he meant it as abona fidegift\nwithout an expectation of a dishonest gain or advantage) would also\nbe relevant in establishing what the intention or ulterior motive\nbehind the giving or promise of the gratification was (seeChan Wing Sengat [37] and [41]). 48     In\nconclusion, we answer Question 1 in thenegative.\nWe are of the view that it is not necessary in every case of establishing\nthe “gratification” of the transaction that it must be proven, as\na fact, that there was an act of inducement by the third party upon\nthe agent. Such a finding may not arise in all cases and will be\nlargely dependent on the facts before the court.",
        "Question 2": "49     Question\n2 states: For the purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where\nan agent used his position (vis-à-vishis\nprincipal) to create an arrangement for the payment of a gratification\nthat conflicts with the interests of his principal, does thisipso factomean that the agent was not,\nby such arrangement, induced or rewarded for showing favours in\nrespect of his principal’s affairs? 50     On\nthe face of it, Question 2 seems to raise very much the same query as\nQuestion 1. However, in the light of the views of the Judge and\nthe PP’s submissions, we have taken it to have raised the query\nwhether, in a situation where the agent has some beneficial or legal\ninterest in the third party, the agent’s drawing of his share of\nthe profits obtained by that third party from the benefits conferred\ncould be considered a “gratification” for the purposes of s 6(a). 51     According\nto the Judgment, the money that was received by the Respondent should\nbe considered as secret profits which he shared with his partners\nand such profits could not amount to a “gratification” for the purposes\nof s 6(a). The crux of the Judge’s\nreasoning is that the benefits which the Respondent conferred on\nAT35 and FRT were effectively secret profits which the Respondent\nhad created for himself using AT35 and FRT as business entities.\nThe Judge was of the view that the agent was effectively benefitting\nhimself which meant that there was no third party upon whom the\nagent was conferring a benefit – the party that the agent was conferring a\nbenefit upon included, or was, himself, as there was some evidence\nof equal ownership in the two entities by Andrew, Gary and the Respondent (see\n[13]–[14] of the Judgment). In other words, when the Respondent drew\nhis entitlement from the profits obtained by the two entities (his\none-third share), that was his share of the secret profits and could\nnot be considered as “gratification”. He was withdrawing what was\nhis as he had a beneficial ownership in the third party (ie, the two entities). The Judge’s analysis\nthus proceeded on the basis that because of this, it could not amount\nto a corrupt transaction. In other words, you could not give a gratification\nto yourself. 52     Two\nrelated issues arise from the Judge’s findings: (i) where a benefit is\nconferred upon an entity in which an agent has a beneficial interest,\ncould such an entity be the third party for the purposes of s 6(a); and (ii) whether the agent receiving\nhis share of the profit made from the benefit conferred upon the\nentity would constitute “gratification” for the purposes of s 6(a). As these two issues are closely connected,\nwe will consider them together. 53     We\nalso note, cursorily, that while what are loosely termed as “secret profits”\nmay be the subject of an actionable civil wrong, that does not preclude\nit from being relied upon as evidence of an objective corrupt element.\nNothing in the PCA provides that civil wrongs cannot also be a criminal\nwrong. Prosecution of cases such as the present do not amount to the\n“broadening [of] the scope of the offence of corruption” as the\nPCA can capture civil wrongs in the appropriate cases (see [14]\nof the Judgment).",
        "Interest in a third party": "54     The\nstarting premise is – what should the court be concerned about when\nthe agent has some form of a beneficial or legal interest in the\nthird party which is conferred the benefit? 55     In\nthis regard, we would make the following observations. It must be borne\nin mind that persons who have a shareholding, legal and/or beneficial\nownership or interest in a legal entity are not synonymous with that\nlegal entity, and the two must be treated as distinct. We do not\nsee why the separate legal entity doctrine should not otherwise\napply in the context of s 6(a). 56     In\nthis case, the vehicles used to confer the benefits were two business entities\n(AT35 and FRT), which were not incorporated companies. However,\nwe do not think that that should matter as the two business entities\nwere no less separate entities from the people who owned them. Following\nthe doctrine of separate legal entity, some form of ownership in\na legal entity does not preclude it from being considered a third\nparty for the purposes of s 6(a).\nOn that premise, an agent’s ownership in the entity does not alter\nthe fact that it is a separate legal entity and is a third party\ndistinct from the agent and his principal. The position of the agent\nin the entity would be like any other person who has a beneficial\nor legal ownership in the entity. Thus, the mere fact that the agent\nis a legal and/or beneficial owner of the third party does not mean\nthat the requirement for there to be an agent, principal, and third\nparty under s 6(a) cannot be satisfied.\nWe would hasten to add that there may be situations in which, due\nto the fact that the agent owns the third party, that the lines\nbetween the agent and the third party may be blurred. For example,\nwhere the third party is a sole proprietorship with the agent being\nthe proprietor or the third party is an incorporated company with\nthe agent being the sole shareholder. In such circumstances, arguably\nthe agent and the third party could be considered (looking at the\nsubstance) to be the same or identical. Such a situation does not\narise in the present case and there is thus no need for us to make\na definite ruling on the PCA’s proscription for such situations.\nAccordingly we say no more and leave it for another day. 57     Where\nthe three parties are established, and s 6(a)\nis engaged, whether the secret profits received by the agent would\nbe considered a “gratification” would be dependent on the same factual\ninquiry of an objective corrupt element that we posited earlier\n(at [43]): was there a gratificationbyinducement\nor reward to the agentthatled\nto a dishonest gain or advantage being conferred by the agent on\nthe third party? 58     So,\nthe court will balance the fact that the agent had an entitlement\nto the profits made by the beneficially owned legal entities with\nthe other facts which might otherwise show that an objective corrupt\nelement is still present. Some relevant, but non-exhaustive, factors\nwould be: the workings of the scheme; how the secret profits were\nderived; the setting up of the third party; the duration and purpose\nof the third party; fair competition against other entities for\ncontracts with the principal; fair competition against the principal\nfor contracts by other parties; and the agent’s actionsvis-à-vis, the principal and the third\nparty in making the profit. Depending on the facts of the case,\nthe scheme may be considered as having an objectively corrupt element\ndespite the agent’s beneficial interest in the monies received by\nthe third party. 59     It\nwould thus be incorrect to assume that simply because the agent\nhas a part ownership in the third party and the agent has obtained\nhis share of the profits from it that the agent could not be said\nto have obtained that share of the profits as a “gratification”.\nAn inquiry into all the circumstances of the case is called for.\nThe Judge had erred in thinking that because the Respondent had\nsome beneficial ownership in the third party (AT35 and FRT) and\nhad merely obtained his share of the profits of AT35 and FRT that\na corrupt transaction could not thereby take place. The beneficial\nownership and the agent’s share of the profits obtained are only part\nof the picture, and a proper inquiry must be made into the true\nnature of the arrangements between the agent and the third party.\nOtherwise, it would be all too simple for an agent to devise inventive\nand sophisticated schemes related to skimming secret profits off\nthe principal in order to escape the sanction of s 6(a). An agent who seeks to obtain a gift\nunder the guise of a cleverly devised scheme may very well find\nhimself guilty of corruption as the court will not hesitate to look\nbeyond the pretext or the guise and determine the presence of an\nobjective corrupt element in the transaction and the true nature\nof the arrangement. 60     Therefore,\nour answer to Question 2 is in thenegative.\nWhere the agent has a beneficial interest or ownership in a legal\nentity, this does not mean that the entity is not a separate legal\nentity and is not a third party for the purposes of s 6(a). In determining whether so-called secret\nprofits received by the agent are a “gratification”, the court will\ntake into consideration the agent’s beneficial interest in the profits,\nbut this is not determinative. The court must consider all the facts\nsurrounding the transaction to see if an objective corrupt element\nis present.",
        "Conclusion": "61     Given\nour analysis and for the reasons above, we have arrived at the conclusion\nthat both the questions referred to this court, and which relate to\ns 6(a), must be answered in thenegative. 62     Under\ns 397(5) of the CPC, this court may make such orders as the High\nCourt might have made as this court considers just for the disposal\nof the case. In light of our answers to the questions raised in\nthis criminal reference, parties are to address us on the appropriate\norders that this court should make in relation to the decision of\nthe Judge."
