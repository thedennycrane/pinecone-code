        "Facts": "2 At the time of his arrest in April 2000, the Appellant was unemployed, although\n\nhe had occasionally been deployed as a daily-rated painter by two contractors. On 11 April 2000, the\n\nAppellant was the subject of a surveillance operation conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)\n\nat a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat at Block 6 Jalan Minyak, #12-362, which was registered\n\nin the Appellant's name. In the early evening, the Appellant was seen leaving the flat in the\n\ncompany of one Abdul Rahman bin Mohd Noor. The Appellant was seen carrying a brown paper bag on\n\nwhich was printed the word \"CAPTIONS\". The Appellant and Abdul Rahman then met up with one\n\nZamri bin Mohd Ali at the void deck of Block 6. The Appellant and Zamri then boarded a lorry,\n\nregistration number YD 8173 P, driven by one Rumli bin Sarib. Also on board the lorry were one Ng\n\nSick Yong and one Jaseni bin Latip. Abdul Rahman was seen boarding the lorry shortly afterwards,\n\nalong Chin Swee Road.3 The lorry was subsequently intercepted by CNB officers near a JTC flatted\n\nfactory in Kallang Bahru. The Appellant and the 5 other persons in the lorry were arrested. CNB\n\nofficers found the \"CAPTIONS\" brown paper bag carried by the Appellant in the front cabin\n\nof the lorry. The bag contained 8 envelopes and a red plastic bag containing a total of 81 sachets\n\nof a substance believed to be heroin, and subsequently confirmed by the Department of Scientific\n\nServices as containing not less than 24.4 grams of diamorphine. In respect of the possession of\n\nthese sachets, the Appellant was charged with trafficking in a controlled drug, or, more\n\nspecifically, with possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(2) of\n\nthe Misuse of Drugs Act (the 1st charge).4 Also found on the Appellant's person at the time of his arrest was a bunch of 3\n\nkeys to the Appellant's HDB flat at Block 6 Jalan Minyak. Later that evening, a CNB team,\n\naccompanied by the Appellant used these keys to enter the flat, where, upon searching the bedroom,\n\nthey recovered a white plastic bag on which the words \"Maxim Cakes\" were printed. The bag\n\ncontained 2 packets and 12 sachets of a substance believed to be heroin, and subsequently confirmed\n\nby the Department of Scientific Services as containing not less than 77.40 grams of diamorphine. In\n\nrespect of the possession of these packets and sachets, the Appellant was similarly charged with\n\ntrafficking in a controlled drug, or, more specifically, with possession of a controlled drug for\n\nthe purpose of trafficking under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the 2nd charge).5 Also found in the \"Maxim Cakes\" bag at the time of the search were a\n\ndigital weighing scale, two candles, two metal spoons, two used envelopes, a stack of 9 envelopes,\n\nsome more envelopes and a stack of 346 empty sachets. In a carton near the bed, another white\n\nplastic bag was recovered, which was found to contain 2320 empty sachets arranged in 5 stacks.\n\nEvidence was given in the court below that the spoons could be used to repack the heroin from the\n\nlarger packets into the smaller sachets, the weight of each sachet measured using the digital\n\nweighing scale, and the packed sachets sealed with the candles.Appellant's Statements6 In statements made to the CNB, the Appellant stated that the heroin retreived\n\nfrom the \"CAPTIONS\" brown paper bag and the \"Maxim Cakes\" white plastic bag\n\nbelonged to a Chinese at Geylang Lorong 37, known as \"Ah Mike\". The Appellant said that he\n\nfirst dealt with \"Ah Mike\" four days prior to his arrest, when an unknown quantity of\n\nheroin was delivered to him by an unidentified individual, to be repacked by the Appellant into\n\nsmaller sachets. The Appellant did so, and 2 hours later, returned the sachets to another\n\nunidentified Chinese man at Geylang Lorong 37, for which he was paid $1000.7 On the night before his arrest, the Appellant was out drinking at the market\n\nplace at Geylang Lorong 2 in the company of Abdul Rahman and another man known only as\n\n\"Ahmad\". At about 3 a.m. on 11 April 2000, Abdul Rahman left by taxi. Ahmad left at 5 a.m.\n\nThe Appellant continued drinking until about 8 a.m. At about 10 a.m. he received a call on his\n\nhandphone informing him that \"someone was coming\", by which he understood that he was to\n\nreceive a new delivery of drugs. At 11 a.m. on 11 April 2000, two male Chinese drove up in a\n\nMalaysia-registered vehicle. The Appellant walked to the car and removed a brown paper bag from the\n\nback seat. This was the same brown paper bag seized from the Appellant at the time of his arrest. No\n\nwords were exchanged and the two Chinese drove off.8 The Appellant then took a taxi back to his flat at Block 6 Jalan Minyak, where\n\nhe inspected the contents of the the brown paper bag. Inside, the Appellant found 8 envelopes\n\ncontaining small packets of heroin and a plastic bag containing 2 big packets of heroin. He stored\n\nthe plastic bag on the floor of the bedroom, next to the wardrobe. The Appellant then waited for a\n\ncall on his handphone. At about 4 p.m., he received a call instructing him to bring the 8 envelopes\n\ncontaining small packets of heroin to \"the same place\", which the Appellant understood to\n\nmean Geylang Lorong 37, at about 6 p.m. that day.9 Shortly after receiving the call, the Abdul Rahman came to the Appellant's\n\nflat, where the Appellant gave him a small quantity of heroin to smoke. According to the Appellant,\n\nAbdul Rahman had no knowledge of the brown paper bag and its contents, or of the plastic bag\n\ncontaining two big packets of heroin. At around 6 p.m., the Appellant and Abdul Rahman left the\n\nflat. Soon after, at the void deck, the Appellant, by chance, met an individual known as Zamri bin\n\nMohd Ali (whom the Appellant knew as \"Hassan\"). Zamri told the Appellant that he was going\n\nto Tampines by lorry. The Appellant asked Zamri for a lift and Hassan agreed. Zamri also agreed to\n\ngive Abdul Rahman a lift, as he was also going to Tampines. The lorry was subsequently intercepted\n\nby the CNB, as explained in the course of events narrated above.The Appeal10 The quantities of diamorphine contained in the heroin found in both the\n\n\"CAPTIONS\" brown paper bag and the \"Maxim Cakes\" white plastic bag exceeded the\n\nstatutory amount (2 grammes) required to activate the rebuttable presumption under s 17 of the\n\nMisuse of Drugs Act that the Appellant possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. This in\n\nturn activated s 5(2) which provides that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a\n\ncontrolled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. On this basis,\n\nthe Judicial Commissioner convicted the Appellant of both charges.11 In his Petition of Appeal, the Appellant contended that the Judicial\n\nCommissioner erred in finding that he had failed, on a balance of probabilities, to rebut the\n\npresumption arising under s 17 that he possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Section\n\n17 provides that the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking can be rebutted if the\n\naccused proves that his possession of the drug is for some other purpose. In this context, it was\n\nargued that the evidence showed that the appellant's purpose in having possession of the drugs was\n\nto repack them into smaller sachets and to return them to their owner, the Chinese man known as\n\n\"Ah Mike\". It was the Appellant's case that possession for the purpose repacking is not\n\nequivalent to possession for the purpose of trafficking. This argument was rejected by the Judicial\n\nCommissioner, and we agreed with his conclusion.12 Section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act provides that\"traffic\" means(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a),otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations; and\n\n  \"trafficking\" has a corresponding meaning;InLee Yuan Kwang & Ors v PP[1995] 2 SLR 249the Court of Appeal\n\nruled that possession of drugs with the intention of returning them to their rightful owner did not\n\nrebut the s 17 presumption. In other words, possession as a bailee or custodian of the drugs still\n\namounts to possession for the purpose of trafficking. See alsoGoh Hock Huat v PP[1995] 1 SLR 274andSze Siew Luan v PP[1997] 2 SLR 522. InLee's case, the Court of Appeal\n\ndistinguished an earlier decision,PP v Wan Yue Kong & Ors[1995] 1 SLR 417in which two\n\ndefendants were convicted of possessionsimpliciterunder s 8 in circumstances where they\n\nknew of the presence of drugs in the flat but the drugs were left there by a third person who had\n\nintended to retreive them from the premises. The Court inLeeemphasised that this was a\n\nprosecution that had been brought under the law prior to the 1993 amendment to the Misuse of Drugs\n\nAct that introduced s 17, and that in the absence of evidence showing overt acts of trafficking, the\n\nelements of the more serious offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking were not made out.\n\nPrior to the introduction of s 17, mere possession of the proscribed amount did not shift the burden\n\nto the defendants to disprove possession for the purpose of trafficking.13 In this appeal, the Appellant argued that he ought to have been convicted of\n\npossessionsimpliciterand not possession for the purpose of trafficking because he only\n\nintended to repack the drugs. We do not see how that line of reasoning can is reconcileable with the\n\nCourt of Appeal's ruling inLee Yuan Kwang. Here, the Appellant, in addition to being in\n\npossession of the drugs, admitted in his statements to the CNB that he intended to repack them,\n\nostensibly with a view to resale by \"Ah Mike\". The Appellant's arguments that this did not\n\nconstitute trafficking flew in the face of reason, and, if we were to accept it, would have\n\nundermined a fundamental objective of the statute. In any event, this argument, even if we were to\n\naccept it, would only have assisted the Appellant in the 2nd charge. In relation to the 1st charge,\n\nthe evidence showed that the Appellant was merely delivering the same 8 envelopes he had collected\n\nat Geylang Lorong 2 to Geylang Lorong 37, which falls squarely within the definition of\n\n\"trafficking\" in s 2.14 In the circumstances, we dismissed the appeal, and confirmed the imposition of\n\nthe capital sentence as required by the Act."
