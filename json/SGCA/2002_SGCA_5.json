        "The background": "2.    The facts of the case are quite straightforward. The respondents,\n\nChiu Teng Construction Co Pte Ltd (\"Chiu Teng\"), were the main contractors of a\n\nhousing development located at the junction of Yio Chu Kang Road and Lentor Avenue known\n\nas \"The Countryside\" (the \"estate\"). Sometime in early January 1996,\n\nthe insured under the policy, Brentford Construction (S) Pte Ltd (\"Brentford\"),\n\nwas carrying out sheet-pile extraction works at an adjacent lot to the estate. These works\n\ncaused soil movement which resulted in damage to some of the houses in the estate. Because\n\nof that, rectification works had to be carried out by Chiu Teng, which included the\n\ninstallation of some 30 micropiles as foundation supports for the boundary walls and\n\nretaining walls of the affected houses. Chiu Teng’s engineer had doubts whether the\n\nfrictional resistance of the existing foundation would be adequate to secure the\n\nstructures and thus advised that the micropiles be installed. The costs of this item alone\n\namounted to slightly more than 50% of the total expenses incurred by Chiu Teng in relation\n\nto the rectification works.3.    Under the terms of the policy, Hartford agreed to indemnify\n\nBrentford against \"such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as\n\ndamages\" consequent upon accidental loss or damage to property belonging to third\n\nparties occurring in direct connection with the construction or erection works carried out\n\nby Brentford. Hartford also agreed, in respect of a claim for compensation to which the\n\nindemnity applied, that it would, in addition, indemnify Brentford against all costs and\n\nexpenses of litigation which Brentford had to pay to the third party claimant.4.    On 24 April 1998, Brentford was wound up by an order of court,\n\nwith the Official Receiver being appointed liquidator. Chiu Teng sought to recover the\n\nloss it suffered on account of the rectification works from Brentford. In view of\n\nBrentford’s winding up, on 12 February 1999, leave of court was obtained by Chiu Teng\n\nto commence proceedings against it. A writ was duly issued on 16 March 1999. On 11 May\n\n1999, an interlocutory judgment was obtained with the consent of the Official Receiver. On\n\n30 May 2000, an assessment of damages was conducted. Witnesses were called on behalf of\n\nChiu Teng. The Official Receiver chose not to participate in the assessment. Judgment for\n\nthe sum of $466,600.08 was granted to Chiu Teng, with interest at 6% p.a. from the date on\n\nwhich the writ was served on Brentford (collectively referred to as \"the judgment\n\nsum\"). We should add that Hartford was informed of this action but chose not to get\n\ninvolved as it felt it was not liable to Brentford under the policy. For convenience, this\n\njudgment shall hereinafter be referred to as \"the earlier judgment\".5.    On 11 August 2000, in reliance on s 1(1) of the 1930 Act, Chiu\n\nTeng commenced the present action against Hartford seeking payment of the judgment sum.6.    In the court below, Hartford raised two main lines of defence. The\n\nfirst line related to policy defences (i.e., that the damage caused did not fall within\n\nthe scope of the policy), which the court below ruled were without any merits. Of course,\n\nif the court had held in favour of Hartford on these defences, then Chiu Teng, who stepped\n\ninto the shoes of Brentford, could have no better claim against Hartford. A related\n\ndefence, based on limitation, also failed. We need say no more on these policy defences\n\nbecause before us Hartford is not challenging these rulings of the court below.7.    The second line of defence was that the judgment sum obtained by\n\nChiu Teng against Brentford was not binding on Hartford and, that Chiu Teng should prove\n\nall over again the quantum of their loss. In this defence, Hartford did not dispute\n\nBrentford's liability to Chiu Teng, but only the reasonableness of the latter's claim and,\n\nspecifically, it said that it was wholly unnecessary for Chiu Teng to install the\n\nmicropiles and that the costs incurred thereby should be irrecoverable.8.    The judge below, Woo Bih Li JC, also rejected this second line of\n\ndefence. He held that Hartford was, by virtue of the earlier judgment, estopped from\n\nchallenging the extent of liability or the quantum which the court had held Brentford to\n\nbe liable to Chiu Teng. It was unnecessary for Chiu Teng to establish all over again the\n\nreasonableness of its claim. His reasoning was simply this: under the policy, Brentford\n\nwas entitled to be indemnified by Hartford as to the judgment sum and as under s 1(1) of\n\nthe 1930 Act, following the winding up of Brentford, Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of\n\nBrentford, Chiu Teng should similarly be entitled to be indemnified by Hartford.",
        "Appeal": "9.    Before us, the main contention of Hartford is that the judge below\n\nerred when he held that the earlier judgment obtained by Chiu Teng against Brentford was\n\nbinding and conclusive as against Hartford. It argued that such a decision would require\n\nan insurer to engage itself in legal proceedings even before it is established that the\n\ninsurer is liable to indemnify the insured in respect of the losses allegedly caused by\n\nthe insured to a third party. This could not be correct. Unnecessary costs would thereby\n\nhave to be incurred by the insurer and this, in turn, would have a detrimental effect on\n\ninsureds in general, as it could lead to an escalation of premiums payable.",
        "The authorities": "10.    The starting point for the consideration of the issue must be the\n\ncaseParker v Lewis[1873] 8 Chancery App 1035 where the facts were somewhat\n\ncomplicated. The case involved the directors of a bank and two related companies in a\n\nscheme to deceive the Stock Exchange by making it appear that one of the two companies had\n\nmoneys which it did not have and to also make it appear that the company had allotted\n\n40,000 shares which were paid for and which was not the case. The scheme was intended to\n\ndeceive all the persons, who might be induced by means of that sham, into taking up shares\n\nin the company. Shareholders of the bank brought an action against the directors of the\n\nbank for an indemnity. The substantive decision of the case concerned a procedural point\n\nas to the proper party to bring an action on behalf of the company. However, Mellish LJ\n\nexpressed the followingobiter dictaas to what an indemnifier could dispute in a\n\ncase of an express contract of indemnity:-\"I think that the law with reference to express contracts of\n\n  indemnity is, that if a person has agreed to indemnify another against a particular claim\n\n  or a particular demand, and an action is brought on that demand, he may then give notice\n\n  to the person who has agreed to indemnify him to come in and defend the action, and if he\n\n  does not come in, and refuses to come in, he may then compromise at once on the best terms\n\n  he can, and then bring an action on the contract of indemnity. On the other hand, if he\n\n  does not choose to trust the other person with the defence to the action, he may, if he\n\n  pleases, go on and defend it, and then, if the verdict is obtained against him, and\n\n  judgment signed upon it, I agree that at law that judgment, in the case of express\n\n  contract of indemnity is conclusive. But I apprehend it is conclusive on account of what\n\n  the law considers the true meaning of such a contract of indemnity to be. It is obvious\n\n  that when a person has entered into a bond, or bought land, or altered his position in any\n\n  way on the faith of a contract of indemnity, and an action is brought against him for the\n\n  matter against which he was indemnified, and a verdict of a jury obtained against him, it\n\n  would be very hard, indeed, if, when he came to claim the indemnity, the person against\n\n  whom he claimed it could fight the question over again, and run the chance of whether a\n\n  second jury would take a different view and give an opposite verdict to the first.\n\n  Therefore, by reason of that contract of indemnity, the judgment is conclusive; but in my\n\n  opinion it is conclusive because that is the meaning of the contract between the parties,\n\n  for it unquestionably is not the general rule of law that a judgment obtained by A against\n\n  B is conclusive in an action by B against C.\"11.    InPost Office v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Ltd [1967]\n\n1 All ER, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the need for an insured (and in turn the injured\n\nthird party who steps into the shoes of the insured under s 1 of the 1930 Act) to\n\nestablish that he is legally liable to pay compensation to the third party before an\n\naction against the insurers to seek indemnity may be made. In that case the public\n\nliability policy provided that the insurer \"will indemnify (the insured) against all\n\nsums which (the insured) shall become legally liable to pay as compensation in respect of\n\n… loss of or damage to property.\" The Post Office (the third party) sued the\n\ninsurers claiming for the loss of damage in the sum of about 839, as statutory assignees\n\nof the insured by virtue of s 1(1) of the 1930 Act. The Court of Appeal noted that while\n\nthe liability of the insured to the Post Office arose at the time of the accident, the\n\n\"rights\" of the insured against the insurers did not arise at that time but\n\nhaving regard to the scope of the policy, only when the insured’s liability \"to\n\nthe injured person has been established\" and, that liability must be\n\n\"ascertained and determined to exist, either by judgment of the court or by an award\n\nin an arbitration or by agreement.\" Lord Denning MR specifically addressed the\n\nprocedural problem which would arise where the insured was a company and had been wound\n\nup, as follows:-\"How is this to be done? If there is an unascertained claim for\n\n  damages in tort, it cannot be proved in the bankruptcy, nor in the liquidation of the\n\n  company; but the injured person can bring an action against the wrongdoer. In the case of\n\n  a company, he must get the leave of the court. No doubt leave would automatically be\n\n  given. The insurance company can fight that action in the name of the wrongdoer. In that\n\n  way liability can be established and the loss ascertained. Then the injured person can go\n\n  against the insurance company.\"12.    Hartford relies on the caseMercantile Investment &\n\nGeneral Trust Co v River Plate Trust, Loan and Agency Co[1894] 1 Ch 578 to contend\n\nthat estoppel does not apply in the present case and that it is entitled to question the\n\nquantum of the loss suffered by Chiu Teng. In that case, an English company purchased the\n\nundertaking and property of an American company and covenanted to indemnify the American\n\ncompany against its debts and obligations. Pursuant to a power of compromise contained in\n\na debenture trust deed given by the American company, a resolution was passed by a\n\nmajority of the debenture holders accepting, in lieu of the debentures, shares in the\n\nEnglish company. The Mercantile Company, which did not agree with the resolution on the\n\nground that the condition necessary for the exercise of the power had not existed,\n\nabsented itself from the meeting. It subsequently sued and obtained a judgment against the\n\nAmerican company for arrears of interest due on their debentures. The English company\n\nassisted the American companies in defence of that action and even paid the costs thereof.\n\nIn a second action, the Mercantile Company, suing on behalf of all the debenture holders,\n\nsought to enforce against the English Company and the lands assigned to them by the\n\nAmerican company, the charge on such lands purported to be given by the debentures. The\n\nlands were located in Mexico. Due to an omission to effect registration of the charge,\n\nwhich registration was essential, the debenture holders thus never acquired a valid charge\n\non the land according to the law of Mexico.13.    Romer J held that the judgment obtained by the Mercantile Company\n\ndid not estop the English company from adducing evidence to show that through\n\nnon-registration of the charge under the debenture, circumstances had existed which were\n\nsufficient to bring the power of compromise into operation and the resolution was\n\ntherefore binding on the Mercantile Company.14.    In our view, the decision in that case is distinguishable and\n\nthis can be gleaned from the following passage of Romer J (at 595):\"In that action the (Mercantile company) were only seeking to\n\n  enforce in this country a personal claim against the American Company; and the American\n\n  Company in their defence and counter-claim were seeking to free themselves and their\n\n  assets, including the land in question, from a personal claim and not from a claim\n\n  constituting, if established, a valid charge on the land. Nothing was decided in that\n\n  action which in any way bound the land,..Lastly, it was said that, inasmuch as the American Company defended\n\n  with the knowledge and approval of the English Company, the latter would be estopped under\n\n  their covenant of indemnity from disputing the judgment as against the American Company\n\n  suing them on the express covenant of indemnity. That is quite true. But this is not an\n\n  action on the covenant of indemnity. The estoppel last referred to is only between the\n\n  party indemnifying and the party indemnified, and arises only by virtue of a term implied\n\n  in an express covenant of indemnity.\"15.    Apart from the peculiar features in the case, it is important to\n\nnote that there was, then, no equivalent provision to s 1(1) of the 1930 Act which the\n\ncourt there had to consider. But it would be seen that Romer J held that estoppel would\n\nhave applied if the American company were to sue the English company on the indemnity. The\n\neffect of s 1(1) is to enable Chiu Teng to step into the shoes of Brentford. On the\n\nprinciple spelt out by Romer J, if Brentford were to sue Hartford, the latter would be\n\nestopped. And since under s 1(1) Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of Brentford, Hartford\n\nshould similarly be estopped in the action by Chiu Teng.16.    A Malaysian case,Tee Liam Toh v National Employer’s\n\nMutual General Insurance Association Ltd(unreported) (OM No 50 of 1963), is also\n\npertinent. There, the plaintiff who was the employer of an employee-driver, took out a\n\nworkman’s compensation policy with the insurers. The driver, while loading some goods\n\ncollapsed and died of heart failure. The dependants of the driver claimed for\n\nworkmen’s compensation. The employer disputed the claim. The arbitrator under the\n\nWorkmen’s Compensation Ordinance ruled against the employer-plaintiff (first\n\narbitration). The plaintiff claimed for indemnity under the policy against the insurers\n\nwho resisted the claim. The dispute went before an arbitrator (second arbitration) who\n\nheld that the driver’s death was due to natural causes and that the injury did not\n\narise out of or in the course of the employment. Accordingly, the insurers were held not\n\nliable to indemnify the employer-plaintiff and the latter in turn moved the High Court to\n\nhave the second award remitted for re-consideration or set aside. Ong J held that as the\n\nfirst arbitration was properly constituted and an award was given, the insurers were\n\nprecluded from raising the same question again before the second arbitration and they\n\nshould pay the employer-plaintiff in accordance with the Workmen’s Compensation\n\npolicy unless they could show that the employer-plaintiff was in breach of any of the\n\nconditions of the policy. As there was an error on the face of the second award in not\n\ngiving effect to the estoppel, Ong J remitted the second award for re-consideration by the\n\narbitrator. In coming to his decision, Ong J had relied upon the views expressed by\n\nMellish LJ inParker v Lewis(quoted in 10 above). He amplified his ruling as\n\nfollows:-\"… with full notice of a claim against their insured, the\n\n  insurance company elected to lift not a finger to assist their insured or protect\n\n  themselves by defending the claim. Under condition three they had the right to take over\n\n  conduct of the defence against the claim put forward by the dependants of the deceased,\n\n  and, if dissatisfied with the decision, they should have appealed. Having left their\n\n  insured to carry the burden, they nevertheless subsequently insisted on raising the very\n\n  same questions before the arbitrator which had already been decided by a competent\n\n  tribunal against their insured. Of course, they are precluded by the decision of the\n\n  learned President, as arbitrator, from agitating these questions again.\"17.    We should add that counsel for Hartford does not question the\n\ndecision inTee Liam Tohbut only seeks to distinguish it from the present case on\n\nthe basis that in the earlier action by Chiu Teng against Brentford, the latter did not\n\ndispute the quantum of claim of Chiu Teng, whereas inTeo Liam Tohthe questions of\n\nliability and quantum were thrashed out in the first arbitration. It is therefore\n\nnecessary for us to determine whether this distinction is really valid in the context of s\n\n1(1).18.    There are two other cases cited by Hartford which we must refer\n\nto. The first isBen Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v An Bord Bainne The C Joyce[1986] 2 All ER 177. There, cargo owners claimed damages against the shipowners for damage to cargo\n\nand short delivery. The shipowners invited the charterers to take over the defence on the\n\nbasis that under the terms of the charterparty the ultimate responsibility for the loss of\n\nthe cargo would rest with the charterers. The charterers refused to accept the invitation\n\npresumably because they did not think they had to indemnify the shipowners. The shipowners\n\nsettled the claim and sought to be indemnified by the charterers. Bingham J (as he then\n\nwas) held that the charterers were not liable under the charterparty to indemnify the\n\nshipowners. However, he went on to express the view that, even if the charterers were so\n\nliable, they were not precluded from contesting the liability of the shipowners to the\n\ncargo owners and/or the reasonableness of the settlement of the claim. We think it highly\n\nrelevant to note the conclusion of Bingham J where he said (at p. 187):-\" … to succeed in their estoppel claim, the shipowners must\n\n  establish as a matter of law that having given notice to the charterers of the claim made\n\n  against them (the shipowners) in South Africa, and the charterers having declined to\n\n  conduct the defence, and the shipowners having compromised the claim, they (the\n\n  charterers) are estopped from contesting the liability of the shipowners to the third\n\n  party in South Africa and the reasonableness of the compromise and the incurring of costs,even though there was no express contract of indemnity and the charterers bona fide and\n\n  on reasonable grounds challenged the shipowners’ right to indemnity and the claim was\n\n  settled without immediate reference to the charterers.I do not think any such\n\n  principle can be clearly found in the authorities relied on. Nor do I think it desirable\n\n  to attempt to lay down such a far reaching principle. It is of course good sense and\n\n  common practice for a defendant to give notice of a claim against him and any proposed\n\n  settlement to a person against whom he intends to seek indemnity or contribution, if such\n\n  person is not joined as a third party. This gives that person the opportunity to raise any\n\n  points or objections he wishes, and will make it somewhat harder for him to raise\n\n  arguments later which he could have raised at the time. It is, however, a large stride\n\n  from a commonsense tactical practice to a rule of law. The present case is a good example\n\n  of how unfairly such a rule could work. The charterers did not (it seems reasonable to\n\n  infer) believe they were bound to indemnify the shipowners against the South African\n\n  claim.Even if one assumes that they were wrong in that belief, it remains the fact\n\n  that they need have had and in all probability had no knowledge at all of how the cargo\n\n  damage occurred. Having dissociated themselves from the proceedings they knew nothing of\n\n  the terms of settlement.The rule contended for would present the charterers with a\n\n  choice between taking over the defence of a claim which they believed to be nothing to do\n\n  with them and thereafter (if that belief was falsified) finding themselves bound to\n\n  indemnify the shipowners against settlement of a claim even though the claim could be\n\n  shown to be ill-founded or the settlement unreasonable. The authorities may well support,\n\n  and I can see virtue in, a much more limited principle, but that would not avail the\n\n  shipowners here.\" (emphasis added).19.    The second is the recent Scottish case,Cheltenhem &\n\nGloucester plc v Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Co(delivered on 30 May 2001)\n\nwhere the Inner House (Court of Session), overruling a decision of the Outer House and\n\nheld that the insurers were entitled to dispute the insured’s liability to the third\n\nparty as part of a defence to a claim under the insurance policy bought by the insured,\n\neven if that liability had already been established by a court judgment. There, the\n\nplaintiffs sued a solicitor for professional negligence. The solicitor’s insurers\n\ninvestigated the plaintiff’s claim and, for a time, conducted the solicitor’s\n\ndefence, before withdrawing from that proceeding in the belief that they could avoid\n\nliability under the policy. The solicitor did not thereafter defend the action and\n\njudgment was given against him. The Inner House held that, in those circumstances, the\n\ninsurers were entitled to dispute the insured’s liability to the plaintiffs in the\n\naction brought by the plaintiffs under s 1(1) of the 1930 Act. The court, proceeding on\n\nthe basis that there was no authority on point, reasoned (at 10):-\"In other words, the pursuers’ rights are co-extensive with,\n\n  but no greater than, St Clair’s (the solicitor’s) rights against the defenders.\n\n  That being so, the decree in the sheriff court action between the pursuers and St Clair\n\n  will be conclusive as to St Clair’s liability in damages for the purposes of the\n\n  present action at the instance of the pursuers only if it would also be conclusive for the\n\n  purposes of an action against the defenders at the instance of St Clair. So, supposing\n\n  that St Clair had been found liable in damages to the pursuers in the sheriff court\n\n  action, would the defenders have been prevented from challenging that liability and its\n\n  amount in any proceedings which he brought against them to enforce the indemnity under the\n\n  insurance policy? In general terms, part, at least, of the answer is clear: the matter\n\n  would not beres judicata, since the parties to the two actions would be different\n\n  and themedia concludendiwould also be different. The existence of the sheriff\n\n  court decree would therefore give St Clair the necessary interest to sue the defenders but\n\n  it would not prevent them from reopening the matter in an action against them at his\n\n  instance. For this reason the existence of the sheriff court decree cannot, in itself,\n\n  prevent the defenders from reopening the matter in the present action where the pursuers\n\n  stand in St Clair’s shoes.\"20.    The Inner House also dealt with the prevailing problem which the\n\nenactment of the 1930 Act was intended to overcome as follows (at 12):-\"Parliament solved the problem by enacting the provisions of\n\n  Section 1 which in effect assigned the insured’s rights against the insurer to the\n\n  third party. But there is nothing in the terms of the 1930 Act or in the aims of the\n\n  legislation that would justify the inference that Parliament intended to give the third\n\n  party any additional advantage which would not be available to the insured in any action\n\n  at his instance against the insurer.\"21.    As far asBen Shippingcase is concerned, it is clearly\n\ndistinguishable as it did not deal with an express obligation to indemnify but with a\n\nsupposedly implied obligation of indemnity. It must be confined to its fact situation as\n\nthe passage of Bingham J which we have cited at 18 above shows. There were also special\n\nfeatures there which seemed to have played a part in the overall determination of the\n\ncase. It would be noted that Bingham J did not rule that the indemnifier could never be\n\nbound. He recognised that the authorities could well support a \"much more limited\n\nprinciple.\"22.    As regardsCheltenhem & Gloucestercase, we note that\n\nthe Inner House, in coming to its decision, had relied uponBen Shipping. With\n\nrespect, we think insufficient consideration was given to the distinguishing factors inBen\n\nShippingwhich we had identified above.23.    Counsel for Chiu Teng further seeks to distinguishCheltenhem\n\n& Gloucesteron the basis that the wording of the operative clause of the\n\nindemnity was different. There, it was stated that the insurers would \"indemnify the\n\ninsured against liability at law for damages and claimant’s costs and expenses in\n\nrespect of a claim … made against the insured … by reason of any negligent act,\n\nneglect or omission on the part of the … insured … occurring or committed …\n\nin good faith.\" In contrast, in our case, the insurer was to indemnify Brentford\n\nagainst \"such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as\n\ndamages.\" While the two clauses are indeed different, we do not think there is any\n\nreal difference in effect, since in this case and inCheltenhem & Gloucesterthere is, in each instance, a judgment against the insured.24.    What is clear is that the Inner House seemed to be concerned with\n\nthe doctrine ofres judicata. As we see it, the real point is one of contract. The\n\nquestion to ask is, following from the first judgment, is there a sum which Brentford is\n\nlegally liable to pay to Chiu Teng as damages. The answer is a definite yes. The wording\n\nof the policy is clear: the insurer (Hartford) shall indemnify the insured (Brentford)\n\nagainst such sums which Brentford shall become legally liable to pay as damages. This\n\ncondition is satisfied. It is not open to Hartford to challenge that judgment; they were\n\nnotified of the claim. To permit such a challenge as to the extent of liability of\n\nBrentford to Chiu Teng, and consequently the quantum thereof, would risk there being an\n\ninconsistent judgment and the insured being indemnified less (or none at all) than what\n\nthe policy provides. And as by virtue of s 1(1), Chiu Teng stepped into the shoes of\n\nBrentford, Chiu Teng should be indemnified by Hartford. There is no question of Chiu Teng\n\nbeing given any additional advantage which would not be available to Brentford in any\n\naction instituted by Brentford against Hartford.25.    Generally, and as stated by Romer J inMercantile Investment\n\n& General Trust(supra), a judgment is only binding as between the parties to the\n\naction, except in the case of an express indemnity given by a third party to a party to\n\nthe action.26.    At common law, Chiu Teng would have no claim against Hartford,\n\nthe insurer:Re Harrington Motor Co[1928] 1 Ch 105. Now, because of the winding up\n\nof Brentford, s 1(1) enables Chiu Teng to step into the shoes of Brentford.\n\nBrentford’s right to be indemnified in respect of the liability is, under s 1(1),\n\ntransferred to Chiu Teng. It is not open to Hartford to reopen the question of quantum of\n\nloss. Judgment had already been obtained on that. As stated by Devlin J inWest Wake\n\nPrice & Co v Ching[1957] 1 WLR 45 at 49, \"The essence of the main indemnity\n\nclauses is that the assured must prove a loss. The assured cannot recover anything under\n\nthe main indemnity clause or make any claim against the underwriters until they have been\n\nfound liable and so sustained a loss.\"27.    We do not think it should make a difference whether the judgment\n\nobtained against the insured is after a trial or on admission, so long as notice was given\n\nto the insurer to defend the claim of the injured third party if it wished. Unlike the\n\ncharterers inBen Shipping, who did not know how the loss occurred, here it is\n\nHartford who is raising the point that the installation of the micropiles was unnecessary\n\nafter judgment was given against Brentford. We would mention that Hartford’s loss\n\nadjusters were kept informed by Chiu Teng’s loss adjusters on the list of defects and\n\nthe proposed rectification works. Nothing was raised by Hartford’s loss adjusters\n\nabout the need or otherwise of the micropiles. It is absurd to require an insured to\n\ncontest a claim, or the quantum thereof, if he does not have any basis to contest it.28.    We would, therefore, respectfully decline to follow the decision\n\nof the Inner House inCheltenhem & Gloucesterand instead say that we agree\n\nwith the approach taken by the Outer House, which broadly followed the opinion expressed\n\nby Mellish LJ inParker v Lewis(see 10 above). It said:-Where the insurer, on the other hand, forms the view that he is not\n\n  liable to indemnify his insured, then he still has at least two options. The first is to\n\n  refuse or withdraw cover in respect of any defence to the pursuer’s action. In that\n\n  event, if the pursuer proceeds with his action and secures decree against the person\n\n  thought to be insured, the amount of the decree will be determinative of the liability of\n\n  the insured to the pursuer unless and until that decree is reduced on the grounds of, for\n\n  example, fraud or collusion. The insurer cannot normally re-open the question of the\n\n  amount of the liability in circumstances where he has declined to enter the process and\n\n  fund the defence to the action or has withdrawn his instructions and funding in the course\n\n  of the action. The question of liability between the pursuer and the insured has to be\n\n  litigated in an action between those two parties and a decree in that action has to be\n\n  seen as a final determination of that liability so long as the decree stands unreduced.The second option is for the insurer to offer to instruct the defence\n\n  to the action but make it clearab ante,or at least as soon as possible, both to\n\n  the pursuer and the insured, that his position is to remain that he is not liable under\n\n  the policy.29.    The choice is entirely for the insurer. If it chooses not to\n\nintervene, then, if a judgment is obtained against the insured, it would have to indemnify\n\nthe insured if the policy defences pleaded by it should fail. As regards the concern\n\nraised that if this court should uphold the decision of the court below, it could lead to\n\nan escalation in premiums, we would make three observations. First, this is not a legal\n\npoint. Secondly, a term which gives the insurer the right to conduct the defence of the\n\ninsured is commonplace in most insurance contracts and such a term is in the policy issued\n\nby Hartford to Brentford. Thirdly, while each insurer will set its own premium rates, in a\n\nfree and competitive economy, the market will ultimately dictate the acceptable levels.",
        "Judgment": "30.    In the result, the appellant’s (Hartford’s) appeal is\n\nhereby dismissed with costs. The security for costs, together with any accrued interest,\n\nshall be paid out to the respondent (Chiu Teng) or its solicitors to account of its costs.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHIEF JUSTICESgd:L P THEANJUDGE OF APPEALSgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDGE OF APPEALCopyright © Government of Singapore."
