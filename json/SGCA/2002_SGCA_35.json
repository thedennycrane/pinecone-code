        "The facts": "2        The appellants, ten\n\nindividuals in all, are taking this action on behalf of themselves and 4,885 other\n\npersons, who are all members of the Raffles Town Club (the Club), a proprietary Club,\n\nseeking reliefs against the respondent-proprietors, Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd (RTC), on\n\nthe grounds of misrepresentation and breach of contract.3        The hearing of the action is\n\nnow in progress. The action is based on a common law prospectus issued by RTC when\n\ninviting members of the public to join the Club. The prospectus comprised the following\n\ndocuments:-(i)     a letter of invitation dated 9 November 1996;(ii)     a brochure;(iii)     a document giving general information in theform of questions and answers.4        The prospectus promised\n\n\"lavish reception and facilities\" and that the Club would be \"without peer\n\nin terms of size, facilities and sheer opulence\". It also gave, inter alia, the\n\nfollowing specific indications as to what members could expect –(i)     there would be about 600 car parking lots for members;(ii)     the exclusive and limited membership would be fully\n\ntransferable;(iii)     the total built-up area would be in excess of 400,000 square\n\nfeet.5        Potential subscribers were\n\nalso told that there would be two classes of membership:-(i)         a\n\n  limited number of exclusive transferable founder members at the subscription price of\n\n  $28,000, on a first-come-first serve basis, provided the application was made before 30\n\n  November 1996. The selection process aimed at building up a network of like-minded\n\n  professionals, executives and business people.(ii)        Those not\n\n  successful under (i), and those who applied after 30 November 1996, would have to pay\n\n  $40,000 and they would be \"second class members.\"6        From all the foregoing, the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that they were made to understand, and it was represented to them, that\n\nthe total number of members at any given time would be limited so that the members and\n\ntheir spouses would not at any time be shut out from enjoying the facilities of the Club.\n\nThe plaintiffs also said that these representations had become terms of the contract upon\n\nthe plaintiffs’ applications to becoming founder members being accepted. The\n\nplaintiffs said that these representations turned out to be false because –(i)        \n\n  Nineteen thousand people have become founder members. No invitation was issued to the\n\n  public for the \"second class members\".(ii)         The\n\n  facilities of the Club were inadequate to cater to the needs of 19,000 members.7        By reason of the\n\nrepresentations which turned out to be untrue, the plaintiffs asked for a rescission of\n\nthe contract and the return of the money paid to become members, or damages for breach of\n\ncontract.",
        "Discovery": "8        By summons-in-chambers made\n\non 2 April 2002, the plaintiffs applied for an order for the discovery of nine\n\nwide-ranging categories of documents. The Assistant Registrar, while granting an order for\n\ndiscovery, drastically narrowed its scope when compared with that prayed for by the\n\nplaintiffs. Discovery was ordered in respect of twelve specific categories of documents.\n\nHowever, as some of the discovered documents were no longer in contention we would only\n\nset out those which were the subject of the appeal:-1.     Any one document of a date\n\n    before 6 November 1996 recording decision (whether of the Board of RTC … its\n\n    directors or its representatives) on the number of Raffles Town Club members to be taken\n\n    in the first offering ending 30 November 1996 and for the fee of $28,000.2.     Any one document of a date\n\n    before 6 November 1996 recording decision (whether of the Board of RTC …. its\n\n    directors or its representatives) on the number of Raffles Town Club members to be taken\n\n    in the second offering after 30 November 1996 and for the fee of $40,000.3.     Any one document of a date\n\n    after 30 November 1996 but before 31 March 1997 recording (whether by the Board of RTC\n\n    …. its directors or its representatives) the number of applications received and\n\n    determining the number of applications to be accepted from the applications made in the\n\n    first offering ending 30 November 1996 and for the fee of $28,000.4.     Any one document(s) dated\n\n    after 1 January 1996 and before 31 September 1997 recording (whether by the Board of RTC\n\n    …. its directors or its representatives) the criteria for approving applications in\n\n    (i) the first offering ending 30 November 1996 and (ii) the second offering starting 1\n\n    December 1996, limited to documents where there is a material change in position from the\n\n    previous document in time.5.        Any one\n\n    document(s) dated after 1 January 1996 but before 31 September 2001 reflecting (whether by\n\n    the Board of RTC …. its directors or its representatives or agents such as\n\n    architects):- (a)(i) the final building plan/design submission to Building Control\n\n    Authority; and (a)(ii) any material amendments to this final submission document\n\n    thereafter; (b)(i) the decision shortly before June 2001 of using S$100,000,000 for\n\n    additional facilities; and (b)(ii) the implementation plan for the use of this additional\n\n    S$100,000,000.6.        Copies of\n\n    correspondence (a) from members raising complaints; and, (b) the club management’s\n\n    replies in relation to the inadequacy, and over-crowding of the RTC coffee-house, Chinese\n\n    restaurant, car-park and swimming pool for the period March 2000 to July 2001.7.        Any\n\n    documents relating to the use of the presidential or executive suits of RTC by a\n\n    non-member person or body corporate in relation in which period and for what fee, for the\n\n    period March 2000 to March 2001.9        Except in relation to items\n\n6, 8 and 9(a), RTC appealed against the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar.\n\nRubin J substantially allowed the appeal except for item 7, where he required RTC to\n\ndiscover a document or furnish best particulars of –(a)     the number of members of the Club as at December 1996; and(b)     the number of members of the Club as at 31 March 1997.Item 5 was not insisted by the plaintiffs as it was not\n\na category of documents requested by the plaintiffs but was nevertheless ordered by the\n\nAssistant Registrar.10        In coming to his decision,\n\nRubin J was of the view that the plaintiffs had not shown the relevance of the requested\n\ndocuments to the plaintiffs’ pleaded case. Relying onThorpe v Chief Constable of\n\nthe Greater Manchester Police[1989] 2 All ER 827 (Thrope’s case) he also\n\nfelt that discovery should not be ordered if the material was to be used only for the\n\npurpose of cross-examination to establish the credibility of witnesses.11        Being dissatisfied with the\n\norder of Rubin J, the plaintiffs appealed to this Court seeking basically to substantially\n\nrestore the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar.",
        "Documents in issue on appeal": "12        Before us counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs pursued only seven items which Rubin J did not allow namely, items 1, 2, 3, 4,\n\n9(b), 10 and 11 as listed in 8 above.",
        "Law on discovery": "13        We should mention that the\n\nrules governing discovery have undergone some important changes when they were reformed in\n\n1996. Not only was the previous system of mutual discovery by parties after the close of\n\npleadings replaced by a system of discovery by orders of court, the applicable test is\n\nalso different. The previous test, to determine whether documents should be discovered,\n\nwas governed by the words \"relating to any matter in question between them in the\n\naction\" found in the previous O 24 r 2(1). This test was elucidated in the often\n\nquoted judgment of Brett LJ in the celebrated caseCompagne Financiere Et Commerciale\n\nDu Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co(1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62-63:-\"… documents to be\n\n  produced are not confined to those, which would be evidence either to prove or to disprove\n\n  any matter in question in the action … The doctrine seems to me to go farther than\n\n  that and to go as far as the principle which I am about to lay down. It seems to me that\n\n  every document relates to the matters in question in the action, which not only would be\n\n  evidence upon any issue, but also which, it is reasonable to suppose, contains information\n\n  which may – not whichmust– either directly or indirectly enable the\n\n  party [requiring discovery] either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his\n\n  adversary …A document can properly be said to\n\n  contain information which may enable the party [requiring discovery] to advance his own\n\n  case or to damage the case of his adversary; if it is a document which may fairly lead him\n\n  to a train of inquiry, which may have either of these two consequences.\"14        So documents which were\n\nindirectly relevant by reason of their potential to set-off \"a train of inquiry\"\n\nresulting in the discovery of evidence of direct relevance were discoverable. But this\n\nsomewhat open-ended criteria often gave rise to difficulties in application to particular\n\ncircumstances, abuses or fishing. It also gave rise to a trend of discovering huge volumes\n\nof insignificant documents.15        The criteria adopted by the\n\nnew Rules are more specific. They are set out in O 24 r 1(2):-(2)    The documents which a party to a\n\n    cause or matter may be ordered to discover under paragraph (1) are as follows:(a)     the documents on which the party relies or will rely; and,(b)     the documents which could –(i)     adversely affect his own case;(ii)     adversely affect another party’s case; or(iii)     support another party’s case.There is, in addition, an overriding principle\n\nprescribed in rule 7, which is, that the discovery must be \"necessary either for\n\ndisposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.\"16        Documents which are now\n\ndiscoverable, other than these which a party relies or will rely [r 1(2)(a)], will be\n\nthose which could (i) adversely affect the party’s own case; (ii) adversely affect\n\nanother party’s case; or (iii) support another party’s case. It should be noted\n\nthat the word there is \"could\" not \"would\". So a document which has\n\nthe \"potential of affecting\" the party from whom the document is requested, is\n\nobliged to discover the same.17        Thus caution must be\n\nexercised when considering decisions which were made under the previous rules because, in\n\nthe words of Jeffrey Pinsler onSingapore Court Practice Order 24, \"a document\n\nis no longer discoverable merely because there is some connection (irrespective of the\n\nnature of the link) between it and the issue in the case.\" Documents which were\n\nrequired to be discovered under the concept of \"train of inquiry\" are no longer\n\ndiscoverable under the present O 24 r 1. However, this is not to say that the concept of\n\n\"train of inquiry\" has been removed from the Rules. It has reappeared in rule 5\n\nwhich relates to discovery of specific documents.18        However, it must not\n\nthereby be taken that cases decided under the previous rules are no longer pertinent. As\n\nwas the position under the previous rules, one of the essential pre-conditions to be\n\nsatisfied before discovery will be ordered is that of \"relevance\". Whether a\n\ndocument would affect that party’s claim, or adversely affect another party’s\n\ncase, or support another party’s case, must depend on the issues pleaded in the\n\naction. The cases that shed light on \"relevancy\" are just as useful today.19        Some of the principles on\n\n\"relevancy\" established by the cases are the following. InThorpe(referred to earlier) it was decided that a document was not discoverable if it was to be\n\nused only for the purpose of cross-examination to establish credibility of witnesses. A\n\ndiscovered document can also be blanked out in part if the blanked out portion is\n\nirrelevant to the issues of the action:GE Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd v\n\nBankers Trust Co[1995] 1 WLR 172. The discovery process should not be allowed to\n\n\"fish\" a cause of action: seeWright Norman v Oversea-Chinese Banking\n\nCorporation[1992] 2 SLR 710. Where an allegation is not pleaded, seeking discovery of\n\na document to back up such an allegation constitutes fishing:Marks & Spencer plc v\n\nGranade t/v & Anor(unreported of 8 April 1997).",
        "Items 1, 2 and 3": "20        We now turn to examine the\n\nbasis upon which the plaintiff sought to justify the discovery order made by the Assistant\n\nRegistrar. On items 1, 2 and 3, the plaintiffs submitted that those documents were\n\nrequired to show whether the representations made by RTC, relating to membership being\n\n\"exclusive\" and \"limited\", were true or untrue at the time they were\n\nmade and whether there was a breach of contract (assuming that the representations had\n\nbecome terms of the contract).21        It is vitally important to\n\nbear in mind that the action is for the non- fulfilment of \"representations\"\n\nand/or for breach of contract. There is no allegation of fraud. Nor is it alleged that RTC\n\nmade the representations knowing that they were false, or with no intention of fulfilling\n\nthe same. Fraud must be expressly pleaded with particulars. Thus, what was RTC’s\n\ndecision on the number of people to accept as founder members under the fee of $28,000 and\n\nas second class members under the fee of $40,000 and what was the actual number of\n\napplications received by 30 November 1996 were wholly irrelevant to the issues in the\n\naction. It was not alleged that the information in any of these three categories of\n\ndocuments were made known or conveyed to any of the plaintiffs. They knew nothing of these\n\ndocuments. The documents never formed the basis upon which RTC sought to attract the\n\nplaintiffs to join as members. Whatever representations made by RTC to the plaintiffs were\n\nexclusively in the three documents and nothing else. The information contained in the\n\ndocuments to be discovered under items 1, 2 and 3 played no part in the plaintiffs’\n\nappreciation of what RTC was trying to convey in the prospectus.22        So what representations RTC\n\ndid make to the plaintiffs must be gleaned from the prospectus and nothing else. And\n\nhaving established those representations, the plaintiffs must show, inter alia, that what\n\nRTC have in fact provided in the Club premises, applying objective standards, do not match\n\nthe representations. The detailed drawings on the design of the Club’s premises have\n\nalready been furnished to the plaintiffs pursuant to the order of the Assistant Registrar.\n\nWhat was in the mind of the promoters behind RTC is not an issue in the action. We would\n\nreiterate that there is no allegation of fraud. The discovery sought was mere fishing. The\n\ndocuments are not necessary for disposing fairly of the action.23        As for the alternative\n\nclaim based on breach of contract, here again the plaintiffs must first establish what\n\nrepresentations did RTC make in the prospectus. Second, plaintiffs must show that the\n\nrepresentations had become terms of the contract. Third, the plaintiffs must establish a\n\nbreach of those terms. Again for the same reasons above, the documents requested are\n\nwholly irrelevant.24        The plaintiffs relied on\n\nthe caseChan Cheow Kiat v Tang Hoon Keng(unreported decision of the High Court in\n\nSuit No. 234/91 dated 9 September 1996). But in that case, which involved the purchase of\n\nshares in a company, there were allegations of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations\n\nand the alleged misrepresentations related to the existing state of affairs of the\n\ncompany. Another case relied upon by the plaintiffs wasForum Development Pte Ltd v\n\nGlobal Accent Trading Pte Ltd[1995] 1 SLR 474which concerned a specific innocent\n\nmisrepresentation made to induce a potential tenant to take up space in a shopping mall\n\nand where the court allowed the tenant to rescind the lease agreement on that account. In\n\nany event, in both these cases, the actual decisions did not really concern discovery\n\nprinciples.25        Another argument put\n\nforward by the plaintiff was that the documents under items 1, 2 and 3 would show whether\n\nthe representations made were fraudulent, negligent or innocent and, in any event, they\n\nformed the factual matrix, or surrounding circumstances, which the court could take into\n\naccount in construing the representations. But evidence as to the factual background must\n\nbe restricted to the circumstances \"known to the parties at or before the date of the\n\ncontract\": seePrenn v Simmonds[1971] 3 All ER 237. The documents requested\n\nwere not known to the plaintiffs before, or at the time, they applied to become members of\n\nthe Club.",
        "Item 4": "26        Under this item, the\n\ndocuments sought to be discovered related to the criteria adopted by RTC in selecting\n\napplicants for membership. They averred that in the prospectus, RTC stated that there\n\nwould be a selection or screening process to ensure that the members accepted were of like\n\nminded professionals, executives and business people; if there were no such criteria, then\n\nit would show that this representation was clearly untrue at the time it was made;\n\nalternatively there was a breach of contract.27        It seemed to us that the\n\nplaintiffs, in making this submission, overlooked what is the substance of their grievance\n\nin the action, which is, that RTC admitted so many people as members so much so that the\n\nplaintiffs, who are members, could no longer enjoy the sort of facilities which RTC\n\npromised in their prospectus. The complaint in the action does not relate to the quality\n\nof the people who have been accepted as members, but the quantity. Thus the document asked\n\nfor is wholly irrelevant to the issues in the action. In our view, this was just another\n\nfishing expedition.",
        "Items 9(b)": "28        This document related to a\n\ndecision of RTC to expend $100,000,000 for additional facilities. The plaintiffs submitted\n\nthat as RTC had represented to the plaintiffs that members would enjoy \"unparallelled\n\nprivileges and facilities\", the decision of RTC to spend $100 million in improving\n\nthe Club facilities was highly pertinent to that question. This alleged decision to expend\n\n$100 million to improving Club facilities was based on a report in the newspaperThe\n\nBusiness Timesof 7 June 2001, which stated that the shareholders of RTC were said\n\n\"to be sitting on cash of over $100 million and should have little difficulty funding\n\nany proposed purchase\" for expansion.29        A couple of observations\n\nshould be made on this item. First, the assertion that RTC proposed to spend some $100\n\nmillion to upgrade the Club facilities is not pleaded in the Statement of Claim even\n\nthough this report in the Business Times was published long before the action was\n\ncommenced. So this allegation, which was based on the newspaper report, is not relied upon\n\nby the plaintiffs. Second, the alleged representations in the prospectus occurred in 1996.\n\nIt is settled law that subsequent acts or conduct cannot be relied upon, or used, to\n\nconstrue any representations made in any instrument or the terms of a contract – seeReardon-Smith\n\nLine Ltd v Yngver Hansen-Tangen[1976] 3 All ER 571. Third, in a statement dated 7\n\nJune 2001, issued to all members by the newly appointed Chairman of RTC (which was already\n\ndisclosed), he stated, inter alia, the following:-.. we have reviewed the strengths,\n\n  weaknesses and opportunities related to the Club and have drawn up a Club Development\n\n  Plan. This blueprint of an action plan was accepted for implementation at the 1stBoard Meeting on 29 May 2001.The Plan will focus on three main areas:-1.    Acquiring an additional location to\n\n  complement our present flagship at Plymouth Avenue.2.    Addressing all reasonable concerns\n\n  about enhancement and usage of Club’s ambience and facilities.3.    Leveraging on our membership\n\n  strength to achieve the vibrancy and viability befitting a prestigious club.The Board has proposed and the Proprietors have readily\n\n  agreed to implement the plan for an additional location to complement the present one at\n\n  Plymouth Ave. The Proprietors will provide the capital outlay for it. This means that the\n\n  Club will be better able to cater to the diverse needs of members in terms of ambience,\n\n  activity type and food and beverage preferences.At the same time we will be taking steps to ascertain\n\n  the optional usage of the service outlets. In this, we assure you that our aim is to try\n\n  to meet all members’ reasonable expectations regarding usage of facilities. As some\n\n  of you who are members of other clubs are aware, clubs often have to cope with high\n\n  patronage during weekends, public and school holidays. During weekdays, food outlets are\n\n  under-patronized causing some clubs to allow walk-in members of the public. This blurs the\n\n  distinction between members and walk-in members of the public. This is a situation we do\n\n  not have and which we want to avoid.30        Therefore, the documents\n\nunder this item are not discoverable for two reasons. First, the allegation was not\n\npleaded and was not relevant to the issues in hand. Second, subsequent acts or plans\n\ncannot be used to determine what were, in fact, the representations made, or interpret the\n\nterms of a contract. In any event, and for what it is worth, the information sought from\n\nthose documents was already conveyed in the general letter to members from the Chairman of\n\nRTC dated 7 June 2001.",
        "Item 10": "31        Under this item, the\n\nplaintiffs sought copies of members’ complaints received by RTC during the period\n\nMarch 2000 to July 2001 relating to the inadequacy and overcrowding of the various\n\nfacilities in the Club premises, e.g., coffee-house, Chinese restaurant, car-park and\n\nswimming pool, and the replies of RTC thereto. It is expressly pleaded that when the Club\n\nopened in March 2000, it was woefully inadequate and shockingly lacking in terms of\n\nfacilities to cater for and accommodate the huge number of members and supplementary card\n\nholders.32        RTC argued that such\n\ncomplaints were irrelevant as they constituted little more than hearsay evidence or only\n\ndemonstrated what were the opinions of the complainants.33        It seemed to us that these\n\ndocuments are clearly relevant to the issue in the action as to whether there is, in fact,\n\nany inadequacy or overcrowding of the facilities or inability of the Club to cope with the\n\ntotal number of members taken in. These documents would be germane to the question of the\n\nalleged breach of representations/terms of contract. Accordingly, we allowed the discovery\n\nof the documents under this item. We must, however, hasten to add that we have only\n\naddressed the question of relevancy. Other questions, such as admissibility and the weight\n\nto be accorded to each of the documents, do not arise at this stage.",
        "Item 11": "34        The documents requested for\n\nunder this item relates to the use of the presidential or executive suites of the Club by\n\nnon-members. The plaintiffs’ argument was that these documents related to another\n\nfacet of \"exclusivity\". Allowing non-members the use of the accommodation in the\n\nClub would be contrary to the promise of \"exclusivity\". But the fact of the\n\nmatter is that the question of usage of the presidential and executive suites by\n\nnon-members is not pleaded or relied on at all. Thus these documents are wholly irrelevant\n\nto the allegations of misrepresentations and/or breaches of contract.",
        "Train of Inquiry": "35        In relation to the\n\ndiscovery sought in the present appeal, the plaintiffs were relying upon r 5 of O 24.\n\nWhile the principle on \"train of inquiry\" is incorporated in r 5, it is\n\nnevertheless necessary for the applicant party to show in what way the requested document\n\nmay lead to a relevant document. For example, inJones v Richards(1885) 15 QBD 439\n\nthe court allowed interrogation of the defendant as to whether or not he was the writer of\n\na letter (which was not in issue) in order to prove that he was the writer of a libellious\n\nletter which was the subject of the proceedings. The plaintiffs here did not attempt to\n\nshow any such linkage other than stating baldly that there could be a train of inquiry. It\n\nwas clear that the plaintiffs just wanted the specified documents (as ordered by the\n\nAssistant Registrar), and not that the discovery of those documents (which we ruled to be\n\nirrelevant) might lead to relevant documents. That was not their position. In modern\n\nlitigation, discovery must be kept under proper control.",
        "Judgment": "36        In the result, the appeal\n\nwas allowed only in respect of the documents under item 10. We affirmed the decision of\n\nthe court below as regards the other six items of documents. We ordered that the costs of\n\nthis appeal be in the cause. The security for costs, together with any accrued interest,\n\nwould be refunded to the plaintiffs or their solicitors.Sgd:CHAO HICK TINTAN LEE MENGJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
