        "Background facts": "2.     The\n\nrelevant facts giving rise to the appeal were briefly these. On 25 November 2000, the appellant\n\ninstituted this action against the respondent, seeking an order for the rescission of an agreement\n\nwhereby the respondents agreed to assign certain patent rights to the appellant on the terms and\n\nconditions therein stated. The basis of the claim, among others, was that the respondent had\n\nintentionally suppressed material information relating to the patent rights. Soon after the\n\ncommencement of the action, the appellant took out an application for summary judgment. At the\n\nhearing thereof before an assistant registrar on 15 January 2001, the respondent was granted\n\nunconditional leave to defend. On 31 January 2001, the respondent served its defence and\n\ncounterclaim. The appellant appealed against the decision of the assistant registrar and the appeal\n\nwas heard on 13 February 2001 before Lai Siu Chiu J. She dismissed the appeal. Not contented with\n\nthe decision, the appellant, on 27 February 2001, applied for hearing of further arguments. That\n\napplication appeared to be belated, as the time for such application had expired. Nonetheless, the\n\napplication was acceded to by Lai J, and 5 March 2001 was fixed for the hearing of further\n\narguments.3.     In\n\nthe meantime, on 28 February 2001, the parties appeared before the registrar for directions, and at\n\nthat hearing the registrar made, inter alia, the following directions:(a) The affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses to be called were to be\n\n  exchanged between the parties by 30 March 2001 and objections thereto were to be taken by 6 April\n\n  2001.(b) Leave was granted to the respondent to adduce the oral evidence at the\n\n  trial of a representative from Allen & Gledhill, and a representative from Chu Chan Gan &\n\n  Ooi.(c) The trial be fixed for five days from 27 April 2001 to 4 May 2001 and the\n\n  action be set down by 9 April 2001.4.     On 5\n\nMarch 2001, the parties appeared before Lai J for the hearing of further arguments. At the\n\nconclusion, the judge altered her previous decision and ordered that the respondent be given only\n\nconditional leave to defend the appellants claim instead. The condition imposed was that the\n\nrespondent was to provide security in the sum of S$600,000 for the appellants claim by 26 March\n\n2001.5.     On\n\n16 March 2001, the respondent filed an appeal against Lai Js decision and applied for the hearing\n\nof the appeal to be expedited. The application was allowed, and in consequence the appeal was heard\n\non 22 March 2001. The appeal was unsuccessful, but the court granted to the respondent an extension\n\nof two weeks from the original deadline of 26 March 2001 to provide the security in the sum of\n\nS$600,000.6.    \n\nThereafter, the respondent and its solicitors attempted to prepare the affidavits of\n\nevidence-in-chief of the witnesses for the trial to meet the deadline of 30 March 2001, but did not\n\nsucceed in so doing. On Friday, 30 March 2001, the appellants solicitors sent a fax to the\n\nrespondents solicitors requesting for a time to be fixed for the exchange of the affidavits. The\n\nrespondents solicitors sought an extension of time from the solicitors for the appellant on the\n\nground that Ms Winnie Tham of Allen & Gledhill, one of the witness they intended to call, was\n\noverseas. The solicitors for the appellants refused. There followed an exchange of correspondence\n\nand no agreement was reached between the parties. The appellant took out an application to strike\n\nout the defence and counterclaim. The respondent, on its part, applied for an extension of time to\n\n14 April 2001 to file and exchange the affidavits of evidence-in-chief.7.     On 4\n\nApril 2001, both the applications were heard before the registrar. The registrar refused the\n\nrespondents application for an extension of time and allowed the appellants application, and\n\nconsequently ordered that the defence be struck out and counterclaim dismissed with costs, and that\n\njudgment for the appellant be entered. On the same day, the respondent filed an appeal to a judge in\n\nchambers, and the appeal was heard before Woo Bih Li JC on 10 April 2001. He allowed the appeal.\n\nFrom that decision, the appellant appealed to this Court.The appeal8.     We\n\nconsidered first the reasons given by the respondent in the application for an extension of time\n\nbefore the registrar. In the affidavit filed in support of the application, Mr Lim Yeow Bing, the\n\nintellectual property and contracts director of the respondent, said in  4 the following:4. The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the\n\n  affidavits. Meanwhile, the Defendants efforts to prepare the affidavits expeditiously have been\n\n  affected by the following circumstances:-(a) The Plaintiff obtained leave, subsequent to the giving of the directions,\n\n    to make further arguments before Justice Lai Siu Chiu in respect of her earlier dismissal of\n\n    their appeal for summary judgment. The further arguments were heard on 5 March 2001 and, at the\n\n    end of a lengthy hearing, the learned Judge gave conditional leave to defend.(b) The Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the learned Judges\n\n    order, and the appeal was heard on an expedited basis on 22 March 2001. The appeal was\n\n    unsuccessful. Much of the Defendants attention and effort were taken up by the hearing of the\n\n    further arguments and the appeal.(c) The Defendant had also previously indicated that they may call a lawyer\n\n    from M/s Allen & Gledhill to testify. In this regard, Ms Winnie Tham of M/s Allen &\n\n    Gledhill, who acted for the Defendant in the subject patent application, has been out of the\n\n    country since 23rdMarch 2001 and is understood that she will only return to\n\n    Singapore after 4 April 2001.9.     The\n\njudge below held that the true reason for the delay was not given in the application for the\n\nextension of time and thus the conduct of the appellant was unsatisfactory, and further, that the\n\ndelay was unjustified. The judge said at  61:61. The truth of the matter was that Rodyk & Davidson and Sky Technology\n\n  had used the absence of Winnie Tham to seek an EOT [extension of time] when the real reason was\n\n  something else. To this extent, their conduct was unsatisfactory.Later, the judge said at  64-66:64.The true reason for the delay was that Rodyk & Davidsons time and attention had\n\n  been taken up and distracted by the hearings before Lai J and the Court of Appeal in respect of\n\n  the application for summary judgment and conditional leave. They had misjudged the time required\n\n  to prepare the AEICs.65.Although I had some sympathy for the situation they found themselves to be in, the true\n\n  reason was still not satisfactory. After all, S3s AEICs were ready by 30 March 2001.66.Hence, the delay was unjustified.10.     We\n\nhad some difficulty in accepting the findings the judge made in this part of his judgment. First,\n\nwith respect, we did not agree with his finding that the respondents had used the absence of Ms\n\nWinnie Tham to seek an extension of time when the true reason was something else. Mr Lim, in his\n\naffidavit, gave what the judge later said were the true reasons for the delay and these included the\n\nabsence of Ms Winnie Tham as one of the reasons. It is true that in seeking an agreement from the\n\nappellants solicitors for the extension of time, Mr Lok Vi Meng, the solicitor for the appellant,\n\ngave only one reason for the delay: that is, that Ms Winnie Tham was out of the country. That was\n\nrather unfortunate, but not fatal. What was more important, surely, must be what the respondent\n\nrelied on as the true reasons for the delay at the hearing before the registrar. These were given by\n\nMr Lim in his affidavit filed in support of the application, the relevant part of which we have\n\nquoted above. We certainly did not find anything wanting in respect of what was said there. Nor did\n\nwe find the conduct of the respondent unsatisfactory.11.    \n\nSecondly, with respect, we did not find that the delay was unjustified. The summons for directions\n\nbefore the registrar was heard only on 28 February 2001 and, among other things, a direction was\n\ngiven for the exchange of the affidavits of evidence-in-chief to take place on 30 March 2001.\n\nMr Lim said in his affidavit that the time frame given for the preparation of the affidavits was a\n\nshort one. We found nothing wrong with this statement. In the circumstances of this case, we think\n\nthat the time frame was a short one. Now, what happened immediately after the directions were given\n\nwas that multiple proceedings took place. It appeared that on 27 February 2001, which was the day\n\nbefore the date the directions were given, the appellant applied to Lai J for a hearing of further\n\narguments on the application for summary judgment. Mr Lok said that he was unaware of this\n\napplication at the hearing of the summons for directions before the registrar. That was not\n\ndisputed. Probably at that point in time, neither of the parties knew that the application had been\n\ngranted, or for that matter, expected that it would be granted, having regard to the fact that the\n\ntime for such an application had expired. It was unclear when the parties were notified that Lai J\n\nagreed to hear further arguments. However, the hearing of further arguments was fixed for 5 March\n\n2001. Naturally both parties would have to prepare further arguments for submission before the\n\njudge. Then on 5 March 2001, Lai J altered her decision previously given and gave the\n\nrespondent leave to defend the appellants claim on condition that the respondent furnished\n\nsecurity in the sum of S$600,000. Against that decision, the respondent decided to appeal, and it\n\nimmediately filed an appeal. An urgent application was made by the respondent for the hearing of the\n\nappeal to be expedited and an order was made expediting the hearing. The appeal was heard on 22\n\nMarch 2001, but unfortunately the respondent was unsuccessful in the appeal. Plainly, all these\n\nevents supervened during the relevant period, i.e. date when the order for directions was made,\n\nnamely 28 February 2001, and the deadline for the exchange of affidavits on 30 March 2001. It was\n\nmanifestly clear to us that all these events, which were unforeseen at the time the directions were\n\ngiven, occasioned a delay in the preparation by the respondent of the affidavits of\n\nevidence-in-chief. As the judge below said, and we agreed, the time and attention of the solicitors\n\nfor the respondent had been taken up and distracted by the hearing before Lai J and the Court of\n\nAppeal in respect of the application for summary judgment.12.     In\n\nour judgment, having regard to the supervening events and the short time frame allowed, the delay\n\ncould not, with respect, be characterised as unjustified. We were of the view that an adequate\n\nexplanation was given for the extension of time, and the registrar should have granted the extension\n\nof time sought or alternatively an extension of seven or even ten days, and should not have\n\nexercised the draconian power of striking out the defence and dismissing the counterclaim with\n\njudgment to the appellant. Particularly, in this case, such extension would not necessitate an\n\nadjournment or postponement of the trial, and the impact of an extension of time on the case overall\n\nwould not have been significant.",
        "Prejudice": "13.    \n\nHaving regard to what we have said, it is unnecessary to deal with the issue of prejudice. However,\n\nsince this was an issue raised and argued by both parties, we should say a word on it. The leading\n\nauthority is the case ofThe Tokai Maru[1998] 3 SLR 105. That was a case involving also a\n\ndelay in filing and exchanging affidavits of evidence-in-chief, and the delay involved covered a\n\nperiod of some nine months, and the court held that the explanation given for the delay was\n\nunsatisfactory and the delay was unjustified. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal found that there was\n\nno prejudice caused to the respondents and the application to extend the time was granted. In coming\n\nto this conclusion, the Court followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in England delivered by\n\nSir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) inCostellow v Somerset County Council[1993] 1 All ER\n\n952, [1993] 1 WLR 256. Among other things, it was stated there thatthe courts practice has\n\nbeen to treat the existence of such prejudice as a crucial, and often a decisive, matter.Even if prejudice is caused, which can be cured by an appropriate order of costs, the court would be\n\ndisinclined to refuse the application for an extension of time.14.     It\n\nis unnecessary for us to refer to the judgment inCostellowwhich was quoted in extenso inThe\n\nTokai Maruand also in this Courts decision inLeong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hook David[2001] 2 SLR 17. Suffice here to remind ourselves of the following passage of the judgment of Sir\n\nThomas Bingham MR which we find appropriate ([1993] 1 All ER 952 at 960, [1993] 1 WLR 256 at 264):[I]n the ordinary way, and in the absence of special circumstances, a court\n\n  will not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to dismiss a plaintiffs action for want of\n\n  prosecution unless the delay complained of after the issue of proceedings has caused at least a\n\n  real risk of prejudice to the defendant. A similar approach should govern applications made under\n\n  Ords 19, 24, 25, 28 and 34. The approach to applications under Ord 3, r 5 should not in most cases\n\n  be very different. Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be\n\n  appropriate,on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny the plaintiff an\n\n  extension (where the denial will stifle his action) because of a procedural default which, even if\n\n  unjustifiable, has caused the defendant no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by an\n\n  award of costs. In short, an application under O 3 r 5 should ordinarily be granted where the\n\n  overall justice of the case requires that the action be allowed to proceed.[Emphasis is ours]15.     The\n\njudge below found that there was no undue prejudice to the appellant if an extension of time\n\nwas granted to the respondent to exchange affidavits of evidence-in-chief by 11 April 2001, i.e. one\n\nday after the hearing before him. We, for our part, found that there was no evidence that the\n\nappellant had sufferedanyprejudice entitling it to deny an extension of time to the\n\nrespondent.",
        "Conclusion": "16.     For\n\nthe reasons given, we found that the appeal had absolutely no merit and had no hesitation in\n\ndismissing it.Sgd:Sgd:L P THEANCHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
