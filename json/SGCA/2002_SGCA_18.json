        "Conflict of Laws": "– Enforcement of foreign judgment –\n\nAllegation that foreign judgment procured by fraud – Approach to be taken by court\n\n– Whether there was any new evidence of fraudFactsThe respondent (\"Les Placements\") was a Canadian company\n\nwhich entered into a loan agreement (\"the Loan Agreement\") with a Singapore\n\ncompany, Wiraco Trading Pte Ltd (\"Wiraco\"), in 1995. At the time of the Loan\n\nAgreement, the President of Les Placements was one Mr Germain Gauthier\n\n(\"Germain\"). Under the terms of the Agreement, Les Placements was to lend Wiraco\n\nC$350,000 and the appellant (\"Hong\") gave Les Placements a guarantee to ensure\n\nthe repayment of the loan. Wiraco subsequently defaulted in repaying the loan and Les\n\nPlacements commenced proceedings against it and Hong in the Superior Court of the District\n\nof Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At the trial, Hong alleged that he never guaranteed a loan\n\nfrom Les Placements to Wiraco. Instead, he claimed that either the guarantee he executed\n\nrelated to a personal loan from Germain to Wiraco which was never effected, or that the\n\narrangement was that Germain was to extend a personal loan to him. The thrust of his\n\ndefences was therefore that there was no privity of contract between Hong and Les\n\nPlacements. The Canadian Court rejected Hong’s defences and held that in relation to\n\nthe loan transaction, Germain was not acting for himself but on behalf of Les Placements,\n\nand that the guarantee was addressed to him as the head of Les Placements. It then held\n\nthat both Hong and Wiraco were jointly and severally liable to Les Placements for\n\nC$360,645 plus interest and costs. Dissatisfied with this decision, Hong and Wiraco\n\nappealed to the Court of Appeal in Quebec but their appeal was disallowed.Upon obtaining the judgment in Canada, Les Placements commenced a writ\n\naction in Singapore to enforce the Canadian judgment against Hong under common law. It\n\nthen applied for, and received, summary judgment in its favour. Hong appealed, arguing\n\nthat the Canadian judgment had been obtained by fraud because Les Placements had\n\nfraudulently failed to disclose to the Canadian court that the guarantee was addressed to\n\nGermain and not Les Placements. As such, the Canadian Judgment was not conclusive and that\n\nthis was so, even if the defence of fraud had been investigated into by the Canadian court\n\nand rejected. Furthermore, Hong argued that he was entitled to have the issue of fraud\n\nre-litigated in Singapore even if there was no new material before the court supporting\n\nhis allegation of fraud. Finally, Hong asserted that there were, in any case, fresh\n\nmaterial to support his allegation: the sworn statements of two witnesses which were\n\nprepared by Les Placements in the Canadian proceedings but were never produced before the\n\nCanadian court.",
        "Held": ", dismissing the appeal:(1) A foreign judgment in personam given by a foreign court of\n\n  competent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as\n\n  the foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. Such a foreign\n\n  judgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached\n\n  for any error, whether of fact or of law (see ¶¶ 12 – 14); Goddard v Gray (1890)\n\n  L.R. 6 QB 139 and Ralli v Angullia [1915-23] XV SSLR 33 followed. In respect of such an\n\n  action, an application for summary judgment may be made on the ground that the defendant\n\n  has no defence to the claim; Grant v Eaton (1883) 3 QBD 302. A local court will only\n\n  refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment if it is shown that the plaintiff procured it by\n\n  fraud, or if its enforcement would be contrary to public policy or if the proceedings in\n\n  which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice (see ¶ 12).(2) There were two distinct views as to how a domestic court should\n\n  treat a foreign judgment where fraud was raised in relation to a foreign judgment, the\n\n  English position as enunciated in Abouloff v Oppenheimer (1882) 10 QBD 295 and the\n\n  Canadian-Australian approach laid down in Jacobs v Beaver (1908) 17 OLR 496 and Keele v\n\n  Findley (1991) 21 NSWLR 44. Under the former approach, so long as fraud was alleged, the\n\n  defendant was entitled to reopen the issue of fraud even though no new evidence was\n\n  produced and even though the fraud might have been, and was, alleged in the foreign\n\n  proceedings. The latter approach allowed the examination of the merits of the foreign\n\n  judgment only if extrinsic fraud was alleged or if the defendant had discovered evidence\n\n  of intrinsic fraud after the foreign judgment was passed. The latter approach is\n\n  consistent with the approach taken by courts when facing an allegation of fraud vis-à-vis\n\n  domestic judgments (see ¶¶ 15 - 26).(3) The approach adopted in Abouloff had less to commend itself as it\n\n  would only encourage endless litigation. It is of paramount importance that there should\n\n  be finality. That said, the rule against re-opening issues is not absolute. As established\n\n  in the body of law governing the re-litigation of issues already adjudicated upon by\n\n  domestic courts, there are exceptions but these are subject to safeguards. There is no\n\n  logical reason why a different rule should apply in relation to a foreign judgment (see ¶\n\n  27). It is also vitally important that no court of one jurisdiction should pass judgment\n\n  on an issue already decided upon by a competent court of another jurisdiction. This is the\n\n  doctrine of comity. After all, two tribunals, both acting conscientiously and diligently,\n\n  could very well come to a different conclusion on the same facts. There is no question of\n\n  which is more correct. To seek to make such an evaluation would be an invidious exercise\n\n  and could lead to the undesirable consequence of encouraging judicial chauvanism. (see ¶\n\n  28).(4) On the other hand, the approach taken by the Canadian-Australian\n\n  cases and Ralli v Angullia is preferable since it is more in line with the principles of\n\n  conflict of laws and treats foreign judgments in the same way as domestic judgments. It is\n\n  consonant with the doctrine of comity of nations. It avoids any appearance that this court\n\n  is sitting in an appellate capacity over a final decision of a foreign court. Applying\n\n  this approach, where an allegation of fraud had been considered and adjudicated upon by a\n\n  competent foreign court, the foreign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud\n\n  only where fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the\n\n  defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a\n\n  difference in the eventual result of the case (see ¶30).(5) Hong had objected to the admission of the two sworn statements in\n\n  the Canadian proceedings and now sought to rely on them to show that the Canadian judgment\n\n  was obtained by fraud. He knew of the existence of the statements and of what the two\n\n  persons stated therein. There was therefore no new evidence of fraud (see ¶ 32). In any\n\n  case, even if the statements were admitted in the Canadian proceedings, they would not\n\n  have made a difference to the court’s verdict since they did not really indicate that\n\n  there was any evidence of fraud. On the contrary, Hong’s actions led to an\n\n  irrefutable inference that there was no fraud and that he had in fact agreed to guarantee\n\n  the loan from Les Placements to Wiraco.",

Hong argued that, having\n\nraised the point that the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud, that should suffice to\n\npreclude the judgment from being enforced in Singapore, and that the action should be\n\nallowed to go on for trial to enable Hong to establish the alleged fraud. We were not\n\npersuaded by Hong’s contention and dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.",
        "Background": "2.    The facts giving rise to the action were largely as follows. Les\n\nPlacements was a company incorporated in Canada. On or about 25 April 1995, it entered\n\ninto a loan agreement (‘the Loan Agreement’) with Wiraco Trading Pte Ltd\n\n(‘Wiraco’), a company incorporated in Singapore, whereby Les Placements agreed\n\nto lend Wiraco a sum of C$350,000. At the time of the loan, the President of Les\n\nPlacements was one Mr Germain Gauthier (‘Germain’) and his son, Pierre Gauthier\n\n(‘Pierre’), was a shareholder and the managing director of Wiraco. Hong’s\n\nwife was also a director of Wiraco. As a part of the loan arrangement, Hong gave a\n\nguarantee to Les Placement to ensure the repayment of the loan extended by Les Placements\n\nto Wiraco.3.    Under clause 12.1 of the Loan Agreement it was provided that the\n\ncourts of the province of Quebec as well as the Supreme Court of Canada shall have the\n\nexclusive jurisdiction with respect to all disputes relating thereto.4.    On the due date, Wiraco defaulted in repaying the loan. Despite\n\ndemands, both Wiraco and Hong failed to fulfil their repayment obligations. Thus, Les\n\nPlacements commenced proceedings against Wiraco and Hong in the Superior Court of the\n\nDistrict of Montreal, Quebec, Canada pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction clause.5.    Hong disputed the jurisdiction of the Canadian Court and sought a\n\nstay on the ground of forum non conveniens. That challenge was rejected. The action went\n\non for trial and Hong alleged that he never guaranteed a loan from Les Placements to\n\nWiraco. Instead, he claimed that the guarantee he executed related to a personal loan from\n\nGermain to Wiraco which was never effected. In the alternative, Hong contended that the\n\narrangement was that Germain was to extend a personal loan to him and that the guarantee\n\nwas for Germain’s benefit and not Les Placements. These defences were raised with a\n\nview to having the claim dismissed on the ground that there was no privity of contract\n\nbetween Hong and Les Placements.6.    The Canadian Court held that in relation to the loan transaction\n\nGermain was not acting for himself but on behalf of his company, Les Placements, and that\n\nthe guarantee was addressed to him as the head of Les Placements. The defences raised were\n\ntherefore rejected and both Hong and Wiraco were held to be jointly and severally liable\n\nto Les Placements for C$360,645.00, plus interest and costs. Dissatisfied with this\n\ndecision, Hong and Wiraco appealed to the Court of Appeal in Quebec but the appeal was\n\ndisallowed.7.    As Canada was not a country gazetted under either the Reciprocal\n\nEnforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264) (‘RECJA’) or the Reciprocal\n\nEnforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 295) (\"REFJA\"), Les Placements had to\n\ncommence a Writ action in Singapore to enforce the Canadian judgment against Hong under\n\ncommon law. Thus, the present proceeding. No enforcement action was taken by Les Placement\n\nagainst Wiraco because the latter was in liquidation.8.    Following the institution of the action in Singapore, an\n\napplication was made to obtain summary judgment, which led to the statement of claim being\n\namended and re-amended and a fresh application for summary judgment made. On 4 May 2001\n\nthe Senior Assistant Registrar granted unconditional leave to defend to Hong. On further\n\nappeal to the High Court, Les Placements successfully obtained a summary judgment from\n\nChoo Han Teck JC. Being dissatisfied, Hong appealed to this court.9.    Before Choo JC, counsel for Hong made the following arguments in\n\nso far as they were germane to this appeal. First, Les Placements was not entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on the strength of the Canadian judgment unless the ‘underlying\n\nbasis’ of the foreign judgment is pleaded and tried in the Singapore courts. Second,\n\nthe Canadian judgment was improperly obtained because Les Placements had fraudulently\n\nfailed to disclose to the Canadian court that the guarantee of 20 March 1995 was addressed\n\nto Germain Gautier and not Les Placements. On both points, Hong failed. The court held\n\nthat it was an established principle that a judgment obtained from a competent foreign\n\njurisdiction, which was final and conclusive on the merits, was also generally conclusive\n\nin Singapore between the same parties.",
        "Appeal": "10.    Before us, Hong reiterated the point about the Canadian judgment\n\nbeing obtained by fraud. He submitted that, where fraud was raised, the foreign judgment\n\ncould no longer be conclusive and this was so even if the defence of fraud had been\n\ninvestigated into by the foreign court and rejected. Furthermore, he was entitled to have\n\nthe issue of fraud re-litigated in Singapore even if there was no new material. However he\n\nconceded that leave to defend would be refused, if it was obvious that the allegation of\n\nfraud was frivolous, citingCodd v Delap[1905] 92 LT 510. He argued that the court\n\nbelow should not have followed the decision inRalli v Angullia[1915-23] XV SSLR 33.11.    Hong further asserted that there were fresh materials to support\n\nthe allegation of fraud: the sworn statements of two witnesses (Chew Kia Lee and Yeo Seok\n\nLee) which were prepared by Les Placements in the Canadian proceedings but were never\n\nproduced before the Canadian court.",
        "Principles governing foreign judgments": "12.    Quite apart from the arrangements under the RECJA or the REFJA,\n\nit is settled law that a foreign judgmentin personamgiven by a foreign court of\n\ncompetent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as\n\nthe foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. The foreign\n\njudgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached\n\nfor any error, whether of fact or of law:Goddard v Gray(1890) L.R. 6 QB 139. In\n\nrespect of such an action, an application for summary judgment may be made on the ground\n\nthat the defendant has no defence to the claim:Grant v Eaton(1883) 3 QBD 302. The\n\nlocal court will only refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment if it is shown that the\n\nplaintiff procured it by fraud, or if its enforcement would be contrary to public policy\n\nor if the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice:\n\nsee ¶¶ 1008-1010 of Vol 8(1) ofHalsbury’s Laws of England, 4thEdn\n\n(Re-issue).13.    In a much earlier case,Vanquelin v Bouard15 C.B.N.S 341\n\nwhich was an action in England on a French judgment, Erle CJ, said:-\"It has been well settled that defences which might have been\n\n  raised in the foreign court cannot be brought forward here for the purpose of setting\n\n  aside the judgment.\"14.    The rule established inGoddard v Graywas followed in the\n\nlocal case,Ralli v Angullia,supra, a 1917 decision of the Court of Appeal of the\n\nStraits Settlements (the predecessor of this Court). One of the issues determined by the\n\ncourt there was that a foreign judgment was conclusive as to any matter adjudicated upon\n\nand could not be impeached for any error of fact or law in an action based on it, apart\n\nfrom special grounds. A defence which might have been raised in the foreign court and was\n\nnot raised could not be raised in the forum of enforcement. Woodward J, who delivered the\n\nleading judgment, even suggested that the foreign judgment created a new and independent\n\nobligation distinct from the original cause of action. But he recognised that the exact\n\nnature of the obligation still remained unsettled and, in his words, \"it may be that\n\nthere is no merger, because the original cause of action still subsists, but the\n\nobligation created by the judgment is nevertheless a new one.\"15.    However, there is a line of authorities starting withAbouloff\n\nv Oppenheimer(1882) 10 QBD 295 which seemed to say that so long as fraud is alleged\n\nthe defendant is thereby entitled to reopen the issue of fraud. This decision considerably\n\nextended the fraud exception to the conclusive rule enunciated inGoddard v Gray.\n\nInAbouloff, the Court of Appeal held that a foreign judgment could be impeached\n\nfor fraud even though no new evidence was produced and even though the fraud might have\n\nbeen, and was, alleged in the foreign proceedings. The Court sought to justify its\n\napproach allowing re-opening of the fraud issue by stating that the foreign court would\n\nnot have itself approved of being misled and permit a judgment so obtained to remain.16.    In the later caseVadala v Lawes(1890) 25 QBD 310, while\n\nthe Court of Appeal recognised the problems posed as a result of the decision inAbouloff,\n\nit nevertheless refused to depart from it. Lindley LJ observed (at 316-7) \"if the\n\nfraud upon the foreign court consists in the fact that the plaintiff has induced that\n\ncourt by fraud to come to a wrong conclusion, you can re-open the whole case even though\n\nyou will have in this court to go into the very fact which were investigated and which\n\nwere in issue in the foreign court.\"17.    It was again reaffirmed in the recent caseJet Holdings Inc v\n\nPatel[1989] 2 All ER 648, where Staughton LJ stated:-\"It is to my mind plain that the foreign court’s decision on\n\n  its own jurisdiction is neither conclusive nor relevant. If the foreign court has no\n\n  jurisdiction in the eyes of English law, any conclusion it may have reached as to its own\n\n  jurisdiction is of no value. To put it bluntly, if not vulgarly, the foreign court cannot\n\n  haul itself up by its own bootstraps. Logically, the same reasoning must apply where\n\n  enforcement is resisted on the ground of fraud. … If the rule is that a foreign\n\n  judgment obtained by fraud is not enforceable, it cannot matter that in the view of the\n\n  foreign court there was no fraud. But this doctrine makes a great inroad into the\n\n  objective, which is generally desirable, of enforcing foreign judgments where in the eyes\n\n  of English law the foreign court has jurisdiction. The defendant may have been served in\n\n  the foreign country, entered an appearance, given evidence, been disbelieved and had\n\n  judgment entered against him. If he asserts that the plaintiff’s claim and evidence\n\n  were fraudulent that issue must be tried all over again in enforcement proceedings. The\n\n  lesson for the plaintiff is that he should in the first place bring the action where he\n\n  expects to be able to enforce a judgment.The doctrine has encountered criticism from academic writers: seeDicey\n\n  and Morrisp. 469, footnote 66. A possible view which is taken by some is that the\n\n  fraud relied on must be extraneous or collateral to the dispute which the foreign court\n\n  determines. But in my judgmentit is a hundred years too late for this court to take\n\n  that view. The decisions inAbouloff v Oppenheimer & Co(1882) 10 QBD 295,\n\n  [1881-5] All Er Rep 307 andVadala v Lawes(1890) 25 QBD 310, [1886-90] All ER Rep\n\n  853 show that a foreign judgment cannot be enforced if it was obtained by fraud, even\n\n  though the allegation of fraud was investigated and rejected by the foreign court.\"\n\n  [Emphasis added].18.    InSyal v Heyward[1948] 2 KB 443 the Court of Appeal,\n\napplyingAbouloff, held it to be immaterial that the facts relied upon to establish\n\na prima facie case of fraud were known to the party relying on them at all material times\n\nand could thus have been raised by way of defence in the foreign proceedings.19.    We must, however, point out that the approach adopted inAbouloffis completely inconsistent with that adopted by the English court vis-à-vis its own\n\ndomestic judgments. This is elucidated clearly in the following passage fromDicey\n\n& Morris on Conflict of Laws (13thEdn)at pp 518-9:-\"A party against whom an English judgment has been given may bring\n\n  an independent action to set aside the judgment on the ground that it was obtained by\n\n  fraud; but this is subject to very stringent safeguards, which have been found necessary\n\n  because otherwise there would be no end to litigation and no solemnity in judgments. The\n\n  most important of these safeguards is that the second action will be summarily dismissed\n\n  unless the claimant can produce evidence newly discovered since the trial, which evidence\n\n  could not have been produced at the trial with reasonable diligence, and which is so\n\n  material that its production at the trial would probably have affected the result, and\n\n  (when the fraud consists of perjury) so strong that it would reasonably be expected to be\n\n  decisive at the rehearing and if unanswered must have that result. But it does not matter\n\n  whether the fraud is extrinsic, e.g., consists in bribing witnesses, or intrinsic, e.g.,\n\n  consists in giving or procuring of perjured or forged evidence.\"20.    In contrast, the Canadian courts declined to followAbouloff.\n\nInJacobs v Beaver(1908) 17 OLR 496, Garrow JA of the Ontario Court of Appeal\n\noffered the following critique ofAbouloffandValada(at p.505):-\"It can be matter of little wonder that there should be a\n\n  hesitation to accept as law all the dicta contained in the judgment inAbouloff v\n\n  Oppenheimer, where the consequences so well pointed out by Hargaty, C.J. inWoodruff\n\n  v McLennan, are or may be to practically abrogate the whole doctrine ofres\n\n  judicataboth as to native and foreign judgments. A doctrine so useful and so well\n\n  established, resting not alone upon a consideration of the private convenience of\n\n  litigants, but upon the broader foundation of public policy, should, one would think,\n\n  require more for its abrogation than the mere dicta of one or even more Judges, here or\n\n  elsewhere, however eminent.Abouloff v Oppenheimerwas followed inVadala v Lawes, 25\n\n  QBD 310. But the judgment rests not upon the actual decision in the former case, but upon\n\n  the dicta to which I have referred. Early in the judgment of Lindley, LJ, appears this\n\n  statement, p. 316: \"There are two rules relating to these matters which have to be\n\n  borne in mind, and the joint operation of which gives rise to the difficulty. First of all\n\n  there is the rule, which is perfectly well established and well known, that a party to an\n\n  action can impeach the judgment for fraud. Whether it is the judgment of an English Court\n\n  or of a foreign Court does not matter, using general language, there is a general\n\n  proposition unconditional and undisputed. Another general proposition which, speaking in\n\n  equally general language, is perfectly well settled, is that when you bring an action on a\n\n  foreign judgment you cannot go into the merits which have been tried in the foreign Court,\n\n  but you have to combine these two rules and apply them in the case where you cannot go\n\n  into the alleged fraud without going into the merits. Which rule is to prevail? That point\n\n  appears to have been one of great difficulty before the case ofAbouloff v Oppenheimer... But until theAbouloffcase the difficulty of combining the two rules and\n\n  saying what ought to be done, where you could not enter into the question of fraud to\n\n  prove it without re-opening the merits, had never come forward for explicit decision.That\n\n  point was raised directlyin the case ofAbouloff v Oppenheimer, and it was\n\n  decided. I cannot fritter away that judgment,\" etc.With the greatest deference, it seems to me that this statement is open\n\n  to two serious objections: (1) it in no way takes account of or definesthe natureof the fraud which can be successfully opposed to a judgment, whether native or foreign,\n\n  for it is admitted the rule is the same, and (2) the point was not explicitly raised inAbouloff\n\n  v Oppenheimer, where the facts were all admitted by the demurrer.The combination of the two rules, with which no one quarrels, is made\n\n  easy and without the reproach of any thing like hairsplitting, if my first objection is\n\n  answered, as I think it should be, in the line of authorities which no one can question,\n\n  namely, that the fraud relied on must be something collateral or extraneous, and not\n\n  merely the fraud which is imputed from alleged false statements made at the trial, which\n\n  were met by counter-statements by the other side, and the whole adjudicated upon by the\n\n  Court and so passed on into the limbo of estoppel by the judgment. This estoppel cannot,\n\n  in my opinion, be disturbed except upon the allegation and proof of new and material\n\n  facts, or newly discovered and material facts which were not before the former Court and\n\n  from which are to be deduced the new proposition that the former judgment was obtained by\n\n  fraud. The burden of that issue is upon the defendant, and until he at least givesprima\n\n  facieevidence in support of it; the estoppel stands.\"21.    What Garron JA advocated was that a court should only look into\n\nthe merits of a foreign judgment if extrinsic fraud was alleged or if the defendant had\n\ndiscovered evidence of intrinsic fraud after the foreign judgment was passed. And what\n\nwould constitute extrinsic fraud was elaborated in the earlier Ontario Court of Appeal\n\ndecision inWoodruff v McLennan(1887) 14 OAR 242 as being:-\"the defendant had never been served with process, that the suit\n\n  had been undefended without defendant’s default, that the defendant had been\n\n  fraudulently persuaded by plaintiff to let judgment go by default … or some fraud to\n\n  defendant’s prejudice committed or allowed in the proceedings of the other\n\n  court.\"22.    The approach advocated by Garrow JA was followed by the courts of\n\nseveral other provinces in Canada, e.g., Nova Scotia inManolopoulos v Pnaiffe[1930] 2 DLR 169; Alberta inUnion of India v Bumber Development Corp[1995] 7 W.W.R 80; and British Columbia inRoglass Consultants Inc v Kennedy Lock & Willet\n\nInc(1984) 65 BCLR 393.23.    In Australia, the courts there also seem to be moving away fromAbouloff.\n\nThe leading case would appear to beKeele v Findley(1991) 21 NSWLR 444 where the\n\nNSW Commercial Division preferred the Canadian approach. Rogers CJ (NSW) held that fraud\n\nwas a defence to an action on a foreign judgment only if there had been a new discovery of\n\nmaterial evidence which would establish fraud and make it reasonably probable that the\n\nopposite result would have been reached. He felt that the current English position came\n\nabout because the courts had failed to take proper account of the developments in the law\n\nrelating to domestic judgments.24.    However, notwithstanding these Canadian and Australian\n\nauthorities, the English Court of Appeal reaffirmed the ruling inAbouloffinOwens\n\nBank Ltd v Bracco[1991] 4 AER 833 and held that, as far as fraud was concerned, the\n\nenforcement of a foreign judgment was not the same as the enforcement of an English\n\njudgment in that there was no requirement of any fresh evidence before an English court\n\ncould try the issue of fraud. This Court of Appeal decision was affirmed by the House of\n\nLords where Lord Bridge, with whom the other Law Lords concurred, stated that if the law\n\nwere in need of reform, it was for the legislature, not the judiciary, to effect it. WhileBraccoinvolved enforcement under the Administration of Justice Act 1920, the House\n\nfelt that the word \"fraud\" in the Act should be given the same sense as in\n\ncommon law.25.    Interestingly, in this regard, there is a Court of Appeal case\n\nwhich sought to limit the scope of theAbouloffline of cases:House of Spring\n\nGardens Ltd v Waite[1991] 1 QB 241.Waiteconcerned two Irish judgments where\n\nin the original judgment (given in 1983 and on which enforcement was sought), the issue of\n\nfraud was canvassed and decided upon and the same issue of fraud was also examined in a\n\nseparate and second action in Ireland (in 1987). The Court held that it was the judgment\n\nin the second action which created the estoppel. In seeking to distinguish the situation\n\nthere from the other cases, Stuart-Smith LJ stated:-\"In none of these cases was the question, whether the judgment\n\n  sued upon here was obtained by fraud, litigated in a separate and second action in the\n\n  foreign jurisdiction.\"26.    In the alternative, the court inWaitefelt that it would\n\namount to an abuse of process to allow the defendant to re-litigate the issue. But the\n\ncourt also noted that the result would have been different and the question of whether\n\nthere had been fraud re-examined if it had been possible to impeach the 1987 judgment on\n\nthe basis that the judgment had itself been obtained by fraud or to produce new evidence\n\nof fraud in relation to the earlier judgment.",
        "Our approach": "27.    There were, therefore, before us, two distinct views as to how a\n\ndomestic court should treat a foreign judgment where fraud is raised in relation to that\n\nforeign judgment. One is that enunciated inAbouloffand the other advocated by the\n\nCanadian-Australian cases which sought to limit the circumstances under which a domestic\n\ncourt may re-open an issue already determined by a foreign judgment including an\n\nallegation of fraud. In our judgment the approach adopted inAbouloffhas less to\n\ncommend itself as it would only encourage endless litigation. It is of paramount\n\nimportance that there should be finality. Every losing party understandably would like to\n\nlitigate the issue over again with the hope that a different tribunal would look at the\n\nfact situation differently. But that can never be a good reason for allowing a losing\n\nparty to re-open issues. To liberally allow a party to do so would be to permit that party\n\nto have a second bite at the cherry, an eventuality which is generally abhorred by all\n\ncivilized systems of law. Of course, we are conscious that the rule against re-opening\n\nissues is not absolute. There are exceptions but they are subject to safeguards. In\n\nEngland, an issue already adjudicated upon by the domestic courts would not, as a rule, be\n\nallowed to be re-litigated. There is no logical reason why a different rule should apply\n\nin relation to a foreign judgment.28.    It is also vitally important that no court of one jurisdiction\n\nshould pass judgment on an issue already decided upon by a competent court of another\n\njurisdiction. This is the doctrine of comity. After all, two tribunals, both acting\n\nconscientiously and diligently, could very well come to a different conclusion on the same\n\nfacts. There is no question of which is being more correct. To seek to make such an\n\nevaluation would be an invidious exercise and could lead to the undesirable consequence\n\nwhich we have mentioned before of encouraging judicial chauvanism. It must be borne in\n\nmind that the enforcement forum is not an appellate tribunal vis-à-vis the foreign\n\njudgment.29.    We note here that inOwens Bank Ltd v Etoile Commerciale SA[1995] 1 WLR 44, Lord Templemen, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council observed that it\n\ndid not \"regard the decision inAbouloff… with enthusiasm.\" InEtoile\n\nCommercialethe Privy Council adopted the approach taken by the Court of Appeal inWaiterather than that inAbouloff.30.    In our judgment, the approach taken by the Canadian-Australian\n\ncases andRalli v Angulliais more in line with principles of conflict of laws and\n\ntreats foreign judgments in the same way as domestic judgments. It is consonant with the\n\ndoctrine of comity of nations. It avoids any appearance that this court is sitting in an\n\nappellate capacity over a final decision of a foreign court. We, therefore, ruled that\n\nwhere an allegation of fraud had been considered and adjudicated upon by a competent\n\nforeign court, the foreign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud only where\n\nfresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant\n\nwould not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a\n\ndifference in the eventual result of the case. There is no necessity for us to offer any\n\nviews on the jurisprudential question whether a foreign judgment created a new and\n\nindependent obligation distinct from that of the underlying or original cause of action,\n\nraised by Woodward J inRalli v Angullia.31.    This common law principle of according finality to a foreign\n\njudgment was at one time thought to be based on the doctrine of comity. English judges\n\nthen believed that the law of nations required the courts of one country to assist those\n\nof any other and they feared that if foreign judgments were not enforced in England,\n\nEnglish judgments would not be enforced abroad:Roach v Garvan(1748) 1 Ves Sen 157\n\nat 159. However, this theory seems to have given way to what is known as the doctrine of\n\nobligations, namely, that the foreign judgment imposes a duty or obligation on the\n\ndefendant to pay the judgment sum which the courts in the enforcement country are bound to\n\nenforce:Schibsby v Westenholz(1870) LR 6QB 155 at 159. Whatever may be the\n\ncorrect legal foundation, or for that matter it could be a combination of both, the\n\ncardinal principle is that no one court should sit in judgment over the final decision of\n\na competent court of another jurisdiction. A party, litigating in a foreign court, must\n\ndiligently muster all the evidence and raise all pertinent issues in that forum. He should\n\nnot have any expectation that any carelessness or omission on his part could nevertheless\n\nbe made good in the forum of enforcement.",
        "Fresh evidence of fraud": "32.    As stated before, the fresh evidence alleged by Hong were the two\n\nsworn statements of Chew Kia Lee and Yeo Seok Lee. According to Les Placements it was Hong\n\nwho objected to the admissibility of the two sworn statements and prevented them from\n\nbeing admitted in the Canadian proceedings. Yet in the proceedings here, he sought to rely\n\non them to show that the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud. He should not be allowed\n\nto blow hot and cold. He knew of the existence of the statements and of what the two\n\npersons stated therein. It was too late for Hong to change his mind now. There was,\n\ntherefore, no new evidence.33.    That should dispose of this appeal. But we would go further and\n\nsay that even if the two statements were admitted in the Canadian proceedings, it would\n\nnot have made a difference to the court’s verdict. In their statements, both Chew Kia\n\nLee and Yeo Seok Lee stated that the loan of C$350,000 was from Germain to Wiraco. But one\n\ncritical uncontrovertible piece of evidence before the Canadian court was that the sum of\n\nC$350,000 was transferred from Les Placements to Wiraco. It might well be that Pierre told\n\nChew that the money was from Germain without distinguishing Pierre’s father’s\n\ncompany from his father. Similarly, when Yeo heard Hong suggesting that Pierre borrow\n\nmoney from Germain, Hong did not distinguish Pierre from Wiraco. It was never suggested\n\nthat Pierre himself wanted to borrow from his father. It was probably understood by all\n\nthat Wiraco was borrowing from Les Placements. In conversations, such a manner of\n\nreference is often present. Quite clearly, the evidence of Chew Kia Lee and Yeo Seok Lee\n\nwould not prove anything to the contrary. More importantly, why did Hong sign the Loan\n\nAgreement if he had not intended to guarantee the loan from Les Placements to Wiraco? It\n\nis true that the Loan Agreement was in French. Les Placements claimed that it was orally\n\ninterpreted to Hong. While Hong disputed this, he did not explain why he, a former\n\nprincipal of Price Waterhouse and therefore a person experienced in business, would have\n\nsigned a document he did not understand. At the very least, he would have seen from the\n\nLoan Agreement that the agreement was between Les Placements and Wiraco. In any case, he\n\nhad also provided no reason for signing the Extension Agreement. The irrefutable inference\n\nwas that there was no fraud and Hong in fact agreed to guarantee the loan from Les\n\nPlacements to Wiraco. His claim that there was fraud was without merit.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHIEF JUSTICESgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDGE OF APPEALSgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
