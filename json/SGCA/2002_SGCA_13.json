        "The facts": "2 The appellant is the management corporation of People’s Park\n\nComplex, a mixed use development in the Chinatown area. In 1988, the respondent bought\n\nfour penthouse units (occupying the top two storeys), which it intended to convert into 18\n\nmaisonette units. It required the appellant’s permission to do so. Discussions took\n\nplace from 1989 to 1993. During that time, the respondent paid $200,000 towards the cost\n\nof upgrading the lifts and $170,000 towards the cost of maintaining part of the common\n\nproperty. The facts will be dealt with in greater detail below.3 On 12 December 2000, the appellant sued the respondent for\n\nmaintenance contributions and other payments for the 18 units. On 27 March 2001, the\n\nrespondent counterclaimed for the $370,000. The respondent also sought declarations\n\nrelating to the maintenance of the roof above the 18 units. On 19 February 2001, the\n\nappellant obtained summary judgment for its claim, but execution was stayed pending the\n\ntrial of the respondent’s counterclaim. The counterclaim was heard by Justice Prakash\n\nin July 2001.",
        "The judge’s decision": "4 The judge delivered her judgment on 31 July 2001. She first set out\n\nthe facts and procedural history. She then identified the issues and dealt with them as\n\nfollows (these issues are not classified in the same way as we have classified the issues\n\narising in this appeal):a No contract existed between the parties. As the respondent was in the\n\n  position of an applicant, and the appellant in the position of a licensing body, there was\n\n  no intention to create legal relations.b The appellant’s demands of $200,000 and $170,000 wereultra\n\n  viress 42(2) and s 42(5) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (\"LTSA\") (Cap 158)\n\n  respectively. The demands could not be legitimised by anything outside the LTSA framework.c The respondents had paid the sums under a mistake of law. It was time\n\n  for the Singapore courts to abrogate the rule against the recovery of payments made under\n\n  a mistake of law.d The respondents could not claim the money under thecolore officiiprinciple, as the appellant is not a public, quasi-public or monopolistic body. (This is\n\n  not an issue in the appeal and will not be dealt with here.)e The counterclaim was not time-barred because it did not fall within\n\n  the provisions of the Limitation Act (Cap 163).f At all times, the appellant had a statutory duty to maintain the roof\n\n  of the building, hence it could not require the respondent to do so. Therefore the court\n\n  granted the declarations sought by the respondent.g The appellant did not succeed on any defences pleaded:i. The appellant could not rely on the defence of laches because: one,\n\n  not much time had lapsed since the respondent could first have been aware of its cause of\n\n  action; and two, no prejudice had been caused to the appellant by the time lapse.ii. The appellant failed on the defence of promissory estoppel because\n\n  the respondent had not made any relevant representations to it. The respondent had merely\n\n  accepted that the appellant had the power to make the demands. (The appellant did not seek\n\n  to rely on this defence on appeal, and its submissions before the judge will not be dealt\n\n  with here.)iii. The appellant could not establish the defence of change of\n\n  position because: one, the demands for payment and that the respondent maintain the roof\n\n  wereultra vires; two, the appellant would have had to upgrade the lifts anyway;\n\n  and three, there was no evidence that the $170,000 had been used to maintain the common\n\n  property.h The parties were to pay interest as follows:i. The respondent was to pay the appellant simple interest on the\n\n  maintenance contributions and other payments, from the date of the summary judgment, at\n\n  ten percent per annum (this was not an issue in the appeal and will not be dealt with\n\n  here).ii. The appellant was to pay the respondent simple interest:1. on $200,000: at five percent per annum from February 1992 to June\n\n  1995, and at ten percent per annum thereafter; and2. on $170,000: at five percent per annum from September 1993 to June\n\n  1995, and at ten percent thereafter.The judge subsequently ordered that the respondent be awarded the full\n\ncosts of the counterclaim.",
        "The issues": "5 The issues in this appeal were:a Whether the appellant’s demand for $200,000 wasultra viresthe LTSA; if it was, whether the parties could and did contract around the LTSA.b Whether the appellant’s demand for $170,000 wasultra viresthe LTSA; if it was, whether the parties could and did contract around the LTSA.c Whether the law allows recovery of payments made under a mistake of\n\n  law; if so, whether the respondent in fact paid out under a mistake of law.d Whether the declarations relating to the maintenance of the roof\n\n  above the units should have been granted.e Whether the appellant should succeed on the defences pleaded before\n\n  the judge: time bar, laches and change of position.f Whether the appellant should succeed on the defences raised on\n\n  appeal: settlement of an honest claim, compromise, honest receipt, estoppel by convention\n\n  and abuse of process / extended res judicata.g Whether other defences should be recognised, for example: payment\n\n  made under a closed transaction, payment made under a settled view of the law, promissory\n\n  estoppel and passing on the burden of the payment.h Whether the judge erred in awarding interest to the respondent at\n\n  such rates and for such period as she did.i Whether the judge erred in awarding the full costs of the\n\n  counterclaim to the respondent.",
        "The first issue: whether the demand for $200,000 was ultra vires": "The relevant facts6 In a letter dated 13 April 1989, the appellant said that it would not\n\nobject to the conversion of the four penthouse units to 18 maisonette units on condition\n\nthat,inter alia:A one-time contribution of $200,000 to the Management Corporation\n\n  towards part of the cost for the modernisation of the 3 lifts serving the residential\n\n  apartment (sic)…The next day, Mr Ow Chor Seng (\"Mr Ow\"), a director of the\n\nrespondent, signed on the letter to indicate acceptance of the conditions. The respondent\n\npaid $200,000 by a cheque dated 10 January 1992. According to the appellant’s\n\naccounts for 1992, the money was put into the sinking fund and used to upgrade the lifts.7 The appellant claimed that the reason for this demand was that the\n\nincreased number of occupants in the top two storeys would place more pressure on the\n\nlifts. However, at the Extraordinary Meeting of the management corporation held on 29\n\nSeptember 1992, this reason was not mentioned. Instead, the Explanatory Notes to the\n\nSpecial Resolution passed at that meeting stated that the lifts had to be upgraded due to\n\nwear and tear, that residents had complained about the waiting times for lifts and that\n\nshopkeepers had complained about the goods lift. The appellant tried to explain away the\n\nfact that no mention had been made of the respondent’s contribution in the\n\nExplanatory Notes, by repeating the testimony of Mr Lim On Guan (\"Mr Lim\"), an\n\nemployee of the appellant’s managing agent:Court: Wouldn’t it have helped you get the resolution passed if\n\n  residents knew defendants were defraying part of this cost?A: No. All kinds of questions could have come up like why not get them\n\n  to pay all the costs or why convert the penthouses, why not maintain them for a more\n\n  exclusive environment. We had to consider what would make it easier to get the resolution\n\n  passed.The role of a managing agent is to present all the facts to the\n\nsubsidiary proprietors and allow them to decide whether to pass a resolution, not to\n\nconceal material facts and manipulate the outcome of a vote. Any misfeasance aside, it was\n\ndifficult to believe that the managing agent would have been motivated by such a minor\n\nconsideration to risk misinforming the subsidiary proprietors. The judge found that the\n\nimpetus for upgrading the lifts was not the increased traffic that would allegedly have\n\nresulted from the conversion of the penthouse units. There is no reason to overturn this\n\nfinding.",
        "The relevant LTSA provisions": "30 As was apparent from the strata plans, the roof had never been part\n\nof the original four penthouse units. The reasoning in relation to the new corridor\n\napplied here (see  12). As the roof above the units was \"common property\" (as\n\ndefined in s 3) within the meaning of s 48(1)(b)(i), the appellant had a duty to maintain\n\nit. Moreover, as the judge pointed out, it was not only the roof of the units, but also\n\nthe roof of the entire development. The appellant’s imposition of the condition wasultra\n\nviresthe LTSA, hence the judge was right in granting the following declarations:a The appellants, not the respondents, were legally obliged to maintain\n\nthe roof above the units.b The respondents were not legally obliged to register any covenant to\n\nthe effect that the subsidiary proprietors of the 18 units had to maintain the roof above\n\ntheir units.31 The appellant also sought to apply its contract argument to the\n\ncovenant. For the reasons discussed in  9 and 10, this failed. Although the discussion\n\nin  10 relates to s 42, it was equally true that parties should not be allowed to\n\nabsolve a management corporation of its duties under s 48.",
        "A contract circumventing the LTSA?": "9 The appellant’s submission here was founded on two points.\n\nFirstly, a management corporation has the capacity to enter into contracts. This argument,\n\naccording to the appellant, would not be defeated even if the appellant was akin to a\n\npublic body, because public bodies also have the capacity to contract. It was unfortunate\n\nthat the judge likened the appellant to a licensing body, because it allowed the appellant\n\nto go off on a tangent by submitting on principles applicable only to public bodies. A\n\nmanagement corporation is not a public body, but an unlimited liability company. In any\n\ncase, the issue was not whether the appellant had thecapacityto contract, but\n\nwhether there were any contracts between the parties.10 The appellant’s second point was that all the elements of a\n\ncontract were present, including an intention to create legal relations. The judge had\n\nfound that there was no such intention. We accepted that the dealings took place in a\n\ncommercial context, but even if all the ingredients of a contract were established, the\n\nappellant’s contract argument was untenable for the following reasons. Firstly, it is\n\ntrite law that a body created by a statute only has powers granted expressly or by\n\nimplication in that statute. A management corporation’s power to raise contributions\n\nis clearly and exhaustively provided for in s 42 of the LTSA. Anything done outside these\n\npowers is voidab initio. Secondly, upholding contracts which circumvent the\n\ndetailed and carefully drafted provisions of the LTSA would drive a coach and horses\n\nthrough it.",
        "The second issue: whether the demand for $170,000 was ultra vires": "The relevant facts11 The conversion entailed a subdivision of the four strata title lots\n\ninto 18. It would also have resulted in the creation of a common corridor. In a letter\n\ndated 5 May 1993, the appellant said it would approve the strata subdivision plans on\n\ncondition that,inter alia:[the respondent] …pay an outright contribution of $200,000 to [the\n\n  appellant] for the maintenance… of the additional common property…The appellant later agreed to reduce the sum to $170,000. Mr Ow signed\n\non the first letter to indicate acceptance of the conditions. The respondent paid $170,000\n\nby a cheque dated 25 August 1993.",
        "LTSA s 12(2)?": "14 The appellant submitted that s 12(2) afforded it another route to\n\nraise contributions, quite apart from s 42. Section 12(2) provides:12. --(2) Where the subdivision of a lot or the amalgamation of 2 or\n\n  more lots results in the creation of any additional or new common property, the subsidiary\n\n  proprietor shall obtain the approval of the management corporation before lodging the\n\n  strata title plan for redevelopment with the Registrar.The appellant relied on s 12(2) in respect of both payments. However,\n\nas s 12(2) deals only with the creation of new common property, it was at most relevant\n\nonly to the payment of $170,000.15 The appellant’s lengthy exploration of the legislative history\n\nof s 12(2) did not aid its case. It also claimed that a management corporation has powers\n\nincidental to those which are expressly provided for in the statute, and hence the manner\n\nin which it raised the contribution was within the powers incidental to s 12(2). These\n\narguments failed for three reasons. Firstly, s12(2) makes no mention whatsoever of a\n\nmanagement corporation’s authority to raise contributions in connection with granting\n\napproval. The judge did not rule out the possibility that it could charge an\n\nadministrative fee, but surely such a fee could not run into hundreds of thousands of\n\ndollars. Secondly, there was no need to speculate about the extent of powers to levy\n\ncontributions incidental to s 12(2), as s 42 clearly delineates a management\n\ncorporation’s powers to raise contributions. Thirdly, recognising vague incidental\n\npowers would defeat the scheme of s 42; this rationale is akin to the one explored in \n\n10.16 The appellant also sought to apply its contract argument to the\n\n$170,000. For the reasons discussed in  9 and 10, this failed.",
        "The third issue: whether the sums are recoverable as payments made under a mistake of law": "The present law17 The law in Singapore in this area, sinceSerangoon Garden Estate\n\nLtd v Marian Chye[1959] MLJ 113, has been that money paid out under a mistake of law\n\n–as opposed to fact – is not recoverable. The key question here was whether\n\nSingapore law should follow the example of some other Commonwealth states and abrogate\n\nthis rule. If the answer was in the affirmative, subsidiary questions included: whether\n\nthe rule should be abrogated legislatively (as in Western Australia and New Zealand) or\n\njudicially (as in Australia, Canada, England and South Africa); and what defences, if any,\n\nshould be developed.",
        "Should the law be changed?": "18 InKleinwort Benson v Lincoln City Council[1998] All ER 513,\n\nthe House of Lords unanimously decided that it was time to abrogate the rule; by a\n\nmajority, it decided to do so judicially. Lord Goff referred to the Law Commission’s\n\nConsultation Paper No. 120 on Restitution of Payments Made Under a Mistake of Law (1991),\n\nwhich cited the following as the main criticisms of the rule:a The rule was contrary to justice, which demanded that money paid\n\nunder a mistake of law should be repaid unless there were special circumstances justifying\n\nits retention by the payee.b The distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law could\n\nlead to arbitrary results.c Courts were tempted to manipulate the fact-law distinction in order\n\nto achieve practical justice. This led to uncertainty in the application of the rule.19 The court also held that two factors in particular did not defeat a\n\nclaim: firstly, that the payment had been made as part of a transaction which was now\n\nclosed; and secondly, that the payment had been made on a settled view of the law. These\n\nholdings are further discussed at  47 to 52.20 The appellant’s first objection to the abrogation of the rule\n\nwas that it was well-entrenched. Such an argument had no merit because the common law is\n\nno stranger to judicial activism. The appellant’s second objection was that the\n\nabrogation of the rule would undermine certainty, as closed transactions would be reopened\n\nand unscrambled. This contention will be addressed at  47 to 52. It will suffice to\n\nsay here that it was not a fatal objection to the abrogation of the rule.21 Most judicial and academic opinion is in favour of bringing the law\n\non mistakes of law in line with that on mistakes of fact. There does not seem to be any\n\ninsurmountable objection once thought has been given to the scope of the new rule and the\n\nexceptions to it.",
        "If the law is to be changed, how should it be done?": "22 The arguments in favour of judicial abrogation were as follows. Lord\n\nLloyd inKleinwort Bensongave two:Indeed I can imagine few areas of the law in which it would be more\n\n  appropriate for the House [of Lords] to take the initiative.The mistake of law rule is\n\n  judge made law. There are no considerations of social policy involved.(emphasis\n\n  added)Firstly, as the mistake of law rule was not created by Parliament,\n\nabrogating it judicially would not amount to defeating legislative intent. Secondly, as no\n\nsocial policy issues were involved, abrogating the rule judicially would not amount to\n\nusurping the legislative function. Thirdly, the courts were not in a position to know if,\n\nand when, Parliament would change the law.23 The Law Reform Committee (\"LRC\") of the Singapore Academy\n\nof Law (\"SAL\"), like the Law Commission in England, recommended in its Paper on\n\nReforms to the Law of Restitution on Mistakes of Law (2001) that the rule be abrogated by\n\nlegislation. The key argument in favour of legislative intervention stemmed from a fear of\n\nopening the floodgates to the re-litigation of closed transactions. In particular, it was\n\nthought that Parliament would be better able to address two issues. The first was: whether\n\nthe change in the law should have retrospective effect. The LRC of the SAL recommended\n\nthat the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) be amended to allow this. However, a judicial abrogation\n\nof the law could achieve the same if this Court followedKleinwort Bensonin\n\nholding that a payment made under a mistake of law could be recovered even if it had been\n\nmade under a completed transaction (see  47 and 48).24 The second issue was: whether limitation periods should be\n\nintroduced in respect of claims founded on a mistake of law, and if so, how long they\n\nshould be. Section 29(1) of the Limitation Act provides:29. --(1) Where,in the case of any action for which a period of\n\n  limitation is prescribed by this Act— …(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake, the\n\n  period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud\n\n  or the mistake, as the case may be, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.\n\n  (emphasis added)No legislative intervention was needed for two reasons. Firstly, s 29\n\ndoes not specify \"mistake\" as either one of fact or one of law, hence it can\n\napply equally to both. We noted that the LRC of the SAL recommended that s 29 be amended\n\nso as to clarify that it encompasses mistakes of law as well, but we did not think it\n\nabsolutely necessary. Secondly, the italicised words show that s 29 was intended to apply\n\nonly to situations covered by the Limitation Act. As there was no need to extend the scope\n\nof recovery under a mistake of law further than that under a mistake of fact, there was no\n\nneed to amend s 29.",
        "Application to the facts": "25 InNurdin & Peacock Plc v DB Ramsden & Co Ltd[1999] 1 WLR 1249, a case decided afterKleinwort Benson, the court said:… it does seem to me clear that in order to found a claim for\n\n  repayment of money paid under a mistake of law it is necessary for the payer to establish\n\n  not only thatthe mistake was madebut also that,but for the mistake, he would\n\n  not have paid the money. (emphasis added)The first requirement – that there was a mistake – was\n\nsatisfied. Firstly, the judge found that the appellant itself had believed that it had the\n\nauthority to make its approval conditional upon the respondent’s paying the sums\n\ndemanded. Mr Lim had been cross-examined in relation to the $200,000 payment:Q At the time this letter [dated 13 April 1989, see  6] was written\n\n  did you believe that the MC had the power to impose this condition?A Yes.He had also been cross-examined in relation to the $170,000 payment:Q At the time of this final offer, you still believed that the MC had\n\n  the power to impose the conditions it did.A Yes.26 Secondly, the judge found that Mr Ow had always been under the\n\nimpression that the appellant’s demands were lawful. Mr Ow had been cross-examined in\n\nrelation to the $200,000 payment:Q You said you had no choice. Did you protest at the meeting?A No becauseI believed they had the power to do soand I had no choice. (emphasis\n\n  added)He had been further cross-examined in relation to the $170,000 payment:Q Aware of the EGM held on 29/9/92?A Yes.Q Agree you could have raised the issue of the payment of the sum of\n\n  $200,000 [which was later reduced to $170,000] at the EGM?A Yes.Q You did not do so.A Agree.Q Why not?A Because at that timewe were of the opinion that the plaintiffs’ action was\n\n  lawful… (emphasis added)This had not been helped by the fact that the respondent did not\n\nconsult a lawyer or an architect on the issue of whether it had a legal obligation to meet\n\nthe appellant’s conditions.27 Thirdly, the judge found that the respondent objected to the quantum\n\ndemanded rather than its liability to pay.28 The second requirement – that, but for the mistake, the\n\nrespondent would not have paid – was also met. There was no reason to overturn the\n\njudge’s finding that the respondent had not paid voluntarily. The appellant argued\n\nthat the respondent faced a time constraint, and would have paid the money rather than run\n\nthe risk of not obtaining the appellant’s approval. If, as the appellant contended,\n\nMr Ow was a seasoned businessman and the parties had treated the transaction as a\n\ncommercial one, it would have been hard to believe that, had the respondent known that the\n\ndemands wereultra vires, it would have paid any more money than it had to.",
        "The fourth issue: declarations requested by the respondent": "The relevant facts29 In a letter dated 5 May 1993, the appellant said it would approve\n\nthe strata subdivision plans on condition that,inter alia:[The respondent]… cause to be registered as a covenant in each of\n\n  the eighteen (18) Subsidiary Strata Certificates of Title for the 18 subdivided units to\n\n  the effect that the subsidiary proprietors thereof shall maintain at their own cost the\n\n  roof directly above the 18 units.Mr Ow had signed on the letter to indicate acceptance of the\n\nconditions.",
        "The fifth issue: defences pleaded before the judge": "Time bar and laches32 A perusal of the Limitation Act showed that a claim for unjust\n\nenrichment which was neither grounded in contract nor tort, and in which equitable relief\n\nwas not sought, did not fall within the scope of the Act. Hence s 29 was irrelevant, and\n\nthere was no need for an inquiry as to when the respondent first knew of the mistake, or\n\ncould with reasonable diligence have known of the mistake.33 Laches is an equitable doctrine which considers the facts of the\n\ncase rather than a fixed time bar. InLindsay Petroleum Co v Hurd(1874) L.R. 5\n\nP.C. 221, the court said that two important factors were: the length of the delay; and the\n\nacts done during that time. In measuring the length of the delay, the court inBeale v\n\nKyte[1907] 1 Ch 564 said:… in all cases of mistake in order that laches or acquiescence may\n\n  be a defence there must be notice of the error, andtime runs from the date of the\n\n  notice and not from the time when the error is committed… (emphasis added)The judge found that the respondent did not know of its mistake until\n\nduring the trial: Mr Ow had paid the money while mistaken; solicitors who had acted for\n\nthe respondent in earlier matters had failed to notice the mistake; and even the\n\nrespondent’s present solicitors had only raised the issue of mistake of law just\n\nbefore trial. She also said that the respondent could not reasonably have known much\n\nearlier that it had a cause of action, as money paid under a mistake of law was still not\n\nrecoverable in Singapore.34 The second factor related to the acts done from the time the mistake\n\nwas made to the time when the party or parties realised the mistake. The judge found that\n\nthe appellant would have upgraded the lifts anyway (see  7), and hence it had suffered\n\nno prejudice in relation to the $200,000. As for the $170,000, as no evidence was adduced\n\nas to whether, and how, it was spent, the appellant could not argue that it had been\n\nprejudiced by the alleged delay.",
        "Change of position": "35 This was one of the defences overtly accepted inKleinwort Benson.\n\nLord Goff said:I recognise that the law of restitution must embody specific defences\n\n  which are concerned to protect the stability of closed transactions. The defence ofchange\n\n  of positionis one such defence; the defences ofcompromise, andsettlement\n\n  of an honest claim(the scope of which is a matter of debate), are others. It is\n\n  possible that others may be developed… (emphasis added)The defence of change of position was recognised – some say,\n\ncreated – inLipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd[1991] 2 AC 548. Lord Goff held that\n\n\"a bona fide change of position should of itself be a good defence\". He\n\nelaborated:At present I do not wish to state the principle any less broadly than\n\n  this: that the defence is available to a personwhose position has so changed that it\n\n  would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make restitution, or\n\n  alternatively to make restitution in full. (emphasis added)InSeagate Technology Pte Ltd v Goh Han Kim[1995] 2 SLR 17, the\n\ncourt noted that this defence was also available in Singapore. It would seem that there\n\nare three elements to the defence:a The payee has changed his position.b The change isbona fide.c It would be inequitable to require him to make restitution or to make\n\nrestitution in full.36 Could the appellant rely on this defence with regards to the\n\n$200,000? Firstly, it had changed its position by expending the money to upgrade the\n\nlifts. Secondly, because the appellant too had been mistaken as to the validity of its\n\ndemand and its ability to apply the money to upgrading the lifts, its change of position\n\nwasbona fide. Thirdly, however, it would not have been inequitable to require the\n\nappellant to make restitution in full. According to Lord Goff:… the mere fact that the defendant has spent the money, in whole\n\n  or in part, does not of itself render it inequitable that he should be called upon to\n\n  repay, becausethe expenditure might in any event have been incurred by him in the\n\n  ordinary course of things. (emphasis added)This was because, firstly, the judge had found that the appellant would\n\nhave upgraded the lifts in any case (see  7). Furthermore, as the need for upgrading was\n\nnot shown to be due, even in part, to the respondent’s proposed subdivision, the\n\nappellant was not allowed to retain any part of the $200,000. Secondly, the\n\nappellant’s demand wasultra vires.37 Could the appellant rely on this defence with regards to the\n\n$170,000? As there was no evidence as to how the $170,000 was spent, the first requirement\n\n– that the appellant had changed its position – was not even met.",
        "The sixth issue: defences raised on appeal": "38 On appeal, the appellants raised the following defences for the\n\nfirst time. The principles governing such situations are found inAttorney General for\n\nthe Straits Settlements v Pang Ah Yew[1934] 1 MLJ 189, which cited Lord Hershell inThe\n\nTasmania(1890) 15 App Cas 223:… a Court of Appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant\n\n  on a ground there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first,\n\n  thatit has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as completely as\n\n  would have been the case, if the controversy had arisen at the trial: and next thatno\n\n  satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an\n\n  opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness-box. (emphasis\n\n  added)39 As we state below that \"honest receipt\" and \"estoppel\n\nby convention\" are not acceptable defences, the above principles were applied only to\n\nthe other grounds raised. The facts necessary for deciding whether the defences are made\n\nout were:a Honest claim: the payee’s state of mind at the time of demand;\n\nand the payer’s state of mind at the time of payment.b Compromise: the payer’s state of mind at the time of payment.c Abuse of process: the respondent’s state of mind at the time of\n\nthe earlier suit in 1992.As for the first principle, these facts did not go beyond those which\n\nwere necessary for deciding whether the payment had been made under a mistake of law. As\n\nfor the second principle, it was the respondent whose conduct was impugned, whether by the\n\nsuggestion that it knew or believed that the claim was invalid or was indifferent as to\n\nwhether it was invalid. The respondent did not have to do more to prove its state of mind\n\nat the relevant time, than it had to for the purposes of showing that it had made a\n\nmistake of law. Hence the appellant was allowed to raise these new grounds.",
        "Settlement of an honest claim and compromise": "40 These defences were recognised inKleinwort Benson, though\n\nLord Goff said there was uncertainty as to the scope of the former (see  35). The\n\nelements of the defence of settlement of an honest claim are:a The payee honestly believes that he can legitimately demand payment;\n\nandb The payer knows or believes that the payee’s claim has no legal\n\nbasis.Element \"a\" was met (see  25). However, element\n\n\"b\" was not: the respondent believed that the appellant had the authority to\n\nimpose the conditions (see  26).41 To satisfy the defence of compromise, it must be shown that the\n\npayer was indifferent as to whether the payee’s claim had a legal basis. The\n\ndiscussion above has concluded that, far from being indifferent, the respondent believed\n\nthat the appellant’s demands were legal (see  26). The payee’s state of mind\n\nwas irrelevant.",
        "Honest receipt": "42 The appellant cited Brennan J inDavid Securities Pty Ltd v\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia(1992) 175 CLR 353 as support that this was a defence\n\nto a claim founded on mistake of law. This defence has not been embraced by other courts.\n\nIt was in fact criticised by Lord Goff inKleinwort Benson:… Brennan J’s proposed defence is so wide that, if it was\n\n  accepted, these other defences would in practice cease to have any relevance in the case\n\n  of money paid under a mistake of law. Moreover in many cases of this kind the mistake is\n\n  shared by both parties… In such cases, recovery by the plaintiff would automatically\n\n  be barred by Brennan J’s proposed defence.We do not recognise this as a defence either.",
        "Estoppel by convention": "43 According toHalsbury’s Laws of England(Volume 16 \n\n1070), the scope of this estoppel is still unclear. It was not appropriate at this\n\njuncture to accept it as a defence.44 In any case, the appellant failed on this point. Firstly, the\n\nabove-mentioned passage inHalsbury’sdefines \"estoppel by\n\nconvention\" as:Where partiesto a contractput a particular interpretation on\n\n  it by a course of dealing on the faith of which each of them to the knowledge of the other\n\n  acts and conducts their mutual affairs, they are bound by that interpretation. (emphasis\n\n  added)As the parties’ relationship was not contractual, the appellant\n\ncould not rely on this doctrine. Secondly, the court would only uphold the common\n\nassumption if it would be unconscionable not to do so. As the judge found that the\n\nappellant had suffered no prejudice (see  34), it was not unconscionable not to give\n\neffect to any common assumption which existed. Thirdly, this estoppel cannot be raised to\n\ndeny one the protection afforded by a statute, the terms of which cannot be circumvented\n\nby contract. The discussion of the first and second issues (see  6 to 16) concluded\n\nthat the relevant LTSA provisions could not be contracted out from.",
        "Abuse of process / extended res judicata": "45 The appellant said that the respondent had an opportunity to raise\n\nthe issues in its counterclaim when it was sued by the appellant in 1992. The simple\n\nanswer to this was that the respondent did not know of, and could not reasonably have\n\nknown of, its claim at that time.",
        "The seventh issue: whether other defences should be recognised": "46 It may be fortunate that the Singapore courts can draw on the\n\njurisprudence of other courts in this area, but no body of judge-made law comes\n\nready-made. As was said by Lord Goff inKleinwort Benson:The proper course is surely to identify particular sets of\n\n  circumstances which, as a matter of principle or policy, may lead to the conclusion that\n\n  recovery should not be allowed; and in so doing to draw on the experience of the past,\n\n  looking for guidance in particular from the analogous case of money paid under a mistake\n\n  of fact, but also drawing upon the accumulated wisdom to be found in the writings of\n\n  scholars on the law of restitution.The following issues were not raised in this case, but it was necessary\n\nto examine them to delineate – however imprecisely – the scope of the new rule.\n\nIn particular, this would give Parliament an indication of the courts’ stand on this\n\narea of law, should it later wish to pass relevant legislation.",
        "Payment made under a closed transaction": "47 The main argument against allowing recovery after the transaction in\n\nwhich the money was paid has been closed, is that everyone who has paid money under a\n\nmistake of law can sue for its return, subject to any applicable time bar and laches. As\n\nmentioned, this would not bring about an effect any different from legislative\n\nintervention with retrospective effect (see  23). Any worries about opening the\n\nfloodgates can however be addressed through the rules on payments made under a settled\n\nview of the law. Lord Goff also thought that certain defences would \"protect the\n\nstability of closed transactions\".48 The reasons for allowing recovery in respect of closed transactions\n\nare as follows. Firstly, not allowing recovery would defeat the policy behind the relevant\n\nlaw (about which one or both parties were mistaken). InKleinwort Benson, Lord Goff\n\nsaid:… it is incompatible with the ultra vires rule that an ultra vires\n\n  transaction should become binding on a local authority simply on the ground that it has\n\n  been completed.Secondly, allowing recovery when transactions are still open, but not\n\nwhen they are closed, will lead to capricious results. It may simply be a question of luck\n\nwhether the mistake of law is, or could have been, discovered before or after the\n\ntransaction is concluded.",
        "Payment made under a settled view of the law": "49 The majority inKleinwort Bensonruled that this was not a\n\ndefence to a restitutionary claim, but the minority thought that it should have been. The\n\nmajority’s view can be summarised as follows. Judges merely \"declare\" what\n\nthe law is; they do not change the law but merely correct what was an incorrect view of\n\nthe law. This correct view of the law is retrospectively imposed, such that the\n\npayer’s belief at the time of payment – which may have been correct according to\n\nthe earlier view of the law – is on hindsight deemed incorrect. Hence he had paid out\n\nunder a mistake of law, and should be allowed to recover the money.50 The minority opposed this for two reasons. Firstly, the declaratory\n\ntheory of law is artificial, and it should be recognised that judges make and change the\n\nlaw. If the payer’s belief at the time of payment was in line with settled law, he\n\nwas not mistaken. Even if the law is changed with retrospective effect, his state of mind\n\ncould not be so changed. Secondly, allowing such a defence would further undermine the\n\nfinality of closed transactions. While it is accepted above that the fact that a\n\ntransaction is closedper seshould not be a defence, it would be undesirable to\n\nallow a transaction to be reopened merely because it had been made under a settled view of\n\nlaw which has been changed. Lord Browne-Wilkinson cautioned inKleinwort Benson:On every occasion in which a higher court changed the law by judicial\n\n  decision, all those who had made payments on the basis that the old law was correct\n\n  (however long ago such payments were made) would have six years in which to bring a claim\n\n  to recover money paid under a mistake of law.It should be noted that, asKleinwort Bensoninvolved contracts,\n\nthe limitation period for claims arising therefrom was six years. If, however, an area of\n\nlaw not covered by the Limitation Act was changed, persons who had made payments in\n\nreliance of the old law would have an unlimited period (subject to laches) in which to\n\nrecover their money.51 The LRC of the SAL preferred the minority position. It also pointed\n\nout that other jurisdictions which have abrogated the rule have not accepted this defence.\n\nThe key issue is how a \"change in the settled view of the law\" should be\n\ndefined, and whether it can be defined with sufficient precision as to avoid much\n\nlitigation. The LRC of the SAL recommended that:a \"Settled law\" means:i. there is binding judicial authority on the specific point; andii. if there is no such authority, a lawyer who was reasonably\n\nexperienced in the relevant field would have advised the payer to make the payment.b A change in the settled law can only be brought about by judicial\n\ndecision.We think that this should be accepted as a defence, and that the\n\ndefinition of the LRC of the SAL should be adopted.",
        "Promissory estoppel": "52 Goff and Jones (The Law of Restitution) suggest that, in the\n\ncontext of restitutionary claims, the defence of promissory estoppel cannot exist\n\ncomfortably with that of change of position. InAvon County Council v Howlett[1983] 1 WLR 605, the court held that estoppel cannot operatepro tanto, such that:… if the defendant has innocently changed his position by\n\n  disposing of part of the money, a defence of estoppel would provide him with a defence to\n\n  the whole of his claim.In contrast, the defence of change of position will only allow the\n\npayee to keep that part of the money which he has disposed of. Given that change of\n\nposition has been specifically recognised as a defence inKleinwort Benson, it is\n\nunlikely that promissory estoppel will be accepted as a defence to a restitutionary claim.",
        "Passing-on the burden of the payment": "53 Such a situation arises where X demands that Y pay a tax, which Y\n\npays. Y then passes on the tax to Z, for example, by incorporating it in the price of\n\ngoods which he sells to Z. According to Evans LJ said inKleinwort Benson v Birmingham\n\nCity Council[1996] 4 All ER 737, this defence is not available in the context of\n\nprivate law claims.",
        "The eighth issue: interest awarded to the respondent": "54 The authorities cited by the respondent related to situations in\n\nwhich the judge could award interest pursuant to what is now s 12 of the Civil Law Act\n\n(Cap 43). This provides:12. —(1) In any proceedings tried in any court of record for the\n\n  recovery of any debt or damages, the court may, if it thinks fit, order that there shall\n\n  be included in the sum for which judgment is giveninterest at such rate as it thinks\n\n  fiton the whole or any part of the debt or damagesfor the whole or any part of\n\n  the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment.\n\n  (emphasis added)This isin pari materiawith s 3(1) of the Law Reform\n\n(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 in England. The words \"any debt or damages\"\n\nwere construed by the House of Lords inBP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2)[1982] 1 All ER 925:… the words \"any debt or damages\", in the context in\n\n  which they occur, are very wide, so that they cover any sum of money which is recoverable\n\n  by one party from another, either at common law or in equity or under a statute of the\n\n  kind here concerned.Hence the judge had the power to award interest on these sums.55 The first issue was whether the judge could have awarded interest\n\nfor the period that she did. The appellant pointed out that s 12(1) only allows for\n\ninterest to be awarded from the date the cause of action arose. It added that, since the\n\nrespondent could not have known of its right to recover the money until the date of the\n\njudgment below, interest should only have run from that date. AlthoughBP Explorationdealt with frustration of contract, the reasoning applied equally here because the common\n\nrationale was to prevent injustice to a successful plaintiff:… there cannot be any general rule that, whenever the amount of\n\n  any debt or damages payable by one party... to the other cannot be ascertained until\n\n  judgment is given, the court should never… award interest from a date earlier than\n\n  the date of such judgment. To apply such a rule would, in my opinion, be plainly\n\n  inconsistent with the express terms of s 3(1) [of the English Act], and in many\n\n  cases… workserious injustice on a successful plaintiff. (emphasis added)Hence the judge could exercise her discretion to award interest from\n\nthe dates that she did.56 The second issue was whether the judge was able to award interest at\n\nthe rate she did. We saw no reason to interfere with her decision to award interest at\n\nfive percent on the sums up to June 1995. However, we did not think that she should have\n\nlinked her decision to award interest at ten percent thereafter to the rate which the\n\nappellant was entitled to collect for the maintenance arrears. They were unrelated causes\n\nof action. Interest from July 1995 should be at the more usual rate of six per cent.",
        "The ninth issue: costs": "Party-and-party costs in general57 The principles governing the award of costs are elucidated inRe\n\nElgindata Ltd (No 2)[1993] 1 All ER 232, and adopted in Singapore inTullio v\n\nMaoro[1994] 2 SLR 489. The relevant passage inRe Elgindata Ltd (No 2)provides:The principles are these. (1) Costs are in the discretion of the court.\n\n  (2) They should follow the event, except when it appears to the court that… some\n\n  other order should be made. (3) The general rule does not cease to apply simply because\n\n  the successful party raises issues or makes allegations on which he fails, but where that\n\n  has caused a significant increase in the length or cost of the proceedings he may be\n\n  deprived of the whole or a part of his costs. (4) Where the successful party raises issues\n\n  or makes allegations improperly or unreasonably, the court may not only deprive him of his\n\n  costs but order him to pay the whole or a part of the unsuccessful party’s\n\n  costs… the fourth implies that a successful party who neither improperly nor\n\n  unreasonably raises issues or makes allegations on which he fails ought not to be ordered\n\n  to pay any part of the unsuccessful party’s costs.As the respondent was the successful party below, according to\n\nprinciple (2),prima facie, it should be awarded costs. As for principle (3), the\n\nstarting point was that the respondent failed on one ground,colore officii.\n\nHowever, it should not be deprived of its costs. Firstly, the trial ended within the\n\nallotted time. Secondly, as the respondent relied on the same facts for proving mistake of\n\nlaw and for provingcolore officii, and as the appellant relied on the same\n\ndefences to both claims, it was unlikely that the respondent’s pleadingcolore\n\nofficiicaused a significant increase in the cost of the proceedings. The respondent\n\nhad also paid costs to the appellant for the late amendment of its pleadings. Since it was\n\nnot alleged that the respondent had raised issues improperly or unreasonably, according to\n\nprinciple (4), it was not ordered to pay the appellant’s costs.58 The court said inTullio v Maoro:Although the question of costs is always in the discretion of the court\n\n  and an appellate court will not readily interfere with the proper exercise of that\n\n  discretion, an appellate court should not hesitate to interfere where the discretion has\n\n  been manifestly exercised wrongly or exercised on wrong principles.As the judge did not exercise her discretion wrongly nor on wrong\n\nprinciples, there was no reason to overturn her order on costs.Costs of more than one solicitor59 Both parties asked the court to certify costs for more than one\n\nsolicitor under Order 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court:19. –(1) Costs for getting up the case by and for attendance in\n\n  Court of more than one solicitor for a party shall not be allowed unless the Court at the\n\n  hearing or within 7 days thereof so certifies.(2) Such costs may be allowed notwithstanding that the solicitors are\n\n  members of the same firm of solicitors.We think that the requests were justified. The issues in this appeal\n\nwere numerous and entailed consideration of reform of the law of Singapore. The lengthy\n\nsubmissions and large number of authorities cited also showed that considerable effort\n\nmust have been expended.Conclusion60 We recognise the following as specific defences to a claim for money\n\npaid out under a mistake of law: settlement of an honest claim; compromise; change of\n\nposition; payment made under a settled view of the law; and perhaps in non-private law\n\nclaims, passing on the burden of payment. Lord Goff was alive to the possibility that\n\nother defences may be developed. We do not think that the following should be defences to\n\nsuch a claim: payment made under a closed transaction; honest receipt; promissory\n\nestoppel; and estoppel by convention. For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal.61 We awarded the costs of this appeal to the respondent. We certified\n\nthat costs for two solicitors be allowed. We also ordered that the security for costs and\n\nany accrued interest be released to the respondent to account of costs.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeSgd:CHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealSgd:TAN LEE MENGJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
