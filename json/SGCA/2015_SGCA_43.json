        "Introduction": "1       This was an appeal against the decision of the\n                    High Court Judge (“the Judge”) which is reported asANB v ANC and another[2014] 4 SLR 747 (“the\n                    GD”). At the conclusion of proceedings below, the Judge set aside,inter alia, an interim injunction previously\n                    granted at theex partestage in favour of the\n                    Appellant restraining the Respondents from using, disclosing or destroying\n                    certain information in their possession which was extracted from the hard disk\n                    of the Appellant’s personal notebook computer and which the Appellant\n                    alleged was taken, copied and distributed in breach of confidence. We allowed\n                    the appeal and granted an interlocutory injunction on terms and upon certain\n                    undertakings given by the Appellant and the solicitors of both parties. The full\n                    details of the orders made and the undertakings given are set out in the\n                    document titled “Annex A” which is appended to our grounds of\n                    decision. 2       We were informed only recently that the parties\n                    had arrived at an amicable full and final settlement. In the circumstances, and\n                    given that the parties had consented to the discharge of the undertakings\n                    mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this court directed that the undertakings\n                    be discharged forthwith without requiring the parties’ attendance before\n                    it. However, given the importance of the legal issues hitherto raised in the\n                    proceedings before us we are of the view that – in addition to setting out\n                    the reasons for our decision – we should also flag out some of the more\n                    salient points that will need to be considered in more detail when these issues\n                    come before the courts for a definitive ruling in the future.",
        "The facts": "3       The Appellant and the 1st Respondent were,\n                    at the time the appeal was heard and decided, husband and wife, respectively.\n                    They were also, at that particular point in time, involved in acrimonious\n                    divorce proceedings. They have two children aged six and eight who were, as\n                    noted by the Judge at various junctures of the GD, unfortunately caught in the\n                    acrimonious currents of the divorce proceedings. The 2nd Respondent was the\n                    law firm which represented the wife. Although there were various circumstances\n                    surrounding the divorce proceedings that were laid down by the Judge in the GD,\n                    we reproduce only the relevant facts that concerned the case before us,ie, those surrounding the alleged\n                    surreptitious copying of information stored in the Appellant’s personal\n                    notebook computer. 4       It was not disputed that the 1st Respondent had\n                    moved out of the matrimonial home on 26 September 2012 to reside somewhere\n                    else. Divorce proceedings were thereafter commenced by the 1st Respondent on\n                    10 October 2012. The 1st Respondent then returned to the matrimonial home\n                    on 18 December 2012 while the Appellant was overseas with their two\n                    children to find the doors to the matrimonial home padlocked. She then, on the\n                    same day, engaged a locksmith to unlock the padlock for her to gain entry into\n                    the matrimonial home. 5       The 1st Respondent found the Appellant’s\n                    personal notebook computer while she was in the house. She took it from the\n                    house and passed it to her private investigator. The private investigator then,\n                    upon the 1st Respondent’s instructions, proceeded to make copies of files\n                    contained in the hard disk drive. The copied data was saved onto an external\n                    hard disk drive by the private investigator and he passed it to the 1st\n                    Respondent who then passed on the information to the 2nd Respondent for use\n                    in the divorce proceedings she was engaged in with the Appellant. The 1st\n                    Respondent also returned the Appellant’s personal notebook computer to its\n                    original location in the matrimonial home where she had initially found\n                    it. 6       The Appellant subsequently discovered the\n                    surreptitious copying of the information from his personal notebook computer\n                    when the 1st Respondent attempted to adduce some of that information as evidence\n                    in the divorce proceedings they were engaged in. He then commenced proceedings\n                    claiming,inter alia, breach of confidence and\n                    obtained the interim injunction which the Judge had discharged in the\n                    proceedings below.",
        "The decision of the High Court": "7       Aside from the Judge’s views concerning\n                    the exclusionary discretion of the court in civil proceedings which we will, for\n                    the reasons given below (at [10]–[12]), deal with tentatively at a later\n                    part of our grounds, the Judge, in discharging the interim injunction, based his\n                    decision on his finding that there was no serious question as to whether there\n                    was a breach of confidence to be tried. In coming to this conclusion, the Judge\n                    provided the following reasons (see the GD at [66]–[67]): (a)     The information did not possess the\n                        necessary quality of confidence and was different from the sexual affairs of\n                        a person – a matter found by Judith Prakash J to possess the\n                        necessary quality of confidence in the Singapore High Court decision ofX Pte Ltd and another v CDE[1992]\n                        2 SLR(R) 575 (“X v CDE”). (b)     The information was not obtained in circumstances\n                        importing an obligation of confidence as the relationship between the\n                        husband and wife had already broken down in the light of the fact that they\n                        were living apart. 8       Although his finding that there was no serious\n                    question to be tried was a sufficient ground for discharging the interim\n                    injunction, the Judge observed that the balance of convenience also lay in\n                    favour of the Respondents as, in relation to the information already placed\n                    before other courts in the course of the divorce proceedings, “allowing\n                    the [interim] [i]njunction to stand would be tantamount to interfering with\n                    another court’s fact-finding process and its right to decide on\n                    admissibility, relevance and weight” (see the GD at [72]).",
        "Some words of caution": "9       Before we give the detailed grounds for our\n                    decision, it is important, in our view, to state at the outset what this case is\n                    – and is not – about. 10     This case is, first and foremost, aboutthe law of breach of confidence. It isnotone that turns (at least on thefacts of the present case) onthe law\n                        of evidence. Further, this case relates to the granting of aninterlocutoryinjunction andnotafinalinjunction.\n                    Put simply, we allowed the appeal in the present case on the basis that the test\n                    applicable to the granting of an interlocutory injunction laid down in leading\n                    House of Lords decision ofAmerican Cyanamid Co v Ethicon\n                        Ltd[1975] AC 396 (“American\n                        Cyanamid”) was satisfied, since: (a) there was a\n                    serious question – as to whether a breach of confidence was committed\n                    – to be tried; and (b) the balance of convenience lay in favour of\n                    granting the interlocutory injunction. 11     In so far as the need to emphasise the point\n                    that this case related to the law of breach of confidence and not the law of\n                    evidence is concerned, we note at this particular juncture that the Respondents\n                    had, in the court below, focused instead (and wrongly, at least on the facts of\n                    the present case) on the law of evidence. Indeed, in the court below, counsel\n                    for the Respondents, Mr S Suressh, sought to argue that the principal\n                    precedent on which the Appellant had relied on in establishing his case that\n                    there had beena breach of confidence(viz, the English Court of Appeal decision ofImerman v Tchenguiz and others[2011] Fam 116\n                        (“Imerman”)) wasnot applicablein theSingaporecontext because it was,inter\n                        alia,premised onadifferent rule of evidence. In particular,\n                    Mr Suressh submitted thatImermanproceeded\n                    on the assumption that the courtcouldrefuse to\n                    admit improperly or illegally obtained evidence whereas, by virtue of the\n                    decision of the Court of 3 Judges inLaw Society of Singapore\n                        v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis[2008] 2 SLR(R) 239\n                        (“Phyllis Tan”), the Singapore\n                    courts hadnosimilar discretion to exclude such\n                    evidence. However, the Judge noted, in this regard, that this court had, in the\n                    criminal decision ofMuhammad bin Kadar v Public\n                        Prosecutor[2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“Kadar”), held that a court nevertheless retained a\n                    discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence if the\n                    prejudicial effect of that evidence towards a party exceeded its probative value\n                    (hereinafter referred to as “the exclusionary discretion”). The\n                    Judge then proceeded to opine thatthe exclusionary\n                        discretionwouldnot, however, be\n                    exercised in the context ofcivilproceedings in\n                    most instances (see the GD at [51]) and (more specifically) in the context of\n                    the present case (see the GD at [52]). 12     While it may be that an interlocutory\n                    injunction, if ordered, would practically prevent the Respondents from tendering\n                    the information as evidenceby copying and distributing the\n                        informationin any other suitin potential\n                        breach of confidence, it must be noted that such an injunction\n                    does not equate to a decision as to theadmissibility of such\n                        information as evidence. The latter decision will only have to be\n                    made if, for example, the information in the present case was tendered as\n                    evidence in support of a suit and the Appellant objects to its admissibility on\n                    the ground that it was being used in breach of confidence. 13     Further, and with respect, it was by no means\n                    clear, in our view, that the Judge had rendered a correct statement of the\n                    relevant legal position as to the exercise of an exclusionary discretion in the\n                    context of civil proceedings for reasons which we tentatively state below. Our\n                    views (set out briefly below at [27]–[31]) are tentative simply because,\n                    as already mentioned, given the fact that this appeal turned on the law relating\n                    tobreach of confidence(and whether there was a\n                    serious question to be tried in this regard), the law of evidence wasnot even engaged to begin with–at least on the facts of the present case. Since\n                    the issue of admissibility under the law of evidence did not even arise, the\n                    (further) issue as to whether or not the exclusionary discretion may also be\n                    exercised in civil proceedings (such as the present) did not,a fortiori, arise. 14     It thus follows from the preceding paragraphs\n                    that we didnotaccept Mr Suressh’s\n                    argument thatImermanisnotgood law in the Singapore context in so far as the relevant\n                    legal principles concerning breach of confidence were concerned. Nonetheless,\n                    there wasalsononeed for us to reach aconclusivedecisionin\n                    the present case as to whether the legal principles enunciated inImerman, and other associated overseas decisions\n                    concerning the protection of private information in the context of the law of\n                    confidence (which have not been considered by our courts prior to the present\n                    case), should be accepted in Singapore. This leads us to our second caveat\n                    – that this case concerned the granting of aninterlocutoryinjunction,notafinalinjunction. As stated above, it was\n                    sufficient for us to be satisfied that there was, in the present case, a serious\n                    question to be tried as to whether or not there had been a breach of confidence\n                    by the Respondents. In our view, in conjunction with the live factual disputes,\n                    the novel and difficult question of law as to whether our law of confidence\n                    protects, at least to a certain extent, private information that is\n                    surreptitiously extracted or obtained (as illustrated in cases such asImerman) was to be properly dealt with at trial (see\n                    also the Singapore High Court decision ofLim and Tan\n                        Securities Pte v Sunbird Pte Ltd[1991] 2 SLR(R) 776 at\n                    [22], cited with approval by this court inObegi Melissa and\n                        others v Vestwin Trading Pte Ltd and another[2008] 2 SLR(R)\n                    540 at [40] (“Obegi Melissa”)). It\n                    was, in the light of this and the fact that the balance of convenience lay in\n                    favour of the Appellant, that we allowed the appeal and granted the\n                    interlocutory injunction on terms and upon certain undertakings. 15     Bearing these caveats in mind, we now proceed\n                    to give the detailed grounds for our decision.",
        "The issues before the court": "16     The parties did not dispute the applicable\n                    testvis-à-visthe granting of an interlocutory\n                    injunction. In our view, the only issues before this court were whether: (a)     the Judge was correct in finding\n                        that there was no serious question as to whether there had been a breach of\n                        confidence to be tried; and (b)     the Judge was correct in finding that the balance of\n                        convenience lay in favour of the Respondents.",
        "Serious question to be tried": "17     In determining whether there was a serious\n                    question to be tried, the Judge below relied on the formulation of the test for\n                    breach of confidence set out in the seminal decision of Megarry J in the\n                    English High Court ruling inCoco v A N Clark\n                        (Engineers) Ltd[1969] RPC 41 (“Coco”), a decision which has been cited with approval in\n                    various local High Court decisions (seeX v CDEat [27];PH\n                        Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd v Intrepid Offshore\n                        Construction Pte Ltd and another[2012] 4 SLR 36 at [55];\n                    andClearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and\n                        others[2015] 1 SLR 163 at [64]). The three elements that\n                    must be established by a plaintiff in a breach of confidence claim, as stated by\n                    Megarry J inCoco(at 47), are that: (a)     the information to be protected must\n                        have the necessary quality of confidence about it; (b)     that information must have been\n                        imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence;\n                    and (c)     there must be\n                        an unauthorised use of the information to the detriment of the party who\n                        originally communicated it. 18     We did not disagree with the applicability of\n                    this test in the context of what has been described as “old fashioned\n                    breach of confidence” cases (see Paul Stanley,The Law\n                        of Confidentiality: A Restatement(Hart Publishing, 2008)\n                        (“Stanley”) at p 6),ie, cases such as those which involve the\n                    transmission of information between transacting parties in a commercial context,\n                    or even the alleged engagement in an extra-marital affair between a man and his\n                    personal secretary (seeX v CDE).\n                    However, the strict application of this test in relation to cases such as the\n                    one before us that involved the surreptitious taking of personal information\n                    must be viewed with at least some circumspection – the protection of such\n                    private information having been “shoehorned” into the law of\n                    confidence in England, not least owing to the need (see below at [21]) for the\n                    English courts to give effect to the relevant provisions (and corresponding\n                    articles) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42) (UK) (“the HRA”)\n                    (seeperLord Phillips of Worth\n                    Matravers MR (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision ofDouglas and others v Hello! Ltd and others\n                        (No 3)[2006] QB 125 at [96]). The HRA is, of course, not\n                    law in the Singapore context (see also below at [21]). 19     We thus disagreed with the Judge’s rigid\n                    application of the test inCocoto the facts of\n                    this case in dealing with whether there was a serious question of a breach of\n                    confidence to be tried. In doing so, the Judge failed to consider English (and\n                    other) jurisprudence which has, under the confidentialitygenus, developed “different features” for cases\n                    involving the protection of private information in contrast to the “old\n                    fashioned breach of confidence” cases (seeImermanat [67]). For example, rather than asking whether the\n                    information possessed the necessary quality of confidence and whether that\n                    information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence\n                    pursuant to the first and second elements in the test laid down inCocorespectively, the question asked in England in a\n                    case concerning the protection of private information is whether the plaintiff\n                    had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in relation to that\n                    information (perLord Nicholls of Birkenhead\n                    and Lord Hope of Craighead in the House of Lords decision ofCampbell v MGN Ltd[2004] 2 AC 457 at [21] and\n                    [85], respectively). Further, with respect to the third element, it was held inImerman(at [71]) that there was no need to\n                    prove that there had been a misuse of the information for the claim to succeed\n                    (although this holding purported to apply to “old fashioned breach of\n                    confidence” cases as well). 20     In our view, the main issue which arose from\n                    this case was whether we should (and, if so, to what extent) adopt the English\n                    (or other) jurisprudence concerning surreptitiously acquired private information\n                    into our law of confidence. This would include consideration of,inter alia, the decision inImermanwhere an injunction was granted by the English Court of\n                    Appeal upon its finding that the surreptitious procurement of information by the\n                    wife’s brother from the husband’s personal computer amounted to a\n                    breach of confidence – a case factually similar to the case before\n                    us. 21     The Respondent submitted that many of these\n                    cases, includingImerman, were driven by the\n                    coming into force of the HRA which was enacted pursuant to the UK’s\n                    membership of the European Union and which incorporated into English law the\n                    right to privacy under Art 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human\n                    Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (4 November 1950), 213 UNTS 221 (Art 8\n                    is to be found in Schedule 1 of the HRA). In this regard, the\n                    1st Respondent argued that there was no serious question to be tried since\n                    these cases were irrelevant in the light of the absence of any express guarantee\n                    of such a right under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\n                    (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”) and\n                    that the Judge was consequently correct in strictly applying the test inCoco. 22     Whilst it is true that the right to privacy is\n                    not expressly enumerated under the Constitution, it must nevertheless be\n                    acknowledged that the protection of privacy under the law of confidence in\n                    England in fact materialisedbeforethe enactment\n                    of the HRA pursuant to acommon law right to\n                        privacy. The first authoritative extension of the law of\n                    confidence to information obtained without the consent of the plaintiff is to be\n                    found in Lord Goff of Chieveley’s seminal judgment 25 years ago\n                    inAttorney-General v Observer Ltd and others[1990] 1 AC 109 (at 281) (see also generally Tanya Aplin, Lionel Bently,\n                    Phillip Johnson & Simon Malynicz,Gurry on\n                        Breach of Confidence – The Protection of Confidential\n                        Information(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012),\n                    especially at paras 6.52–6.191 as well asStanley). Further, other common law jurisdictions, such as New\n                    Zealand, have also extended protection to private informationviathe law of confidence in the absence of any express\n                    constitutional (or similar) guarantees to the right to privacy. Finally, on a\n                    policy level, legislative developments in recent years, which included the\n                    enactment of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) and\n                    the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No 26 of 2012), also point towards\n                    an increasing recognition of the need to protect personal privacy –\n                    developments which must also be viewed in the context of recent spates of data\n                    breaches involving commercial customers and government employees in the United\n                    States. 23     In our view, these factors meant that a\n                    serious legal issue arose from this case as to whether we should afford, like\n                    the courts in England and various other jurisdictions, protection to one’s\n                    privacy by way of the law of confidence regardless of whether such a right is\n                    guaranteed under the Constitution (an issue which is also dealt with in the\n                    comprehensive and perceptive article by George Wei Sze Shun, “Milky Way\n                    and Andromeda: Privacy, Confidentiality and Freedom of Expression” (2006)\n                    18 SAcLJ 1, especially at paras 81-89). The extent to which we should\n                    adopt such jurisprudence,ie, the circumstances\n                    under which the law of confidence would extend its protection to private\n                    information acquired without consent, also depended on a determination of the\n                    facts (that are to a certain extent disputed) of the case. These matters, to our\n                    mind, gave rise to a serious question to be tried as to whether there was a\n                    breach of confidence and we thus disagreed with the findings of the Judge on\n                    this issue. However, we would again highlight the caveat that we were by no\n                    means endorsing, or even encouraging, the identification of a right to\n                    protection of private information under our law of confidence. We were simply of\n                    the view that such an issue was better left to be determined at trial upon a\n                    full and comprehensive canvassing of the relevant legal as well as factual\n                    arguments by counsel for both sides (which is of course now moot in view of the\n                    settlement arrived at between the parties (see above at [2])). 24     As a final point of note, we held inObegi Melissathat a triable issue concerning a breach\n                    of confidence arose in a case where documents which were allegedly\n                    “abandoned” were obtained by one party from another\n                    surreptitiously. Although that case dealt with whether there was a triable issue\n                    in relation to the granting of leave to defend upon an application for summary\n                    judgment, we nonetheless found that it supported our conclusion that there was a\n                    serious question to be tried in this case.",
        "The balance of convenience": "25     As observed by Lord Nicholls in the House\n                    of Lords decision ofCream Holdings Ltd and others v\n                        Bangerjee and another[2005] 1 AC 253 (at [18]),\n                    “[c]onfidentiality, once breached, is lost for ever”. Given that\n                    there was a serious issue to be tried in relation to a breach of confidence, we\n                    found that the balance of convenience also lay in favour of granting an\n                    injunction to preserve the confidential (or private) quality of the information.\n                    The Respondents relied on the Judge’s reasoning below and submitted that\n                    prejudice could arise if the information obtained could not be used in the\n                    divorce proceedings between the parties. Again, we point out that these\n                    proceedings did not relate to the admissibility of the information as evidence\n                    in the divorce proceedings (see above at [12]). In any event, we made it clear\n                    in the orders made that our holding in this case did not prevent the\n                    1st Respondent from relying on her knowledge of the information to seek\n                    disclosure of the informationviaspecific\n                    discovery in other proceedings in the usual course of litigation (although the\n                    admissibility of the information as evidence would be subject to the decision of\n                    whichever court is seized of the matter) (see Order of Court in Annex A at\n                    paras 1(c) and 10). In our view, such an arrangement obviated the practical\n                    prejudice contemplated by the Respondents and the Judge below that may arise\n                    upon a granting of an injunction.",
        "Conclusion": "26     For the reasons given above, we held that the\n                    test inAmerican Cyanamidwas satisfied by the\n                    Appellant and granted an interlocutory injunction in terms. These reasons formed\n                    thesole basisof our decision. Nonetheless, we\n                    would also proceed to take the opportunity to provide our tentative views on the\n                    inherent discretion of the courts to exclude evidence which the Judge had dealt\n                    with substantially below.",
        "Some observations on the inherent discretion to exclude\n                evidence": "27     As we have explained at the outset of these\n                    grounds (at [9]–[14]), it wasunnecessary,\n                    in our view, for us to have considered whether or not the information which\n                    formed the subject matter of the injunction was admissible pursuant tothe law of evidence. However, this doesnotmean that the law of evidence willneverbe engaged.Much will depend on\n                        the particular facts of the case itself(see the example provided\n                    above at [12]). Nevertheless, where (as on the present facts) an interlocutory\n                    injunction ought to be issued to prevent a potential breach of confidence in the\n                    first place, it is important to reiterate that the court need not (consistently\n                    with what the Appellant argued, albeit contrary to what the Respondents had\n                    argued in the court below) even begin to enter into an inquiry as to whether or\n                    not the information that constitutes the subject matter of a breach of\n                    confidence claim is (or is not) admissible pursuant to the relevant principles\n                    of the law of evidence. Indeed, what the relevant principles of the law of\n                    evidence are in this last-mentioned regard would need to be decided when\n                    detailed arguments are made on a future occasion when the issue arises directly\n                    for consideration by the court. We would thus only make a few observations at\n                    this particular juncture in relation to the views expressed by the Judge below\n                    as to the court’s inherent discretion to exclude evidence. 28     The Judge below, after consideringPhyllis TanandKadar(cases which concerned criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings), found that the\n                    courts did possess an inherent discretion to exclude evidence inbothcriminal and civil proceedings (and for an\n                    excellent overview of this particular area of the law, see ch 10 of Jeffrey\n                    Pinsler,Evidence and the Litigation Process(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013)). However, he was also of the view that a distinction\n                    should be “made between civil and criminal proceedings because of the\n                    need for precautions against injustice in the latter” (see the GD at [51]\n                    (and citing Prof Jeffrey Pinsler’s article, “Admissibility and\n                    the Discretion to Exclude Evidence: In Search of a Systematic Approach”\n                    (2013) 25 SAcLJ 215 (“Pinsler”)\n                    at para 2 (which paragraph was, however, referring specifically to the then\n                    newstatutorydiscretion introduced by the\n                    Evidence (Amendment) Act 2012 (No 2 of 2012))). He thus concluded that, in\n                    the context of civil proceedings, the prejudicial effect in the probative\n                    value/prejudicial effect balancing exercise enunciated inKadar“assumes a far lighter weight and role when put in\n                    the balance against the probative value component” and that “[i]n\n                    most instances, it boils down to a matter of weight in civil proceedings”\n                    (see the GD at [51]). 29     Whilst we agree that different societal and\n                    policy reasons as well as arguments may applyvis-à-visthe inherent discretion of the court to exclude\n                    evidence as between criminal and civil proceedings, we do not, with respect,\n                    think that thisnecessarilyleads to the\n                    conclusion arrived at by the Judge,ie, that the\n                    exclusionary discretion would be exercised with less rigidity such that most\n                    evidence would not be excluded in civil proceedings. First, it may simply be the\n                    case that the probative value/prejudicial effect balancing exercise (though\n                    well-suited to the nuances of and the values at stake in criminal proceedings)\n                    cannot be applied to civil proceedings and that a different balancing exercise\n                    should be conducted in that respect. Secondly,Phyllis\n                        TanandKadarrelated to fact\n                    situations which concerned the propriety of the conduct of law enforcement\n                    officers and private investigators with regard to the obtaining of the evidence\n                    and the effect of that conduct on the quality of the evidence. This is different\n                    from cases such as the present which was not only concerned with the propriety\n                    of the conduct of the Respondents, but also with the protection of the\n                    Appellant’s potential pre-existingproprietaryrights over the evidence as well, the protection of\n                    such potential proprietary rights in general being a matter of public interest.\n                    Thirdly, whilst the exclusion of the evidence inPhyllis\n                        TanandKadarmay have deprived the\n                    prosecuting parties in both cases of certain evidence which could have been used\n                    to convict the defendants (ie, that the evidence\n                    in question could only have been admitted in the form and manner in which it was\n                    obtained), which may weigh against the court excluding the evidence, the same\n                    cannot be said of cases such as the case before us. The Respondents had an\n                    obvious alternative to obtain the same evidence, but in a lawful manner –\n                    that is, by way of discovery. 30     The factors discussed above illustrate the\n                    fact that too sharp a distinction should not be drawn between criminal and civil\n                    proceedings without further analysis of theprecise\n                        typeof impropriety or illegality behind the evidence attempted\n                    to be adduced – although we hasten to add that nothing we state should\n                    detract from the importance of the exclusionary discretion with regard tocriminalcases because the life or liberty of\n                    the accused are at stake. Returning to the facts of the present case, although\n                    the 1st Respondent in this case might – looked at from one point of view\n                    – be said to have taken the information improperly or illegally, we note\n                    (consistently with the views we have just expressed) that thismightbea different conception of\n                        the concept of “unlawfully or illegally obtained evidence”\n                        which forms the basis of decisions in cases such asKadarandPhyllis Tan, and we therefore (except to\n                    the extent of our observations on the exclusionary discretion) say no more about\n                    this particular issue in this judgment. What we would note, however, is that\n                    there are good reasons why the inherent discretion to exclude evidence may also\n                    be needed to be exercised more robustly – or at least more vigorously than\n                    what the Judge envisaged in his decision below – incivilproceedings in the light of the very different\n                    countervailing factors that arise from the need to protect potential proprietary\n                    interests and the public interest in promoting the obtaining of evidence by way\n                    of legally prescribed methods. Put simply, the respecting of such rights and\n                    rules is something which is expected when one is living in a civilised society\n                    where the Rule of Law (and not of the jungle) must prevail. This is especially\n                    needful in the context of the sea change in both the quality – as well as\n                    the availability of – technology in the modern world. Much would of course\n                    also depend, in the final analysis, on the precise facts as well as context of\n                    the case. 31     We have enunciated the views above for the\n                    purpose of highlighting how the inherent discretion to exclude evidence may,\n                    contrary to the views of the Judge below, not be exercised as sparingly in civil\n                    proceedings as he had envisaged in his decision. Nonetheless, as we have already\n                    caveated above, these views are merely tentative and a full and final\n                    pronouncement on this issue, including the applicability ofPhyllis TanandKadar(the former\n                    decision of which, we note, was strongly critiqued by Prof Ho Hock Lai in\n                    ““National Values on Law and Order” and the Discretion to\n                    Exclude Wrongfully Obtained Evidence” [2012] Journal of Commonwealth\n                    Criminal Law 232), should only be made after considering the detailed arguments\n                    in an appropriate case in the future. Indeed, Prof Pinsler was of the view\n                    that the fact that thecommon lawexclusionary\n                    discretion discussed above presently exists side-by-side with a more specificstatutoryexclusionary discretion embodied\n                    within ss 32(3) and 47(4) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)\n                    (in relation to hearsay evidence and expert opinion evidence, respectively)\n                    results in a situation that is, in his view, “unsatisfactory” (seePinslerat para 40).",

All parts of the Copied Data subject to privilege in the hard and\n                    electronic copies of the affidavits filed by the 1st Respondent on\n                    27 March 2013 and 2 May 2013 (“D4895 Affidavits”) shall\n                    be forthwith expunged from (a) the copies of the said affidavits on file\n                    with the Court and (b) drafts and/or copies in the possession, custody\n                    and/or power of the Respondents. The Appellant and the Respondents shall make\n                    all applications to Court and/or consent to such applications (as the case may\n                    be), as may be necessary to give effect to this paragraph, with no Order as to\n                    costs. 4       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in\n                    this Order: (a)     The Respondents shall be permitted to\n                    retain in their possession, hard copies and electronic copies of:- (i)       all complaints and/or draft complaints made\n                    by them to the relevant authorities as at 10 May 2013 that refer to and/or\n                    exhibit the Copied Data, or any part thereof; (ii)       the D4895 Affidavits and any drafts\n                    thereof; and (iii)       all Affidavits filed in the Suit\n                    to-date, provided that any Copied Data in the above documents that is\n                    subject to privilege has been expunged therefrom, in accordance with\n                    paragraph 3 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the 1st Respondent\n                    shall also be permitted to use the D4895 Affidavits in D4895 after privileged\n                    material has been removed from them in accordance with paragraph 3 above,\n                    subject to the law of evidence. (b)     The Respondents shall be permitted to\n                    retain with Harry Elias Partnership LLP (“HEP”) one hard copy\n                    of each of the following, without any privileged material redacted or\n                    expunged:- (i)       all complaints and/or draft complaints made by\n                    them to the relevant authorities as at 10 May 2013 that refer to and/or\n                    exhibit the Copied Data, or any part thereof; (ii)       the D4895 Affidavits and any drafts thereof;\n                    and (iii)       all Affidavits filed in the Suit\n                    to-date.

(b)     At the same time as they comply with (a)\n                    above, the Respondents shall provide to the Appellant a complete\n                list: (i)       of all storage media, devices and computers\n                    (each a “Repository” and together the\n                    “Repositories”) in the possession, custody or power\n                of: (1)       either of the Respondents; (2)       the servants and/or agents of either of the\n                    Respondents; and/or (3)       any other person(s) that either of the\n                    Respondents have made the Copied Data or any part thereof, available\n                to, on which electronic copies of the Copied Data (“Electronic\n                    Copies”) are resident or were previously resident (to the best of the\n                    Respondents’ knowledge and belief), excluding the Wife’s HDD;\n                    and (ii)       stating the location(s) of the Electronic\n                    Copies in the relevant Repository by reference to the specific drive(s),\n                    folder(s) and filename(s) (to the best of the Respondents’ knowledge and\n                    belief). (c)     Within 2 days of the above list\n                    being provided to the Appellant, the Respondents shall give, allow and/or\n                    procure the Appellant’s nominated computer forensic expert\n                    (“ACFE”) access to the Electronic Copies in the possession,\n                    custody or power of either of the Respondents and/or their servants and/or\n                    agents. (d)     Upon such access being given to the\n                    ACFE: (i)       he shall transfer the Electronic Copies,\n                    and all parts thereof, that he may find resident on the said Repositories,\n                    excluding the Wife’s HDD, onto an external storage medium\n                    (“Preserved Data Storage Medium”); and (ii)       he shall thereafter take all necessary\n                    steps to permanently and irretrievably remove the Electronic Copies, and all\n                    parts thereof, from the said Repositories, excluding the Wife’s HDD, while\n                    taking all reasonable measures to preserve or retain data on the said\n                    Repositories that is not part of the Copied Data. (e)     When the ACFE has completed his work, he\n                    shall certify that he has done so to the Appellant and the Respondents, in\n                    writing. 6       The Delivered-Up Material and the Preserved\n                    Storage Data Medium shall be retained by DN in compliance with the undertaking\n                    set forth in the Schedule to this Order. 7       Any Copied Data or part thereof already on\n                    record with the relevant authorities as at 10 May 2013 … , shall\n                    continue to remain on record. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall\n                    preclude the Appellant from applying to exclude any part of the Copied Data from\n                    consideration by the said authorities on the grounds of privilege or\n                    otherwise. 8       This Order supercedes and replaces the Orders\n                    made in the Suit on 10 May 2013, 15 May 2013 and 22 July 2014 and\n                    in this Appeal on 12 September 2014. 9       All undertakings to the Court of Appeal given\n                    on 12 September 2014 are discharged, and the parties to the same as\n                    released from their undertakings. 10     Nothing herein constitutes a finding or\n                    determination by the Court of Appeal that the Copied Data or any part thereof is\n                    protected by confidentiality. 11     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein\n                    absolves the Appellant or the Respondents from their obligations of discovery in\n                    Court proceedings. 12     Costs of the Appeal, of Summons 3690\n                    of 2014 and Summons 2511 of 2013 be reserved to the trial judge and all\n                    earlier costs orders be set aside. 13     There shall be liberty to apply to the\n                    Court of Appeal.
