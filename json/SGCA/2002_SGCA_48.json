        "Background": "3.\n\n        Quek, who is 56 years old and holds a Bachelor\n\nof Science degree from the University of Singapore, was formerly employed as a Laboratory\n\nOfficer at the Toxicology Laboratory of the Department of Scientific Services\n\n(\"DSS\") for 12 years until June 2000. After his retirement, he served as a\n\nvolunteer member of the Bukit Timah Zone 5 Residents Committee (\"RC\").4.\n\n        Investigations revealed that on 31 December\n\n2001, a New Year’s Eve party was organised by the RC. The party was to be held at the\n\nRC centre on the void deck of Block 319, Clementi Avenue. At around 4 pm on that day, Quek\n\nwas asked by Madam Doreen Lum, the chairperson of the RC, to purchase 20 packets of\n\nchicken rice for a number of people who were helping out at the party. He bought and\n\ndelivered the chicken rice but felt aggrieved at having been given the task without\n\nsufficient notice. In fact, he was already quite unhappy with Madam Lum as he thought that\n\nshe had taken advantage of him and not given him sufficient credit for his work.5.\n\n        Quek decided to teach Madam Lum a lesson. He\n\nhad in his possession some methomyl, a highly toxic insecticide. This is a controlled\n\npoison under the Environmental Pollution Control Act and is unavailable to the public. He\n\nhad obtained the methomyl when he was employed by the DSS as he had been asked to handle a\n\npolice exhibit involving methomyl that had been mixed with coffee drunk by a Filipino maid\n\nwho committed suicide. He put one teaspoon or less of the methomyl into a 1.5 litre\n\n\"Ice Mountain\" bottle before filling it up with water. He then proceeded to the\n\nRC centre and placed the bottle of contaminated water on top of a cabinet, which was\n\ndirectly opposite Madam Lum’s office. Apparently, the RC centre’s regular supply\n\nof mineral water was placed on top of the said cabinet.6.\n\n        As it turned out, Madam Lum did not drink the\n\ncontaminated water. Mr Ho and Mr Wong drank from the contaminated water bottle. Some time\n\nlater, Quek saw the said bottle in the refrigerator in the RC centre. He did not remove\n\nthe bottle from the refrigerator even though he noticed that some 200 ml of the\n\ncontaminated water had been consumed. Subsequently, Madam Fong drank some of the\n\ncontaminated water. She found the water smelly and had the presence of mind to pour it\n\naway to prevent others from drinking it. All three persons who drank the contaminated\n\nwater became very ill. They lost consciousness and began to foam at the mouth. All three\n\nvictims were rushed to the National University Hospital for emergency treatment.7.\n\n        Madam Fong’s medical report indicated that\n\nshe had been quite well although she had a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was a\n\nhepatitis B carrier. When she was admitted to hospital after drinking the contaminated\n\nwater, she was drowsy and had bilaterally small pupils. Subsequently, she became even more\n\ndrowsy and hypoxemic. She was intubated and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\n\nInvestigations revealed a depressed level of pseudocholinesterase that was compatible with\n\norganophosphorous poisoning. She then suffered a lack of blood supply to her heart and\n\nrequired drugs to bring up her blood pressure. Her condition continued to worsen and she\n\ndeveloped renal failure. She died on 3 January 2002 at around 1.13 pm. The autopsy report\n\ncertified the cause of death as \"Bronchopneumonia\" and \"Acute Methomyl\n\nPoisoning\".8.\n\n        The other two victims, Mr Ho and Mr Wong, who\n\nwere also hospitalised, did not die but they were dangerously ill and went through much\n\nsuffering.9.\n\n        In due course, police investigations linked the\n\nmethomyl to Quek and he was duly arrested. He contended that he had no intention to kill\n\nanybody and that he had only wanted Madam Lum to have diarrhoea after drinking the\n\ncontaminated water.",
        "The trial judge’s decision": "10.\n\n        As Quek pleaded guilty, the only issue before\n\nthe trial judge was the imposition of an appropriate sentence. The trial judge noted that\n\nthe prosecution had asked him to impose a sentence of life imprisonment or imprisonment\n\nfor more than 10 years on Quek to reflect the community’s outrage and to deter others\n\nfrom attempting to commit the same crimes. However, he took the view that the facts of\n\nthis case, including the mitigating circumstances, marked \"the lower end\" of the\n\ncrimes in respect of which Quek was charged. He pointed out that Quek had an unblemished\n\nrecord and that \"he had hitherto been serving society long and well\". He added\n\nthat he believed that the remorse felt by Quek was genuine. As for the question of\n\ndeterrence, he thought that it would be sufficient for him to \"sound the warning to\n\nthose who may contemplate a similar mischief that they may be liable to be dealt with more\n\nseverely if they do not have similar mitigating factors\". As such, he sentenced Quek\n\nto a term of 9 years imprisonment in respect of the first charge and 3 years imprisonment\n\nin respect of the second charge. He ordered that the sentences of imprisonment shall run\n\nconcurrently.",
        "The appeal": "11.\n\n        The deputy public prosecutor, who reiterated\n\nthat the sentence imposed on Quek was manifestly inadequate, pointed out that Quek’s\n\nact of poisoning the mineral water cannot be viewed as being on the \"lower end of\n\nculpability\". This was not a crime that resulted from impulsive behaviour. Quek had\n\nensured that the methomyl would not be detected easily and he had hoped to snare his\n\nintended victim by placing the deadly bottle of contaminated water in a place where she\n\nwas likely to consume it. He ought to have known that there was a real risk that others\n\nmight end up drinking the contaminated water. He was not an amateur who was handling\n\nunknown substances. He knew that methomyl had killed a Filipino maid because he had a role\n\nin the investigations relating to her death and he had taken the poisonous substance home\n\nfor reasons best known to himself. It was fortuitous that only three persons drank the\n\ncontaminated water because the deceased had the presence of mind to throw away the\n\ncontaminated water. Viewed in this light, what Quek did with complete disregard for the\n\nlives and safety of others deserved condemnation in the strongest possible terms.12.\n\n        The prosecution asserted that a sentence of a\n\nlonger term of imprisonment was called for in order to deter others from following\n\nQuek’s footpath. He pointed out that inXia Qin Lai v PP[1999] 4 SLR 343,\n\n356, Yong Pung How CJ had said as follows:[T]he principle of deterrence\n\n    (especially general deterrence) dictated that the length of the custodial sentence awarded\n\n    had to be a not insubstantial one, in order to drive home the message to other like-minded\n\n    persons that such offences will not be tolerated, but not so much as to be unjust in the\n\n    circumstances of the case.13.\n\n        In the present case, when the effect of\n\nremission under thePrisons Regulations, Cap 247, Regulation 2, is taken into\n\naccount, Quek may only be in prison for around 6 years. The deputy public prosecutor\n\nrightly pointed out that such a sentence will send the wrong message to the public\n\nregarding the punishment imposed for causing death by poisoning. Admittedly, Quek has had\n\nan unblemished record. However, it must be borne in mind that inSim Gek Yong v PP[1995] 1 SLR 537, 541, the question of an accused’s record was put in the proper perspective\n\nwhen the court noted as follows:Like any other personal factor\n\n    put forward on an accused’s behalf in mitigation, the absence of similar antecedents\n\n    is something to be taken into account by the sentencing court and weighed in the balance\n\n    against other, possibly opposing, factors. The first and foremost consideration in this\n\n    balancing process, however, must be the public interest. Any sentence imposed must be such\n\n    that it enables our criminal law not merely to punish crime effectively but also to\n\n    prevent it.14.\n\n        Quek’s unblemished record must thus be\n\nweighed against the heinous act committed by him. As for whether or not he was genuinely\n\nremorseful, the DPP asserted that if he had really been remorseful, he would have helped\n\nhis victims by providing the doctors with information on the specific poison he had\n\nadministered to them so that they could have been treated more effectively at an early\n\nstage. He pointed out that Quek did not surrender himself to the police and was arrested\n\nonly after investigations linked him to the poison in question.15.\n\n        In the final analysis, it must be borne in mind\n\nthat the poisoning of the water in this case was not done by a layman. It was carried out\n\nby a former laboratory officer who knew that methomyl is a potent poison that had caused\n\nthe death of a Filipino maid. Its potency was such that a small amount from the\n\ncontaminated bottle was sufficient to lead to the death of Madam Fong and put the lives of\n\ntwo other victims in grave danger. As Quek had acted with complete disregard for the lives\n\nand safety of others, we agreed with the prosecution that he should be incarcerated for a\n\nlonger period than nine years. We thus sentenced Quek to imprisonment for 10 years for the\n\nfirst charge and 5 years for the second charge. As the maximum penalty for committing\n\neither of the said offences is life imprisonment, we ordered that the two terms of\n\nimprisonment are to run consecutively.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHAO HICK TINTAN LEE MENGChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
