        "The facts": "2\n\n         The defendant-appellants (Bandung) were\n\nat all material times the owners of the vessel \"Victoria Cob\". The\n\nrespondent-plaintiffs (Keppel TL) were bankers. A cargo of 508 m/t of crude palm oil,\n\nwhich was the subject matter of the action, was shipped by Shweta International Pte Ltd\n\n(Shweta) on board the vessel at Belawan, Indonesia for delivery at Kandla, India. Two\n\nbills of lading (B/L), dated 13 April 2000, were issued by Bandung for that shipment.3        In\n\nthe statement of claim, Keppel TL averred that they were the owners of the cargo which was\n\ncarried on board the vessel. In the alternative, they alleged that they were the lawful\n\nholders or indorsees of the two B/Ls and were thus entitled to immediate possession of the\n\nsame.4        \n\nKeppel TL further averred in the statement of claim the following:-7.    In breach of\n\n    contract and or in breach of their duty as baileesand or through negligencethe\n\n    Defendants failed to take reasonable care of the Cargo and to deliver the Cargo to the\n\n    Plaintiffs against the presentation and or production of the original Bills of Lading and\n\n    instead delivered the Cargo to person(s) who did not hold and or present and or have\n\n    possession of the said original Bills of Lading.8.Further\n\n    and or alternatively, the Defendants have converted the cargo to their own use and have\n\n    wrongfully deprived the Plaintiffs thereof.9.    By\n\n    reason of the Defendants’ breach of contract and or dutyand or negligence and orconversionaforesaid, the Plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage.5        We\n\nwould point out that the portions of 7 to 9 of the statement of claim quoted above which\n\nwere underscored, were the portions which were struck out by the judge below when allowing\n\nin part the appeal of Keppel TL. There was no appeal by Keppel TL against the order\n\nstriking out those parts. Following the decision of the High Court, what remained of\n\nKeppel TL’s claim was on contract/bills of lading.6        \n\nPursuant to a written request by Bandung, further and better particulars were furnished.\n\nKeppel TL stated that they obtained the two B/Ls by purchase from Ranchhoddas Purshottam\n\nHoldings (RPH). They alleged that at all material times Keppel TL were holding the B/Ls\n\nand yet Bandung delivered the cargo to another who never presented the B/Ls.7        When\n\nparticulars were requested as to the party who allegedly endorsed the B/Ls to Keppel TL,\n\nthe latter asserted that they were not relying on any indorsement on the B/Ls to establish\n\ntheir title to sue.8        After\n\nthe particulars were furnished, Bandung applied to have the action struck out under O.18\n\nr.19(1)(a)-(d) of the Rules of Court. From the affidavits filed by the parties, the\n\nfollowing facts emerged. Shweta had sold the cargo to RPH and shipped them on board the\n\n\"Victoria Cob\". Shweta indorsed the B/Ls in blank and delivered them to RPH who,\n\nin turn, had on-sold the cargo to Lanyard Foods Ltd (Lanyard). Thereafter, RPH, through\n\nits bankers, Bank National de Paris, delivered the two B/Ls to Keppel TL for\n\npurchase/negotiation, without filling in any name onto the indorsement made in blank by\n\nShweta.9        On 25\n\nMay 2000, Keppel TL filled in the name \"the State Bank of Saurashtra in India\"\n\n(State Bank) onto the blank endorsement made by Shweta and forwarded the two B/Ls to the\n\nState Bank to hold the same for collection by Lanyard. However, Lanyard never came forward\n\nto pay for the cargo and collect the two B/Ls, which were duly returned by the State Bank\n\nto Keppel TL in November 2000. No indorsement was made by the State Bank on the B/Ls\n\neither in blank or specially in favour of Keppel TL. Upon receipt of the two B/Ls, Keppel\n\nTL, on their own motion, just stamped the word \"CANCELLED\" over the indorsement\n\nin each of the two B/Ls.10        In\n\nthe meantime, the vessel arrived at Kandla and discharged the cargo to the agents of\n\nLanyard, without the production of the B/Ls.",
        "Decision below": "11        To\n\nsucceed under r 19(1)(a), no other material may be referred to except the pleadings. As\n\nKeppel TL had pleaded that they purchased the B/Ls from RPH, that Bandung had delivered\n\nthe cargo to a third party without the presentation of the B/Ls which were still held by\n\nthem and that they had thereby suffered loss, Bandung could not possibly succeed in having\n\nthe action struck out under r 19(1)(a). And the judge below so held.12        \n\nHowever, affidavit evidence is admissible for the purposes of r 19(1)(b)-(d), and such\n\nfacts may be taken into consideration in determining whether the action should be struck\n\nout. The judge below noted that Keppel TL inserted the name of State Bank in the blank\n\nindorsement as a safety precaution, in case either of the two B/Ls should go astray in\n\ntransit. With regard to the argument raised by Bandung, that the cancellation of the\n\nindorsement effected by Keppel TL had the result of nullifying the original indorsement of\n\nShweta, the judge was of the view that this was a question of law which was not altogether\n\nclear and that the issue should proceed to trial. He said that it was only in plain and\n\nobvious cases that the power of striking out should be invoked.",
        "Issues on appeal": "13        \n\nThere was in substance only one issue for this court to decide: Had Keppel TL the rights\n\nof suit under the contracts of carriage as evidenced by the two B/Ls. A related question\n\nwas, if Keppel had no such right of suit, whether the action should have been struck out.\n\nWe will first deal with the substantive question.",
        "Rights of Suit": "14        \n\nUnder s 2(1) of our Bills of Lading Act (B/L Act), which was adopted from, and is inpari\n\nmateriawith, the English Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1992 (COGSA 1992), a person\n\nwho has become the lawful holder of a B/L shall have and \"transferred to and vested\n\nin him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that\n\ncontract\".15        \n\nUnder s 5(2)(b) of the B/L Act, a person \"with possession of the bill as a result of\n\nthe completion, by delivery of the bill, of any indorsement of the bill or, in the case of\n\na bearer bill, of any other transfer of the bill\" and who \"has become the holder\n\nof the same in good faith\", shall be regarded as the lawful holder of the bill. In\n\nshort, an indorsee who is in possession of the B/L in good faith would be the lawful\n\nholder. We should add that under s 5(2)(a) and (c), two other situations are provided\n\nwhere a person could be the lawful holder of a bill but they do not concern us here.16        \n\nAnother relevant provision is section 2(5) of the B/L Act which reads:–\"2(5) Where rights are\n\n    transferred by virtue of the operation of subsection (1) in relation to any document, the\n\n    transfer for which that subsection provides shall extinguish any entitlement to those\n\n    rights which derives,(a)    where that\n\n      document is a bill of lading, from a person’s having been an original party to the\n\n      contract of carriage;(b)    in the case\n\n      of any document to which this Act applies, from the previous operation of that subsection\n\n      in relation to that document,\"17        The\n\neffect of s 2(5) is explained inCarver on Bills of Ladingas follows (at\n\n5-066):-\"The situation here to be\n\n    considered is that in which goods are shipped by A under a bill of lading which he\n\n    transfers to B who then transfers it to C. If each of these transfers is made in\n\n    circumstances vesting rights in the transferee, by virtue of section 2(1) of the 1992 Act,\n\n    then section 2(5) (which extinguishes the contractual rights of the transferor) operates\n\n    in relation to the second transfer no less than in relation to the first. In other words,\n\n    the first transfer extinguishes A’s rights under the bill of lading as an original\n\n    party to the contract of carriage, and the second transfer extinguishes the rights under\n\n    the contract which had been vested in B by virtue of section 2(1). The latter consequence\n\n    follows from section 2(5)(b) which extinguishes B’s ‘entitlement to those rights\n\n    which derives … from the previous operation of … [section 2(1)] … in\n\n    relation to the bill’.\"18        At\n\ncommon law an \"order\" bill is a document of title and may be transferred by\n\nindorsement. The provisions of s 5(2)(b) of the B/L Act reflect that position. There are\n\ntwo types of indorsements: blank indorsement and special indorsement (also known as\n\n\"endorsement in full\"). Here, we would quote fromScrutton on Charterparties\n\nand Bills of Lading (20thEdn)at p. 184:-Indorsement is effected either by\n\n    the shipper or consignee writing his name on the back of the bill of lading, which is\n\n    called an \"indorsement in blank\", or by the writing \"Deliver to I, (or\n\n    order), F\", which is called an \"indorsement in full\".So long as the goods are\n\n    deliverable to a name left blank, or to bearer, or the indorsement is in blank, the bill\n\n    of lading may pass from hand to hand by mere delivery, or may be redelivered without any\n\n    indorsement to the original holder, so as to affect the property in the goods.19        InBenjamin’s\n\nSale of Goods (5thEdn)the difference between the two types of\n\nindorsements is described as follows (at p.986):-\"… where the person to\n\n    whom goods are deliverable under an order bill wishes to transfer the bill to another, the\n\n    transfer must be effected by indorsement by the transferor and delivery of the bill to the\n\n    transferee. The indorsement may be to the transferee by name or in blank, in which latter\n\n    case no further indorsement, but only delivery, is as a matter of law required for\n\n    subsequent transfers.\"20        In\n\nother words, where a B/L has been indorsed in blank, it becomes like a bearer bill and can\n\nbe transferred simply by delivering the bill to the intended transferee without any\n\nfurther indorsement. But where a B/L has been specially indorsed, the indorsee must, if he\n\nwishes to further transfer the B/L, indorse it either specially or in blank. And if this\n\nfurther indorsement is in blank, then the B/L will again function like a bearer B/L. This\n\nis the scheme of things under the B/L Act. The rights under a bill of lading operate\n\nindependently of the banking arrangements which any of the holders of the B/L in the chain\n\nmay have with his bankers.21        In a\n\nvery recent decision,East West Corporation v DKBS 1912 & Anor[2002] EWHC 83\n\n(COMM), where the facts were similar to those of the present case, except that the\n\nbankers, the Chilean banks, instead of being indorsees were the named consignees and who\n\ndid not, in turn, indorse the B/Ls over to the claimants, Thomas J of the English\n\nCommercial Court held that a valid indorsement, besides the physical possession of the\n\nbill, was critical to the claimants obtaining the rights to suit. We did not think it was\n\nin any way material that the Chilean banks were consignees instead of indorsees.",
        "Our decision": "22        \n\nReverting to the instant case, it would be recalled that Shweta indorsed the B/Ls in blank\n\nand the bills eventually came into the hands of Keppel TL. The effect of such an\n\nindorsement was that each of the B/Ls had become a bearer bill, transferable with the mere\n\npassing of the bill. At that point, Keppel TL had become the holder of the two bills and\n\ncould have sued on them if the shipowner were to be unable to deliver the cargo upon the\n\npresentation of the B/Ls. If Keppel TL had not inserted the name of the State Bank in\n\nforwarding the bills to the latter, and if the bills were later to be returned by the\n\nlatter to Keppel TL without further ado, Keppel TL would again become the lawful holder of\n\nthe bills.23        \n\nHowever, by inserting the name of the State Bank onto the blank endorsement in each of the\n\ntwo B/Ls, the character of each bill changed from that of a bearer bill to that of a bill\n\nwhich had been transferred specifically to the State Bank. And upon each bill being\n\nphysically conveyed over to the State Bank, the latter would become the lawful holder\n\nthereof and in turn acquire the rights of suit pursuant to s 5(2)(b). Of course, the State\n\nBank could further transfer the bill but to do so it must indorse the bill over, either to\n\na specific transferee or in blank. In fact, Keppel TL had expected the State Bank to\n\nindorse the B/Ls over to Lanyard as and when the latter came forth to pay for the goods\n\nand collect the bills. However, Lanyard did not do so. Eventually, the State Bank returned\n\nthe bills to Keppel TL without making any indorsement. In our opinion, this indorsement\n\nwas crucial to enable Keppel TL to become the lawful holder again.24        The\n\nargument raised by Keppel TL was that the specific indorsement and delivery of the B/Ls to\n\nthe State Bank were insufficient to determine whether the State Bank had become the\n\n\"lawful holder\", thereby extinguishing the rights of suits that Keppel TL had\n\nacquired under s 2(1). For this argument, they relied on the element of \"good\n\nfaith\" laid down in s 5(2). They contended that it was never their intention to vest\n\nthe rights of suit in the State Bank. That could not be so. The fact of the matter was\n\nthat the State Bank was clearly authorized to indorse the B/Ls and deliver them over to\n\nLanyard upon the latter paying for the goods. The precise instruction to the State Bank\n\nwas to \"deliver documents against payment\". Reading this instruction together\n\nwith the special indorsement made in favour of the State Bank, it was obvious that the\n\nintention was to vest the rights of suit in the State Bank with a view to enabling the\n\nlatter to transfer the B/L, with the attendant rights of suit, to Lanyard.25        We\n\nwould also point out that there is no longer any requirement that an indorsement be\n\nintended to pass any property to the goods (seeVoyage Charters by Julian Cookeat\n\n18.84 and 31 below). If, as we thought was the case, the rights of suit did vest in\n\nthe State Bank for the purpose of indorsing the B/Ls over to Lanyard or its nominee, then\n\nthere can be no question of any residual rights of suit remaining with Keppel TL. Any\n\nother approach to the matter would do violence to the scheme envisaged under the B/L Act\n\n(and COGSA 1992). A simple indorsement by the State Bank in favour of Keppel TL or in\n\nblank would have transferred the rights of suit back to Keppel TL.26        \n\nReliance was also placed by Keppel TL onAegean Sea Traders Corp v Repsol Petroleo SA[1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 29 to support the proposition that mere indorsement, followed by\n\ndelivery of the bill, does not make the indorsee a lawful holder. But inAegean Sea\n\nTradersthe name of the indorsee was entered by mistake. The indorsee, in fact,\n\nrefused to accept it and sent it back to be indorsed to the rightful indorsee and\n\ntransferee. It was because of that that the court held that the indorsee did not become\n\nthe lawful holder.27        We\n\nmust reiterate that the court does not look behind a B/L to determine who is entitled to\n\ndelivery. As pointed out by the English and Scottish Law Commissions (the Law Commissions)\n\nin their joint report, which led to the passing of COGSA 1992, under the law as it then\n\nstood, a carrier was bound to make delivery against presentation of the B/L without\n\ninquiry as to the way in which the presenter of the B/L had acquired the property in the\n\ngoods. The change brought about by COGSA was to simplify the law. The Law Commissions\n\nfurther pointed out that if a person who transfers a B/L were to retain rights, it would\n\nenable him to undermine the security of the new holder and expose the carrier to\n\ninconsistent claims. Keppel TL’s attempt to rely on their underlying arrangement with\n\nthe State Bank pursuant to which the B/Ls were specially indorsed over to the State Bank\n\nwas, therefore, without merit.28        \n\nAccordingly, there was no basis for Keppel TL to claim that they had acquired any rights\n\nof suit in relation to the B/Ls, as the B/Ls were not indorsed specially in their favour\n\nor in blank. Physical possession of a B/L does not constitute the holder the lawful\n\nholder; there must be a valid indorsement.29        The\n\ncourt below seemed to have been troubled by the case,Gurney v Behrend(1854) 3 El.\n\n& BL 622, which Keppel TL’s counsel argued supported the proposition that if an\n\nagent indorses a B/L without authority, his principal may still retain rights of suit\n\nunder the contract of carriage contained in the B/L. But the case did not involve a suit\n\nby a holder of a B/L against the carrier. The issue in the case was not the rights of suit\n\nin relation to the B/L but the rights of property or title to the goods carried under the\n\nB/L. This is apparent from the following portion of the judgment of Lord Campbell CJ (at\n\np.1279):-\"For this purpose it is not\n\n    enough that they had become bona fide holders of the indorsed bill of lading, for valuable\n\n    consideration. A bill of lading is not, like a bill of exchange or promissory note, a\n\n    negotiable instrument, which passes by mere delivery to a bona fide transferee for\n\n    valuable consideration, without regard to the title of the parties who make the transfer.\n\n    Although the shipper may have indorsed in blank a bill of lading deliverable to his\n\n    assigns, his right is not affected by an appropriation of it without his authority. If it\n\n    be stolen from him, or transferred without his authority, a subsequent bona fide\n\n    transferee for value cannot make title under it, as against the shipper of the goods. The\n\n    bill of lading only represents the goods: and, in this instance, the transfer of the\n\n    symbol does not operate more than a transfer of what is represented.\"30        The\n\ncourt there was concerned with determining, as between two competing claimants, who had\n\nthe better title to the goods and Lord Campbell came to the conclusion (at p.1280):-\"Ever since the great case\n\n    ofLickbarrow v Mason(a), the law has been considered to be that the bona fide\n\n    transferee, for value, of a bill of lading, indorsed by the shipper or his consignee, and\n\n    put into circulation by the authority of the shipper or consignee, has an absolute title\n\n    to the goods, freed from the equitable right of the unpaid vendor to stop in transitu, as\n\n    against the purchase; and we believe it to be of essential importance to commerce that\n\n    this law should be upheld. For these reasons we give Judgement for the plaintiffs.\"31        It\n\nis vitally important to differentiate rights of suit under a B/L and the issue as to who,\n\namong competing claimants, has the better title to the goods. The difficulties in relation\n\nto these two matters under the previous Bill of Lading Act 1855 were discussed in the Law\n\nCommissions’ report and they came to the conclusion that there should be a severance\n\nof the link between the passing of title or property in goods and the transfer of B/L and\n\nrights of suits under a contract of carriage contained in the B/L. In 2.22 of their\n\nreport, the Commissions stated:-\"We recommend that Option 3\n\n    [i.e., rights of suit under contract of carriage vested in holder of bill of lading]\n\n    should form the basis of a reform of the Bills of Lading Act 1855. Thus, there would no\n\n    longer be a link between the transfer of contractual rights and passing of property.\n\n    Instead, any lawful holder of a bill of lading would be entitled to assert contractual\n\n    rights against the carrier.\"32        \n\nTherefore,Gurney v Behrenddoes not stand for the proposition which Keppel TL\n\nsought to advance before us. In any event, the question of rights of suit is now governed\n\nby the B/L Act and under this statute an order B/L is transferred by indorsement, coupled\n\nwith physical delivery of the bill.33        \n\nBefore we conclude, we would like to make a brief observation on the\n\n\"cancellation\" stamp effected by Keppel TL over the indorsement. As we have\n\nexplained above, Keppel TL can only become a lawful holder of the B/L if there is an\n\nappropriate indorsement. Keppel cannot by their own act of cancelling the indorsement made\n\nin favour of the State Bank improve their position. However, there is no need for us at\n\nthis time to decide what effect the cancellation stamp has on the B/L.",
        "Striking out": "34        In\n\nthe light of the foregoing it was plain and obvious that the claim could not succeed. It\n\nwas hopeless and should be struck out. To allow the case to go further for trial would be\n\nto compel the defendants (Bandung) to expend time and money in defending a case which\n\nobviously had no merit whatsoever. There was really no dispute on facts. The question\n\nraised was one of law which we have answered. The parties had made full arguments before\n\nus. Accordingly, we struck out the action on the ground that it was an obviously\n\nunsustainable claim.Sgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDITH PRAKASHJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
