        "Facts": "4       The\nRespondent is a company registered in Singapore and is part of the\n[C] Group of companies. It carried on the business of a general\ninsurer in Singapore and was registered under the Insurance Act\n(Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Insurance Act”) until December 2009.\nUnder the provisions of the Insurance Act, an insurer is required\nto establish separate insurance funds for each class of insurance\nbusiness and to ensure that all assets, receipts, liabilities and\nexpenses are properly attributed to the relevant fund. Pursuant\nto s 17(1) of the Insurance Act, the Respondent therefore established\nthe Singapore Insurance Fund (“SIF”) and the Offshore Insurance\nFund (“OIF”) in respect of its Singapore and overseas policies respectively.\nThe Respondent used the SIF to invest in [C] shares, and used the\nOIF to invest in [C], [D] and [E] shares. In the years of assessment (“YA”)\n1973, 1976, 1980–1981, 1984–1986, 1988 and 1995, the Respondent sold\nsome of the Shares and reported the gains as taxable income. 5       On\n29 June 2001, a hitherto unrelated company, [F], made a general offer\nfor the shares of [C] at a consideration of $4.02 in cash and 0.52\n[F] share for each [C] share held (“the Takeover Offer”), which\noffer received the requisite acceptances of [C’s] shareholders to\nbecome unconditional. In response to the Takeover Offer, the Respondent\nsold to [F] its entire holding of [C] shares amounting to 13,459,214\nshares in exchange for $54,106,040 in cash and 6,998,791 [F] shares.\nThe Respondent also sold, in 2002, its portfolio of [D] and [E]\nshares in the OIF, amounting to 3,308,000 and 6,000 shares respectively,\nin exchange for $16,669,280 in cash. The Respondent thereby made\ngains of $89,246,800 from the sale of [C] shares, $7,934,100 from\nthe sale of [D] shares, and $1,452,480 from the sale of [E] shares.\nAll in all, the Shares amounted to some 36% of the total value of\nthe SIF and the OIF. 6       The\nAppellant took the view that the gains made by the Respondent were\ntaxable and issued revised assessments for YA 2002 and YA 2003 to the\nRespondent. On 15 April 2010, in response to the Respondent’s request for\namendment, the Appellant issued to the Respondent a Notice of Refusal to\nAmend the Assessments for YA 2002 and YA 2003. 7       On\n19 April 2010, the Respondent filed Notices of Appeal against the Appellant’s\nrevised assessments for both YA 2002 and YA 2003. By way of a decision\ndated 20 June 2012 (“the Board Decision”), the Board allowed the appeals.\nThe Appellant then appealed against the Board Decision to the High\nCourt under s 81(2) of the ITA by way of Originating Summons No 681\nof 2012 (“OS 681/2012”), which appeal was dismissed by the Judge\nin a decision dated 8 April 2013 (“the Judgment”). On 7 May 2013,\nthe Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal against the decision of the\nJudge.",
        "Summary of Pleadings": "8       In\nOS 681/2012, the Appellant appealed on the grounds that: (a)     The\nBoard erred in law when it did not take into account the extensive\ncase law indicating that the gains or profits of an insurance company\nfrom the sale of its investments are revenue in nature and hence\ntaxable; (b)     The\nBoard erred in law in that it did not treat the gains or profits from\nthe sale of share investments by the Respondent as being taxable under\ns 26 of the ITA; (c)     The\nBoard erred in fact and law in that it did not recognise that the\nShares were the trading stock (rather than the capital) of the Respondent,\ntaking into account: (i)       The manner in which the Shares were previously held for the\npurposes of the insurance business of the Respondent; and (ii)       The fact that the Respondent had previously, of its own accord,\nbrought to tax the gains from the sale of the same counters of share\ninvestments. (d)     The\nBoard erred in fact and law when it held that the gains or profits\nderived by the Respondent from the sale of the Shares were capital\nin nature and not taxable.",
        "Decision below": "9       Before\nthe Board and the Judge, the Appellant advanced two separate arguments: (a)     That\nthe profits made were profits falling with s 10(1)(a)\nof the ITA as “income … in respect of gains or profits from any\ntrade [or] business”; and (b)     That\nthe profits were, in any event or inferentially, to be brought to\nassessment by the terms of ss 26(3) and 26(4) of the ITA. 10     The\nseparate argument referred to above at [9(b)] is no longer being pursued.\nThe sole issue on appeal is therefore whether the gains derived from\nthe disposal of the Shares were “income … in respect of gains or profits\nfrom any trade [or] business”. 11     The\nBoard held,inter alia, that: (a)     Profits\nfrom the sale of investments by insurance companies (other than\nlife insurance companies) were not automatically liable to tax under\nss 26(3) and (4) of the ITA; (b)     The\nreal question was whether the Respondent’s gains from the sale of\nthe Shares amounted to trading or business profits, which would\nthen be taxable under s 10(1)(a),\nor whether they were in the nature of capital gains and hence not\nexigible to tax; (c)     The\nRespondent had not engaged in any trade or business in the transaction\nof the Shares and the profits from the sale of the Shares ought\nto be treated as capital gains. Specifically: (i)       The Shares were held for the long-term strategic purpose of\npreserving the corporate structure of the [C] Group; (ii)       The Shares were held for a long time and this supported the\nargument that the Shares were acquired for a long-term strategic\npurpose; (iii)       The Shares were not previously sold by the Respondent to meet\nits offshore claim liabilities; (iv)       Those of the Shares which the Respondent sold were sold to\nother companies within the [C] Group, which further reinforced the\ncorporate preservation policy; and (v)       As [E] was not a listed company, the case in relation to the gains\nand profits derived by the Respondent from the sale of the [E] shares\nbeing capital gains was even stronger. The Board came to its conclusion after examining the facts\nand evidence available, including the oral testimonies of the Respondent’s\ntwo witnesses. 12     The\nJudge affirmed the Board’s findings of fact. In particular, the Judge\nexamined the present facts with reference to the so-called “badges\nof trade” in order to determine if the gains from the sale of the\nShares were income in respect of gains or profits from the Respondent’s\ntrade or business: (a)     In\nrelation to themotive of the taxpayer,\nthe Judge found that the Respondent’s intention in holding the Shares\nwas to promote the long-term strategic interests of itself and the\n[C] Group. This was manifested in various ways: (i)       There were cross-holdings of shares and cross-directorships\nbetween the companies within the [C] Group; (ii)       The corporate preservation strategy of the [C] Group also involved\nthe holding of shares of companies in the group by [QR], a company\ncontrolled by the founder of [C] and his family; (iii)       The regular reports and updates on the status of cross-holdings\nof various companies in the [C] Group and [QR] were generated to\nenable the Senior Management of [C] to monitor and ensure that the\nshareholding of the companies in the [C] Group was not diluted and\nthat effective control was maintained to minimise the possibility\nof a hostile takeover; (iv)       Any decision to sell any shares or rights in the companies within\nthe [C] Group was closely scrutinised and reviewed. Specifically,\nthe Respondent was not allowed to sell any of its shares or rights\nin the companies within the [C] Group without the requisite approval\nfrom [C]; (v)       The Shares were passively held by the Respondent and were\nnot managed by the Respondent’s fund manager; and (vi)       The Shares of [E], a non-listed company, were not readily realisable.\nTherefore, the Board was correct in finding that there was a strong\ncase for the view that the gains arising from the disposal of at\nleast the [E] shares were of a capital nature. (b)     In\nrelation to theduration of ownership,\nthe Judge found that, consistent with the [C] Group’s corporate\npreservation strategy, the Respondent acquired the Shares and held\nonto them for a long period of up to thirty years. The intention\nto hold the Shares for a long period of time was an indication that\nthe investment was of a capital nature; (c)     In\nrelation to thefrequency or number of similar\ntransactions, the Judge found that, consistent with the\ncorporate preservation strategy of the [C] Group, there were few\ndisposals of the Shares by the Respondent throughout the long period\nof holding. (No [D] and [E] shares were disposed of during the entire\nperiod before 2002, and there were only nine disposals of the [C]\nshares over a span of 30 years); and (d)     In\nrelation to thecircumstances surrounding the\nrealisation, the Judge found that there was no necessity\nfor the Respondent to liquidate the Shares to meet claims and liabilities\nof its insurance business as it had sufficient cash reserves. For the above reasons, the Judge found that the Shares were\ncapital assets and not revenue assets, and that the gains from their\nsale were therefore not taxable as income. The Judge rejected the\nAppellant’s arguments in relation to the fact that the Shares were\nheld in statutorily mandated insurance funds and the fact that they\nwere taken into consideration when calculating the solvency margin\nof the said insurance funds. The Judge also rejected the Appellant’s\narguments in relation to ss 26(3) and 26(4) of the ITA, which the\nAppellant has since abandoned on appeal to this court.",
        "Appellant’s Case/Respondent’s\nCase": "13     The\nAppellant’s core argument in the present appeal relates largely\nto s 17 of the Insurance Act which requires an insurance company\nto maintain an insurance fund or funds relevant to its particular\nliabilities. It runs as follows: (a)     The\nrequirement in s 17 of the Insurance Act is a recognition of the\nnature of the insurance business,viz,\nthat of obtaining present receipts in the form of premiums by underwriting\nfuture risks and using the premiums so obtained to defray the cost\nof those future liabilities. (b)     Section\n17 contains a requirement that the moneys obtained by means of premiums\nmust be retained in a fund to meet liabilities underwritten by the\ncontracts obtaining those premiums so that the assets of the particular\nbusiness and its parts are identified. Those assets could only arguably\ncease to be part of the insurance business if they were determined\nto be surplus to such requirements with the consequence that, upon\nsatisfying the regulatory requirements, such surplus might be transferred\nout of the insurance fund into the shareholders’ fund. Absent any\nsuch transfer, any realisation of assets which had been purchased\nwith the premiums obtained would give rise to a profit or loss over\ncost which is part of the taxable insurance business. Since the\nShares were never taken out of the insurance funds, they remained\na part (and a substantial part) of the assets of the insurance business. (c)     Many\nof the cases relied on by the Judge and the Board in their respective\ndecisions were decided at a time prior to the application of the\nmore detailed regulations or in circumstances where the relevant law\ndid not require the assets of the insurance fund to be identified and\nseparately held. For the above reasons, the Appellant submits that the gains\narising from the realisation of the Shares are profits of the Respondent’s\nbusiness and therefore liable to be taxed. 14     The\nRespondent argues that the Appellant’s contention is unsustainable,\nfor the following reasons: (a)     The\nInsurance Act is irrelevant to the present appeal because: (i)       Assets which are acquired with the receipts of income would\nnot necessarily be of a revenue nature; (ii)       The purpose of the Insurance Act is not to govern the taxation\nof insurance companies but to regulate the insurance business; (iii)       The insurance fund is merely part of the regulatory framework\nfor insurance companies and cannot determine the income tax treatment\nof insurance companies. The purpose of the regulatory framework\nis to protect policyholders and to this end, the regulatory framework\nrequires assets to be held in the name of the respective insurance\nfunds. The classification of assets, receipts, liabilities and expenses\nis common to all companies, not just insurance companies. The regulatory framework\ndoes not prevent an insurance company from holding capital assets\nin the same way as any other company. In addition, the capital assets\nof a company do not become revenue assets just because they could\npotentially be applied to meet the company’s liabilities, in a situation\nof liquidation or otherwise; (iv)       The Appellant has failed to provide any legal basis to substantiate\nthe supposed relationship between the Insurance Act and the ITA; (v)       The irrelevance of the insurance fund is particularly evident\nwhen considering the fact that the ITA actually pre-dated the Insurance\nAct; (vi)       The Appellant’s allusion to a distinction between the insurance\nfund and shareholders’ fund is misleading when there may be no material\ndifference in tax treatment by the Appellant since gains arising\nfrom the shareholders’ fund could be taxed as well. The insurance\nfund can and should only be taxed according to the ordinary concepts\nof income and capital; and (vii)       The Appellant’s reliance on the solvency requirements prescribed\nby the Insurance Act is misplaced. The solvency requirement is merely\nanother regulatory measure to ensure that the interests of policyholders\nare adequately protected. The taxability of companies cannot be\ndetermined by regulatory measures which are prescribed for the protection\nof their customers. (b)     It\nis well established in common law that insurance companies, like\nany other companies, can hold shares as capital assets. (c)     The\ntotality of the evidence indicates that the Shares were capital\nassets. The “badges of trade” approach adopted by the Judge provided\na useful and structured framework for reviewing all the facts and\nevidence in totality and in coming to this conclusion. 15     We\nshall address each of these arguments in turn, following a close examination\nof the applicable law. In our view, whilst the approaches taken in\nother jurisdictions are of considerable assistance, the question\nmust ultimately be resolved on the basis of first principles and\nthe established rules of revenue law as applied to the specific\nfacts of the instant appeal.",
        "The applicable law": "16     The\nITA is intended “to impose a tax upon incomes and to regulate the\ncollection thereof”.[note: 1]The charging provision is s\n10(1) of the ITA which provides: Charge\nof income tax 10.—(1) Income tax shall,\nsubject to the provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or\nrates specified hereinafter for each year of assessment upon the income\nof any person accruing in or derived from Singapore or received\nin Singapore from outside Singapore in respect of — (a)gains\nor profits from any trade, business, profession or vocation, for\nwhatever period of time such trade, business, profession or vocation\nmay have been carried on or exercised; (b)    gains\nor profits from any employment; … (g)    any gains or profits of\nan income nature not falling within any of the preceding paragraphs. … [emphasis added in bold italics] 17     Whilst\nthe concept of “income” is not defined anywhere in the ITA, it is\nclear that “gains or profits” in ss 10(1)(a)\nand 10(1)(b) refer only to gains or\nprofits of an income nature. This is also reflected in the wording\nof s 10(1)(g), which taxes “gains\nor profits of an income nature” not included in the preceding paragraphs\nof s 10(1). There is no capital gains tax in Singapore; capital\ngains are not taxableeven ifthe\ncapital gains arise from the carrying on of a trade, business, profession\nor vocation (The Law and Practice of Singapore\nIncome Tax, vol I (Pok Soy Yoong, Ng Keat Seng & Steven\nTimms eds) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (“The\nLaw and Practice of Singapore Income Tax”) at para 6.15).\nBy way of an example, capital gains from the sale of machinery or\nequipment used in a trade or business are not taxable although a\nbalancing charge is applied to recoup depreciation allowances previously\ngiven. 18     In\ndetermining the scope of income tax, it is therefore necessary to draw\na distinction between taxable income and non-taxable capital gains. However,\nthis distinction is often ambiguous in marginal cases such as those\nwhere investment activities are central to the enterprise concerned. The\nappropriate approach in such situations was considered by the Lord Justice\nClerk in the seminal case ofCalifornian Copper\nSyndicate (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes)(1904)\n5 TC 159 (“Californian Copper Syndicate”)\nat 165 to 166: It is quite a well settled principle in\ndealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the\nowner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains\na greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced\nprice is not profit … assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally\nwell established that enhanced values obtained from realisation\nor conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is\ndone is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an\nact done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a\nbusiness. The simplest case is that of a person or association of\npersons buying and selling lands or securities speculatively, in\norder to make gain, dealing in such investments as a business, and\nthereby seeking to make profits. There are many companies which\nin their very inception are formed for such a purpose, and in these\ncases it is not doubtful that, where they make a gain by a realisation,\nthe gain they make is liable to be assessed for Income Tax. 19     The\nLord Justice Clerk then went on to articulate the time-honoured test\nto be applied in such cases (at 166): What is the line which separates the two\nclasses of cases may be difficult to define, and each case must\nbe considered according to its facts; the question to be determined\nbeing—Is the sum of gain that has been made\na mere enhancement of value by realising a security, or is it a\ngainmade in an operation of business\nin carrying out a scheme for profit-making?[emphasis added in italics and bold\nitalics] The Appellant submits, and we agree, that the relevant question\nto be asked in such cases is simple,viz,\nwhether the gain in question is a mere enhancement of value by realising\na security or whether it was made in an operation of business in\ncarrying out a scheme for profit-making. On our reading of the case,\nit is not enough that the gain arose in the operation of business;\nit must also have arisen pursuant to the carrying out of a scheme forprofit-making. Put another way, the distinction\nis between the profit that arises when property has been committed\nto a business as part of its stock in trade and is then realised\nin the course of trading operations and the gain that arises from\na realisation of property not so committed. The former is taxable\nincome, the latter not. 20     In\nthe context of the insurance industry, it is trite that an integral\npart of the insurance business is to channel its premium receipts\nand capital into productive activities such as investments in equities,\nsecurities and properties which would generate investment income\nto meet its liabilities arising from claims by policy holders. As\nthe investment of an insurer’s funds is generally part of the business\nof the insurer, any investmentincome(eg, in the form of interest or dividends)\nderived from within or without Singapore constitutes its taxable\nbusiness income. Likewise, the gains or profits derived from thedisposal of investmentsby the insurer\nin the course of its business activities are generally subject to\nincome tax. This general (and, indeed, pragmatic) proposition has\nbeen recognised by courts in various jurisdictions. 21     One\nof the earliest authorities for this general proposition is a Scottish case,Northern Assurance Co v Russell(1889)\n2 TC 551, where the surpluses derived by an insurance company from\nrealising investments in the course of its business were held to\nbe part of its profits. There, it was stated in broad terms (at\n578) that “[w]here the gain is made by the Company … by realising\nan investment at a larger price than was paid for it, the difference is\nto be reckoned among the profits and gains of the Company”. Unfortunately,\nin our view, this sweeping and unqualified statement is of somewhat\nlimited assistance due to the brevity of the aforementioned judgment\nand its lack of reasoned analysis. 22     A\nmore detailed examination of the nature of the insurance business and\nits general consequential treatment for taxation purposes is found\nin the judgment of Hamilton J inThe Liverpool\nand London and Globe Insurance Company v Bennett (Surveyor of Taxes)(1913)\n6 TC 327 (“The Liverpool and London and Globe\nInsurance”), where it was stated (at 357) that: … The private individual may have property\nentirely independent of his trade, although part of his assets,\nno doubt, in case of his insolvency, and it is intelligible to say\nthat his trade does not extend to or touch his private property.\nI do not think that that is true of the Insurance Companies. The private\nindividual may save to provide for his old age or for his family,\nhe has leisure to enjoy, he has ambitions to gratify, and his existence,\nin fact, can be separated into his trading and his private life.\nNothing of the kind can be done with an Insurance Company. Subject\nto the scope of the Memorandum and Articles … they are a trading\ncompany and a trading company only. … There is another point with regard to the\nInsurance Company. It embarks its funds in its business simply by\nhaving money ready to pay its debts with. We are not here concerned\nwith manufactories or the maintenance of a stock which is to be\nsold.The business of insurance consists in\nmaking promises to pay, by way of indemnity, in futuroand contingent sums in consideration of present payments\nof money, and the whole business therefore, apart from the wisdom\nand prudence with which it is conducted, consists in being ready\nto meet the liabilities if they accrue, and to the extent to which\nthey accrue, out of one class of funds or another. Consequently\nthe money is embarked in the business as soon as it is money which\nbelongs to and is available to the Insurance Company.If\nthey have paid it away in the shape of dividends, it is no longer\navailable, but all of their assets substantially are only possessed\nfor the purpose of meeting the contingencies of losses on the policies\nif they should fall in. I am speaking of fire insurance only as\nan illustration, but I do not think that either indemnity business\nor, for this purpose, life business differs, although of course\nthe calculation of risks and the mode of carrying out the transaction\nare enormously different. [emphasis added] It was decided then that where an English company carrying\non insurance business both locally and abroad invested sums of money\nabroad, and the interest on those sums was not remitted (it being\nthen the law that foreign income was charged only to the extent\nthat the foreign income was remitted back to England), such interest\nnevertheless formed part of the taxable income of the company assessable\nunder the Income Tax Act 1842, s 100, Schedule D, Case 1. 23     The\ndecision was affirmed on appeal to the English Court of Appeal and\nthe House of Lords. In the words of Lord Mersey (at 379 and 380): … It is well known that in the course of\ncarrying on an insurance business large sums of money derived from\npremiums collected and from other sources accumulate in the hands\nof the insurers, and that one of the most important parts of the\nprofits of the business is derived from the temporary investment\nof these moneys. These temporary investments are also required for\nthe formation of the reserve fund, a fund created to attract customers\nand to serve as a standby in the event of sudden claims being made\nupon the insurers in respect of losses. It is, according to my view,\nimpossible to say that such investments do not form part of this\nCompany’s insurance business, or that the returns flowing from them\ndo not form part of its profits. In a commercial sense the directors\nof the Company owe a duty to their shareholders and to their customers\nto make such investments, and to receive and distribute in the ordinary\ncourse of business, whether in the form of dividends, or in payment\nof losses, or in the formation of reserves, the moneys collected\nfrom them. … 24     Similar\nsentiments were expressed by the High Court of Australia inColonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited v\nFederal Commissioner of Taxation(1946) 73 CLR 604 (“Colonial Mutual Life Assurance”) at 619–620: But an insurance company, whether a mutual\ninsurance company or not, is undoubtedly carrying on an insurance\nbusiness and the investment of its funds is as much a part of that\nbusiness as the collection of the premiums.The\npurpose of investing the funds of the appellant is to obtain the\nmost effective yield of income. The diminution or increase in the\ncapital value of the investment between the date of purchase and\nthat of maturity, and the apportionment and deduction or addition\nover the intervening period of that diminution from or increase\nto the interest actually payable on the investment is a material\ningredient in the ascertainment of this yield. InKonstam,\nLaw of Income Tax, 8th ed. (1940), p. 126, it is stated\nthat “the buying and selling of investments is a necessity of insurance\nbusiness; andwhere an insurance company in\nthe course of its trade realizes an investment at a larger price\nthan what was paid for it, the difference is to be reckoned among its\nprofits; conversely, any loss is to be deducted.” … [emphasis\nadded] Likewise, in the Hong Kong case ofCommissioner\nof Inland Revenue v Sincere Insurance and Investment Co Ltd[1973]\nHKCU 47 (“Sincere Insurance”), it\nwas observed that “where the person making the gain is an insurance\ncompany that fact alone makes it themore likelythat\nthe gain arises in the carrying on, or carrying out of business”\n[emphasis added]. 25     In\nour judgment, whilst the above articulations of general principle provide\na practical and even compelling approach in relation to the majority\nof such cases, these statements cannot be read to stand for any absolute\nor immutable principle oflaw. On\nthe contrary, the question whether certain investment gains are\nproperly attributable to the revenue or capital account is ultimately\na question offact. Courts have\nfrequently cautioned that the word “income” in the context of the\nincome-capital dichotomy is not a term of art and that, in the absence\nof statutory provision to the contrary, whether a receipt is “income”\nmust be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and\nusages of mankind:Scott v Commissioner of\nTaxation (New South Wales)(1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at\n219. In a similar vein, the court inColonial\nMutual Life Assuranceobserved that (at 615): The crucial question is whether the net\nprofit …is a profit arising from the carrying\non or carrying out of a profit-making scheme, and if\nit is not whether this net profit is incomeaccording\nto ordinary usages and concepts. As Lord Parker said\ninLiverpool and London and Globe Insurance\nCo v Bennett, (1913) AC 610 at p 622, “This question\nought, in my opinion, to be determined on ordinary business principles,having regard to the circumstances under which, and\nthe purposes for which, the investments were made and are held by\nthe appellant company.”[emphasis added] 26     Indeed,\nthe language of most of the decisions indicate that the aforementioned\nproposition (viz, that gains or\nprofits derived from the disposal of investments by insurers are\ngenerally taxable as revenue) is more in the way of ageneralruleorpresumption of factdrawn from circumstantial\nevidence. InGRE Insurance Ltd v FC of T92\nATC 4089 (“GRE Insurance”), for\nexample, the Full Federal Court of Australia made it clear (at 4093)\nthat “profits from the realisation of investments of an insurance\ncompany … arenot invariablytaken\ninto account” [emphasis added]. InColonial\nMutual Life Assurance(at 618), the court was of the view\nthat “profits and losses on the realization of investments of the\nfunds of an insurance company shouldusuallybe\ntaken into account in the determination of the profits and gains\nof the business” [emphasis added]. The relevant tribunal is therefore\nnot discharged from its role as fact-finder solely by virtue of\nthe fact that the taxpayer is engaged in the business of insurance\nor something similar. However, the particular features of the insurance\nbusiness would generally give rise to thefactualinference\nthat the gains concerned arose in an “operation of business in carrying\nout a scheme for profit-making” (see [19] above) unless there is\ncogent evidence to the contrary. 27     In\nparticular, we would emphasise that the statements expressed in the\nabove cases should not be read in isolation and must be examined\nin the context of their specific facts. InCalifornian\nCopper Syndicate(at 166 and 167),Employers’\nMutual Indemnity Association Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation91\nATC 4850 (at 4854, 4856 and 4857) andGRE Insurance(at 4094\nand 4095), the courts consistently stated that the facts of each\ncase must be closely examined and, indeed, reached their decisions\nbased on their findings of fact. It is also apposite to note that\nnone of the above cases bears any factual similarity to the appeal\nat hand, where it was accepted (by both the Board and the Judge\nbelow) that the Shares were acquired, held and disposed of for long-term\nstrategic reasons. In the circumstances, caution must be exercised\nnot to extend any broad and generalised statements in the above\ncases beyond the actualratio decidendiof\nthose cases. 28     For\ninstance, the facts ofLiverpool and London\nand Globe Insurance(cited above at [22]) didnotin fact involve the taxation of gains\nfrom the sale of investments, but instead concerned interest and\ndividend receipts from investments abroad (ie,\ninvestmentincome). There was no\nquestion but that the interest and dividend receipts were income.\nWhat was in issue was whether they were exigible to tax notwithstanding\nthat they had not been remitted back to England. In the result,\nthey were held to form part of taxable income of the company in\nthe carrying on of its insurance business. 29     InColonial Mutual Life Assurance(conveniently\nsummarised by the court inSincere Insurance),\nthe appellant, a mutual life assurance company, was guided in its\ninvestments by actuarial estimations which indicated that, to meet\nits liabilities under insurance policies, it had to obtain a certain effective\nyield on its investments. The interest yield was the governing factor\ninfluencing the company’s policy and it held its securities as investments\nrather than for the purpose of constantly seeking profits from realising\nthem. In the relevant tax year the amount realised by it in the\nsale of securities exceeded the cost to it of those securities and\nthe amount of the excess was regarded as assessable income. It was\nin this context that the court stated that (at 619–620): But an insurance company, whether a mutual\ninsurance company or not, is undoubtedly carrying on an insurance\nbusiness and the investment of its funds is as much a part of that\nbusiness as the collection of the premiums.The purpose\nof investing the funds of the appellant is to obtain the most effective yield\nof income. The diminution or increase in the capital value of the investment\nbetween the date of purchase and that of maturity, and the apportionment\nand deduction or addition over the intervening period of that diminution\nfrom or increase to the interest actually payable on the investment is\na material ingredient in the ascertainment of this yield.…\nThe acquisition of an investment with a view to producing the most\neffective interest yield is an acquisition with a view to producing\na yield of a composite character, the effective yield comprising\nthe actual interest less any diminution or plus any increase in\nthe capital value of the securities. Such an acquisition and subsequent\nrealization is a normal step in carrying on the insurance business, or\nin other wordsan act done in what is truly\nthe carrying on of the business of the [company]. [emphasis\nadded] It is clear that the decision inColonial\nMutual Life Assurancetook place squarely within the\nframework of aprofit-makingscheme\n(whether through the optimisation of interest yields or the fortuitous\n“switching” of securities). 30     Similarly,\ninLondon Australia Investment Co Ltd v The\nCommissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia(1977)\n138 CLR 106, the High Court of Australia found that aninvestmentcompany that had systematically\nsold shares at a profit in order to increase its dividend yield was\nearning taxable income from the sale of shares. The court stated\n(at 116–117) that: In the present case the taxpayer naturally\nplaced considerable reliance on the finding that the shares were\nnot bought for the purpose of selling them at a profit. That is\nindeed an important circumstance. It was then submitted that the\nshares were acquired on the capital account of the company, for\nthe purpose of adding to its profit-making structure, as the means\nof producing dividend income, rather than as part of the profit-earning\nactivities within that structure … If that submission were correct,\nthe fact that the shares were realized in a methodical and enterprising\nway, so as to secure the best results for the taxpayer, would not\nconvert the proceeds of realization into income. But the question\nwhether the shares were acquired on the capital account of the taxpayer\ncan only be answered by applying the tests indicated by [Californian Copper Syndicate]. Helsham J.\nfound that during the three years in question it was an integral\npart of the taxpayer’s business to deal in shares, in the sense\nthat switching of investments was desirable to produce the best dividend\nreturns and was indeed necessary if the taxpayer’s policy of investing\nin shares with growth potential was to be adhered to. In my opinion it\nis impossible to controvert that finding; it was clearly right.Although the company’s business was to invest in\nshares with the primary purpose of obtaining income by way of dividends,\nthe conduct of the investment business required that the share portfolio\nshould be given regular consideration, and that shares should frequently\nbe sold when the dividend yield dropped, which for practical purposes\nusually meant when the shares went up in value. The taxpayer systematically\nsold its shares at a profit for the purpose of increasing the dividend\nyield of its investments. The sale of the shares was a normal operation\nin the course of carrying on the business of investing for profit.It\nwas not a mere realization or change of investment. [emphasis added] 31     This\nis largely consonant with the general approach taken in respect of\nbanks and similar financial institutions. InPunjab\nCo-operative Bank Limited, Amritsar v Commissioner of Income-Tax,\nLahore[1940] AC 1055, the Privy Council observed as\nfollows (at 1072–1073): In the ordinary case of a bank, the business\nconsists in its essence of dealing with money and credit. Numerous\ndepositors place their money with the bank, often receiving a small\nrate of interest on it. A number of borrowers receive loans of a\nlarge part of these deposited funds, at somewhat higher rates of\ninterest. But the banker has always to keep enough cash or easily realizable\nsecurities to meet any probable demand by the depositors. No doubt\nthere will generally be loans to persons of undoubted solvency which can\nquickly be called in, but it may be very undesirable to use this\nsecond line of defence.If, as in the present\ncase, some of the securities are realized in order to meet withdrawals\nby depositors, it seems to their Lordships to be quite clear that\nthis is a normal step in carrying on the banking business or, in\nother words, that it is an act done in “what is truly the carrying\non” of the banking business.[emphasis added] Notwithstanding this, however, the Privy Council inWaylee Investment Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland\nRevenue[1991] 1 HKLR 237 (“Waylee Investment”)\ntook pains to emphasise that a bank, like any other trader,couldin certain circumstances hold investments\nas capital assets. The taxpayer bank subscribed for shares in one\nof its customers at a time when the customer was facing financial\ndifficulties. The bank subscribed for more than 20% of the issued\ncapital of the customer which was a very large trading concern.\nBeing anxious to ensure that the general public did not misconstrue\nthe investment as indicating that the bank itself intended to enter\ninto the field of general trading, it publicly announced that its acquisition\nwas “a sizable investment of venture capital” and the chairman of\nthe bank affirmed that its intention was to “substantially reduce\nits shareholding as soon as conditions permit”. The shares were\nrealised over a period of some six years. The initial sales were\nin response to an unsolicited offer. The taxpayer was assessed to\ntax on the profits from those sales on the basis that it was trading\nin shares. 32     The\nBoard of Review allowed the bank’s appeal against the assessment on\nthe ground that it was not trading. The High Court upheld the Board\nof Review’s decision. On Revenue’s appeal however, the Court of\nAppeal reversed the High Court’s decision. It did so in reliance,inter alia, on the bank’s earlier public\nstatement that it intended to reduce its holding in the customer\nas soon as conditions permitted. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal,\nthe acquisition of the shares was an adventure in the nature of trade.\nAllowing the bank’s appeal, the Privy Council held (at 242–243): …The stock in trade\nof a bank is money and securities readily convertible to money.But\nit is equally clear thata bank, like any other\ntrader, may hold investments as capital assets.The clearest\nindication that an investment was acquired as a capital asset would\nbe an indication that the bank intended to hold the investment as\nsuch for an indefinite period. The clearest indication that an investment\nwas acquired as trading stock would be an indication that it was\nheld by the bank as available to meet the demands of depositors whenever\nnecessary. But the indications to show which category a particular investment\nbelongs may be uncertain, inconclusive or even conflicting. [emphasis\nadded] It then held that since it was clear that the bank never intended\nthat the relevant shares acquired by the bank should be held as\npart of the bank’s circulating assets, the Court of Appeal was not\nentitled to reverse the finding by the Board of Review that those\nshares were acquired as capital assets. 33     Two\nNew Zealand authorities,Commissioner of Inland\nRevenue v National Insurance Company of New Zealand Ltd(1999)\n19 NZTC 15,135 (“National Insurance Company”) andState\nInsurance Office v Commissioner of Inland Revenue[1990]\n2 NZLR 444 (“State Insurance Office”),\nboth relating to insurance companies, were extensively relied on\nby the Judge below for the proposition that, notwithstanding the\ngeneral presumption with regards insurance companies, the gains\nor losses arising from the disposal of investments by an insurer\nmayin some instancesbe capital\nin nature and therefore not subject to income tax. This was not disputed\nby the Appellant below, who instead argued that the present case could\nnot be characterised as exceptional in the above sense. 34     Nevertheless,\non appeal, the Appellant now contends that the decisions of the\nNew Zealand courts have very little relevance to the present enquiry\nor should not apply at all. First, the Appellant alleges that due\nto differences between our legislation and the New Zealand legislation,\nthe New Zealand cases are not necessarily applicable to the interpretation\nof the words of s 10(1) of the ITA. It is not clear how the differences\nin the legislation assist the Appellant’s case. In our view, the\nNew Zealand legislation, if anything, is broader than our local\ntax legislation. Section 65(2)(a)\nof the New Zealand Income Tax Act 1976 (“the New Zealand Act”) taxed\n“all profits or gains derived from any business”, which is very\nsimilar to s 10(1)(a) of the ITA\nwhich taxes “gains or profits from any trade [or] business”. Section\n65(2)(e) of the New Zealand Actadditionallytaxed: All profits or gains\nderived from the sale or other disposition of any personal propertyor\nany interest therein … if the business of the taxpayer comprises dealing\nin such property, orif the property was acquired\nfor the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it,\nand all profits or gains derived from the carrying on or carrying\nout of any undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the\npurpose of making a profit: [emphasis added] In our view, the New Zealand cases, which are based on similar\n(if not broader) charging provisions, are therefore directly relevant\nto the present appeal. 35     The\nAppellant’s second contention is that the two New Zealand authorities\nwere determined at a time when New Zealand did not require the maintenance\nof insurance funds for insurance companies as has been required\nin Singapore since 1966. The relevance of the insurance fund (or lack\nthereof) will be discussed later in this judgment (at [41]–[49]). Notwithstanding\nthe legislatively mandated insurance funds, it is clear that the\nrevenue or capital nature of investments gains is an issue to be determined\nin accordance with ordinary principles on the basis of all the facts\nand evidence in each case. 36     InNational Insurance Company, the taxpayer\nwas an insurance company with a 30% shareholding in a private merchant\nbank. The remaining 70% of shares were held by the National Bank\nof New Zealand (“the National Bank”). As a significant minority\nshareholder, the taxpayer had two directors representing it on the\nboard of the merchant bank. The taxpayer sold its shares to the\nNational Bank and realised a profit of $67m on the sale. The Court\nof Appeal of New Zealand gave judgment for the taxpayer, holding\nthat the shares were capital assets. 37     The\ncourt found in that case that there was a weak nexus between the realisation\nof the shares and the carrying on of the insurance business. In particular,\nthe taxpayer had sufficient cash reserves such that the sale of\nits strategic investments was never in contemplation as a means\nof meeting claims or maintaining profitability. Moreover, the taxpayer\ndid not acquire the shares for the purposes of trading, but with\nthe aim of diversifying its investment. The shares were acquired\nwith an intention to be held long-term, evidenced in part by the\nfact that the shares were treated differently from the taxpayer’s\nportfolio shares which were traded. Finally, the court also considered\nthe fact that the shares were eventually sold only because of extenuating\ncircumstances. 38     The\ncourt concluded that the shares were part of the capital structure of\nthe taxpayer’s business and, as such, their disposal gave rise to\ncapital gains (at 15,146): …In the end, this\nwas the making of a value judgment based on the totality of the\nevidence. There were features of the … transaction distinguishing\nit from the general run of investments inherent in the nature of\nthe company’s insurance business which we think allowed a conclusion\nthat it was, albeit an investment, a move into another area of business\nwhich then, for supervening reasons, it became commercially desirable\nto terminate. By the time of disposition the shareholding could\nbe seen as part of the capital structure of a company’s business.\n[emphasis added] 39     A\nsimilar issue arose inState Insurance Office,\nwhere the issue before the New Zealand High Court was whether gains\narising from the sale of shares by the taxpayer (which was a fire\nand general insurer) pursuant to a takeover or merger were properly\ncharacterised as capital gains or revenue. In deciding that the\ngains were of a capital nature, the court placed great emphasis\non the fact that claims submitted to the taxpayer could easily be met\nfrom its cash flow and cash reserves without the need to liquidate\nany of its shares to meet the claims and liabilities. The court\ntook into consideration the lack of intention on the shareholders’\npart to trade in the shares and the fact that the shares were sold\npursuant to a compulsory acquisition. Pertinently, the New Zealand\nHigh Court held (at 476): … Whilst there is a nexus between the income\ngenerated by the shares and the operation of the business …there is no nexus between the realisations which\noccurred here and the method of operation of the business.\n[emphasis added] The shares therefore were “not in their character revenue\nassets in the sense that their realisation is inherent in or incidental\nto the carrying on of the business”. They had become “structural\nassets”. 40     In\nour view, the relevant enquiry to be undertaken in cases involving the\ntaxation of investment gains by insurance (or similar) companies\nmay be summarised as follows: (a)     The\ncrucial question is whether the gain in question is a mere enhancement\nof value by realising a security or whether it was made in an operation\nof business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making. (b)     This\nis ultimately a question offactto\nbe determined according to ordinary concepts having regard particularly\nto the circumstances under which, and the purposes for which, the\ninvestments were acquired and held by the taxpayer. (c)     However,\nas a matter of practicality, the nature of insurance (or similar)\nbusinesses would ordinarily give rise to an inference that the gains\nconcerned arose in the course of trade or in the operation of business\nin carrying out a scheme for profit-making (unless, of course, there\nis cogent evidence that the investments were acquired and held as\ncapital assets). It is on this basis that we now go on to examine the Appellant’s\ncentral argument on appealvidethe\nregulatory regime established by the Insurance Act.",
        "Relevance of the Insurance Act": "41     The\nAppellant’s argument on appeal largely relies on s 17 of the Insurance\nAct. Section 17(1) of the Insurance Act provides for the establishment\nby an insurer of separate insurance funds for each class of its insurance\nbusiness, whilst s 17(4) stipulates what must be paid into an insurance\nfund and the restrictions on what an insurance fund may be used for: Establishment\nof insurance funds and allocation of surplus 17.—(1) Every licensed insurer\nshall establish and maintain a separate insurance fund — (a)    for each class of insurance\nbusiness carried on by the insurer that relates to Singapore policies;\nand (b)    for\neach class of insurance business carried on by the insurer that relates\nto offshore policies. … (4)    There\nshall be paid into an insurance fund all receipts of the insurer properly\nattributable to the business to which the fund relates (including\nthe income of the fund), and the assets comprised in the fund shall\nbe applicable only to meet such part of the insurer’s liabilities\nand expenses as is properly so attributable. 42     The\nAppellant’s primary argument on appeal is that the Shares were attributable\nto the Respondent’s insurance business as the shares were acquired,\nby applying the proceeds of premiums received, in the course of the\ninsurance business and were at all times in its insurance funds.\nAs such, the Appellant alleges that the gains realised in the disposal\nof the Shares were taxable as income. 43     At\nthe outset, it is to be noted that the Appellant’s position on the appeal,\nelevating the Insurance Act as the cornerstone of its case, diverges greatly\nfrom the case it advanced before the High Court, where the Insurance\nAct was acknowledged not to be the “main thrust” of the Appellant’s\narguments. Before the Board and the High Court, the Appellant had\naccepted that notwithstanding the general presumption with regard\nto investment gains by insurers, there might be exceptional instances\nwhere disposals of investments by insurance companies would give\nrise to capital gains (although the Appellant submitted that this\ncase was not exceptional on the facts). However, the main contention\nof the Appellant on appeal now appears to be that gains arising\nfromallassets (even fixed assets)\nheld in insurance funds would invariably be assessable income. On\nsuch an argument, it would presumably be inappropriate for the relevant\ntribunal to consider all the other circumstances of the case (such\nas the circumstances of the acquisition and the realisation of the\nasset) in coming to its determination. 44     The\nAppellant’s argument is clearly flawed. The regulatory requirement\nfor the establishment and maintenance of insurance funds cannot\nwithout more restrict an insurance company from holding capital assets\nin its insurance funds. Assets which are acquired with the receipts\nof income would not invariably be of a revenue nature, and the relevant enquiry\n(set out above at [40]) must be applied at each stage. 45     The\nRespondent rightly notes that the purpose of the Insurance Act is for\nthe regulation and not the taxation of the insurance industry. The insurance\nfund is merely part of the regulatory framework for insurance companies\nand cannot be determinative of their tax treatment. The imposition\nof tax is solely within the purview of Parliament through the enactment\nof clear tax legislation which is to be interpreted by the court\nor relevant tribunal using principles developed incrementally by\ncase law. The fact that certain gains are attributable to investments\nheld in statutorily mandated insurance funds cannotautomaticallydivest\nthe relevant tribunal of its proper role in deciding whether, in\nall the circumstances of the case, the gains are properly attributable\nto the revenue or capital account. Otherwise, any regulatory body\nwould theoretically be able to determine the taxation of companies.\nThis runs counter to the fact that regulatory frameworks are often\nshaped by intricate policy considerations which may have little\nor nothing to do with tax. 46     Moreover,\nthe distinction between the insurance fund and the shareholders’\nfund, whilst relevant, cannot bedeterminativeof\nthe tax treatment of particular assets or investments. Clearly,\ngains arising from the shareholders’ fund could be taxed as income\nas well. In our judgment, insurance companies (whether holding assets\nin the insurance fund or shareholders’ fund) should only be taxed\naccording to the ordinary principles of revenue law, albeit the\nholding of an asset in a particular fund may be a relevantfactorin ascertaining whether the investment\nwas intended to be held as a capital asset. 47     It\nis trite that capital assets do not become revenue assets just because they\ncouldpotentiallybe applied to\nmeet the company’s liabilities, in a situation of liquidation or\notherwise. InState Insurance Office(at\n451), the New Zealand High Court held: … [The Company] is in the business of insurance,\nand it is something of a contradiction on the other hand to advocate\nthat it will never have its reserves called upon, and therefore\nthey assume the character of capital detached from the business\nof insurance, and on the other say that it is necessary for a company\nto obtain commercial credibility to have such reserves in the event that\na calamity does occur. But I think between the two positions the\ntrue situation is that normal requirements are met without recourse\nto investments including shares, and they are truly categorised\nas fixed capital as opposed to circulating capital. As with all\nundertakings, fixed capital is not beyond the reach of creditors\n… Itcannotbe said that merely\nbecause the Shares were held in state-mandated insurance funds and\ncould, in exceptional circumstances, be realised to meet the company’s\nliabilities, the gains attributable to them are invariably revenue\nas opposed to capital gains. 48     The\nAppellant has also sought to rely on the solvency requirements prescribed\nby the Insurance Act to argue that the Shares, which were used to\nmeet the aforesaid solvency requirements, formed part of the Respondent’s\ninsurance business. In our view, such arguments are unpersuasive\nand run the risk of being unduly technical. These solvency requirements\nare merely regulatory measures introduced to ensure that the interests\nof policy holders are adequately protected. As mentioned above (at [45]),\nthe taxation of financially regulated companies such as insurance companies,\nbanks and finance companies cannot be determined solely by regulatory\nmeasures which are prescribed for a whole gamut of policy reasons\nwhich may have little or nothing at all to do with taxation. 49     For\nthe abovementioned reasons, we are of the view that the Insurance\nAct isnotdeterminative of the\ncentral issue in the present appeal,viz,\nwhether, in light of the totality of the evidence, the gains attributable\nto the Shares arose in the operation of the Respondent’s insurance\nbusiness in carrying out a scheme for profit-making.",
        "Application of the relevant\nlegal principles to the facts": "50     Taking\ninto account the totality of the evidence before the Board and the\nJudge, which is largely undisputed by the Appellant, we are of the\nview that the Shares were capital assets and the gains attributable\nto them were therefore not liable to tax. In coming to the same\nconclusion, the Judge considered the following factors (which included\nthe “badges of trade”) and weighed them in balance: (a)     Motive\nof the taxpayer; (b)     Duration\nof ownership; (c)     Multiplicity\nof disposal of the Shares; (d)     Finances; (e)     Findings\nby an earlier Board; (f)     Earlier\ntax treatment; (g)     Placement\nof the Shares in insurance funds; and (h)     The\nconsideration of the Shares in calculating the solvency margin of\nthe Respondent’s insurance funds. 51     It\nis pertinent that, on appeal, the Appellant does not contest theprimary findings of factreached by the\nJudge (and indeed, the Board) in relation to the above factors.\nThe Appellant only disputes theinference of factreached\nby the Judge in concluding that, in light of the above factors, the\nShares were capital assets.",
        "Motive of the taxpayer": "52     As\nnoted above (at [12(a)]), the Respondent did not acquire the Shares\nwith an intention to trade in them. Instead, the Respondent’s intention\nin holding the Shares was to promote the long-term strategic interests\nof itself and the [C] Group. This was evidenced by the numerous cross-holdings\nof shares and cross-directorships between companies within the [C]\nGroup. Regular updates on the status of cross-holdings of companies\nin the [C] Group and [QR] were generated to the senior management\nof [C]. Any decision to sell any shares or rights in the companies\nwithin the [C] Group was closely scrutinised and reviewed by the\nInvestment Committee of the [C] Group to ensure that the appropriate level\nof shareholding and effective control was maintained. The Respondent was\nnot allowed to sell any of its shares and rights in relation to\ncompanies within the [C] Group without the requisite approval from\n[C]. The Shares were also treated differently and segregated from\nshares that were readily traded by the Respondent. 53     The\nabove facts were uncontested by the Appellant who, indeed,\nappears to concede that the Shares were held as part of a corporate preservation\nstrategy as opposed to for the purposes of trade. For example, at\n[11] of its Skeletal Arguments, the Appellant states that “it is\ntempting to be seduced by the fact that the Shares were held for\na long period of time … and were held as part of the ‘corporate\npreservation strategy of the [C] Group’”. Instead, the Appellant\nappears to argue that the Shares were part of the Respondent’s insurance\noperationsnotwithstandingthe particular motive\nfor the acquisition. 54     We\nhave difficulty accepting this submission. The motive of the Respondent\nin acquiring and holding the Shares is relevant (indeed, highly relevant)\nto the enquiry. As observed by Lord Parker inLiverpool\nand London and Globe(at 380), the central question in\nsuch cases ought to be determined on ordinary business principles\n“having regard to the circumstances under which, and the purposes\nfor which, the investments were made and are held by the … company”. 55     It\nis clear to us that the presumption of fact in relation to the taxation of\ninvestment gains of insurance companies (ie,\nthat they are usually taxable) is predicated on what was viewed\nto be the intention and purpose behind the acquisition and holding\nof such investments by most insurance companies,viz,\nfor the purposes of trade and profit generation. However, the natural\nand logical corollary of this is that where there is convincing evidence\nthat the predominant motivation of acquiring the investment is different\n(eg, strategic) this would also\nbe relevant in evaluating whether the gains were in fact capital\ngains as opposed to income. 56     In\nthese circumstances, the factual finding that the Shares were acquired\nand held as part of a group corporate preservation strategy (which finding\nwent unchallenged by the Appellant on appeal) gives rise to a very strong\ninference that they were capital assets.",
        "Duration of ownership": "57     As\nnoted above (at [12(b)], the Shares were held for a long period\nof time. The [C] shares, [D] shares and [E] shares were accumulated\nover a period of 30 years, 20 years and 27 years respectively. This\nis in line with the Respondent’s stated intention of holding the\nShares for an indefinite period pursuant to its corporate preservation\nstrategy and weighs heavily in the balance of the Shares being found\nto be capital assets of the Respondent. As noted inWaylee\nInvestment(cited above at [31]) in the context of banks and\nfinancial institutions, “the clearest indication that an investment\nwas acquired as a capital asset would be an indication that the\n[company] intended to hold the investment as such for an indefinite\nperiod.”",
        "Multiplicity of similar transactions": "58     Consistent\nwith the stated corporate preservation strategy, there were few\ndisposals of the Shares by the Respondent throughout its relatively\nlong period of holding. Evidence was adduced by the Respondent that\nno [D] shares and [E] shares were disposed before the Takeover by\n[F] in 2002. There were only nine disposals of [C] shares over a\nspan of 30 years, and these were mostly to other companies within\nthe [C] Group. Moreover, during the period from YA 1983 to YA 1991\n(during which there were disposals of [C] shares), the percentage\nof [C] shares held by the [C] Group remained relatively constant\nand ranged between 21.28% and 22.78%. Again, the Appellant did not\nseriously attempt to challenge these primary findings on appeal.",
        "Finances": "59     Evidence\nwas adduced by the Respondent to show that the Respondent did not\nneed to and did not in fact liquidate the Shares to meet its liabilities\nin the insurance business. From YA 1973 to YA 2003, the Respondent’s\nnet cash flow was positive from a year-to-year basis. For certain\nyears of assessment, such as YA 1985 and YA 1986, where the offshore\nclaims were higher than the premiums collected, the Respondent would\ndraw upon cash reserves in its offshore fund as well as upon dividend and\ninterest income to meet the cash outflow requirements arising from\nthe offshore claims. Alternatively, the Respondent would transfer\nmoneys from the accumulated profits of its onshore fund to its shareholders’\nfund, and then transfer moneys from the shareholders’ fund to the\noffshore fund to pay the offshore claims. As the Judge and the Board\nnoted, there was no necessity for the Respondent to sell the [C]\nshares to meet its offshore claims and the Respondent did not in\nfact do so. 60     As\nsuch, the Judge rightly found that, similar to the situation inNational Insurance CompanyandState Insurance Office, there was a weak nexus\nbetween the sale of the Shares and the carrying on of the Respondent’s\ninsurance business. To borrow the words of Heron J inState Insurance Office, the Judge found\nthat the Shares were not in their character revenue assets in the\nsense of their realisation being inherent in or incidental to the\ncarrying on of the Respondent’s insurance business. Instead, the\nShares were “structural” or capital assets.",
        "Other factors": "61     The\nJudge also considered certain findings made by an earlier Board and\nthe earlier tax treatment of certain shares sold by the Respondent\nof the same counters. These factors were rightly found to be unpersuasive\nor at most neutral by the Judge.",
        "The insurance fund": "62     For\nthe reasons set out above (at [43]–[49]), the statutorily mandated insurance\nfunds and solvency requirements are not determinative of whether\nan investment is a capital asset for the purposes of income tax. Insurance\ncompanies (whether holding assets in the insurance fund or shareholders’\nfund) can and should only be taxed according to the ordinary principles\nof revenue law. Whilst the holding of an asset in a particular fund can\nbe a relevant factor in ascertaining whether the investment isintendedto be held as a capital asset,\nthe Judge (and the Board) had found (and the Appellant does not\ndispute) that the Shares were held pursuant to the Respondent’s\ncorporate preservation strategy. In these premises, the relevant\nregulatory framework is insufficient to offset the very strong inference\nthat the Shares were intended to be (and were in fact) held as capital\nassets.",
        "Conclusion": "63     In\nconclusion, all factors indicated that the Shares were acquired\nand held to safeguard the long-term strategic interests of the [C]\nGroup and, indeed, the Shares were eventually realised pursuant\nto the takeover of [C]. At that point, there was no longer any reason\nfor the Respondent to retain the Shares. For the above reasons,\nwe were satisfied on the totality of the evidence that the Board\nwas well entitled to find that the Shares were in fact capital assets,\nthe gains attributable to which were not taxable under the ITA.\nIt follows that the Judge did not err in affirming the determination\nof the Board. We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs and the\nusual consequential orders.  [note: 1]Recital\nto the ITA"
