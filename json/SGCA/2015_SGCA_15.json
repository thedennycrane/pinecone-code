        "Background Facts": "2       The\nbackground facts are set out in full in the High Court judge’s (“the\nJudge”) judgment inSu Ah Tee and others v\nAllister Lim and Thrumurgan (sued as a firm) and another (William\nCheng and others, third parties)[2014] SGHC 159 (“the\nJudgment”). We do not propose to repeat them in their entirety,\nbut will highlight the salient facts that are germane to these appeals. 3       Mr\nSu Ah Tee (“Su”), a businessman, paid $900,000 for the Shophouse,\nwhich was located at Block 63 Kallang Bahru #01-423 Singapore 330063.\nThe seller of the Shophouse was Mr William Cheng (“Cheng”). Su’s\nconveyancing solicitor was Mr Allister Lim (“Lim”) of M/s Allister\nLim & Thrumurgan (“ALT”). Lim qualified as a solicitor in 1999 and\nhas practised conveyancing law since 2004. He had acted for Su from time\nto time from December 2010 in the purchase of some other shophouses.\nSu’s property agent, Ng Sing (“Ng”) and Cheng’s property agent,\nMr Sam Oh Seng Lee (“Sam”) jointly brokered the sale. 4       After\nthe sale of the Shophouse was completed, Su realised that the Shophouse\nhad a remaining lease of just 17 years. He, his wife and their son (“the\nPlaintiffs”) filed a professional negligence suit (“the Main Action”) against\nLim and ALT (“the Defendants”) in the High Court. The Defendants\nthen brought third party proceedings against Cheng, Ng and Ng’s\nalleged employer SGR Property Pte Ltd (“SGR Property”) (collectively “the\nThird Parties”), seeking a contribution of damages payable under\ns 15(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”), which\nreads: Entitlement\nto contribution 15.—(1) … [A]ny person liable\nin respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover\ncontribution from any other person liable in respect of the same\ndamage (whether jointly with him or otherwise). 5       The\nJudge entered judgment in default against SGR Property for failing\nto enter appearance (the Judgment at [225]–[227]). She also ruled against\nthe Defendants, Cheng and Ng (the Judgment at [115]–[116], [194]–[195]\nand [220]–[223]). 6       The\nJudge found that Cheng made a fraudulent misrepresentation to both\nSam and Ng that the Shophouse had a remaining lease of 62 years, who\nthen repeated this misrepresentation to Su. At trial, Cheng argued\nthat he did not make any misrepresentation, and that he in fact\nhanded Ng an option to purchase that stated that the Shophouse had\na remaining lease of 17 years. The Judge found that this option\nto purchase was in fact a forgery and accordingly rejected this\nargument (the Judgment at [43]–[46] and [192]–[196]). Ng was also\nfound liable for negligent misrepresentation (the Judgment at [220]–[223]). 7       The\nJudge also held the Defendants liable for negligence in failing\nto inform Su that the Shophouse had a remaining lease of only 17\nyears (the Judgment at [69(f)], [91]–[100]). Lim did two title searches\non the Shophouse, which showed that the Shophouse had a remaining\nlease of only 17 years (the Judgment at [69(f)] and [92]–[93]).\nBut he did not give Su either of these title searches (the Judgment\nat [93]). The Judge also found that Su never informed the Defendants\nthat he had been told by the vendor through Ng and Sam that he was\npurchasing a shophouse with 62 years remaining on its lease (the\nJudgment at [69(d)]). Even so, the Judge held that in property transactions,\nthe duration of the term of the lease was of such vital importance\nthat conveyancing solicitors were expected to keep their clients\ninformed of such information as the number of years left on the\nlease (the Judgment at [98]–[100]). 8       Having\nfound the Defendants as well as the Third Parties variously liable,\nthe Judge proceeded to apportion liability between them. She ordered Cheng\nto bear 50% of the overall liability for damages, the Defendants\nto bear 45%, and Ng to bear the remaining 5% (the Judgment at [233]).\nShe also ordered full costs in the Main Action in the Plaintiffs’\nfavour (the Judgment at [234]) and full costs in the third party\nproceedings in the Defendants’ favour (the Judgment at [235]–[236]). 9       Dissatisfied,\nboth Cheng and the Defendants appealed. Cheng filed Civil Appeal\nNo 148 of 2014 on 8 September 2014 (“CA 148/2014”). The Defendants\nfiled Civil Appeal No 152 of 2014 on 10 September 2014 (“CA 152/2014”).",
        "Arguments on appeal": "10     On\nappeal, both Cheng and the Defendants argue that they are not liable\nand, in any event, that the respective proportions of the damages awarded\nagainst them are excessive. In CA 152/2014, the Defendants also take\nissue with the order on costs. The Defendants say that they should\nnot be made to bear the Plaintiffs’ costs in the Main Action on\ntheir own as they had succeeded in the third party proceedings;\nthe Third Parties ought therefore to contribute towards these costs.\nThe Defendants also say that the Judge should have ordered SGR Property\nto indemnify the Defendants at least in relation to Ng’s portion\nof damages payable on the basis that SGR Property is Ng’s employer. 11     Ng\nappeared in person. He accepts the Judge’s finding that he is liable for\nnegligent misrepresentation, but wishes to pay no more than 5% of\nthe damages. SGR Property did not appear in the appeal and has not\napplied to set aside the judgment in default that was entered against\nit.",
        "Our decision": "",
        "Overview": "12     We\ndo not accept the arguments made by Cheng and the Defendants that\nthey are not liable for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligence respectively.\nIn our judgment, the Judge rightly held them liable and we generally\nagree with the detailed reasons she gave in the Judgment, in which she\npainstakingly analysed the evidence and the law. We agree with much of\nwhat she said and, to that extent, we do not repeat the basis or\nthe reasons set out in the Judgment. However, we respectfully disagree\nwith three aspects of her decision: (a)     First,\nthe Judge made no finding of contributory negligence on Su’s part.\nIn our judgment, such a finding should have been made having regard\nto the evidence, the facts that were found, and the pleadings. Su’s\ncase was that a fraudulent representation – that the Shophouse had\na remaining lease of 62 years – was made to him and he then acted\nupon it. An essential element of such a case is reliance – that\nthe representee had taken a certain course of actionbecausethe representation had been made\nto him and he believed it to be true. However, the Judge eventually\nfound that Su had never informed either Lim or ALT of the fact of\nthis representation that he said he had (and indeed was found to\nhave) relied on. Given these three factors – the legal significance\nof the element of reliance in an action for misrepresentation and\nthe two factual aspects, namely, Su’s awareness of the importance\nof the representation, as well as his failure to inform the Defendants\nabout it – we find he should be held contributorily negligent; (b)     Second,\nwe consider that the Judge’s apportionment of liability between\nCheng, the Defendants, and Ng should be adjusted to reflect the\ngreater degree of culpability on Cheng’s part in making afraudulentmisrepresentation; and (c)     Third,\nwe have also found it necessary to revise aspects of the Judge’s\norder on costs. In this judgment, we confine\nourselves to these points.",
        "Contributory negligence": "General principles 13     Contributory\nnegligence is a partial defence that reduces the quantum of damages\npayable to plaintiffs if they fail to safeguard their own interests (Froom v Butcher[1976] QB 286 at 291,\napproved inParno v SC Marine Pte Ltd[1999]\n3 SLR(R) 377 (“Parno”) at [59];Astley v Austrust Ltd(1999) 197 CLR 1\nat [30], approved inPlanAssure PAC (formerly\nknown as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd[2007]\n4 SLR 513 at [119]). It is regarded as a salutary power to register\ndisapproval of the plaintiffs’ conduct by a reduction of damages\n(Glanville Williams,Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence(Stevens\n& Sons Ltd, 1951) (“Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence”)\nat p 353). It used to be the case at common law that contributory\nnegligence operated as a complete defence against a claim in damages,ieif the damage suffered by the plaintiffs\nwas partly due to the plaintiffs’ failure to take reasonable care,\nthe plaintiffs could not recover any damages at all from the defendant\n(Butterfield v Forrester(1809)\n11 East 60,perEllenborough CJ;Davies v Mann(1842) 10 M & W 546).\nThis is no longer so following statutory intervention – England\npassed the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 (c 28)\nand Singapore followed suit by enacting the Contributory Negligence\nand Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Contributory Negligence\nAct”). The relevant provision in the Contributory Negligence Act\nis s 3, which reads: Apportionment\nof liability in case of contributory negligence 3.—(1) Where any person suffers\ndamage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault\nof any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage\nshall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering\nthe damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall\nbe reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable\nhaving regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for\nthe damage. (2)    Subsection (1)\nshall not operate to defeat any defence arising under a contract. (3)    Where any contract or written law\nproviding for the limitation of liability is applicable to the claim,\nthe amount of damages recoverable by the claimant under subsection (1)\nshall not exceed the maximum limit so applicable. … 14     As\nis apparent from s 3(1), both the fault of the claimant and the\nfault of the defendant are relevant. The term “fault” is defined\nunder s 2 of the Contributory Negligence Act as follows: “fault” means negligence, breach of statutory\nduty or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in\ntort or would, apart from this Act, give rise to the defence of\ncontributory negligence. 15     It\nis clear from this that the definition of “fault” is a broad one,\nand that it is not just an “act” that is caught; an omission also\nwould fall within the ambit of “fault”. 16     The\ndefence of contributory negligence must be specifically pleaded under\nOrder 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).\nAs with virtually all pleading requirements, the underlying purpose\nof this requirement is to ensure that the other side is not taken\nby surprise (Rajendran a/l Palany v Dril-Quip\nAsia Pacific Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR(R) 887 at [17]–[19],\napprovingFookes v Slaytor[1979]\n1 All ER 137). Can a failure on a client’s\npart to inform his solicitor of information amount to contributory\nnegligence? 17     In\nour judgment, a clientcanbe held\ncontributorily negligent for omitting to inform his solicitor of\nmaterial information and that such an omission can fall within the\nambit of “fault” under the Contributory Negligence Act. 18     We\nrecognise that a solicitor is under a duty to elicit information\nfrom a client before acting and that there are concerns that a finding\nof contributory negligence may derogate from this duty on the part\nof solicitor (Richard Scott Novak, “Attorney Malpractice: Restricting\nthe Availability of the Client Contributory Negligence Defense”\n(1979) 59 BULR 950). Indeed, there are authorities which suggest\nthat courts should be slow in finding contributory negligence on\nthe part of a solicitor’s client. One such authority is Rimer J’s\npronouncement inFootball League Ltd v Edge\nEllison[2006] EWHC 1462 (at [330]): It is only in rare cases that a solicitor\nis able to advance a plea of contributory negligence with any real\nprospect of success, and for obvious reasons. This is because his\nbreach of duty will usually be in relation to a matter within his special\nexpertise as a solicitor, being a duty which is not usually one\nrelating to a purely commercial matter of judgment falling squarely\nwithin the client’s own competence. It will usually relate to a\nmatter upon which the client is depending upon the solicitors’ own\nspecial expertise. 19     Similarly,\nthe Hong Kong Court of Appeal inHondon Development Ltd\nand another v Powerise Investments Ltd and another[2005]\n3 HKLR 605 (“Hondon”) at [36] held: As a solicitor is remunerated for his services\nand it is his duty to advise his lay client and protect his interest,\npublic policy requires that such a professional’s claim of contributory\nnegligence by the client may only be successfully raised in very\nlimited circumstances … 20     It\nis not difficult to appreciate why this is the case. As the authors\nofJackson & Powell on Professional Liability(Sweet & Maxwell,\n7th Ed, 2012) (“Jackson & Powell”)\nstate at para 5-146: In the context of professional negligence\na successful plea of contributory negligence by the defendant is\nless common than in other areas of negligence. This is because the\nparties often do not stand on an equal footing (as they do in, say,\nclaims arising from road traffic accidents). If the defendant makes\na mistake, it may be difficult to say that the client was negligent\nnot to spot it or correct its effect, unless the client is expected\nto be wiser than his own professional advisers. 21     But\nthere are exceptions to this general observation.Jackson\n& Powellgoes on to note this in the next paragraph\n(para 5-147): There are, of course, exceptions to the\nvery general statements made in the previous paragraph. First, the\nclaimant may be particularly well placed to spot or correct the\ndefendant’s mistake. Secondly, the claimant may do something quite\nseparate which aggravates the consequences of the defendant’s breach\nof duty. … [Thirdly,] [w]here a relevant fact is not communicated\nby the client to his professional advisers, the question commonly\narises whether the client was negligent to withhold it or the defendant\nwas negligent not to elicit it. If the client is an experienced businessman,\nthe court is more likely to treat his omission as amounting at least\nto contributory negligence. 22     This\ncategorisation of the exceptions to the general rule may be useful for\nanalytical purposes but we do not regard it as necessarily exhaustive. The\ncourt inHondoncited the first\ntwo exceptions (citing an earlier edition ofJackson\n& Powell) with approval (at [36]). The first category\nof cases includes claims made by mortgage lenders (such as banks)\nagainst solicitors for the latter’s failure to draw the lender’s\nattention to particular problems such as the creditworthiness of\nthe borrower, which, had it been brought to the lender’s knowledge,\nwould have caused the lender to withdraw the mortgage offer or reduce\nthe amount of the advance (seeeg:Birmingham Midshires Mortgage Services Ltd v David\nParry & Co[1998] PNLR 249;Omega\nTrust Co Ltd and another v Wright Son & Pepper and another (No\n2)[1998] PNLR 337). Lenders are particularly well-placed\nto spot these problems as they have the resources and means for\nthis (Hugh Evans,Lawyer’s Liabilities(Sweet\n& Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2002) at para 8-04) and indeed the motivation\nto do so since this goes to the core of their own business decision.Jackson & Powellstates thatCrossman v Stewart(1977) 5 CCLT 45 (“Crossman”) is an example of the second\ncategory. InCrossman, a patient\nwas held liable in contributory negligence for taking larger doses of\na negligently prescribed drug. As the present case does not fall\nwithin the first two categories, we say no more about them. 23     As\nto the third category, we agree withJackson\n& Powellthat a client canin\nprinciplebe held liable for failing to communicate information\nto a professional. In our judgment, a client who omits to reveal\ninformation that the solicitor would be expected to need in order\nto properly carry out that which is within his special expertise,\ncan be said to have failed to take steps to protect himself. If\na client neglects to inform his solicitor of such information, the\nsolicitor might not fully appreciate the client’s concerns and interests\nand might not therefore be sufficiently alive to the risk of harm\nto the client. There are three cases that illustrate this: (a)     First,\ninCarradine Properties Ltd v D J Freeman &\nCo(1989) 5 Const LJ 267, the claimant’s managing director,\nan experienced property developer, hired a demolition contractor\nto demolish the upper floors of a freehold property. In the process\nof the demolition, the contractors damaged the ground floor of the\nproperty, which was owned by a third party. As a result, the claimant\nwas liable in damages to the third party. The claimant instructed\nits solicitors to sue the contractor, but the contractor turned\nout to be worthless. The claimant then brought a claim under its\ninsurance policy but was refused cover because it had made the claim\ntoo late. The claimant subsequently commenced proceedings against\nits solicitors. It alleged that its solicitors failed to safeguard\nits interests as they did not remind it to make a claim under its\ninsurance policy. It asserted that this resulted in its claim being\nimpermissibly late. The claimant was not awarded any damages and\nits claim failed in its entirety. The court held that the solicitors\nwere not to blame as the claimant had not informed them that it\nhad an insurance policy to begin with. (b)     Second,\ninFong Maun Yee and another v Yoong Weng Ho Robert[1997]\n1 SLR(R) 751 (“Fong Maun Yee”),\na decision of this court, a businessman wishing to purchase property\nfrom a company gave his property agent a deposit. The agent later\nabsconded with the money, and it turned out that the owner of the\nproperty in question (the company) never had any intention to sell\nthe property. The businessman’s solicitor was given a copy of the\noption to purchase purportedly signed by the managing director of\nthe company and a company resolution stating that the board approved\nthe sale. These documents turned out to be forgeries. The solicitor\nwas held liable in negligence for failing to confirm the position\nwith the company directly. He had only carried out a company search\nto confirm that the persons who had purportedly signed the resolution\nand the option were named as the company’s directors. Nonetheless,\nthe court held that the businessman client was contributorily negligent\nfor having failed to tell his solicitor that he suspected that something\nwas amiss. The businessman admitted that he thought that things\nwere not right because of the notably low price at which the purported\nseller was prepared to sell the property. The court held that had\nthe businessman told the solicitor that he (the businessman) suspected that\nmatters were amiss, the solicitor would have been put on guard, and\nwould hence have been able to better protect his client’s interests. (c)     Third,\ninEdwards v Lee[1991] 141 NLJ\n1517 (“Edwards”), the sellers of\nan expensive car were approached by a rogue who offered to buy it.\nA third party later telephoned the sellers saying that the rogue had\ntried to sell him their car at a large discount. At this point,\nthe sellers telephoned the rogue’s solicitors for a reference but\nomitted to tell them of the call that had been made to them. The\nrogue’s solicitors provided a clean reference even though they knew\nthat their client was on bail and faced 13 charges for fraud. The\nsolicitors were found liable in negligence but the claimants’ damages\nwere reduced by 50% because of their failure to mention the telephone\nconversation that would have alerted them (the solicitors) that\nthe sellers werethemselvesabout\nto become victims of a fraud. 24     Advice\nby solicitors will generally only be as good as the facts on which\nit is based (John Murdoch, “Client negligence: A lost cause” (2004) 20(2)\nPN 97 at p 100). Indeed, the courts have also recognised that there\nis a reciprocal duty on the part of a client to communicate relevant\ninformation to his solicitor. Richardson J in the decision of the\nNew Zealand Court of Appeal inMouat v Clark\nBoyce[1992] 2 NZLR 559 (reversed on appeal to the Privy\nCouncil on an unrelated point) said at 572: In conducting business affairs, as in other\nareas of life,failure to provide adequate\ninformationto the professional adviser and inflexibility\nin responding to advice receivedmay be one\nof the causes of the damage. [emphasis added] 25     A\nclient must also be candid and disclose information notwithstanding\nthat this may be detrimental to the possibility of a successful\nclaim. InDawe v Brown(1995) 130\nNfld & PEIR 281 (“Dawe”), the\nNewfoundland Supreme Court found that a client had not been candid with\nhis solicitor in disclosing information that was detrimental to\nthe possibility of a successful claim. There, a seller sold fish\nto a buyer but did not receive full payment. The seller retained\na solicitor to recover the monies to which he thought he was entitled.\nHowever, the seller failed to mention to the solicitor that some\nof the fish sold to the buyer was not fresh and the buyer had withheld\nfull payment because of this. Schwartz J made the following observations\nat [45]: A problem is not simply left at the hands\nof a lawyer with the sole expectation of a satisfactory resolution.\nIt is incumbent on the client to explain the problem fully, provide\nall facts pertaining to the matterincluding\nanything which might be detrimental to the possibility of a successful\nclaim, and to give the lawyer instructions on proceeding\nafter being fully advised. It is only then that a solicitor can\nact properly on behalf of the client. [emphasis added] 26     To\nensure that a solicitor’s duty to elicit information from his client before\nacting is not derogated from, the quantum of reduction in damages payable\nshould generally be modest to reflect a solicitor’s primary responsibility\nin safeguarding his client’s interest.Fong\nMaun Yeeprovides a useful illustration. There, although\nwe reduced damages payable by the solicitor to the claimant, the\nreduction was a modest one of 25%. This was because the solicitor\nmust assume the primary responsibility as a professional (at [63],\napprovingBanque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle\nStar Insurance Co Ltd[1995] 2 All ER 769). Application of law to the present\ncase 27     In\nthe present case, as we have noted above, an essential element of Su’s\ncase is that he in fact acted on the misrepresentation. At trial,\nSu strenuously asserted that he had conveyed the fact of the representation\nto ALT but the Judge did not accept this. Before us, faced with\nthis finding, Su’s counsel, Mr Thomas Lei, contended that Su had\nnot mentioned the representation at all because he was not placed\non inquiry as the information that was conveyed to him was routine\nand consistent with what he knew about the leasehold durations of\nproperties in the vicinity. Indeed, the Judge noted at [26] of the\nJudgment that the Shophouse was the only lot in that location with\na 30-year leasehold. The neighbouring shophouses had 78-year leaseholds.\nIn these circumstances, Mr Lei suggested that it would be wrong\nto hold that Su was at “fault” in not informing ALT or Lim of the\nimpression he had or of the representation that had been made to\nhim. 28     In\nour judgment, it was not open to Mr Lei to make this argument. This\nis for two reasons. First, to stretch this argument too far would\nrisk running afoul of Su’s basic position that he was the victim\nof a fraudulent misrepresentation, which was a finding of fact made\nby the Judge. If the representation was such a routine piece of\ninformation, then did he even rely on it? Second, it was also inconsistent\nwith the affirmative position he had taken in the trial where, as\nwe have already noted, his evidence was that he had told ALT of\nthis fact. The point ultimately is that the representation was a\nsignificant piece of information as far as Su was concerned and\nhe had relied on it in entering into the sale. In these circumstances,\nwe are unable to see how Su can avoid all responsibility for having\nfailed to convey this to his solicitors. 29     This\npoint was first raised by the Plaintiffs in para 6 of their Statement of\nClaim (Amendment No 1) (“SOC”), which reads: On or about 23.3.2001, [Su] instructed\nand retained the [Defendants] to conduct the legal conveyance of\nthe property at 63 Kallang Bahru #01-423 which he told them had\na remaining 60 plus years’ leasehold from the HDB, to be conveyed\nto the names of [Su’s son] and [Su’s wife] as [Su’s] nominees. … 30     This\nwas categorically denied by the Defendants. At paras 7 and 16 of their\nDefence (Amendment No 1), the Defendants averred that Su did not tell\nthem or instruct them to check that the Shophouse had a remaining lease\nof “more than 60 years”; he only gave instructions to “proceed”\nwith the purchase of the Shophouse. The Defendants repeated this\naverment at para 42 of their opening statement. The Plaintiffs were\nclearly aware that this was part of the defence mounted, as evinced\nby para 33(2) of their opening statement where they stated: 33. The defences that can be gleaned from\nthe pleadings in brief are: … (2) … Su did not expressly request or instruct\nthe Defendants to ensure that the property has a leasehold of more\nthan 60 years … … 31     Moreover,\nthe Defendants squarely raised Su’s failure to mention his expectation\nthat the remaining leasehold of the property was 62 years as contributory\nnegligence in their closing submissions. The Plaintiffs were not\ncaught off guard by this. In fact, they had fought strenuously at\ntrial to convince the Judge that Su did in fact inform the Defendants\nthat the Shophouse had a remaining lease of 62 years (the Judgment\nat [14] and [58]–[62]). The Judge concluded that Su did not (the\nJudgment at [59]). Given this finding, the remaining issue was whether\nSuoughtto have informed his solicitors.\nThis is a point of law. 32     In\nour judgment, Su’s failure in these circumstances does come within the\nambit of “fault” in s 2 of the Contributory Negligence Act. It is\nan “omission” and, as we have stated above, a client can be held\nliable in contributory negligence for failing to communicate information\nto his solicitor. To some degree, Su was an author of his own misfortune\nin failing to communicate a piece of informationthat\nhe appreciated was important, namely, his belief that\nthe Shophouse had a remaining leasehold of 62 years. The damages\npayable to Su should therefore be reduced to take into account such\ncontributory negligence on his part. 33     In\nthe circumstances, we reduce the damages by 15% which, in our judgment,\nis a just and equitable reduction having regard to Su’s responsibility\nfor his loss pursuant to s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence Act.\nThis reduction is less than the 25% applied inFong\nMaun Yeebecause, unlike the position inFong\nMaun Yee, it does not appear that Su suspected that Cheng\nwas acting fraudulently. Where a client’s suspicions have been aroused\nin a material way and he nonetheless fails to mention the relevant facts\nand circumstances to his solicitor then it would generally warrant\na larger reduction in the damages recoverable.",
        "Apportionment of liability": "34     We\nalso consider that the Judge ought to have ordered Cheng to pay more\nthan 50% of the damages to reflect his culpability in having made\na fraudulent misrepresentation. In deciding the contribution that\nshould be made by each third party under s 15 of the CLA, the court\nmust have regard to the extent of the third party’s responsibility\nfor the damage. This is made clear by s 16(1) of the CLA, which\nreads: Assessment of contribution 16.—(1) Subject to subsection\n(3), in any proceedings for contribution under section 15, the amount\nof the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as\nmay be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard\nto the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage in\nquestion. 35     Counsel\nfor Cheng, Mr Melvin Chan, argues that the Judge placed undue weight\non Cheng’s moral blameworthiness and that insufficient attention\nwas given to the actual wording of s 16(1) of the CLA. In this regard,\nMr Chan relies especially on two cases,Downs\nand another v Chappell and another[1997] 1 WLR 426 (“Downs”) andCollins\nv Hertfordshire County Council and another[1947] 1 KB\n598 (“Collins”). 36     InDowns, the claimants sued the seller of\na property for fraudulent misrepresentation and the seller’s accountant\nfor negligent misrepresentation. The seller misrepresented the value\nof the property by inflating its worth and the seller’s accountant\nrepeated that misrepresentation in a letter addressed to the claimants.\nThe English Court of Appeal found in favour of the claimants but\napportioned damages equally between the defendants. 37     InCollins, Hilbery J followed his earlier\ndecision inSmith v Bray (Wickham, third party)(1939)\n56 TLR 200 (“Smith”) in holding\nthe following in relation to s 6(2) of UK’s Law Reform (Married\nWomen and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 (c 30) (“Law Reform (Married Women\nand Tortfeasors) Act 1935”), a provision that is worded similarly\nto s 16(1) of the CLA and apportioning liability equally between\nthe defendants (at 624): If the wording of that sub-section had\nstopped at the word “equitable” and the semi-colon had occurred\nthere, I should have thought that what was plainly intended was\nthat the court was to have the fullest discretion and to distribute\nthe contribution to the damages between persons whose several acts\nhad brought about the damage according to what the court thought\nwere their degrees of culpability. But the sub-section does not\nstop at the words “just and equitable” but continues with the governing\nwords “having regard to the extent of that person's responsibility\nfor the damage.” … The words “having regard to the extent of that\nperson's responsibility for the damage,” certainly seem to indicate\nthat the extent of the responsibility for the damage is to be the\nguiding principle of the assessment.It is\ndifficult to conceive how anything other than causal acts resulting\nin the damage can show the extent of a person’s responsibility for\nthe damage.[emphasis added] 38     With\nrespect, we are unable to accept Mr Chan’s submission. First,Downsdoes not stand for thegeneralproposition that the court should\nnot take into account moral blameworthiness. On the contrary, Hobhouse\nLJ (as he then was) (with whom Roch and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed)\ninDownsheld that both moral blameworthiness\nand causative responsibility are important considerations in deciding\na just and equitable apportionment of damages (at 445) as follows: The extent of a person’s responsibility\ninvolves both the degree of his fault and the degree to which it\ncontributed to the damage in question. It is just and equitable\nto take into account both the seriousness of the respective parties’\nfaults and their causative relevance. … 39     In\nour judgment, the court inDownscould\nwell have held the seller responsible for a higher percentage of\nthe damages as he had misrepresented the positionfraudulentlyand\nwe respectfully disagree with Hobhouse LJ’s reasons in apportioning\nliability equally between the fraudulent seller and the negligent\naccountant. Hobhouse LJ held that even though a fraudulent party\nshould be made to bear a greater proportion of the damages to take\ninto account his moral blameworthiness in the normal case, the facts\nofDownswarranted a different treatment.\nOn the facts ofDowns, the claimants\nrelied on the accountants’ letterinsteadof\nthe fraudulent misrepresentation made by the seller in deciding\nto purchase the property. On this basis, Hobhouse LJ held that the\naccountants’ letter had a greater “causative impact” than the fraudulent\nmisrepresentation made by the seller in inducing the claimants to\npurchase the property. Therefore, both the seller and the accountant\nbore equal overall responsibility for the claimants’ loss (at 445).\nWe respectfully disagree with this reasoning because it seems to\nus to be artificial to say that the buyer inDownsdid\nnot rely on the seller’s fraudulent misrepresentation when the accountant’s letter\nrepeated thatsamemisrepresentation. 40     Similarly,\nthe view expressed in the passage fromCollinsthat\nwe have extracted above is too restrictive a reading of the equivalent\nprovision in the UK of s 16(1) of the CLA as it places too much\nemphasis on a person’s causative responsibility and neglects the\nneed for the court to apportion liability in a “just and equitable”\nmanner. 41     Indeed,Smith, the decision relied on inCollins, andCollinsitself,\nhave both been subject to trenchant criticism. For ease of reference,\nwe refer to the approach taken inSmithandCollinsas the “causative test”. 42     J\nP Lawton in his article “Vicarious Liability of Hospital Authorities” (1947)\n10(4) Mod LR 425 at pp 427–428 argues that the causative test gives the\nequivalent provision in the UK of s 16(1) of the CLA a “strained\nand impracticable” interpretation, and if Parliament had intended\nthe provision to be read restrictively, it would have used a more\nneutral phrase such as “the extent to which the personcausedthe damage”. 43     Similarly,\nboth Professor Glanville Williams in “The Law Reform (Contributory\nNegligence) Act 1945” (1946) 9(2) Mod LR 105 at pp 131–132 and Stephen\nChapman in “Apportionment of liability between tortfeasors” (1948)\n64 LQR 26 at pp 27–28 have argued that the causative test is too\nrestrictive and may cause injustice. Williams and Chapman argue that\nthe causative test – in focusingonlyon\ncausation in apportioning liability – is very likely to result in\nan equal apportionment of damages among parties without having regard\nto the parties’ respective degrees of blame in many cases, especially\nthose involving successive tortfeasors, because it will often be\nimpossible in such cases to say that one was more the cause of the\ndamage than the other. Each tortfeasor’s causal responsibility will\ncommonly be the same because each of their acts/omissions will be\nequally important forming one part of a continuous causal link resulting\nin the eventual loss. Williams and Chapman further argue that this\ncannot have been the intended result given that the statute does\nnot direct the courts to apportion damages equally among defendants, but\nrather affords a wide discretion in deciding a just and equitable apportionment\nof damages. 44Collinsin fact illustrates the potential\nfor injustice. There, a final year surgical student was asked by\nher supervisor (a fully qualified surgeon) to prepare anaesthesia\nfor a surgery. Instead of mixing procaine with adrenalin, she mixed\ncocaine with adrenalin. The anaesthesia was administered by the\nsurgeon, and the patient died as a result. The widow of the patient\nsued, and an issue of apportionment of liability between the surgeon\nand student arose. Hilbery J rejected an argument made by counsel for\nthe student that the surgeon, who failed to supervise her, was more blameworthy,\nholding that the wording of s 6(1) of the Law Reform (Married Women\nand Tortfeasors) Act 1935 directed him to apply the causative test\nalone. 45     As\nmentioned above, we disagree with the approach inCollins.\nIn determining each party’s contribution, both causative responsibility\nand blameworthiness have to be considered (seeeg:Randolph v Tuck[1962] 1 QB 175 at 185;Acrecrest Ltd v Hattrell & Partners(1982)\n252 EG 1107 at 1113;Madden v Quirke[1989]\n1 WLR 702). In this regard, we approve of the following passage\nin para 4-018 ofJackson & Powell,\nwhich provides: The court should have regard to both the\nculpability of the various parties and to the extent to which each\nparty’s conduct “caused” the damage in question. …The\n“just and equitable” criterion is wide enough to enable the apportionment\ntake account of blameworthinessas well as causative\npotency, and even, to an extent, of non-causative matters. However,\nthe main factor to consider is each party’s responsibility for the\ndamage. [emphasis added] 46     The\nterm “blameworthiness” is broad and it gives the court the flexibility\nto take into account a wide range of conduct to arrive at a just\nand equitable result in a myriad of situations (G H L Fridman,Torts(Waterlow Publishers, 1st Ed, 1990)\nat para 13-40). This inevitably necessitates a value judgment and,\nas rightly pointed out by the Judge, there are cases which demonstrate\nthat the courts will take fraud and dishonesty into account (Nationwide Building Society v Dunlop Haywards Ltd[2010]\n1 WLR 258 (“Nationwide Building Society”)\nandClydesdale Bank Plc v Workman[2014]\nPNLR 18 (“Clydesdale Bank”), both\ndiscussed in the Judgment at [230]). 47     In\npassing, we note that it is a well-established principle in contributory\nnegligence that blameworthiness is a relevant consideration in the\nreduction of damages (Stapley v Gypsum Mines\nLtd[1953] AC 663 at 682,perLord\nReid andDavies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) Ltd[1949]\n2 KB 291 at 326,perDenning LJ,\nboth approved inParno(see above\nat [13])). We see no reason why blameworthiness should not be a\nrelevant consideration under s 16 of the CLA as well when it is\naccepted as a relevant consideration in contributory negligence.\nIndeed, s 16 of the CLA and s 3 of the Contributory Negligence Act\nare conceptually similar in that both direct the court toapportiondamages between parties having\nregard to their responsibility to reach a just and equitable result.\nOf course, the two are concerned with different things. In contributory\nnegligence, damages are apportioned between claimant and defendant\nhaving regard to the fault of the claimant, whereas under s 16 of\nthe CLA, the apportionment is between the defendant and third parties\nhaving regard to their respective responsibility for the damage\nin question (Douglas Payne, “Reduction of Damages for Contributory\nNegligence” (1955) 18 Mod LR 344 at p 346; Spike Charlwood, “Contribution\nand professionals: an overview of the 1978 Act, alternatives to\nit, and its relationship with contributory negligence” (2007) 23(2)\nPN 82 at p 83). A court should therefore first determine the extent\nof the reduction in the damages to be awarded to the claimant by reference\nto the claimant’s contributory fault and then apportion the liability\nthat is found among the defendant(s) and third parties (seeFitzgerald v Lane and another[1989] AC\n328 at 339). We adopt that approach here. 48     In\nour judgment, the Judge ought to have ordered Cheng to bear a larger\nshare of the damages. We are conscious of the need to give due deference\nto the Judge’s exercise of discretion in apportioning liability.\nAs we recently said inGoh Sin Huat Electrical\nPte Ltd v Ho See Jui (trading as Xuanhua Art Gallery) and another[2012]\n3 SLR 1038, an appellate court should be slow to intervene in a\ntrial judge’s decision in apportioning liability, particularly where\n“the apportionment decision of the trial judge was supported by\ncogent reasons alluding to the interaction of the respective parties’\nindividual culpability in a myriad of identified causes from which\nthe damages flowed” (at [54]). It is clear from the Judgment that\nthe Judge did apply her mind to Cheng’s, the Defendants’ and Ng’s culpability\nin apportioning liability (the Judgment at [228]–[233]). But an appellate\ncourt is permitted to interfere with a trial judge’s decision in apportioning\nliability if the trial judge erred in principle (Capps\nv Miller[1989] 2 All ER 333;Holland\nHannen and Cubitts (Northern) Ltd v Welsh Health Technical Services\nOrganisation(1985) 35 BLR 1 at 18,perLawton LJ).\nWe are satisfied that the Judge, with respect, erred in principle\nhere in apportioning liability equally between Cheng (who acted\nfraudulently) on the one hand, and the Defendants and Ng (who acted\nnegligently) on the other hand. 49     In\nthis regard, we have considered the following two cases which demonstrate\nthat fraudulent parties should generally be made to bear more than\nan equal share of the damages payable, both of which were mentioned in\nthe Judgment, though the Judge did not appear to pay heed to the percentage\nof damages the fraudulent parties in those cases were made to bear\n(the Judgment at [230]): (a)     InNationwide Building Society(see above\nat [46]), the property was overvalued by a fraudulent employee of\nthe valuer. The plaintiff made two advances to a company based on\nthe valuation. The company later defaulted. The plaintiff sued the\nvaluer as well as the negligent solicitors who handled the advances.\nThe solicitors later brought a claim for contribution against the\nvaluer. Christopher Clarke J decided that it would be just and equitable\nto apportion liability 80:20 to the valuer, since “the moral blameworthiness\nof [the valuer] and the causative potency of the fraud of its [employee]”\nwere very much greater than that of the solicitors, whose “failing\nwas not to pick up on the fraudulent scheme rather than to play\nany part in it” (at [77]). (b)     Similarly\ninClydesdale Bank(see above at\n[46]), Mr Mark Pelling QC (sitting as a Deputy Judge of the English\nHigh Court) concluded that dishonesty was a relevant consideration\nin deciding a “just and equitable” apportionment. He therefore ordered\nthat the dishonest party bear 65% of the damages, and the negligent\nparty, the remaining 35% (at [97]–[99]). 50     In\nour judgment, Cheng should bear 65% of the overall liability for the\ndamages for which the Defendants are found responsible. His moral blameworthiness\nand the causative potency of his fraud were very much greater than\nthose of the Defendants and Ng, whose failing was in not picking\nup on Cheng’s fraud, rather than playing any part in perpetrating\nit. 51     As\nbetween the Defendants and Ng, we are satisfied that the Defendants\nshould bear the bulk of the remaining damages payable and will therefore\nnot increase the proportion of damages payable by Ng. Lim is a solicitor\nof close to 16 years’ standing, and has practised conveyancing law for\na considerable time. Yet, he fell well below the mark in discharging\nhis duties owed to the Plaintiffs. We do not propose to repeat the\nmultiple breaches of duty on his part as these have been dealt with\nby the Judge (the Judgment at [106]–[115]). However, we do wish\nto reiterate that the remaining leasehold on any property is a highly\nimportant piece of information to purchasers in conveyancing transactions;\nconveyancing solicitors are expected to keep their clients apprised\nof such information even if not specifically asked. Furthermore,\nin our judgment, when a solicitor is asked to represent the purchaser\nin the sale and purchase of a property, there will be a duty in\ngeneral to take proper instructions as to what the purchaser’s understanding\nof the deal that he wishes to enter into is. Had the question been\nasked by Lim or ALT in this case, and had Su omitted to mention\nthe representation in the light of such a question, a different\nresult might well have ensued. However, those are not the facts before\nus. 52     We\ntherefore apportion liability in the following manner: Cheng (65%),\nthe Defendants (30%) and Ng (5%). These ratios should apply in relation\nto the 85% liability that we have found having regard to Su’s contributory\nnegligence. The Judge valued Su’s loss in the sum of $308,436 (the\nJudgment at [154]). 85% of that sum amounts to $262,170.60, which\nis what Su and his family are entitled to. The sum of $262,170.60\nshall be borne by the Defendants and the Third Parties in the following\nmanner: Cheng ($179,410.89), the Defendants ($78,651.18) and Ng\n($13,108.53). 53     We\ndecline to order SGR Property to indemnify the Defendants in relation\nto Ng’s portion of damages payable. The Judge found at [226] of the\nJudgment that there was insufficient evidence to prove that SGR Property\nis Ng’s employer and we are not minded to interfere with this.",
        "Costs": "54     In\nthe light of the forgoing, we turn finally to the question of costs. We\ndeal with the costs of the matter below and the costs of these appeals\nin turn. Costs of the matter below 55     There\nare two aspects to the costs of the matter below. The first pertains\nto the Main Action. The Judge ordered that the Defendants should pay\nthe Plaintiffs’ costs of the Main Action without any contribution\nfrom the Third Parties. The Defendants take issue with this and\ncontend that the Third Parties ought to contribute to the Defendants\nfor a share of the costs payable by them to the Plaintiffs. We accept\nthe Defendants’ contention and order that the Third Parties should\ncontribute in the proportions in which we have apportioned the overall\nliability. Hence, Cheng should contribute towards 65% of the Plaintiffs’\ncosts for which the Defendants are liable and Ng should contribute\ntowards 5% of such costs. 56     The\nsecond aspect pertains to the third party proceedings. The Judge ordered\nthat the Defendants’ costs are to be paid in the proportionate share of\nthe contribution by Cheng and Ng. We generally agree with this approach,\nbut given our finding on what the respective contribution by each\nof the Third Parties should be, we order that the Defendants’ costs\nof the third party proceedings are to be borne by the Third Parties\non a standard basis in the proportion of 90% by Cheng and 10% by\nNg. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not disturb the Judge’s finding\nin relation to costs for the counterclaim (the Judgment at [236]). 57     Having\ndealt with the apportionment, we come now to quantum. The Defendants\nargued the amount of costs they should be paying to the Plaintiffs\nfor the Main Action ought to be reduced for two reasons. First, they\nsucceeded in their contention that the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to damages\nshould be reduced on account of contributory negligence. Second, a\nlarge part of the trial below was taken up with such issues as Su’s contention\nthat he had conveyed the fact of the representation to ALT, on which\nSu was ultimately unsuccessful. In our judgment, the Defendants’ contentions\nare valid. Taking a broad view on costs, we order that the Plaintiffs\nshould only be entitled to two-thirds of their costs for the Main Action\non a standard basis. Costs of the appeals 58     We\nturn finally to the costs of these appeals. In relation to CA 148/2014,\nCheng is to pay the Defendants’ costs. 59     In\nrelation to CA 152/2014, the Defendants who brought the appeal have\nsucceeded in part against the Plaintiffs (who were the first three respondents\nin the appeal) on the issue of contributory negligence. They have\nalso succeeded against Cheng on the question of apportionment of damages.\nHowever, they have not succeeded against Ng who appeared in person.\nWe accordingly hold that the Defendants are entitled to 50% of their\ncosts of the appeal, which shall be borne in equal shares as between\nthe Plaintiffs on the one hand and Cheng on the other hand. These\ncosts are to be taxed if not agreed.",
        "Conclusion": "60     We\naccordingly dismiss CA 148/2014 with the costs order noted above\nand with the usual consequential orders. We allow CA 152/2014 in part\nsimilarly with the costs order noted above and with the usual consequential\norders."
