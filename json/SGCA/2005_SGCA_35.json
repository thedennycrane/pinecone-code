        "Justification": "24        Was that characterisation of the appellant’s actions as obstructive, oppressive and irrational justified? When we examine the developments leading to the statement, we find that the appellant opposed the linkage on the ground that it might oblige him to make a general offer; or cause him to lose his veto power over special resolutions. 25        98 Holdings offered the whitewash proposal as a solution. Sanion’s immediate reaction was to label it a complicated last-minute effort. No real criticism can be made against that initial response, and the decision to adjourn the EGM for a week recognised that more time was needed for the proposal to be examined, clarified and discussed, and for the other unspecified concerns of Sanion to be considered. 26        Sanion and the appellant did not do anything to try to resolve the dispute. They did not initiate, respond to, or engage in any discussion on the whitewash proposal, and the appellant placed himself out of reach to all parties concerned by his absence. 27        At the trial, the parties took different approaches on the issue of rationality. The appellant focused his arguments on the rationality of the linkage of the resolutions, while the respondents directed their arguments to the rationality of the appellant’s opposition to the whitewash proposal. 28        We agreed with the latter approach. There was an active and continuing process of bids, counter-bids, proposals and responses during that period leading up to the EGM. When Mr David Ban called the appellant’s position irrational, he was not referring to the entire saga but was specifically referring to the developments on the whitewash proposal and the request to the appellant to disclose his other concerns. He only had to justify his statements regarding the appellant’s opposition which the appellant sued on. The rationality of the linkage of the proposals touched on another area of alleged irrationality which had no bearing on the rationality of the appellant’s opposition. 29        The issue should be examined against the background of a situation where a substantial minority shareholder, Sanion, was opposing a proposal, which opposition threatened to stop a dividend payment to all the shareholders of the company. Efforts were made to modify the proposal and to deal with the opposition to the proposals, and time was given for further consultations to take place between the interested parties. Instead of making use of the opportunity to clarify matters, the objector withdrew into silence, refusing to engage in any way with any of the interested parties. 30        The appellant’s conduct when so viewed, was obstructive, oppressive and irrational. He knew that he would scuttle the payment if he maintained his opposition to the proposals. While NatSteel and 98 Holdings were keen to work out a solution with him and the other shareholders were anxious to receive the special dividend, he rebuffed all efforts to seek a resolution. The defence of justification was made out.",
        "Qualified privilege": "31        Tay J set out the law in his judgment at [98] and [99]: The defence of qualified privilege accords a right to a person whose character or conduct has been attacked to answer such attack. Any defamatory statements he may make about the attacker will be privileged provided they are publishedbona fideand are fairly relevant to the accusations made. “The law justifies a man in repelling a libellous charge by a denial or an explanation. He has a qualified privilege to answer the charge; and if he does so in good faith, and what he published is fairly an answer, and is published for the purpose of repelling the charge, and not with malice, it is privileged, though it be false. Mere retaliation, which cannot be described as an answer or explanation, is not protected, but the defendant is not required to be diffident in protecting himself and is allowed a considerable degree of latitude in this respect”: seeGatley on Libel and Slander([94]supra) at para 14.49. The defence is also available where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it: seeAdam v Ward[1917] AC 309.The shareholders and the officers of a company have a common interest in the affairs of the company: seeGatley on Libel and Slanderat para 14.44. 32        He then referred to the facts at [100]: The issue as at 3 June 2003 was not so much the correctness of the linkage of the resolutions but whether Sanion would accept the whitewash solution as proposed or in a modified form. The 28 May 2003 EGM, at which Sanion’s proxy had criticised the linkage as irrational and unnecessary, was reported in the newspapers. Although the EGM was meant to be a closed-door matter, the proceedings had become very public. SIAS had issued a statement to Catherine Ong rehashing the issues debated on at the said EGM and that statement was going to be published in the BT article of 4 June 2003. The SIAS statement attacked the board of directors of NatSteel in public by stating that the minority shareholders were outraged by the board’s failure to keep its promise of paying the remaining 55 cents in dividend. It must not be forgotten that the said attacks took place as part of an ongoing debate. David Ban, as chairman of the executive committee and a director of NatSteel, was entitled to respond to the attack, even if he was of the view that it was inspired by dramatic showmanship, by explaining why the shareholders’ outrage ought to be directed at the plaintiff rather than the board. and found, at [102]: As NatSteel is a listed company, the public, in particular the shareholders, had an interest in its corporate governance. The defendant had a duty to respond to the criticism levelled against the board (with him as a director and the chairman of its executive committee) and the public, in particular the shareholders, had a corresponding interest in his response. The defence of qualified privilege therefore succeeds, unless malice is proved. 33        The response must be proportionate to the attack. Excessive replies made after the attack has already been answered, or as Steytler J put it inHeytesbury Holdings Pty Ltd v City of Subiaco(1998) 19 WAR 440 at 462, a statement which is “merely a further shot in the battle” which adds nothing to the answer given, will not be protected by qualified privilege. 34        The appellant argued that Mr David Ban’s response of 3 June 2003 went beyond an answer because answers were already made and publicised, which rebutted the charge that the linkage was irrational. This argument was misdirected. It is correct that the criticisms of the resolutions had been answered. However, those were not the answers for which qualified privilege was pleaded. Qualified privilege was pleaded for Mr David Ban’s response that the appellant’s opposition to the whitewash resolution was irrational. 35        The statement on the appellant’s rationality was not made before the interview with Ms Catherine Ong on 3 June 2003. When it was made, it was made for the first time, and it would enjoy qualified privilege if it was not made with malice. 36        The defence usually arises when a party makes a response to an attack. In exceptional cases where it is necessary in the reply to bring in a third party’s name in explanation, the publication will be privileged – seeGatley on Libel and Slander(Sweet & Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2004) at para 14.63.If A accuses B of negligence that caused a building to collapse, and B’s response is that the omissions of C caused the collapse, B can raise the defence against C. 37        In the present context, the defence may be available to Mr David Ban if he needed to refer to the appellant’s conduct in responding to SIAS’s statement. The SIAS statement was paraphrased in Ms Catherine Ong’s article set out in [14] herein. SIAS disapproved of the resolutions on the basis that having promised to pay dividends of $1 a share, NatSteel should keep the promise without imposing the linkage to the scrip dividend proposal. 38        The complaint was that NatSteel was going back on its words. When Mr David Ban said that the appellant was being irrational, obstructive and oppressive, that had nothing to do with SIAS’s attack, and he was not replying to it.  We found that Mr David Ban’s statement was a reply to Mr Bobby Chow’s criticisms of the whitewash resolution, but it could not be regarded as a response to the SIAS statement. 39        However, the response must be proportionate to the attack in another way. When the attack is made in one forum, the response should be targeted at the same forum. As Mr Bobby Chow’s criticisms were made at a company EGM, the response should be circulated to the parties at the EGM and to other parties reasonably expected to have learnt of the attack. When Mr David Ban’s response was published in BT for all the readers to see, that exceeded the test of proportionality, and he could not claim qualified privilege for his right of reply. 40        Qualified privilege also arises, as explained by Tay J in [99] of his judgment, to a statement made by a party with an interest or duty to make it. 41        The privilege applies to communications between parties who have “a duty, legal, social or moral, to persons who had a corresponding duty or interest to receive it” –perStephenson LJ inBlackshaw v Lord[1984] QB 1at 26. While the shareholders of NatSteel have the necessary interest, it cannot be said that all BT readers have the same interest. Although the NatSteel takeover battle was a matter of public interest, “[i]t is not enough that the publication should be of general interest to the public. The public must have a legitimate interest in receiving the information contained in it, and there must be a correlative duty in the publisher to publish” –perDunn LJ inBlackshaw v Lordat 35. 42        When Mr David Ban’s views were published in BT, he was expressing his views to parties who did not have the requisite duty or interest to receive them, the publication exceeded his right of reply, and he could not claim qualified privilege.",
        "Fair comment": "43        A plea of fair comment will succeed if: (a)        the words complained of are comments, although they may consist of or include inferences of facts; (b)        the comment is on a matter of public interest; (c)        the comment is based on facts; and (d)        the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved. SeeChen Cheng v Central Christian Church(“Chen Cheng”)[1999] 1 SLR 94at [33]. 44        The first element is the most important one to establish because statements of fact are not protected. While there are statements which can be clearly characterised as either statements of fact or comments, the distinction is not always easy to make; and (at [35] ofChen Cheng): At the end of the day much depends on how the defamatory statement is expressed, the context in which it is set out and the content of the entire article or passage in question. One should adopt a common sense approach and consider how the statement would strike the ordinary reasonable reader, ie whether it would be recognizable by the ordinary reader as a comment or a statement of fact. 45        The appellant argued that Mr David Ban’s statements were out-and-out factual allegations, or were so mixed up with the facts that the reasonable reader would not be able to recognise the comments from the assertions of fact. We did not accept that. 46        A reasonable reader of the BT article would understand it to reflect Mr David Ban’s thoughts and reaction to the appellant’s actions. He would note that Mr David Ban thought unfavourably of the appellant’s actions, but he would read those words as comments rather than statements of facts. 47        The other three elements presented no difficulties. The takeover of NatSteel was a matter of public interest. The comments were based on the developing controversy over the dividend payment, the linkage and whitewash proposal and the appellant’s responses, and a fair-minded person could have shared Mr David Ban’s exasperation with the appellant. 48        The elements of fair comment having been made out, the defence would succeed unless the appellant could prove that Mr David Ban did not believe in the statements he made: seeChen Chengat [52].",
        "Malice": "49        Even when the requisite elements of qualified privilege and fair comment are established, these defences will fail if a statement was made with malice. 50        This court has hitherto assumed that the test for malice in qualified privilege and fair comment is the same, seeJeyaretnam JB v Goh Chok Tong[1984–1985] SLR 516 at 528, [36] andNirumalan K Pillay v A Balakrishnan[1997] 3 SLR 25at [32]. 51        That assumption was examined by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal inCheng Albert v Tse Wai Chun Paul[2000] 4 HKC 1.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at 17 noted that the purposes for which the law had accorded the defence of qualified privilege and the defence of fair comment were not the same in that while: ... The rationale of the defence of qualified privilege is the law’s recognition that there are circumstances when there is a need, in the public interest, for a particular recipient to receive frank and uninhibited communication of particular information from a particular source … The rationale of the defence of fair comment is different, and is different in a material respect. It is not based on any notion of performance of a duty or protection of an interest. As already noted, its basis is the high importance of protecting and promoting the freedom of comment by everyone at all times on matters of public interest, irrespective of their particular motives. therefore (at 22): [A] comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not genuinely hold the view he expressed. Honesty of belief is the touchstone. Actuation by spite, animosity, intent to injure, intent to arouse controversy or other motivation, whatever it may be, even if it is the dominant or sole motive, does notof itselfdefeat the defence. However, proof of such motivation may be evidence, sometimes compelling evidence, from which lack of genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred. Proof of motivation may also be relevant on other issues in the action, such as damages. [emphasis in original] 52        There is much force in Lord Nicholls’ reasoning. When a person pleads fair comment as his defence, he is not claiming that he was driven by duty to speak out. He is exerting his right to express his views on a matter of public interest even though he is under no duty to do so. Public policy gives him the right to state his views on such matters. The defence will only hold up if he honestly believes in the views he expresses, as no one has the right to make defamatory comments on matters of public interest that he himself does not believe in. 53        InJeyasegaram David([16]supra), this court held that it was not necessary to decide whether the test for malice was the same for qualified privilege and fair comment. In that case, the issue was not fully dealt with as Mr David Ban did not enter his defence at the trial, and was not examined on the issue of his malice. In the present case, he gave evidence in his defence, and the issue was raised in examination. In the circumstances, it was appropriate to deal with the issue, and we agreed with Lord Nicholls’ exposition. 54        The appellant contended that Mr David Ban did not make the statements honestly because: (a)        he knew that the linkage in the resolutions was unnecessary and irrational and that it was designed to dilute [the appellant’s] shareholding in NatSteel; (b)        he knew that the NatSteel board had sought to conceal the linkage from the company’s shareholders; (c)        he knew that the whitewash proposal had failed to resolve the problems created by the linkage; and (d)        he resented [the appellant] for forcing 98 Holdings to pay considerably more than it had intended to secure a controlling interest in NatSteel. 55        The appellant was entitled to look at all the circumstances relating to the takeover fight for proof of Mr David Ban’s good faith or the lack of it. There is no doubt that Mr David Ban did not think well of the appellant’s entry into the takeover contest and of his objection to the dividend proposals. 56        However, it does not follow that when one person is ill-disposed towards another, whatever he says about the other person does not reflect his honest belief, or is infected with malice. It was still necessary for the appellant to show that the impugned words were not spoken honestly, but were actuated by malice. In making a finding on the issue, the unhappiness towards the other person is a factor to be taken into account, but only in conjunction with all other relevant facts. 57        We have found that when Mr David Ban was interviewed by Ms Catherine Ong on the eve of the reconvening of the adjourned EGM and called the appellant’s conduct obstructive and irrational, his words were justified as a response to the charge that the proposed resolutions were irrational. It could not be said that he was acting out of malice or that he did not believe what he said. 58        The appellant also complained that Ms Catherine Ong’s authorship of the article was infected with malice because the appellant had accused her and her employers of defamation in two earlier articles she had written in BT for which he obtained a published apology as well as $20,000 damages and costs. 59        Ms Catherine Ong’s situation was not unlike Mr David Ban’s situation. She might be upset by those events and might not regard the appellant with fondness. But that did not mean that whatever she wrote of him was infected with ill will. Their past run-in would be a factor to be taken into account with all the other facts. 60        Ms Catherine Ong had been covering and reporting the takeover of NatSteel from the start. An important milestone was to be reached on 4 June 2003. The shareholders were to vote to accept or reject the payment-by-scrip and whitewash resolutions. It was reasonable and natural for her to report on the positions of the principal players on the eve of the meeting. The appellant was not accessible, so she spoke to Mr David Ban for an update on the progress since the adjournment the previous week. She then went on to report Mr David Ban’s views on the appellant’s actions. 61        She was doing what any journalist would have done. We did not see any evidence that Ms Catherine Ong wrote the article out of malice.",
        "Vicarious liability": "62        This was not a critical issue as there can be no vicarious liability without primary liability. As the parties took different positions on this, we will deal with the issue whether Mr David Ban was speaking as a director of 98 Holdings when he made his statements. 63        When the scrip dividend proposal was made by NatSteel, 98 Holdings supported it, and NatSteel in turn supported the whitewash proposal put forward by 98 Holdings. 64        When Mr David Ban gave the interview, he spoke in support of the proposals and he expressed his disapproval of the appellant’s opposition. He did not specify, and indeed, he did not have to specify, whether he was speaking as a director of 98 Holdings or NatSteel, or both. It is unlikely that if he had addressed his mind to the issue, he would have prefaced his comments with “Speaking on behalf of 98 Holdings” or “Speaking on behalf of NatSteel” because there was no need for the distinction to be drawn – what he said reflected the positions of both the companies he was director of. 65        We could not agree with his defence that he was speaking on behalf of NatSteel but not of 98 Holdings, but ultimately nothing turned on this in view of our findings on justification and fair comment. 66        As the appellant was unable to show that the trial judge’s judgment should be disturbed, the appeal was dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed."
