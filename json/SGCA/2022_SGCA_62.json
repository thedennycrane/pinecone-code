        "Introduction": "1 This appeal, which arises from the decision of the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) inRatan Kumar Rai v Seah Hock Thiam and others[2021] SGHC 276 (the “Judgment”), raises an interesting question as to whether and when a director may owe concurrent fiduciary duties both to a third partyandhis principal company. Through the factual lens of this dispute, this judgment will examine a situation in which such duties may legally co-exist and how they may be reconciled. 2 This question of interest arises from the main matter which forms the subject of this appeal, that is, HC/S 160/2019 (“Suit 160”). In the court below, the Judge found, largely, in favour of the plaintiff, and this judgment deals with the appeal of the second defendant against that decision. There is a separate but connected application which this appeal also concerns, HC/SUM 2708/2021 (“SUM 2708”). We will first address the appeal in respect of the decision in Suit 160 before turning to deal with the appeal in relation to SUM 2708 at [105] below.",
        "The appeal in respect of Suit 160": "",
        "The parties’ dispute": "3 The thrust of the plaintiff’s case below was relatively straightforward; to the extent there were complexities, they arose chiefly from the need for careful characterisation of the roles played by the various actors involved in the case. Essentially, the plaintiff claimed to have participated in an investment venture over which the first and second defendants had oversight and control; the third defendant was said to be the corporate vehicle of the venture. The nature of the first and second defendant’s oversight and control was argued to have given rise to fiduciary obligations, which the plaintiff sought to enforce by orders to account. The plaintiff also made allegations of wilful default with a view to obtaining more onerous orders to account on the basis of wilful default. The third defendant was absent from the trial, and the first and second defendants denied the truth of the underlying averments which formed the foundation of the plaintiff’s claim that fiduciary obligations arose. 4 The Judgment comprehensively set out the cases advanced by the parties below, and ably addressed the many factual issues to which those conflicting cases gave rise. As such, it is not in our view necessary to repeat them. Instead, we will provide an abridged overview of the dispute with a view to focussing on the most crucial disputes of fact which need to be resolved in this appeal. This overview will progress in four parts, chronologically. Part 1: The basic relationship between the parties 5 Our starting point is the basic narrative advanced by the plaintiff, Ratan Kumar Rai (“Mr Rai”). The Judgment sets out Mr Rai’s case in detail at [30]–[42]. Mr Rai claimed that around 2010 or 2011, he, the first defendant, Seah Hock Thiam (“Mr Seah”) and one Seah Chong Hwee (“Mr SCH”) began discussing the possibility of jointly investing in Cambodian real property following several trips there to examine potential sites (see the Judgment at [70]). The second defendant, Tan Teck Kee (“Mr Tan”), who was based in Cambodia in connection with various businesses owned by Mr Seah (see the Judgment at [69]), was also a party to these discussions. It needs to be noted that these four men were close friends (see the Judgment at [2] and [68]), and according to Mr Rai, it was in the context of their close friendship that they started discussing this potential joint investment (see the Judgment at [30]). 6 These discussions, according to Mr Rai, culminated in a meeting (the “First Meeting”) at which he, Mr Seah and Mr SCH orally agreed to pursue the joint investment to purchase some plots of Cambodian land (the “Venture”). At this juncture, the plan underlying the Venture was simply to purchase land in Cambodia and flip it for a profit when it appreciated in value. Mr Tan was also present at the First Meeting, though he did not agree to participate in the Venture as an investor as he lacked capital. However, it was not the case that he had no role in the Venture, as we will explain below. 7 In his pleadings, Mr Rai labelled the oral agreement reached at the First Meeting in respect of the Venture as the “Oral Understanding” (see the Judgment at [32]). The existence and content of this Oral Understanding lay at the heart of the dispute in the court below. On Mr Rai’s case, the parties to the Oral Understanding – namely, Mr Rai, Mr Seah and Mr SCH – agreed that Mr Seah would act as the “custodian” of the investment funds for the Venture (see the Judgment at [33]). As “custodian”, he was said to have undertakendirectly to the other investorsin the Venture, the obligation to oversee the funds, monitor expenses, sales receipts, and distribute profits made from the Venture, amongst other things (the list of obligations pleaded by Mr Rai is set out in the Judgment at [86] and [88]). Mr Seah, however, did not have to perform these tasks alone. On Mr Rai’s case, he and Mr SCH agreed that Mr Seah could engage Mr Tan to “assist” him in the performance of such duties. In exchange, Mr Seah and Mr Tan would be entitled to share in 10% of the profits as their management fee. 8 However, regardless of what these four men allegedly agreed on, it was not in dispute that they could only give effect to this Oral Understandingviaa Cambodian company. This was because Cambodian law precluded foreigners from owning land in Cambodia. Only citizens or companies incorporated in Cambodia with at least 51% of their shares held by a Cambodian national were allowed to do so. “Everyone” was aware of this restriction, even before the First Meeting (see the Judgment at [71]). Therefore, to get around this restriction, Mr Rai claimed that, shortly after the First Meeting, he, Mr Seah and Mr SCH met with one Oknha Rithy Sear (“Mr Rithy”) (the “Second Meeting”) to discuss his potential involvement. Mr Rithy was a Cambodian businessman whom they had met through a mutual friend during their visits to Cambodia to view the plots of land, the purchase of which they were considering. 9 At the Second Meeting, they discussed the Venture, and, on Mr Rai’s case, Mr Rithy agreed to join them not only as an investor, but also as one of the individuals (alongside Mr Seah and Mr Tan) liable to render “true and full” accounts to the other investors, and who was also entitled to share in the 10% management fee mentioned above. Their plan, Mr Rai claimed, was to make the acquisitions using a Cambodian company in which Mr Rithy was to hold the bare majority of shares (ie, 51%), and Mr Tan was to hold the balance. The Cambodian company ultimately used for this plan was the third defendant in Suit 160, Worldbridgeland (Cambodia) Co Ltd (“WBL”). Upon incorporation, Mr Rithy and Mr Tan were WBL’s only two directors, and they remained so throughout the period with which Suit 160 was concerned. Mr Rithy and Mr Tan held, respectively, 51% and 49% of WBL’s shares, and these represented around US$5,000 in capitalisation. 10 Whilst we are on WBL, it is useful to highlight that a point of some inferential significance is its incorporation date of 25 May 2011, prior to the First Meeting. Since the company existed at this time, an important question which arises in connection with the First Meeting – given that its participants were aware of the land-ownership restrictions imposed by Cambodian law – is whether WBL wasspecificallyidentified as the corporate vehicle for the Venture at that meeting. Mr Rai’s evidence was that WBL did not come into the picture untilafterthe Oral Understanding was concluded. He claimed that no company in particular had been identified at the time of the Oral Understanding, and that it was only thereafter that Mr Tan said that WBL would be the company used to make the land purchases. If true, this might lend support to Mr Rai’s claim that the Venture was informally driven by the close relationship between the participants; indeed, to the extent that they were not even concerned about the particular vehicle to be used. However, there is no written evidence of the fact of the First Meeting, much less its contents. So, the answer to this question remains, ultimately, an inferential one to which we will return at [50] below. 11 There was no dispute that the plots of Cambodian land ultimately purchased were acquired in the name of WBL with the funds of Mr Rai and other investors. However, Mr Seah and Mr Tan wholly denied the existence of the Oral Understanding or anything equivalent to such an oral agreement. They asserted, to the contrary, that the Oral Understanding – as well as the First and Second Meetings – were complete fabrications by Mr Rai. They instead relied on the fact that WBL was incorporated on 25 May 2011 and averred that it had been established by Mr Tan and Mr Rithy as a real estate investment company. In this connection, in fulfilment of its commercial purpose, they claimed that WBL was the actual entity which identified the opportunities to invest in Plots A and B, and had solicited the investors’ contributions to finance these acquisitions (see the Judgment at [31]). Therefore, Mr Seah and Mr Tan pleaded that all investors (including Mr Rai) only had a contractual relationship with WBL, against which their causes of action lay. No cause of action, they claimed, could lie against them personally because there was simply no Oral Understanding. 12 It is evident from the above that the case put forth by Mr Seah and Mr Tan was fundamentally opposed to that of Mr Rai. Therefore, the primary issue which needed to be decided in order to resolve the dispute, waswhoseaccount ought to be believed. That is, was the investment initiated pursuant to the Oral Understanding which placed Mr Seah and Mr Tan personally at the helm of the Venture; or, was it initiated by WBL? The answer would ultimately depend on the assessment of the undisputed and objective facts. It is to these undisputed and objective facts which we now turn as we describe how the Venture panned out. Part 2: How the Venture panned out 13 Shortly after the Second Meeting, on 10 October 2011, WBL entered into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase a 7,000m2 plot in Phnom Penh for US$11,854,100 (“Plot A”). The particulars of this purchase are set out in the Judgment at [7]–[10] and we need not restate them here. We will only highlight four salient points. First, in addition to the persons present at the First and Second Meetings, there were three others who contributed to the purchase of Plot A: Lee Eng Ngee (“Mr LEN”), Tan Loo Lee (“Mr TLL”) and Lee Teck Leng (“Mr LTL”). Mr Seah admits that these three men were his “business partners”, but the evidence of Mr TLL and Mr LTL (Mr LEN did not give evidence) suggests that their relationship with Mr Seah (and that of Mr LEN) was more akin to that of close friends. That said, it is not unequivocally clear that Mr Seah was the one who invited them to invest in the Venture. Mr TLL gave evidence that he heard about the opportunity from Mr LEN, who could have been told of the opportunity by Mr Seah. Mr LTL’s evidence was that he came to know about the Venture from Mr Seah. The latter’s evidence clearly supports Mr Rai’s claim, but what is more pertinent to highlight is that neither Mr TLL nor Mr LTL gave evidence that they had learnt of the Venture from WBL directly. The importance of this point should be clear in light of the fundamentally opposing cases of the parties. 14 Returning then to the remaining three salient points in respect of the purchase of Plot A: the second is that Mr Rai’s contribution was a significant sum of US$1,904,000. The third is that, part of this sum, amounting to US$974,000 was transferred by Mr Rai to Esun International Pte Ltd (“Esun”), a company controlled by Mr Seah (see the Judgment at [10]) rather than to WBL directly. Esun sent the money to Mr Tan’s personal bank account, and it was then used to complete the purchase. The last is that, not long after the purchase of Plot A, Mr Tan issued a document to the contributing investors on 1 December 2011. This document was not issued on WBL’s letterhead and was simply titled “Cambodian Investment Funds”. It recorded the contributions of each investor, and, more importantly, included the following two terms (the full document is set out in the Judgment at [11]): 2. The decision on investment opportunities and the amount of investments for each projects [sic]will be solely decided by [Mr Tan]… director of [WBL], the company handling these funds. 3. To protect the interests of all subscribers, these funds will be logged in for a minimum period of two years. At the maturity of the investment funds,10% of the net profit(after deducting all cost and tax)will be paid to the director,[Mr Tan]as the director fees. [emphasis added] 15 The next milestone in the Venture took place on 29 March 2012. On this date, WBL entered into another sale and purchase agreement to purchase a further 3,000m2 plot adjacent to Plot A (“Plot B”). The price of Plot B was US$5,424,700 and although the group of investors who contributed to the purchase of Plot B differed from that in respect of Plot A (see the Judgment at [12]–[15]), Mr Rai remained a substantial contributor. He paid US$3,490,252 towards the purchase price of Plot B, all of which was transferred to Mr Tan’s personal bank account instead of to WBL’s bank account. Nothing equivalent to the “Cambodian Investment Funds” document was issued to the contributors following this second acquisition. 16 The final milestone of the Venture took place sometime between late 2012 and early 2013. By this time, Plots A and B had appreciated substantially in value. The investors determined that it would be more profitable for them to develop rather than to sell the land. After meetings with potential land developers and subsequent negotiations, a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) was entered between WBL and Oxley Holdings Limited (“Oxley Holdings”) – a company listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange – to construct a 45-storey twin tower, mixed-use development called “The Bridge” on Plots A and B. The JVA was signed on 15 July 2013. 17 Mr Seah and Mr Tan did not adduce any objective evidence of communications from WBL seeking the investors’ consent to enter into the JVA (see the Judgment at [80]). Instead, Mr TLL testified to the effect that it was Mr Tan, acting in his capacity as a director of WBL, who had sought his consent. Mr LTL testified that Mr Seah was the one wholikelyinformed him about the JVA and conveyed the opportunity to exit the Venture, though he was unable to recall this as a fact. Although neither account was supported by contemporaneous or objective evidence, one would expect Mr TLL’s account, if correct, to be supported by objective, written correspondence emanating from WBL. On the other hand, given that Mr LTL’s account was premised on informality, the absence of written documentation was not unexpected. 18 In any event, whatever the circumstances under which it came to be drafted and executed, the JVA provided that the vehicle of the joint venture was another Cambodian company called Oxley Diamond (Cambodia) Co Ltd (“Oxley Diamond”). WBL and Oxley Holdings each held 50% of the shares in Oxley Diamond; Mr Tan and Mr Rithy were appointed to Oxley Diamond’s board as WBL’s nominees, and the Chief Executive Officer of Oxley Holdings, Ching Chiat Kwong (“Mr Ching”) was its nominee on Oxley Diamond’s board (see the Judgment at [16]–[17]). The JVA provided that WBL and Oxley Holdings would each contribute an initial sum of US$35 million to the development of The Bridge, this sum being the valuation of Plots A and B agreed upon by the parties. Therefore, to put the JVA simply, WBL was to contribute US$35 million in land, and Oxley Holdings was to pay for the development costs up to the same value. 19 After the JVA was signed, nothing of particular significance took place until 31 December 2013. On or around this date, Mr Tan sent a document bearing WBL’s letterhead to the investors who remained invested in the Venture after the JVA was signed. This document, titled “Investment Agreement for ‘The Bridge’” (the “Investment Agreement”), recorded each investor’s contribution to the Venture (ie, the sums they each contributed to the purchase of Plots A and B) and, thus, their share of the profits which WBL stood to earn from the JVA. Mr Rai’s total contribution was recorded as US$5,394,252 and this entitled him to a share of 31.2% of the profits (see the Judgment at [99]). Three further points about this document, are also worth noting. 20 First, the Investment Agreement states that WBL entered into the JVA “with the consent of all the subscribers to this fund” (see the Judgment at [19]). This statement pulls into even sharper focus the curioustotalabsence of objective evidence demonstrating that formal requests for investors’ consent had in fact emanated from WBL (see [17] above). Second, the Investment Agreement also provided that 10% of the net profit would be paid toWBLas management fees, “after deducting all costs and tax” (see the Judgment at [19] and [97]). This contradicts the terms of the “Cambodian Investment Funds” document which provided thatMrTanwas the one entitled to 10% of the profits as his “director fees” (see [14] above). Third, after 15 July but before 31 December 2013, the investors in the Venture were not issued any formal written document recording their interest in the profits which WBL stood to earn from the JVA. On Mr Rai’s case, he was the one who asked for this document because he was critically ill at that time and he wanted to ensure that his wife would be able to handle his affairs should something untoward happen to him. Mr Tan’s version of events is that he procured the Investment Agreement to ensure that, should anything happen to him (ie, Mr Tan), the investors would be able to prove the extent of their investments (see the Judgment at [80]). It is pertinent to note that, on either account, the Investment Agreement was not a document created contemporaneously to capture ongoing changes in the investors’ positionvis-à-visthe Venture. Instead, it was a retrospective document aimed at formalising the informal understanding of the Venture among the parties. Therefore, even if Mr Tan’s account is preferred, it is not entirely clear how it supports his and Mr Seah’s claim that the Venture was WBL-led. 21 The foregoing paragraphs adequately capture how the Venture broadly panned out. Thus, we turn next to the third segment of the parties’ dispute. This concerns the period after the Venture had become profitable and when profit distributions started to be made to (or withheld from) the investors. In particular, we are concerned with: (a) four payments made to Mr Rai, the first of which he received in 2015 and the balance three in 2018 (see the Judgment at [24]); and (b) US$35 million which WBL received from Oxley Diamond as dividends under the JVA, in respect of which no distribution has, to-date, been made to the investors. In respect of (a), Mr Rai also alleged that Mr Tan had made wrongful deductions prior to issuing the distributions. Part 3: Distributions made and withheld by WBL; deductions 22 In July 2015, WBL and Oxley Holdings agreed to amend the JVA to account for the latter’s reduced contribution from US$35 million to US$20 million as the land development costs were lower than initially estimated. As a consequence, WBL’s contribution to the joint venture outvalued that of Oxley Holdings by US$15 million. Accordingly, it was agreed that Oxley Holdings would reimburse WBL to the tune of US$15 million, which it did on 17 July 2015. WBL, in turn, apportioned this US$15 million amongst the remaining investors in the Venture on or around 11 August 2015. For his 31.2% share in the Venture, Mr Rai received the sum of US$4,672,009 (the “First Payout”) (see the Judgment at [22] and [24(a)]). With respect to the First Payout, no wrongful deduction has been alleged by Mr Rai (see the Judgment at [115]). 23 From the date of the First Payout until January 2018, nothing of interest occurred in relation to dividends from Oxley Diamond and payment to the investors. On 17 January 2018, Mr Tan informed Mr Rai that WBL would be receiving dividends from Oxley Diamond pursuant to the JVA, and that these funds would be distributed to the investors once received. On 27 March 2018, Mr Tan confirmed that US$10 million had been received from Oxley Diamond, and that Mr Rai would receive $2,840,892 (converted from US to Singapore dollars at the rate of US$1 is to S$1.30) for his 31.2% share,afterdeductions. On 2 April 2018, two cheques amounting to $2,840,000 were issued to Mr Rai by Mr Seah (see the Judgment at [24(b)]) (the “Second Payout”). 24 Before turning to the next payout, we should state that it was Mr Rai’s case that two improper deductions were made by Mr Tan from the dividends before the Second Payout. The first was the deduction of 20% allegedly made on account of capital gains tax. Mr Rai contends no capital gains tax was payable at the time. The second was a deduction of 15% for withholding tax when the correct deduction would have been of 14%. At the trial, Mr Rai called Vanessa Sok (“Ms Sok”), a Cambodian lawyer, as his expert witness. She confirmed that WBL did not need to pay capital gains tax at the material time, and that the applicable withholding tax rate was 14% (see the Judgment at [116]–[117] and [119]–[120]). Mr Seah and Mr Tan’s Cambodian law expert was not asked to provide his opinion on these issues (see the Judgment at [115]). There was thus no serious dispute that Ms Sok’s opinion was accurate. 25 Following communications between Mr Tan and Mr Rai in June 2018, Mr Rai was informed that WBL would be receiving further dividends of US$10 million from Oxley Diamond. For his 31.2% interest in the Venture, Mr Rai received a cheque for the sum of S$2,539,555 on 12 June 2018 (the “Third Payout”). The cheque for this sum was, again, issued by Mr Seah and not by WBL. In respect of the Third Payout, like the Second Payout, Mr Rai claimed that Mr Tan had wrongfully deducted capital gains tax and excessive withholding tax (see the Judgment at [116] and [119]). Further, even though the dividends received from Oxley Diamond in respect of the Second and Third Payouts were the same (ie, US$10 million), we note that the sums actually paid to Mr Rai on the two occasions were curiously different. 26 Finally, on 17 October 2018, Mr Tan informed Mr Rai that there would be a further distribution of US$10 million. On 15 November 2018, Mr Tan sent a further message to inform Mr Rai that the total amount, after deductions, would be US$7,650,000, and that Mr Rai would be receiving US$2,368,800 for his 31.2% share. Four days later, Mr Rai received a cheque for this sum and again, the payment was from Mr Seah (the “Fourth Payout”). In respect of the Fourth Payout, Mr Rai only claimed that Mr Tan had wrongfully deducted excessive withholding tax; unlike the Second and Third Payouts, he did not allege that there was wrongful deduction for capital gains tax (see the Judgment at [116] and [119]). 27 At the trial, Mr Tan explained that the calculations for the deductions were carried out by the staff of WBL, and not by him personally, though he did not adduce any written documentation to evidence such calculations. Under cross-examination, he accounted for the lack of written evidence with the explanation that the calculations were conveyed to him verbally at a meeting. However, Mr Tan subsequently changed his evidence under cross-examination and claimed that the staff of WBL had given him a thumb drive containing the calculations, which he had subsequently lost. Mr Tan did not, however, attempt to obtain a duplicate copy of these calculations. He claimed that there was simply no reason for him to doubt the correctness of the calculations prepared by WBL’s staff (see the Judgment at [122]–[123]). Of course, whether it was reasonable for Mr Tan to have taken this course depends on a variety of considerations. Even so, however, it should be noted that a specific discovery order compelling him to disclose his correspondence with WBL’s finance staff was made on 5 July 2021, three weeks before the start of the trial. By this stage of the proceedings, it was clear that Mr Rai had made allegations of wrongful deductions against Mr Tan. Yet, no explanation was proffered by Mr Tan as to why he did not take basic steps to answer these allegations. 28 Finally, we turn to the last important facet of the case in relation to the payouts. There is no dispute that, between April 2018 and August 2019, WBL received a further sum of US$35 million from Oxley Diamond which was retained without consulting the investors, including Mr Rai (see the Judgment at [125] and [129]). In fact, Mr Rai and the other investors were not even informed that this large sum had been received by WBL. It was only by way of a subpoena for documents served on Mr Ching that this came to be discovered by Mr Rai on the second day of the trial (see the Judgment at [125]). 29 When questioned about WBL’s receipt of these dividends from Oxley Diamond, Mr Tan asserted that WBL – and, by extension, he (as a director of WBL at the time) – did not owe any duty of disclosure to the investors (see the Judgment at [127]). Further, such money had to be retained by WBL because itmaybe required for a “guaranteed rental scheme” (“GRR Scheme”) promised by Oxley Diamond to purchasers of units in The Bridge. By this scheme, potential purchasers were allegedly incentivised to buy units in The Bridge because they were guaranteed rental earnings for a specified duration (see the Judgment at [130]). In due course, we will turn to the appropriate inferences to be drawn from these explanations. Nevertheless, it bears highlighting at this point: (a) that the latter explanation was maintained despite Mr Tan conceding that Oxley Diamond did not actually impose any conditions on the use of the US$35 million which was distributed to WBL (see the Judgment at [131]); and (b) the assertion that such funds needed to be retained for the GRR Scheme was not pleaded. Part 4: Commencement of Suit 160 30 Whatever one makes of the foregoing events, what is plainly evident is that the Venture was successful. Indeed, on 29 April 2018, Oxley Holdings issued a press release which reported that sales from The Bridge had garnered a “gross profit of S$140.8 million with a gross profit margin of 38%”. This came to the attention of Mr Rai, who claimed that he turned to Mr Seah and Mr Tan for more information. No record of these requests exists and Mr Rai’s explanation for this was that they were made orally, in person. In any case, Mr Rai claimed that the information was not forthcoming from them, and so, on 4 February 2019, he commenced Suit 160 against them for an account. WBL was added as a third defendant on 4 December 2019, but, as stated at [3] above, it did not participate in the trial.",
        "The decision below": "112 In respect of the first and second declarations sought by SUM 2708, the Judge undertook an analysis of s 6(2) of the AJPA: Contempt by corporations 6.—(2) Where a corporation commits contempt of court under this Act, a person — (a) who is — (i) an officer of the corporation, or a member of a corporation whose affairs are managed by its members; or (ii) an individual who is involved in the management of the corporation and is in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to the commission of the contempt of court; and (b) who — (i) consented or connived, or conspired with others, to effect the commission of the contempt of court; (ii) is in any other way, whether by act or omission, knowingly concerned in, or is party to, the commission of the contempt of court by the corporation; or (iii) knew or ought reasonably to have known that the contempt of court by the corporation (or contempt of court of the same type) would be or is being committed, and failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of that contempt of court, shall be guilty of the same contempt of court as is the corporation, and shall be liable on being found guilty of contempt of court to be punished accordingly. 113 Upon her analysis of this provision, the Judge determined that aprima faciecase of contempt had been made out against Mr Tan. For reasons which we shall not repeat (see the Judgment at [145]–[154]), she made two crucial findings in arriving at this view. First, s 6(2)(a) was satisfied on either limb (i) or (ii); that is, WBL was either a “corporation whose affairs are managed by its members”, or, in any case, that Mr Tan was “involved in the management” of WBL and was “in a position” to influence its conduct. Second, she was satisfied that limb (iii) of s 6(2)(b) was made out because the facts showed that Mr Tan knew about the contempt by WBL and yet he did not take any steps to prevent or stop such contempt (see the Judgment at [155]–[156]). In light of her decision, she declined to grant either the first or second declarations sought by SUM 2708. 114 As regards the third declaration, the Judge was invited to consider the operation of O 45 r 5(1)(ii) and r 7(3) of the old ROC: ORDER 45 ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS Enforcement of judgment to do or abstain from doing an act (O. 45, r. 5) (1) Where — (a) a person required by a judgment or order to do an act within a time specified in the judgment or order refuses or neglects to do it within that time or, as the case may be, within that time as extended or abridged under Order 3, Rule 4; or (b) a person disobeys a judgment or order requiring him to abstain from doing an act, then, subject to these Rules, the judgment or order may be enforced by one or more of the following means: (i) with the leave of the Court, an order of committal; (ii)where that person is a body corporate, with the leave of the Court, an order of committal against any director or other officer of thebody; (iii) subject to the provisions of the Debtors Act (Cap. 73), an order of committal against that person or, where that person is a body corporate, against any such officer. Service of copy of judgment, etc., prerequisite to enforcement under Rule 5 (O. 45, r. 7) 7.—(3) Subject as aforesaid, an order requiring a body corporate to do or abstain from doing an act shall not be enforced as mentioned in Rule 5(1)(ii) or (iii) unless — (a) a copy of the order has also been served personally on the officer against whom an order of committal is sought; and (b)in the case of an order requiring the body corporate to do an act, the copy has been so served before the expiration of the time within which the body was required to do the act. [emphasis in bold italics added] 115 The Judge began by stating that the Order was issued against WBL, not against Mr Tan personally, and, therefore, the above provisions were applicable (see the Judgment at [162]–[163]). On the basis of these provisions, particularly O 45 r 7(3)(b), she then found that the Order and penal notice were served out of time. Indeed, as stated above, Mr Tan was only served these documents on 26 May 2021, several weeksafterthe deadline for WBL’s compliance with the Order (see [108]–[109] above). 116 Nevertheless, the Judge went on to hold that this defect in service did not preclude Mr Rai from commencing committal proceedings against Mr Tan. She reasoned at [165] of the Judgment: The consequence of this non-compliance with O 45 r 7(3) is that [the Order] cannot be enforced by an order of committal against “any director or other officer” of WBL, under O 45 r 5(1)(ii), and the service of [the Order] and [Penal Notice] on Mr Tan on 26 May 2021 was improper to that extent.However, service onMr Tan was not improper for the purposes of any committal proceedings against Mr Tan himselfunder O 52. What must be personally served on the person sought to be committed under O 52 is theex parteoriginating summons or summons for an order of committal, the statement and supporting affidavit under O 52 r 2(2), the order granting leave to commence committal proceedings and the application for the order of committal: O 52 r 3(4). The ROC does not expressly require an O 52 r 2(2) statement to set out whether and how the relevant order of court was served on the person against whom an order of committal is sought for breach of that order:BMP v BMQ and another appeal[2014] 1 SLR 1140 (“BMP”) at [28]. While the court at the leave stage must be satisfiedprima faciethat the court order which is the subject of the committal proceedings has been duly served on the respondent or that the respondent has received notice of the court order, and evidence of service must be included in the affidavit supporting the leave application (seeBMPat [31]),there is no requirement that the order must have been served on an “officer” of the body corporate concerned, or that service must have been effected before the expiration of the time within which WBL was required to comply with [the Order](as is required under O 45 r 7(3)). [emphasis added] 117 It seems to us, from the emphasised text, that the Judge drew a distinction between two situations. The first situation contemplates committal proceedings commenced against Mr Tan in his capacity as a director or officer of WBL, for the purpose of enforcing the Order. In this situation, strict compliance with the timelines for service prescribed by O 45 r 7(3)(b) is necessary, and, if service is defective in this regard, O 45 r 5(1)(ii) precludes the Order from being enforced by an order of committal. The second situation contemplates committal proceedings commenced against Mr Tan “himself”, which suggests to us that the Judge had in mind an order of committal which did not depend on Mr Tan being a director or officer of WBL. Indeed, this reading of the Judgment is supported by the Judge’s decision that aprima faciecase of contempt was made out against Mr Tan on the basis that he – despite having vacated his office as a director of WBL at the time of the Order – nevertheless fell within the other limbs of s 6(2)(a) of the AJPA (see [113] above). Given that the Judge declined to grant the third declaration sought by SUM 2708, it is evident that she took the view that Mr Tan fell within the second situation.",
        "The grounds of appeal": "118 Mr Tan challenges the Judge’s decision in respect of SUM 2708 in its entirety. Therefore, the issues before us are the same two which the Judge had to determine, although we will address them in reverse order. We will first consider the consequence of the defective service of the Order on Mr Tan, and, thereafter, we will address whether s 6(2) of the AJPA has been made out.",
        "Our decision": "Consequences of the defective service of the Order 119 In summary, we do not agree with the Judge’s reasoning in respect of this issue. Our approach to this issue follows three steps. First, we will explain the relationship between the AJPA and the old ROC. No observations will be made on how this explanation translates to the new Rules of Court 2021. Second, we then explain which provisions of the ROC 2014 apply to an individual in Mr Tan’s position; that is, a person whose liability for contempt stems from any limb of s 6(2)(a) of the AJPAotherthanby virtue of him being an “officer of the [relevant] corporation”. Lastly, we will resolve how these explanations apply to the facts in this case. 120 The AJPA chiefly sets out the substantive law on contempt. Part 6 pertains to certain matters of procedure, but those are irrelevant for present purposes. Before us, the procedural matter in issue concerns theinitiationof contempt proceedings,ie, the prerequisites which must be met in order to obtain an order of committal. The provisions relevant to this are found only in O 45 rr 5–7 and O 52 of the ROC 2014. Thus, one should not determine the validity of the initiated contempt proceedings with reference to the AJPA; this issue is to be determined by the application of the ROC 2014. Indeed, s 26(1) of the AJPA expressly provides that contempt proceedings as well as the court’s power to punish contempt “must be exercised in accordance with the procedure set out in the Rules of Court”. 121 Second, it is clear that O 45 r 5(1)(ii) does not apply to Mr Tan. He was not a director or officer of WBL, and, indeed, Mr Rai’s own case was that: (a) Mr Tan was a member of WBL, which was a corporation managed by its members; or (b) Mr Tan was an individual in a position to influence the conduct of WBL. There was no claim that Mr Tan was somehow still a “director”. Thus, if O 45 r 5(1)(ii) is not engaged, it follows that O 45 r 7(3) also does not apply. Before we explain which provisions of the ROC 2014 should then apply, it bears highlighting that we are aware that O 45 r 5(1)(ii) mayseemas though it has been engaged in this case because the Order was issued against WBL, a company. However, there are two parts to O 45 r 5(1)(ii). First of all, a “body corporate” must have disobeyed the order in question, and,secondly, in such case, an order of committal may be obtained specifically against that body corporate’s directors or officers. In cases, like the present, where the Order is issued against a body corporate (ie, WBL) but the individual against whom enforcement by an order of committal is sought isnota director or officer, O 45 r 5(1)(ii) plainly does not apply. 122 The question then is whetherany other provisionapplies. Mr Yim argues that none applies because, even though s 6(2)(a) of the AJPA expands the categories of persons who may be held in contempt for a body corporate’s non-compliance with a court order – that is, beyond “directors and officers” – O 45 r 5(1)(ii) was not amended to provide for a service requirement on such persons other than “directors and officers”. In essence, Mr Yim attributes the apparent lack of a service requirement to “legislative oversight”. Such oversight, he says, obviates the need for personal service on Mr Tan “whether before or after the expiration of time within which [WBL] was required to do the act ordered”. 123 We reject this argument. Order 45 r 5(1)(i) of the ROC 2014 (see [114] above) clearly applies generally toallcases in which a party seeks to enforce a court order by an order of committal. This is broad enough to catch the present case, and, consequently, O 45 r 7(2)(b) – which refers to enforcement of “Rule 5” as a whole, not any particular sub-paragraph of Rule 5 – would require that Mr Tan be served a copy of the Orderbeforethe expiration of the time within which he was required to compel WBL’s compliance. In our view, such a construction of the provisions of the ROC 2014 is not only textually permissible, it is sensible and necessary. Service in the context of contempt proceedings is not a mere formality. Indeed, it can scarcely be said that a person has failed to comply with an order of court if he does not even know about the order untilafterthe date by which his compliance was required. To suggest that a person could still be held in contempt in such case, as Mr Yim does, would not only be prejudicial to such persons against whom committal proceedings are initiated, but also simply contradict good order and common sense. 124 This, finally, brings us back to the facts of the present case. There are, in our view, two important points to be borne in mind. The first is that Mr Rai’s lawyersthemselvestook the position that the Order and penal notice had been served on Mr Tan pursuant to O 45 r 7(2) of the ROC 2014 (see [109]–[110] above). Having done so, they should have taken steps to ensure that the requirement of service under O 45 r 7(2)(b) was fulfilled. Second, however, Mr Rai’s lawyers failed to do so because they did not apply under O 45 r 6 to modify the period of compliance prescribed by the Order. Instead, by their letter dated 28 May 2021, they purported tounilaterallyextend Mr Tan’s period for compliance by seven days from 26 May 2021 (see [110] above). Such unilateral extension was not permissible under the ROC 2014 and, as such, given that service of the Order was effected well past 23 and 30 April 2021, the deadlines for compliance, such service failed to comply with O 45 r 7(2)(b). 125 The effect of this, pursuant to the words of O 45 r 7(2)(b), is that the Order “shall not be enforced under Rule 5” by way of an order of committal, and Mr Rai is precluded from commencing committal proceedings against Mr Tan on the premise of such service. We accordingly allow Mr Tan’s appeal and declare that the service of the Order on him was defective; the leave granted by the Judge for Mr Rai to commence committal proceedings is, consequently, also set aside. Whether s 6(2) of the AJPA has been made out 126 In light of our decision that the Order and penal notice were not properly served on Mr Tan, there is no need for this court to decide whether the Judge was correct in holding that s 6(2) of the AJPA was made out.",
        "Our decision in respect of the appeal in Suit 160": "100 Leaving aside the specific factual and legal arguments raised in support of Mr Tan’s position – which we have already addressed above – we are, more fundamentally, unpersuaded by the narrative put forth by Mr Seah and Mr Tan to contradict that advanced by Mr Rai. As stated at [11] above, they did not merely deny that the Oral Understanding existed. They averred, on the contrary, that the investors had directly contracted with WBL as the true initiator and manager of the Venture. 101 In this appeal,allof the factual arguments advanced by Mr Singh were directed at scrutinising Mr Rai’s case. While that approach is, strictly, not incorrect, it is insufficient because it does not remove the need for this court to examine the probative weight of WBL’s positive defence. As explained earlier, the fact of the matter is that the court is confronted with two competing narratives as to who the investors contracted with. The court’s task is to decide which ismoreprobable, always bearing in mind that there is no dispute that the investors did participate in and did contribute large sums to the Venture. 102 After all, it was incontrovertible that the investors transferredmillionsof dollars without any agreement in writing, much less a written agreement with WBL. This was particularly striking given that the investors held no stake in, much less control of WBL, and indeed, the full extent of their very substantial contributions to both Plots A and B was not even captured in writing until 31 December 2013 when the Investment Agreement was issued. There was nothing which showed that WBL had, in its own capacity, communicated with Mr Rai and the other investors prior to the payment of their contributions. Furthermore, substantial portions of the investors’ contributions were paid into Mr Tan’s personal bank account for the acquisition of Plots A and B, not WBL’s, notwithstanding that WBL’s bank account was operational at the time of these transfers (some payments into it had been made). These critical factors pointed sharply away from the claim that the investors dealt directly with WBL in contract. 103 By contrast, although Mr Rai’s case contained some inconsistencies and could not account for every objective or undisputed fact, in the final analysis, it provided a clear and coherent explanation for thecriticalfoundational facts which Mr Seah and Mr Tan’s case evidently could not. 104 In the premises and for all the above reasons, we dismiss Mr Tan’s appeal in respect of Suit 160 in its entirety.",
        "The appeal in respect of SUM 2708": "105 We now turn to the appeal against the decision in SUM 2708.",
        "Background": "106 In the lead up to the trial, Mr Rai applied for and was granted an order for specific discovery against WBL (the “Order”). The Order was served on WBL, which did not comply. In search of a way to secure its compliance, the Order (alongside a penal notice) was then served on Mr Tan, who – despite retaining his 49% stake in the company – had by then resigned as a director of WBL. Given his resignation, Mr Tan took the position that he was not in a position to influence WBL to comply with the Order. He therefore filed SUM 2708 seeking two declarations to such effect, as well as a third declaration that, in any event, the Order and penal notice had not been properly served on him. Shortly thereafter, an application for leave to commence committal proceedings was taken out against Mr Tan in respect of his alleged failure to ensure WBL’s compliance in HC/SUM 2849/2021 (“SUM 2849”). 107 The sequence of events relating to SUM 2708 is important. On 7 and 8 February 2019, Mr Rai’s Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim were served on Mr Seah and Mr Tan. At this point, WBL was not a defendant to Suit 160; it was only on 4 December 2019 that the Statement of Claim was amended to include WBL as the third defendant. On 19 August 2020, Mr Tan tendered his resignation as a director of WBL with a three-month notice period. His resignation was thus effective on 19 November 2020. 108 On 16 February 2021, Mr Rai filed an application for specific discovery against WBL. On 25 March 2021, before this application was heard, then-counsel for WBL informed the court that WBL would no longer take part in Suit 160 and that they would be taking steps to discharge themselves from acting for WBL. On 16 April 2021, the specific discovery application was heard and the Order was granted. The same day, Mr Rai’s lawyers were informed by Mr Tan’s lawyers that Mr Tan had earlier resigned as a director of WBL. On 21 April 2021, the Order was served on WBL; it prescribed two deadlines: (a) by 23 April 2021, WBL was to file and serve its list of documents as well as the relevant affidavits; and (b) by 30 April 2021, WBL was to produce those documents for inspection. 109 These deadlines passed without WBL’s compliance. Accordingly, on 26 May 2021, Mr Rai’s lawyers served the Order and a penal notice on Mr Tan. Two points, in this connection, must be emphasised. First, by a letter sent on the same day, Mr Rai’s lawyers informed Mr Tan’s lawyers – “as a matter of professional courtesy” – that the Order and penal notice had been served on Mr Tan “in accordance with” O 45 r 7(2) of the ROC 2014. Second, the penal notice stated: If[WBL] neglects to obey this order by the time therein limited, you, [Mr Tan (NRIC)], a member of [WBL] whose affairs are managed by its members and/or an individual who is involved in the management of [WBL] and is in a position to influence its conduct in relation to the commission of the contempt of court, will be liable to process of execution and/or contempt of Court for the purpose of compelling the said [WBL] to obey the same. [emphasis added] 110 Mr Tan’s lawyers responded on the same day but that response does not bear on this appeal. Mr Rai’s lawyers replied on 28 May 2021 stating that the service of the Order and penal notice on Mr Tan was effected in compliance with O 45 r 7 of the old ROC. They also purported to extend the deadlines prescribed by the Order. After asserting the view that Mr Tan was “in a position to influence” WBL under s 6(2) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (“AJPA”), the letter stated: “In light of the above … Please have [Mr Tan] procure [WBL’s] full compliance with [the Order] by 2 June 2021 (ie, being 7 days from the date of service)”. The “date of service” being 26 May 2021. 111 Mr Tan maintained his position that he was not obliged to comply with the Order and, thus, on 10 June 2021, he took out SUM 2708 for the following declarations. First, that the Order did not require him, a minority shareholder of WBL, to influence WBL to comply with it. Second, that the Order could not be enforced by an order of committal against him. Third, that the service of the Order and penal notice on him was out of time and thus improper. On 17 June 2021, Mr Rai responded by taking out SUM 2849. The Judge directed both applications to be heard with the trial.",
        "Conclusion and costs": "127 For the reasons given, we dismiss the appeal against the Judge’s decision in Suit 160. The order that Mr Tan render an account to Mr Rai on the basis of wilful default thus stands. As regards Mr Tan’s appeal against the decision in SUM 2708, we allow his appeal only on the basis that the service of the Order and the penal notice was improper. We therefore set aside the leave granted to Mr Rai to commence committal proceedings against Mr Tan. 128 For the appeal against the decision in Suit 160, we award Mr Rai costs of $75,000 (all-in); in respect of appeal against the decision in SUM 2708, we award Mr Tan $15,000 (all-in). The net order is therefore $60,000 (all-in) in favour of Mr Rai. The usual consequential orders are to apply.
