        "The facts and background": "10 The legal battle surrounding Ms Azlin’s claim has been an acrimonious and lengthy one which began in 2015. This appeal is the fourth time that Ms Azlin’s claim has come before this court, and its factual background has been well-summarised in a slew of judgments, most recently inNoorAzlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd[2021] 2 SLR 440 (“the Transfer Judgment”). We lay out only the most relevant facts. 11 The genesis of the dispute can be traced to 31 October 2007 when Ms Azlin visited the Accident and Emergency Department of CGH (“A&E department”), complaining of lower chest pain and shortness of breath. A chest X-ray was ordered (“the October 2007 X-ray”) and an opacity in the right mid-zone of her chest was noted. Ms Azlin subsequently visited CGH three more times (see the Judgment at [10]–[13]): (a) On 15 November 2007, Ms Azlin went to CGH’s Specialist Outpatient Clinic (“SOC”) and two chest X-rays were ordered for her by Dr Imran bin Mohamed Noor (respectively, “the November 2007 X-rays” and “Dr Imran”). Dr Imran assessed that the opacity noted in the October 2007 X-ray was resolving or had resolved on its own and gave Ms Azlin an open date for her follow-up appointment. (b) On 29 April 2010, Ms Azlin went back to CGH’s A&E department complaining of right lower chest pain. An X-ray and an electrocardiogram (“the April 2010 X-ray” and “ECG”, respectively) were ordered by Dr Yap Hsiang (“Dr Yap”). Dr Yap deemed the opacity found in the right mid-zone of her lungs to be an “incidental finding” (ie,a finding that was not related to the patient’s presenting symptoms) as its size had remained more or less the same. Dr Yap ordered that the April 2010 X-ray be reported upon and requested specifically that Ms Azlin be called back after the radiological report was out, if necessary. A radiological report was prepared and sent to the A&E department for follow-up. (c) On 31 July 2011, Ms Azlin went back to CGH’s A&E department complaining of intermittent left lower ribcage pain. Dr Soh Wei Wen Jason (“Dr Soh”) ordered two chest X-rays (“the July 2011 X-rays”) and an ECG. Dr Soh and his supervising consultant took the view that Ms Azlin had costochondritis, a condition which is of musculoskeletal origin. Ms Azlin was discharged with analgesics. The July 2011 X-rays were sent for reporting and the report recommended a follow-up of the opacity. 12 On 28 November 2011, Ms Azlin went to the Raffles Medical Clinic complaining of cough, breathlessness, and blood in the sputum. On 1 December 2011, Ms Azlin returned for an X-ray (“the December 2011 X-ray”) which showed a lesion in the right mid-zone of the lung. Ms Azlin was referred to a respiratory physician at CGH’s SOC and was seen by Adjunct Assistant Professor Sridhar Venkateswaran (“Prof Sridhar”) on 15 December 2011. Among other things, Prof Sridhar ordered a Computed Tomography (“CT”) scan of Ms Azlin’s chest, which revealed a nodule (see the Judgment at [16]–[17]). 13 The biopsy of the nodule was conducted on 16 February 2012 by Dr Andrew Tan (“Dr Tan”). This confirmed that the nodule was malignant and that Ms Azlin had cancer originating from it. The stage of the lung cancer was not yet known at that point in time (see the Judgment at [18]). 14 On 1 March 2012, Prof Sridhar explained to Ms Azlin that there was a good chance that she could have a complete cure with a lobectomy. Ms Azlin was clinically staged as having stage I lung cancer. On 29 March 2012, she underwent a lobectomy and one-third of her right lung was resected. The tumour measured 3.0cm and was pathologically diagnosed as stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer. Ms Azlin underwent four rounds of adjuvant chemotherapy for about three months and CT scans every four months (see the Judgment at [19]). 15 In August 2014, a recurrence of Ms Azlin’s lung cancer occurred. This was discovered on a CT scan dated 26 August 2014. A biopsy confirmed that the lung cancer had progressed to stage IV. In December 2014, an analysis of the tumour that was resected via lobectomy in March 2012 was done to determine its mutation type. The resected tumour from 2012 was retrospectively found to be positive for a rare ALK-gene arrangement and Ms Azlin was retrospectively diagnosed in 2014 to have been suffering from ALK-positive lung cancer in 2012 (see the Judgment at [20]). 16 From 22 January 2015 to 8 July 2015, Ms Azlin was treated with a first-generation ALK-inhibitor, Crizotinib. In July 2015, she was placed on second-generation ALK-inhibitors, Ceritinib and Nivolumab, as part of a clinical trial. She remained on those drugs until October 2016, when the cancer progressed to her brain and mediastinal lymph node. She was then taken off the clinical trial and managed with radio surgery, chemotherapy and Ceritinib. From March 2017, Ms Azlin was treated with a third generation ALK-inhibitor, Lorlatinib (see the Judgment at [21]).",
        "The procedural history": "17 Ms Azlin commenced legal proceedings against CGH on 20 January 2015 in HC/S 59/2015 (“Suit 59”). Her claim was dismissed by the Judge inNoorAzlin bte Abdul Rahman v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd and others[2019] 3 SLR 1063 (“the first HC Judgment”) after a lengthy 28-day trial (“the Original Hearing”). 18 Ms Azlin appealed and her appeal in CA/CA 47/2018 was allowed in part by this court in the first CA Judgment. We briefly elaborate on our most relevant holdings therein. (a) First, Ms Azlin had shown, on a balance of probabilities, that she had lung cancer by July 2011 (see the first CA Judgment at [105] and [114]). This was for two reasons: (i) Ms Azlin was diagnosed with stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer in March 2012 which was retrospectively determined to be ALK-positive. The cancer must have gone through stage IA and stage IB before progressing to stage IIA in the period leading up to March 2012 (see the first CA Judgment at [106]–[107]). (ii) It was unlikely that Ms Azlin had gone through both stage IA and stage IB during the extremely short interval of time between August 2011 (after her consultation with Dr Soh on 31 July 2011) and March 2012. It was therefore “more likely than not that [Ms Azlin]didhave lung cancer by July 2011” [emphasis in original] (see the first CA Judgment at [109]). (b) Second, CGH had breached its duty of care to Ms Azlin by failing to ensure that there was proper follow-up in her case when even the radiological reports from April 2010 and July 2011 recommended follow-up on the opacity in the right mid-zone of her chest. There were also serious inadequacies in CGH’s patient management system (see the first CA Judgment at [96]–[101]). (c) Third, CGH’s negligence caused a delay in diagnosing Ms Azlin with lung cancer which, more likely than not, caused her to suffer from nodal metastasis and any consequences that may have followed (see the first CA Judgment at [116] and [122]). (d) Fourth, given the abovementioned findings on CGH’s liability, it was necessary for the losses occasioned by CGH’s breach to be determined and assessed. As the Original Hearing was not bifurcated, the evidence led at trial, and the submissions on appeal, were not tailored or directed to the specific facts as found by this court. As such, we ordered that the “issue of loss and damage, including quantification (if any), be remitted to the Judge with leave for the parties to refine or revise their evidence so as to address the specific factual findings that have been made in [the first CA Judgment]” (see the first CA Judgment at [125]). 19 After Ms Azlin passed away on 1 April 2019, the appellants made an application in SUM 1204 for interim payment. The application was heard by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who ordered a sum of $200,000 to be paid out. This decision was upheld on appeal on 3 February 2020. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was not granted by either the High Court or the Court of Appeal (see the Judgment at [5]). 20 The AD Hearing took place over six days in August and September 2020. The Judgment was released on 19 January 2021. The notice of appeal in AD/CA 22/2021 was filed by the appellants on 18 February 2021. Notably, this appeal was filed by default to the Appellate Division of the High Court (“AD”) (see the Transfer Judgment at [83]). 21 On 12 March 2021, the appellants took out an application to transfer the appeal from the AD to the Court of Appeal in CA/OS 9/2021. This application was granted on 9 June 2021 in the Transfer Judgment. 22 On 12 August 2021, we heard the parties in CA 39.",
        "The decision below": "23 CA 39 is a contained appeal that deals only with thequantification of damages due toMs Azlin, and costs.We therefore set out only those parts of the Judgment which are relevant to CA 39.",
        "The Judge’s decision on causation": "24 To understand the Judge’s decision on quantum, it is necessary to first comprehend her finding of a causal link between CGH’s negligence and Ms Azlin’s death from lung cancer (see the Judgment at [88]), a finding which is not contested on appeal. 25 First, the Judge found that CGH’s negligence likely caused Ms Azlin’s death (independent of any pre-existing condition). Ms Azlin’s tumour was deemed to be at pathological stage IB in July 2011. From stage IB to stage IIA, Ms Azlin’s prognosis of a relapse increased by 10–15% (see the Judgment at [43]–[54]). 26 The Judge specified that the delay in diagnosis had caused the relapse, and not the delay in treatment since the nature of the treatment at stage IIA and stage I would be the same (ie,lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy). In contrast, the delay in diagnosis allowed the cancer cells to enter Ms Azlin’s lymphatic system (ie,nodal metastasis) which resulted in a higher risk of relapse even with a lobectomy in March 2012 to remove the tumour and the affected lymph node. If Ms Azlin had been diagnosed properly when her cancer was at stage IB and if she had been treated then, it was more likely than not that she would not have suffered from microscopic node involvement. Furthermore, the fact that Ms Azlin suffered from ALK-positive cancer (generally a “more aggressive” form of cancer) meant that it was even more critical that the lobectomy be carried out earlier when Ms Azlin was at pathological stage I before the cancer cells entered her lymphatic system (see the Judgment at [57]–[73]). 27 Second, the Judge held that Ms Azlin’s fate was not conclusively biologically determined when CGH breached its duty to her. Given the Judge’s finding that Ms Azlin was deemed to be stage IB in July 2011, there was no microscopic node involvement which would (beforeCGH’s negligence) have caused Ms Azlin’s eventual relapse and death. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that Ms Azlin had a pre-existing condition or some other issue which would have caused Ms Azlin’s death (see the Judgment at [74]–[75]). 28 Third, there were available treatments that could have prevented Ms Azlin from dying in the way that she did; alobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy would already have been available to Ms Azlin at stage I. The Judge found that Ms Azlin would have availed herself of these treatments given the danger to her health posed by the size of the nodule and her willingness to follow the recommendations of her doctors (see the Judgment at [76]–[78]). 29 Fourth, the Judge found that if Ms Azlin had availed herself of those treatments, she would have been “cured” (ie,a relapse of the cancer would not occur within a specific timeframe such as five, ten or 15 years after treatment) and would go on to live to her full life expectancy. This finding was, in turn, premised on the following sub-findings (see the Judgment at [79]–[89]): (a) Firstly, CGH’s breach allowed Ms Azlin’s cancer to progress from stage IB to stage IIA such that despite the lobectomy done at pathological stage IIA in March 2012, Ms Azlin’s cancer had already entered her lymphatic system which increased the risk of, and caused, the relapse of the cancer just two and a half years later in August 2014. The cancer then progressed to stage IV which caused Ms Azlin’s eventual death on 1 April 2019. (b) Secondly, Ms Azlin was only 39 years old when she passed on and had no other known major illness. But for CGH’s breach, Ms Azlin would not have died and would not have suffered a diminution of her full life expectancy.",
        "The Judge’s decision on quantum": "30 Before the Judge, the appellants claimed a total sum of $13,464,100.75 (see the Judgment at [27]). 31 As a preliminary point, the Judge observed that the absence of evidence as to Ms Azlin’s full life expectancy by having regard to her age, race, smoking habits, obesity and lifestyle was a critical gap for the purpose of quantifying Ms Azlin’s loss (see the Judgment at [90]). Further, a number of claims “were not satisfactorily or adequately pleaded”, such as the claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages amounting to $8,943,046.70 (see the Judgment at [6] and [94]). 32 The Judge awarded $326,620.61 in damages, consisting of the following (see the Judgment at [218]): S/NHead of damageQuantum awarded by the JudgeReference to the Judgment1Pain and suffering for cancer tumour, treatment and shock and anxiety$140,000[100]–[114], see especially at [114]2Pain and suffering from the awareness of the reduction of her life expectancy$80,000[118]–[121]3Loss of amenity$30,000[122]–[124]4Estate or dependency claim$54,000[164]–[181], [218]Total award for general damages$304,000[133]–[138], [218]5Special damages – medical expenses pre-trial (ie,6 March 2012 to 22 January 2015)$19,620.61[209]–[215], [218]6Special damages – transport expenses pre-trial (ie,6 March 2012 to 22 January 2015)$3,000[216]–[217], [218]Total award for special damages$22,620.61[218]Total award (combined)$326,620.61[218] 33 The Judge also awarded $105,000 in costs to the appellants (see the Judgment at [224]). We examine her reasoning in greater detail when we consider the various heads of claim in the sections below.",
        "The parties’ positions on appeal": "34 Mr Rai submits that the Judge’s award is manifestly inadequate and avers that the Judge had erred in six main respects. (a) “[R]equiring the [appellants] to prove average life expectancy”, when this should simply be taken as 86 years. (b) Dismissing Ms Azlin’s claim for loss of earnings and CPF contributions during her living years (ie,2016 to 2018) and lost years (ie,2019 to 2044), when this should be awarded in the amount of $819,179.76. (c) Awarding Ms Azlin only $250,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenity, and disallowing her claim for loss of marriage prospects, when this should have been granted in the amount of $1,051,000. (d) Disallowing Ms Azlin’s claims for medical expenses, transport expenses as well as expenses for nursing care and a domestic and auxiliary helper from 2015 to 1 April 2019, when this should have been granted in the amounts of $1,226,885.56 (or $1,148,361.50 being $353,342 per year for 3 years and 3 months), $118,617.50 and $35,700, respectively. (e) Disallowing Ms Azlin’s claims for punitive and/or aggravated damages which should have been awarded at twice that of the general damages awarded. (f) Awarding costs of only $105,000, when this should be granted in the amount of $258,600. 35 We pause at this juncture to state that there is some ambiguity as to the global sum that Mr Rai claims on behalf of the appellants as this figure was not stated anywhere in the Appellants’ Case, Appellants’ Reply or Appellants’ Skeletal Submissions (collectively, “the Appellants’ Submissions”). When we queried Mr Rai on this during the hearing of CA 39, Mr Rai informed us that the appellants are maintaining their claim for a global sum of $13,464,100.75 (ie,the same sum that they had sought before the Judge which consisted of $4,471,523.35 in general damages, $8,943,046.70 in aggravated and/or punitive damages and $49,530.70 in special damages). Mr Rai confirmed that the sum as well as the calculations from which it was derived can be found in the appellants’ closing submissions before the Judge. Mr Rai explained that no concrete figure had been put forth in respect of the claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages because this should be quantified at twice the sum of general damages awarded. 36 Notwithstanding Mr Rai’s clarification, there remain two residual ambiguities in relation to the global sum claimed by the appellants. The first stems from the fact that Mr Rai has not raised any challenge against the Judge’s quantification of two individual heads of damages (as tabulated below) in the Appellants’ Submissions despite the Judge’s quantification being $170,910.09 lower than the amounts sought in the closing submissions before the Judge. This being the case, the appellants are taken to be content to accept the Judge’s quantification. Consequently, in so far as Mr Rai states that the global award claimed in the closing submissions represents the appellants’ position on appeal, this does not, with respect, make sense mathematically. Head of claimAppellants’ quantification in the closing submissionsThe Judge’s quantification in the Judgment at [218]Estate or dependency claim$198,000.00$54,000.00Pre-trial loss of earnings (2010 to 2015)$26,910.09$ -Total$224,910.09$54,000Difference between the two sets of quantification$170,910.09 37 The second ambiguity stems from the fact that certain figures, as quantified in the Appellants’ Submissions, differ from the figures set forth in the appellants’ closing submissions before the Judge. For instance, the claim for Ms Azlin’s medical expenses from 2015 to 1 April 2019 is stated to be $1,501,703.50 in the appellants’ closing submissions before the Judge, but is expressly stated to be $1,226,885.56 at para 86(d)(i) of the Appellants’ Case. 38 These ambiguities concerning core aspects of the appellants’ case do not help this court in its inquiry in CA 39. It is a fundamental requirement for parties to specifically quantify the exact figures that they themselves wish to claim before the court, and to include them in their written Cases on appeal. As we made clear to Mr Rai during the hearing, it is unsatisfactory that this court must resort to the parties’ casesat trial in the court belowby referencing numerous disjointed sections of theRecord of Appealin order to just obtain an understanding of a simple and basic point, that is, what the appellants are seeking to claimon appeal. 39 To cut through the thicket of these uncertainties, we adopt the following approach. The global figure claimed by the appellants will be taken to be $13,464,100.75 because this was expressly confirmed to us by Mr Rai during the hearing. The appellants’ positions on the individual heads of claim will be taken to be those stated in the Appellants’ Submissions. In so far as the Appellants’ Submissions are silent as to the quantification of the individual heads of claim, we refer to their closing submissions before the Judge. 40 On behalf of the respondent, Ms Kuah submits that the Judge was overly generous in her award of damages and costs, but nonetheless aligns herself with the decision of the Judge.",
        "The issues on appeal": "41 The issues on appeal are as follows: (a)Issue 1:How should life expectancy be determined? (b)Issue 2:What should the award for pain and suffering be? (c)Issue 3:For the period from 2014 to 1 April 2019, should an award be made for Ms Azlin’s medical expenses, transport expenses and costs of nursing care, a domestic and auxiliary helper? (d)Issue 4:Should an award be made for loss of earnings and CPF contributions for the period from 2016 to 2018 (“living years”) and the period from 2019 to 2044 (“lost years”)? (e)Issue 5:Should aggravated and punitive damages be awarded? (f)Issue 6:What is the appropriate order of costs for the AD Hearing?",
        "A preliminary point on appeals and O 57 r 9A of the Rules of Court": "42 Before turning to the appeal proper, we consider the import of O 57 r 9A of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) and its impact on the position of a respondent who has not filed any cross-appeal against a trial judge’s decision on the quantum of an award. 43 In the Respondent’s Case and Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions (collectively, the “Respondent’s Submissions”), Ms Kuah argues that: (a) The award of $140,000 for pain and suffering from the cancer tumour, treatment, shock and anxiety “was actually on the high side”. (b) The award of $30,000 for loss of amenity is “on the high side”. (c) The award for Ms Azlin’s pain and suffering due to her awareness of the reduction in her life expectancy “should be significantly less than the [$]80,000 awarded”. Ms Kuah then puts forward a “far more modest sum” of $10,000 and “ask[s] this Honourable Court toconsider a variationof this portion of the award for general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities, which the Court is at liberty to do pursuant toOrder57 rule 9A(5) of the ROC” [emphasis added]. 44 In our judgment, by virtue of the fact that CGH has not filed any cross-appeal against the Judge’s decision, Ms Kuah is precluded from submitting for a reduction of the Judge’s award in CA 39. This is because O 57 r 9A of the ROC only permits a respondent to mount a case to affirm the ultimate decision of the lower court. The rule does not permit a respondent to challenge the decision without filing a cross-appeal. 45 Order 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC states as follows: Preparation of Cases (O. 57, r. 9A) … (5) A respondent who,not having appealed from the decision of the Court below, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of that Court should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in part, orthat the decision of that Court should be affirmed on groundsother than those relied upon by that Court, must state so in his Case, specifying the grounds of that contention. [emphasis added] 46 The provision was considered recently in the decision of this court inReputation Administration Service Pte Ltd vSpamhaus Technology Ltd[2021] 2 SLR 342 (“Reputation”). There, the appellant sought to stay a suit pending before the High Court on the basis that the appellant had signed a contract with the respondent which contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause conferring jurisdiction over disputes between the parties on the Courts of England and Wales. The appellant’s application for a stay was dismissed by the High Court judge who found that (a) the appellant did not unequivocally submit to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction, but that (b) the appellant did not show a good arguable case that the exclusive jurisdiction clause covered the pending suit (seeReputationat [14]). 47 Taking reference from its previous decision inLCapital Jones Ltd and another v Maniach Pte Ltd[2017] 1 SLR 312 (“LCapital”), this court noted (at [15]–[16]) that while the respondent had not filed a separate notice of appeal, it was entitled to argue that the judge below had erred on the issue of submission because the respondent had raised the point in its Respondent’s Case and had therefore brought itself within the ambit of O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC. 48 At first glance,Reputationappears to support the argument that a respondent who does not file a cross-appeal is nonetheless at liberty to contend that an award of damages ought to be reduced. However,Reputationmust be read as applying the prevailing law as laid down inLCapital.This points firmly towards the opposite conclusion than that put forward by Ms Kuah. 49L Capitalinvolved a minority oppression action by the respondent against the appellants, seeking relief under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The appellants applied for a stay in favour of arbitration, which was dismissed by the High Court on the sole ground that minority oppression claims were not arbitrable. The appellants appealed against the High Court’s finding on arbitrability. The respondent did not file a cross-appeal but sought to rely on O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC to challenge the High Court’s findings which were adverse to it, namely that: (a) the appellants had not taken a step in the proceedings; and (b) the dispute fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement. In response, the appellants contended that O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC did not assist the respondent given that the refusal of the stay was not a “decision” within the meaning of the provision. In doing so, the appellants relied on the decision of this court inLim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei[2010] 4 SLR 331 (“Peter Lim”) which laid down the proposition that a “decision” within the meaning of O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC referred to a “separate and independent decision” and not to a decision on the outcome of the case as a whole as the latter was merely a consequence of the former (seeLCapitalat [33]–[36]). 50 This court overruled the previous approach to O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC inPeter Lim,reasoning (at [65]–[67]) as follows: 65 In our judgment, given all that we have said, we are satisfied that a departure fromPeter Limis necessary and justified. A broader interpretation of what counts as a ‘decision’ under O 57 r 9A(5) should be adopted such that the court’s ultimate decision on the claim or application falls within the meaning of ‘decision’.This would allow successful respondents to mount a case toaffirmthe judge’s ultimate decision by raising other arguments which did not find favour with the court below, without needing to file a cross-appeal.While our reasons for reaching this conclusion should be evident from the discussion above, we briefly summarise our reasons for departing fromPeter Lim. 66 First, we think that the approach that underliesPeter Limrunscontraryto the intent behind the introduction of O 57 r 9A(5),which was to simplify procedures by doing away even with the relatively uncomplicated requirement of filing a respondent’s notice.The introduction of the more onerous requirement of filing a cross-appeal would all the more run contrary to that intent. Further, the amendment to the Rules of Court was not intended to change the definition of a ‘decision’ that may be varied or affirmed on other grounds without an appeal. It was only intended to change themechanismthrough which a respondent gives notice to the appellant of its intention to contend that the decision below should be varied or affirmed on grounds not relied upon by the judge. Indeed, it seems to us thatPeter Limdeparted from the prevailing understanding of the position without fully appreciating the history that preceded O 57 r 9A(5). 67 Second, a broader interpretation of what counts as a ‘decision’ would obviate many of the practical and logical difficulties that have arisen as a consequence ofPeter Lim, as we have noted. Successful respondents would not have to apply for an extension of time to file a cross-appeal out of time after receiving notice of the appellant’s intention to appeal. Further, the parties and the court will not be faced with the difficulty of trying to distinguish between findings that are ‘merely a consequence’ of the judge’s anterior findings on logically prior sub-issues, and findings that can properly be characterised as ‘separate and independent decision[s]’.Simply put, under O57 r 9A(5), a respondent is entitled, without filing a cross-appeal, to seek to persuade this court either to vary (in the event of a successful appeal) or otherwise to affirm the decision of the court below, relying on grounds that that court did not accept or rely on in reaching its ultimate decision.It is not helpful in this context to distinguish between a decision on a sub-issue from one on the main issue, or, for that matter, from the final outcome of the case. It follows, therefore, that there is no need to distinguish where in the logical hierarchy a decision or finding stands; nor is there a need to distinguish a ‘finding of law or fact’ from a consequence of those findings. 68 While it is true that the approach inPeter Limhas been applied by this court on a number of occasions, we reiterate that the holding inPeter Limwould have made no difference to the outcome in most, if not all, of those cases (see [38] above). We repeat that in none of those decisions applyingPeter Limdid the court critically evaluate the reasoning behind the decision.Peter Limwas simply applied as a relevant precedent, without further interrogation of its merits. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics and bold underlined italics] 51 The passages above (especially the portions emphasised in bold italics and bold underlined italics) suggest that while the term “decision” in O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC should be interpreted broadly so as to allow a respondent to raise arguments in relation to the lower court’s ultimate decision on the claim or application pursuant to the provision (without filing a cross-appeal),therule only applies if the purpose of the respondent doing so is to mount a caseto affirmthelower court’s ultimate decision (or to vary the decision of the lower court, in the event of a successful appeal).If, however, the respondent is dissatisfied with the lower court’s decision and wishes to convince the appellate court that the lower court’s ultimate decision should be overturned in some way or another, then the proper approach would be to file a cross-appeal and to comply with the relevant procedures for doing so. This would include, for example,depositing security for the other party’s costs. Put another way, O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC “does not permit [a party] to mount what is essentially a backdoor appeal against the decision of the [lower court] without following the proper procedure for an appeal” (see the recent decision of this court inTQU v TQT[2020] SGCA 8 (“TQU”) at [18]). 52 Our decision inTQUis particularly apt for present purposes. It concerned a matrimonial matter in which only the appellant-husband filed an appeal. This court held that in the absence of a cross-appeal, the respondent-wife was precluded from raising new issues on appeal by relying on O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC which, if successful, would have the effect of increasing her share of the matrimonial assets and the quantum of her maintenance (at [18] and [24]). 53 Our decision inLiShengwu v Attorney-General[2019] 1 SLR 1081 is to similar effect. In that case, the Attorney-General sought to argue that O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC allowed new arguments to be made on appeal – namely, that s 15 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) could be introduced as a new basis for the High Court’s contempt jurisdiction. We disagreed, on the basis that the purpose and scope of the provision was to (at [46]): … permit a respondent to argue that the decision on appealshould be affirmedon grounds other than those relied upon by the court below without having to file a cross-appeal provided that the new grounds arise from the pleadings and neither party needs to adduce fresh evidence to address the new grounds. … [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]. 54 Returning to CA 39, in so far as the Respondent’s Submissions suggest that the amounts awarded in respect of the three heads of claim listed at [43] above ought to be reduced, we are of the view that this would constitute an active challenge to reduce the Judge’s ultimate award. This is impermissible given that CGH has not filed any cross-appeal. Order 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC cannot assist Ms Kuah because it applies only if CGH is seeking toaffirmthe decision of the Judge. 55 At the hearing, Ms Kuah accepted that as CGH had not filed a cross-appeal, the Judge’s decision on the quantum of damages and costs could not be altered in CGH’s favour. Ms Kuah also clarified that while CGH is of the opinion that the Judge was overly generous towards the appellants, it is prepared to accept the Judge’s decision in its entirety. We therefore construe Ms Kuah’s arguments as advancing the position that CA 39 ought to be dismissed as the Judge’s award of damages and costs cannot be said to be inadequate.",
        "The general law on tortious damages": "56 We turn now to the appeal proper. Compensatory damages for personal injuries can be divided into two categories,viz,general damages and special damages. General damages have two major components: (a) pain and suffering and loss of amenity; and (b) post-trial pecuniary losses such as the loss of future earnings. Special damages, on the other hand, compensate for pre-trial pecuniary losses and include: (a) pre-trial out-of-pocket expenses such as medical, nursing and supportive care expenses, transportation and household expenses; and (b) pre-trial loss of earnings or profits. 57 If death ensues, the tortious cause of action of the deceased survives for the benefit of the estate. In so far as the claims of the estate of a deceased person are concerned, an estate may not recover from the tortfeasor damages for: (a) exemplary damages; and (b) any damages for loss of income in respect of any period after death (see ss 10(3)(a)(i) and 10(3)(a)(ii) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)) (“CLA”). However, in assessing damages in respect of pain and suffering, the court is entitled to consider any suffering likely to have been caused to the claimant as a result of his or her awareness that his or her expectation of life had been reduced (see s 11(1) of the CLA). 58 It is well-established that the aim of an award of damages is to restore a plaintiff to the same position as if the tortious wrong had not been committed (see the decisions of this court inACESSystem Development Pte Ltd v Yenty Lily (trading as Access International Services)[2013] 4 SLR 1317 at [14] andLua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo CheeSiong[2019] 1 SLR 145 (“Lua Bee Kiang”) at [9]). 59 It is fundamental and trite that a plaintiff claiming damages must prove his or her damage – the fact of damage and the quantum of loss. If he or she satisfies the court on neither, his or her action will fail, or at the most, he or she will be awarded nominal damages where it is clear that a legal right has been infringed. If the fact of damage is shown, but no evidence is given as to its amount such that it is virtually impossible to assess the quantum of loss, this will generally permit only an award of nominal damages. That said, given the myriad of factual matrices which may give rise to a claim for damages, the law does notalwaysdemand that the plaintiff prove with complete certainty the exact amount of damage that he or she has suffered, although he or she must do his or her “level best” (see the decision of this court inRobertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen ConsultantsPte Ltd and another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“Robertson Quay”) at [27]–[29] and [31]). 60 The court has to adopt a flexible approach with regard to the proof of damage. Different occasions may call for different evidence with regard to certainty of proof, depending on the precise circumstances of the case and the nature of the damages claimed. There will be cases where absolute certainty is possible, for example, where the plaintiff’s claim is for loss of earnings or expenses already incurred (ie,expenses incurred between the time of accrual of the cause of action and the time of trial) or for the difference between the contract price and a clearly established market price. On the other hand, there will be instances where such certainty is impossible, for example, where the loss suffered by the plaintiff is non-pecuniary in nature, or is prospective pecuniary loss, such as the loss of prospective earnings or loss of profit (seeRobertson Quayat [30]). 61 To summarise, a plaintiff cannot make a claim for damages without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss that he or she has suffered, even if he or she is otherwise entitled in principle to recover damages. On the other hand, the court must also adopt a flexible approach and allow for the fact that, in some cases, absolute certainty and precision is impossible to achieve. Where specific evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not, the court must do the best it can to assess the plaintiff’s loss (seeRobertson Quayat [30]–[31]; see also James Edelman,McGregor on Damages(Sweet & Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2021) (“McGregor”) at para 3-003 (reproduced below at [257])).",
        "Issue 1: Life expectancy": "62 We allow the appellants’ appeal in respect of Issue 1 and find that but for CGH’s negligence, Ms Azlin could be expected to live up to 85.5 years old, in line with the average life expectancy of a female Singapore citizen.",
        "The Judge’s decision": "236 The Judge dismissed the claims on the basis that the appellants had failed to plead any claim for aggravated or punitive damages despite their counsel, Mr Rai being alerted to this omission by the Judge (see the Judgment at [188]–[192]). The Judge was also of the view that the claims were “contrived” and “nothing more than an attempt to increase the quantum of the recoverable damages for the Estate” (see the Judgment at [193]). 237 In any event, the Judge found no evidence of any contumelious or exceptional conduct or motive on CGH’s part in inflicting the injury on Ms Azlin (see the Judgment at [194]–[195]). The Judge also did not think that the sum awarded in general damages was strikingly inadequate so as to require augmentation by way of aggravated damages (see the Judgment at [193]). As for punitive damages, the Judge held that there was no basis to award this given that s 10(3)(a)(i) of the CLA statutorily outlaws such a claim. Even if this was not the case, CGH’s conduct was not so outrageous as to warrant an award of punitive damages (see the Judgment at [196]–[201]).",
        "The parties’ arguments": "238 Mr Rai submits that aggravated and/or punitive damages should be granted at twice the amount of general damages awarded in this case. CGH acted reprehensibly by: (a) concealing the flaws in its system and disputing the appellants’ claim since January 2015, putting them “to strict proof on all issues at trial, at the [Court of Appeal] and throughout the [AD Hearing]”; (b) withholding the discovery of important evidence and engaging “hired gun[s]” such as Dr Lynette Teo “to come up with dubious readings of the nodule” and who even “whitewashed the evidence”; and (c) refusing to explore a settlement with the appellants. Mr Rai alleged that the “high-handedness of [CGH] towards [Ms Azlin] … was calculated to aggravate her stress and to incur the expense of having to engage experts to prove her case” and even put “[Ms Azlin] through the rigours of a full and prolonged trial and subjected her to the worst humiliation conceivable”. 239 During the hearing, Mr Rai raised a new instance of alleged misconduct on the part of CGH – namely, that it had sought to vacate the trial that was originally fixed in March 2016 such that the Original Hearing only occurred in 2017. This delay prejudiced the conduct of the appellants’ case because Ms Azlin’s condition had deteriorated by the time of trial, which in turn hampered her ability to gather and collect the relevant documentary evidence in readiness for trial. This was the first time an argument had been raised to the effect that CGH’s application to vacate trial in 2016 warranted an award of aggravated damages (albeit that Mr Rai had previously taken issue with CGH’s alleged “attempts to delay proceedings” generally). Mr Rai also referred us to his reply submissions before the Judge which repeated many of the same points in the Appellants’ Submissions (see above at [238]). 240 Mr Rai submits that the award of general damages is strikingly inadequate given that Ms Azlin died, and aggravated damages are necessary because of the allegedly reprehensible conduct detailed above. 241 Mr Rai claims that punitive damages should be awarded because: (a) there is a strong impetus to deter similar conduct by other healthcare providers; (b) CGH’s conduct was outrageous; (c) CGH displayed a sustained pattern of indifference and deceit and (d) its conduct showed a sustained pattern of systemic errors which were life threatening and did, in fact, led to death. 242 In response to the Judge’s point that aggravated and punitive damages must be specifically pleaded, Mr Rai states that it is unreasonable to expect this as CGH’s reprehensible conduct could not have been foreseen at the commencement of the action in 2015. Even if aggravated and punitive damages must be pleaded, the court is seised of jurisdiction by virtue of O 33 r 2 of the ROC to award such damages, even if they are not pleaded. Mr Rai adds that CGH was not prejudiced as it had been notified of the appellants’ intention to claim aggravated and punitive damages as far back as 8 March 2019. 243 Ms Kuah aligns herself with the Judge.",
        "Our decision": "244 While CGH did not contest the availability of aggravated damages in cases of medical negligence (see the Judgment at [190]), Ms Azlin’s claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages suffers from a number of fundamental difficulties. These include: (a) the statutory bar under s 10(3)(a)(i) of the CLA in respect of any claim for punitive damages after a claimant’s death; (b) the absence of any pleading in support of a claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages (see also the Judgment at [188]);and (c) the fact that no evidence had ever been led whether at the Original Hearing or at the AD Hearing as to these two heads of claim. 245 Chief amongst these various difficulties is the fact that Ms Azlin’s pleadings are bereft of any mention of aggravated and/or punitive damages and therefore provide no indication that a claim quantified at twice the sum of general damages awarded is being brought against CGH. The claim for general damages already stood at $4,471,523.35 – no paltry sum by any measure (see above at [35]). It was therefore curious that the claimed sum for aggravated and/or punitive damages, a staggering sum of $8,943,046.70, found no foothold whatsoever in the pleadings. 246 As a result of this anomalous state of affairs before us, it is necessary for us to answer the anterior question of whether it is open to the appellants to seek aggravated and/or punitive damages, in circumstances where no such claim had ever been pleaded, before we can consider whether such damages can and ought to be awarded in the present case. In other words, the question iswhether aggravated and punitive damages must be specifically pleaded in order for them to beclaimed and granted. 247 We answer this question intheaffirmativeas such a requirement is in line with the general rules concerning the necessity of pleadings, the “exceptional” nature of both forms of damages as well as the purpose and object of pleadings. As this is a point of law which has witnessed conflicting opinions from various decisions of the High Court, we take some time to lay out our analysis in detail. The general rules on pleadings and the “exceptional” nature of aggravated and punitive damages 248 We begin by considering the procedural rules governing pleadings as set out in the ROC. 249 As a starting point, the relevant provisions concerning the general rules on pleadings, and in particular statements of claim, contained within O 18 of the ROC, do not provide any specificguidance as to whether a claim for punitive or aggravated damages must be pleaded specifically, nor have the parties pointed us to any rules to this effect. The relevant provisions read as follows: Facts, not evidence, to be pleaded (O. 18, r. 7) 7.—(1) Subject to this Rule and Rules 10, 11 and 12, every pleading must contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved, and the statement must be as brief as the nature of the case admits. (2) Without prejudice to paragraph (1), the effect of any document or the purport of any conversation referred to in the pleading must, if material, be briefly stated, and the precise words of the document or conversation shall not be stated, except in so far as those words are themselves material. (3) A party need not plead any fact if it is presumed by law to be true or the burden of disproving it lies on the other party, unless the other party has specifically denied it in his pleading. (4) A statement that a thing has been done or that an event has occurred, being a thing or event the doing or occurrence of which, as the case may be, constitutes a condition precedent necessary for the case of a party is to be implied in his pleading. … Particulars of pleading (O. 18, r. 12) 12.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), every pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words — (a) particulars of any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default or undue influence on which the party pleading relies; and (b) where a party pleading alleges any condition of the mind of any person, whether any disorder or disability of mind or any malice, fraudulent intention or other condition of mind except knowledge, particulars of the facts on which the party relies. (1A) Subject to paragraph (1B), a plaintiff in an action for personal injuries shall serve with his statement of claim — (a) a medical report; and (b) a statement of the special damages claimed. … Statement of claim (O. 18, r. 15) 15.—(1) A statement of claim must state specifically the relief or remedy which the plaintiff claims; but costs need not be specifically claimed. (2) A statement of claim must not contain any allegation or claim in respect of a cause of action unless that cause of action is mentioned in the writ or arises from facts which are the same as, or include or form part of, facts giving rise to a cause of action so mentioned; but, subject to that, a plaintiff may in his statement of claim alter, modify or extend any claim made by him in the endorsement of the writ without amending the endorsement. 250 Order 78 r 3(3A) of the ROC makes mention of the need to specifically plead aggravated damages in stating that: Obligation to give particulars (O. 78 r. 3) … (3A)Without prejudice to Order18, Rule 12, the plaintiff must give full particulars in the statement of claim of the facts and matters on which he relies in support of his claim for damages, including details of any conduct by the defendant which it is alleged has increased the loss suffered and of any loss which is peculiar to the plaintiff’s own circumstances. [emphasis added] However, this provision applies specifically to defamation actions and cannot simply be extrapolated to a claim for aggravated damagesgenerally− a point made patently clear by the words italicised above. In addition, O 78 r 1 of the ROC states unequivocally that the rules contained within O 78 of the ROC only “apply to actions for libel or slander”. 251 In the absence of specific provision(s) in the ROC, the general rules must apply, in particular, O 18 rr 7 and 15 of the ROC (which have been reproduced above). 252 Order 18 r 15 of the ROC is of the greatest relevance to the present case as it pertains specifically to Statements of Claim (and also counterclaims by virtue of O 18 r 18(a) of the ROC), the pleading in which a plaintiff’s claim for aggravated or punitive damages is usually found. It requires the plaintiff to “state specifically the relief or remedy which the plaintiff claims”. As a matter of practice, the plaintiff will generally have the prayer for relief or remedy at the end of the statement of facts where he sets out separately and distinctly in numbered paragraphs the items of relief or remedy which are claimed (seeSingapore Civil Procedure2021: Volume I(Cavinder Bull SC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”) at para 18/15/1) . 253 In the event that the relief or remedy claimed is general and non-specific, for example, a claim for general damages, the plaintiff need only state that he claims damages. A simple, “the plaintiff claims damages” will suffice. Further particularity is not necessary because the lawpresumesdamage which is the natural and probable consequence of the wrong suffered (see Jeffrey Pinsler,Singapore Court Practice(LexisNexis, 2021) (“Singapore Court Practice”) at para 18/15/1). 254 Conversely, where special damages or specific remedies are sought, such relief must be set out separately (seeSingapore Civil Procedureat para 18/15/1 andSingapore Court Practiceat para 18/15/1). As stated by Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) inThe“Shravan”[1999] 2 SLR(R) 713 at [77]: … Special damage … is such a loss as the law will not presume to be the consequence of the defendant’s act, but such as depends in part, at least on the special circumstances of the particular case. It must therefore be always explicitly claimed on the pleading, as otherwise the defendant would have no notice that such items of damage would be claimed from him at the trial. The above passage remains good law and was recently cited with approval by this court inCrest Capital Asia Pte Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as InternationalHealthway Corp Ltd) and another and other appeals[2021] 1 SLR 1337 at [211]. 255 Despite the different rules in respect of differenttypesof relief and remedies under O 18 r 15(1) of the ROC, one point is clear. Even in respect of the most uncontroversial head of damage which the law is prepared to presume as arising out of the wrong suffered, there remains a requirement to state the relief claimed. The question here is whether the words “AND the Plaintiff claims … Damages to be assessed” [emphasis in original omitted] in Ms Azlin’s SOC 2 dated 8 January 2016, suffice to enable a claim foraggravated and punitivedamages. 256 It may be recalled that we had provided an overview of the two categories of compensatory damages in personal injury cases –ie,general damages and special damages, at [56] above. Punitive damages are awarded when conduct is “so outrageous that it warrants punishment, deterrence, and condemnation”. This being the case, it is clear that punitive damages falloutsidethese categories ofcompensatorydamages (seeACBat [176]). Aggravated damages arecompensatoryin nature. However, they too falloutsidethese categories because they are awardedover and abovegeneral compensatory damages (see, for example,the decision of this court inFreddie Kohat [75]–[77] which draws the distinction between general damages and aggravated damages, as cited with approval inACBat [156] and inLi SiuLunat [151]). The sense in which “general damages” and “special damages” are used at [56] above, is not, however, the same sense in which those exact words are used in relation to O 18 r 15(1) of the ROC. 257 We pause briefly at this juncture to unpack the meaning of the terms “general damages” and “special damages” as used above at [252]–[254]. These words are used in a variety of different, albeitlegitimate, senses in the law and are apt to cause confusion if not properly contextualised and identified. A helpful guide to this is found inMcGregorat paras 3-002–3-006, as follows: [3-002] The first meaning of general and special damage concerns liability: it relates principally to contract, coinciding with the distinction between the well-known first and second rules inHadley v Baxendalewhich are dealt with later. It is best expressed by Lord Wright inMonarch SS Co vKarlshamns Oliefabriker,where he said: ‘The distinction there drawn [inHadley v Baxendale] is between damages arising naturally (which means in the normal course of things) and cases where there were special and extraordinary circumstances beyond the reasonable prevision of the parties. In the latter event it is laid down that the special facts must be communicated by and between the parties. The distinction between these types is usually described in English law as that between general and special damages.’ … [3-003] The second meaning of general and special damage concerns proof: it has more connection with tort, but the clearest statement comes in a contract case,Prehnv Royal Bank of Liverpool,where Martin B put the distinction thus: ‘General damages … are such as the jury may give when the judge cannot point out any measure by which they are to be assessed, except the opinion and judgment of a reasonable man. Special damages are given in respect of any consequences reasonably and probably arising from the breach complained of.’ This type of general damage is usually concerned with non-pecuniary losses, which are difficult to estimate, the principal examples being the injury to reputation in defamation and the pain and suffering in cases of personal injury. Pecuniary loss is also to be found as general damage within this meaning, both in contract and in tort. In tort there is the loss of business profits caused by the defendant’s inducement of breach of contract or passing off or the defendant’s libelling of the claimant. So too in the event of a person’s goods being tortiously damaged, whereas a claim for the cost of replacement goods hired during the goods’ repair requires proof of special damage, in the absence of a hiring of replacement goods, or of a liability for such, a claimed loss of use has to be proved as general damage. In contract there is injury to credit and reputation caused by the defendant’s failure to pay the claimant’s cheques or honour their drafts. These are pecuniary losses which it is difficult to estimate at all accurately. … [3-005] The third meaning of general and special damage concerns pleading. The distinction here is put thus by Lord Dunedin inThe Susquehanna: ‘If there be any special damage which is attributable to the wrongful act thatspecial damage must be averred and proved, and, if proved, will be awarded. If the damage be general, then it must be averred that such damage has been suffered, but the quantification is a jury question.’ And inStröms Bruks Aktie Bolag v HutchinsonLord Macnaghten, after stating that he thought the division into general and special damages was more appropriate to tort than contract, said: ‘“General damages” … are such as the law will presume to be the direct natural or probable consequence of the action complained of. “Special damages”, on the other hand, are such as the law will not infer from the nature of the act. They do not follow in ordinary course. They are exceptional in their character and, therefore, they must be claimed specially and proved strictly.’ Here, in pleading, general damage is wider than its second meaning, for it includes losses the amount of which the law will not presume since this is capable of calculation, and therefore evidence to assist the court in doing the calculation must be given if the claimant wishes to obtain substantial damages on the general head. Thus, in a personal injury case, loss of future earning capacity and future expenses are general damage in pleading but the claimant must clearly give evidence of amount. On the other hand, general damage in pleading tends to be narrower than its first meaning. Thus, in a personal injury case again, the loss of earnings and the expenses incurred between injury and trial must be pleaded as special damage; yet they are ordinary foreseeable consequences. The present distinction is set out in regard to personal injury cases by Lord Goddard inBritish Transport Commission v Gourleywhere he said: ‘In an action for personal injuries the damages are always divided into two main parts. First, there is what is referred to as special damage, which has to be specially pleaded and proved. This consists of out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general damage which the law implies and is not specially pleaded. This includes compensation for pain and suffering and the like, and, if the injuries suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability, compensation for loss of earning power in the future.’ … [3-006] The fourth meaning is a meaning of special damage only. To the rule that when a tort is actionable upon proof of damage not all damage is special damage, there are two clear exceptions: the case of most slanders and the case of public nuisance. Since no action lies in respect of general damage to reputation in the first case, all damage is called special; and since in the second case no action is available to an individual for damage which is to the public generally, all damage, again, is called special. The last meaning touches upon both liability and pleading: liability depends upon the existence of the special damage, and the action will fail if the special damage is not pleaded. [emphasis added] 258 The third meaning of “general damages” and “special damages” is specific to pleadings and is squarely applicable to our analysis on whether aggravated and punitive damages must be specifically pleaded. As stated inMcGregorand as laid out above at [253]–[254],the core distinction between “general damages” and “specific damages” in the context of pleadings is that only the latter must be specifically pleaded. This is for two reasons. First, facts warranting the grant of special damages are not those that the law will presume to be the natural, direct or probable consequences of the action complained of. They do not follow from the action complained of in the ordinary course. Second, and as a corollary to the first reason, they are exceptional in character. 259 In our judgment, it follows inexorably from the above distinction that aggravated and punitive damages constitute “special damages” for the purpose of pleadings. Neither follow in the ordinary course and both are exceptional in character. Let us explain. 260 Punitive damages are wholly anomalous and therefore awarded only exceptionally. First, they are a “response to conduct which is beyond the pale and therefore deserving of special condemnation” (seeACBat [176]). Such conduct is necessarily rare – it does not follow in the ordinary course. Second, they are exceptional in nature because they represent adeparturefrom the general rule that damages in tort are awarded tocompensatea plaintiff for wrongs suffered and to place him back in the same position as if the tortious wrong had not been committed (see above at [58]). The law therefore does not and cannot presume that conduct giving rise to or arising in connection with a tort is “outrageous” or deserving of “punishment, deterrence, and condemnation”. Such conduct must be pleaded and proved to the satisfaction of the court. We therefore agree with the approach taken by the Judge at [192] of the Judgment, as well as in cases such asAKRO Group DMCC v Discovery Drilling Pte Ltd[2019] 4 SLR 222 at [164]–[165] that punitive damages must be specifically pleaded and particularised. 261  In a similar vein, aggravated damages are awarded only when the plaintiff is able to show that there is “contumelious or exceptional conduct or motive on the part of the defendant and that the plaintiff suffered an intangible loss, injury to personality or mental distress, as the case may be” (seeLi SiuLunat [138], citing the High Court decision ofTan Harryand another v Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius and another[2004] 1 SLR(R) 513 (“Tan Harry”) (affirmed by this court inTeo CheeYeow Aloysius and another v Tan Harry and another[2004] 3 SLR(R) 588) at [82])). Furthermore, aggravated damages are unique because they are awarded for theaggravation of injuryby the manner in which the defendant committed the wrong or by his motive in doing so, either or both of which might have caused further injury to the plaintiff’s dignity and pride (seeACBat [156], citingFreddie Kohat [75]–[77] with approval). Crucially, this occurs in circumstances where the normal measure of general compensatory damages,whichis usually sufficient to compensate plaintiffs for their loss,is insufficient so as to require afurthercompensatory award,over and abovean award of general compensatory damages. This enhanced hurt must therefore be proved specifically by the plaintiff to the satisfaction of the court. In short, there is nothing ordinary about aggravated damages, and nothing for the law to presume. It is for this reason that there is a long line of cases in support of the proposition that aggravated damages must be pleaded specifically and with particularity (see, for example,Li SiuLunat [163] andTan Harryat [83]). As succinctly put by the authors ofBullen& Leake & Jacob’s Singapore Precedents of Pleadings(Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2016): 25.08Inspecial circumstances, the court may grant additional damages as aggravated damages.The facts which ‘aggravate’ the plaintiff’s loss must be pleaded, for example exception or contumelious conduct or motive, and malice. [emphasis added] This same point was also made by the authors ofSingapore Civil Procedureat para 18/12/13 as follows: The facts relied on to support a claim for aggravated damages should be specifically pleaded(Perestrelloe Companhia Limitada v. United Paint Co. Ltd.[1969] 1 W.L.R. 570; [1969] 3 All E.R. 479, CA (Eng),Rookesv. Barnard[1964] A.C. 1129; [1964] 1 All E.R. 367). Where the facts relied on do not support such a claim, the claim may be struck out (A.B. v. South West Water Services Ltd.[1993] Q.B. 507; [1993] 2 W.L.R. 507; [1993] 1 All E.R. 609, CA (Eng)). [emphasis added] 262  In so far as the High Court decision ofLeeKuan Yew and another v Vinocur John and others and another suit[1995] 3 SLR(R) 38 (“VinocurJohn”) stands for the proposition that aggravated damages do not need to be specifically pleaded (at [37]), we do not, with respect, think that this case ought to be followed. 263 First, the case must be understood in its specific context as distinguished from the case before us in CA 39 which concerns aggravated damages generally.VinocurJohnconcerned two defamation suits in which an issue before the court was “whether aggravated damages on grounds of malice and for injury to feelings wereencompassedwithin the plaintiffs’ pleadings” [emphasis added]. Crucially, this particular issue was raised in circumstances where the statements of claim had already alleged that the plaintiffs had “been gravely injured in [their/his] character, credit and reputation” and had been brought “into public scandal, odium and contempt” (at [29]). 264 The High Court held that the latter set of words were similar to the ancient formula of “hatred, ridicule and contempt” and a plea containing this ancient formula would already include a claim for mental distress, which is a claim for injury to feelings. Furthermore, the claim for aggravated damages for injury to feelings would, in any event, have fallen within the ambit of what had already been pleaded in the plaintiffs’ statements of claim (as quoted above at [263]). 265 In arriving at the above conclusion, the High Court was influenced in no small part by the unique features of the case asa defamation suit. At [47], the court held that “injury to the feelings of the plaintiffs … must be thenecessary andimmediate consequenceof the injury to their character, credit and reputation and their being brought into public scandal, odium and contempt” [emphasis added]. In other words, the court appears to have viewed aggravated damages in the context of a defamation suit as a part of “general damages” and, in so far as they are the necessary and immediate consequences of the defendant’s wrong, they could be encompassed in a claim for general damages such that a specific plea would not be necessary. Indeed, this is the way in whichVinocurJohnhas been interpreted (seeSingapore Civil Procedureat paras 18/8/14 and 18/12/13 andSingapore Court Practiceat para 18/15/3). An award of aggravated damages in a defamation action is however distinguishable from an award of aggravated damages generally, as the latter requires contumelious or exceptional conduct or motive on the part of the defendant and that the plaintiff suffered an intangible loss, injury to personality or mental distress. 266 Second, the proposition inVinocurJohnthat aggravated damages do not need to be specifically pleaded is no longer good laweven in the specific context of defamation. After the release of the judgment in August 1995, the then existing Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1990 Ed) were amended in 1997 to include a new O 78 r 3(3A) of the ROC which presently states as follows: Without prejudice to Order 18, Rule 12, the plaintiff must give full particulars in the statement of claim of the facts and matters on which he relies in support of his claim for damages, including details of any conduct by the defendant which it is alleged hasincreased the loss sufferedand of any loss which is peculiar to the plaintiff’s own circumstances. [emphasis added] The incontrovertible position following the introduction of O 78 r 3(3A) of the ROC is this: aggravated damages in the context of defamation actions must be specifically pleaded and accompanied by full particulars of the facts or matters upon which the plaintiff relies upon in support of such a claim (seeSingapore Court Practiceat para 18/12/5). The proposition inVinocurJohnthat aggravated damages do not need to be specifically pleaded is now dated and is, with respect, no longer good law. In so far as it pertains to aggravated damages generally, it has been superseded by developments in the law which emphasise the exceptional nature of aggravated damages generally. In so far as it pertains to aggravated damages in the context of defamation actions which frequently feature before our courts, the position has since been modified by O 78 r 3(3A) of the ROC. 267 To summarise, aggravated and punitive damages are exceptional in character and do not follow in the ordinary course. As such, they can rightly be characterised as special damages in the third sense elucidated inMcGregorand pursuant to O 18 r 15(1) of the ROC, must be specifically pleaded, with particularity. 268 Our conclusion above can be further supported by the ordinary application of O 18 r 7(1) of the ROC which requires that every pleading contain a statement in a summary form of the “material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence”. As explained by the High Court inKalzipAsia Pte Ltd v BFG International Ltd[2018] SGHC 152 at [106], material facts refer to “all the facts which constitute a cause of action or defence so that [the party] will be in a position to offer evidence of them at trial”. However, as stated inSingapore Court Practiceat para 18/7/2: … [T]he pleader is not limited to facts which establish a cause of action or defence. The scope of materiality extends to any fact that may be proved by evidence at the trial. … The point is that there may be many facts which are not material to the cause of action but which ought to be pleaded because they will be in issue at the trial, and the parties ought to be notified of them to avoid surprise at the trial. … 269 As Lord Selbourne LC observed inMillington v Loring(1880) 6 QBD 190 (cited inSingapore Court Practiceat para 18/7/2): The rule provides that, ‘Every pleading shall contain as concisely as may be a statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies’. If those words, ‘material facts’, are to be confined to matters which are material to the cause of action, that is to say, facts which must be proved in order to establish the existence of the cause of action, then no doubt the facts in this paragraph were not properly pleaded.But in my opinion those words are not so confined, and must be taken to include any facts which the party pleading is entitled to prove at the trial.… [emphasis added] 270 If punitive damages are sought, the material facts would presumably include some elaboration of the “outrageous conduct” that would have to be proven for such damages to be awarded. Likewise, if aggravated damages are sought, the material facts would presumably include some allegation of the manner of, or motive behind, the offending conduct, which resulted in enhanced losses that justify an award of aggravated damages above the usual measure of compensatory damages. These are the types of material facts which should have been pleaded. 271 To summarise, we hold that aggravated and punitive damages must be pleaded specifically and with particularity, in line with the general rules concerning pleadings in the ROC and the “exceptional” nature of an award made in respect of such damages. The purpose and object of pleadings 272 The purpose and object of pleadings was succinctly explained in the decision of this court inVNithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another[2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“VNithia”) as follows (at [36]−[38]): 36 … [P]leadings delineate the parameters of the case and shape the course of the trial. They define the issues before the court and inform the parties of the case that they have to meet. They set out the allegations of fact which the party asserting has to prove to the satisfaction of the court and on which they are entitled to relief under the law. Adherence to the rules of pleadings promotes good case management and results in cost and time saving efficiencies. In an age of burgeoning volume and complexity of modern litigation, adequate pleadings are necessary to reduce inefficiencies in the dispute resolution process, and they tend to increase the productivity of lawyers and courts alike. 37 Equally important to the principle of fairness, pleadings also serve to uphold the rules of natural justice (Sheagars/o TM Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd[2014] 3 SLR 524 (‘Sheagar’) at [94]). Parties are expected to keep to their pleadings because it is only fair and just that they do so – to permit otherwise is to have a trial by ambush. Every litigant is entitled as a matter of procedural fairness to be informed of his opponent’s case in advance and to challenge his veracity in cross-examination at the trial. … 38 Thus, the general rule is that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue. … [emphasis in original omitted] 273 In our judgment, the reasons elucidated above apply with especial force in the context of aggravated and punitive damages so as to require the claim for such damages to be specifically pleaded and particularised. As the Judge rightly observed at [192] of the Judgment, a claim for aggravated damages must be pleaded because the defendant ought to be given full and early notice that the plaintiff is pursuing a claim for aggravated damages so as to have adequate opportunity to adduce evidence to respond to the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had aggravated the plaintiff’s injury by the manner in which the defendant committed the wrong or by his motive in so doing. This consideration applies with even greater force to punitive damages. It is absolutely critical, and a matter of justice, that would-be defendants be given an adequate opportunity to respond to a claim that they had acted in an outrageous fashion, not least because an award of punitive damages by the court serves a condemnatory function in respect of defendants, and takes the further step of making an example out of them. 274 All this, however, is subject to an important caveat: important as pleadings are, the court should not adopt an overly formalistic and inflexibly rule-bound approach which might result in substantive injustice (see the decision of this court inSICCollege of Business and Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo Poh Siah and others[2016] 2 SLR 118 at [46]). In the same vein, this court observed inLiberty Sky Investments Ltd v Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltdand other appeals and another matter[2020] 1 SLR 606 at [16] that “[t]he entire spirit underlying the regime of pleadings is that each party is aware of the respective arguments against it and that neither is therefore taken by surprise”. In cases where no party is taken by surprise and no party will be prejudiced irremediably by the raising of unpleaded claims or arguments (for example,in cases where the objecting party can be adequately compensated with costs (see the decision of this court inMaHongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd[2021] 1 SLR 304at [35])), the courtmayallow the raising of unpleaded claims and arguments. That said, we reiterate that cases where it is clear that no prejudice will be caused by the reliance on an unpleaded cause of action or issue that has not been examined at the trial are likely to be uncommon (seeVNithiaat [41]). Given the nature of aggravated and punitive damages and the manner in which they are awarded, the threshold that must be crossed before the court is satisfied that it is permissible to consider such unpleaded and unparticularised claims will be high and will rarely, if ever, be crossed. Application 275 Given our conclusion on the relevant principles of pleadings governing claims for aggravated as well as punitive damages above, Ms Azlin’s claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages fails at the outset for want of pleading. 276 We do not see any compelling reason that would warrant a departure from the rule that aggravated and punitive damages must be specifically pleaded and particularised, or for us to exercise our power under O 33 r 2 of the ROC to broaden the damages assessment inquiry before us to also consider these unpleaded claims (seeACBat [22]). The appellants had been informed as early as August and November 2019 that there were various deficiencies in their pleadings, including the complete absence of any pleaded claim for aggravated or punitive damages. If, as Mr Rai claims, the appellants fully intended to claim aggravated and punitive damages at an “early” stage and went so far as to notify CGH by way of Ms Azlin’s affidavit dated 8 March 2019, they had ample time and opportunity to amend their pleadings. Having chosen their course of action, the appellants must now abide by it and accept the logical consequences flowing from it. The claim for aggravated and/or punitive damages is dismissed. 277 We add that even if aggravated and/or punitive damages are claimable notwithstanding the failure to plead such damages, the appellants’ claim is bound to fail for the simple reason that CGH’s conduct is self-evidently not “reprehensible”. We do not doubt that Ms Azlin and her family have suffered greatly from the pressures of litigation. However, being required to prove their claims on the stand and having their claims contested by CGH is part and parcel of the ordinary process of litigation in the courts. 278 As for Mr Rai’s new argument that aggravated damages are warranted as CGH had vacated the trial in 2016, Ms Kuah has clarified that CGH’s application to vacate the trial in HC/SUM 454/2016 (“SUM 454”) was pursued on the basis that the appellants had decided to “put in very substantial amendments to their pleadings” which CGH required time to analyse and take follow-up action for. Indeed, these very same points were made in an affidavit filed by Ms Kuah in support of SUM 454 on 29 January 2016. The more fundamental point, however, is this – parties are not allowed to raise newfactualarguments on appeal without leave of court, and certainly not for the first time at the very belated stage of the oral arguments. 279 We therefore agree with the Judge that no aggravated or punitive damages are claimable on the facts of this case.",
        "Issue 2: Pain and suffering, loss of amenity and loss of marriage prospects": "81 We affirm the Judge’s decision on Issue 2, save that we allow Ms Azlin’s claim for loss of marriage prospects and award the appellants a sum of $6,000. The total award for pain and suffering, loss of amenity and loss of marriage prospects is thus $256,000.",
        "The general law on pain and suffering": "82 “Pain and suffering” refers to the physical pain and emotional and intellectual suffering arising from the injury (see the High Court decision ofAu Yeong Wing Loong v Chew Hai Ban and another[1993] 2 SLR(R) 290 (“Au Yeong Wing Loong”) at [11]), while “loss of amenity” refers to the loss of the ability to enjoy life to its fullest (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Civil Procedure,vol 4 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 50.387). Whether there is loss of amenity is an objective fact that does not depend on an appreciation of the loss by the victim (see the decision of this court inTan Kok Lam (next friend to Teng Eng) v Hong Choon Peng[2001] 1 SLR(R) 786 (“Tan Kok Lam”) at [28]). 83 Where non-pecuniary loss – such as pain and suffering and loss of amenity – is concerned, the guiding principle is that of “fair compensation”. This means that compensation ought to be reasonable and just, and need not be “absolute” or “perfect” (seeLua Bee Kiangat [9]). 84 There are two methods to determine what is “fair compensation”. The first is the component method, by which the loss arising from each item of injury is individually quantified and then added up to estimate the overall loss that the claimant has suffered. The second is the global method, by which all the injuries sustained by the claimant are considered holistically to arrive at an estimation of his or her overall loss (seeLua Bee Kiangat [10]). 85 The principle behind the component method is that damages should be awarded for losses that may properly be regarded as distinct or discrete. However, a concern regarding the component method is that the overall quantum must be a reasonable sum that reflects the totality of the claimant’s injuries. This latter point is the principle which animates the global method. The two methods are complementary rather than mutually exclusive because they are simply different practical modes of producing a fair estimate of the claimant’s loss. The application of both methods proceeds in two stages. The court should first apply the component method to ensure that the loss arising from each distinct injury suffered is accounted for and quantified. The court should then apply the global method to ensure that the overall award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate (seeLua Bee Kiangat [11]–[13]).",
        "Issue 3: Ms Azlin’s expenses from 2014 to 1 April 2019 (post-writ)": "162 We dismiss the appeal in respect of the appellants’ claim for Ms Azlin’s expenses from 2014 to 1 April 2019, save for the claim in respect of post-writ transport expenses which we allow in part.",
        "Issue 4: Ms Azlin’s loss of earnings and CPF contributions": "195 We affirm the Judge’s decision not to award any damages for Ms Azlin’s loss of earnings and CPF contributions from 2016 to 2044.",
        "Issue 5: Aggravated and punitive damages": "233 We affirm the Judge’s decision on aggravated and punitive damages, and decline to award any damages for this particular claim to the appellants. 234 Punitive damages (also termed exemplary damages) are “meant to punish, deter, and condemn” and may be awarded “where the totality of the defendant’s conduct isso outrageousthat itwarrants punishment, deterrence, and condemnation” [emphasis added] (see the decision of this court inACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and others[2017] 1 SLR 918 (“ACB”) at [156] and [176]). 235 On the other hand, aggravated damages are distinct from punitive damages and are awarded toaugmenta sum awarded in general damages to compensatefor the enhanced hurt suffered by the plaintiff due to the aggravation of the injury by the manner in which the defendant committed the wrong or by his motive in so doing, either or both of which might have caused further injury to the plaintiff’s dignity and pride (seeACBat [156]). In other words, aggravated damages are distinctlycompensatoryin nature (see the decision of this court inKoh Sin Chong Freddie v Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others and another appeal[2013] 4 SLR 629 (“Freddie Koh”)at [75] and that of the High Court inLee Hsien Loong v Xu Yuan Chenand another suit[2021] SGHC 206 at [68]) and are “parasitic” on the award of general damages (see the High Court decision ofLi SiuLun v Looi Kok Poh and another[2015] 4 SLR 667 (“Li SiuLun”) at [156]).",
        "Issue 6: Costs for the AD Hearing": "280 The Judge took the view that not all the costs incurred by the winning party (ie,the appellants) were incurred in pursuing claims bearing a reasonable relationship to the dispute. As such, she awarded the appellants $105,000 in costs (see the Judgment at [224]). 281 Mr Rai submits that the costs award was “manifestly low” because the AD Hearing spanned two weeks from 24 August 2020 to 4 September 2020 and there were three rounds of written submissions. The costs award ought to be increased to $258,600. 282 We do not agree with Mr Rai. As Ms Kuah points out, Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions states that party-to-party costs for assessment of damages trials attract a daily tariff of $8,000–$12,000, with 80% of the tariff to be applied from the sixth to tenth day of trial. Even if one were to apply the highest end of the range, party-to-party costs would only come up to $69,600. We add that Mr Rai does not provide any breakdown or explanation for his figure of $258,600 which is 4.1 times the highest reasonable estimate in Appendix G. 283 To sum up, the Judge’s award of costs for the AD Hearing is not “manifestly low”. It in fact inclines towards the high side.",
        "Conclusion": "284 We award the appellants a combined sum of$343,020.61in damages and $105,000 in costs for the AD Hearing, the breakdown of which can be found at [5] above. The appellants’ appeal is allowed in part. 285 In so far as the question of the costs of this appeal are concerned, we note that the appellants have, to some extent, succeeded on a number of points in this appeal. That said, the appellants have also raised a number of points which were unsuccessful. In all the circumstances, we think the fairest order would be to make no order as to the costs for CA 39 save for disbursements which we fix at $12,890.13 (as quantified by the appellants) to be paid by the respondent to the appellants.
