        "Held,": "granting the respondents’ application:(1)        The power granted to the\n\ncourt by O 57 r 3(4) confers an unfettered discretion to the court to make orders as it\n\ndeems \"fit\". This concept of \"fit\" must encompass the notion of what\n\nis just in all the circumstances (see  17-18)(2)        Foreign residency is a\n\nground warranting the imposition of further security for costs if there would be undue\n\ndelay and expense in enforcing an order for costs, since the whole point of ordering a\n\nforeign plaintiff or appellant to furnish security is to ensure that a fund would be\n\navailable within the jurisdiction of this court against which a successful defendant or\n\nrespondent could enforce the order for costs (see 19, 27),De Bry v Fitzgerald[1990] 1 All ER 560 andPorzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd[1987] 1 WLR 420 followed.(3)        The merits of the appeal\n\nare also a valid factor for consideration in determining whether it is just to order that\n\nfurther security be furnished. Here, it had been assumed that there could be some merits\n\nin the appeal. (see 29)(4)        Another factor to be\n\nconsidered is if the application is so late that the bulk of the costs have already been\n\nincurred by the appellant. The court would look at whether there was a satisfactory\n\nexplanation by the appellant, in the absence of which the application may be refused. (see\n\n20)(5)        In the present case, the\n\nappellant’s previous conduct evidenced an intention to resist vigorously an order for\n\ncosts if made against her and it was likely that she would make it difficult for any\n\nenforcement of such order to take place. It was notable that in her affidavit filed to\n\noppose the application, she was silent concerning the respondents’ allegations that\n\nshe did not intend to satisfy the judgement debt and/or costs awarded against her. In\n\naddition, her conduct in relation to the attempts by the respondents’ to satisfy\n\ntheir judgment debt gave the impression that she was trying to evade enforcement action.\n\n(see 14, 24-25)(6)        The respondents had only\n\nmade their application when it became clear from the appellant’s conduct that she was\n\nlikely to resist enforcement of an order for costs against her; hence, there could not be\n\nsaid to be a delay in the making of the application (see 21,22)(7)        Enforcement of an order\n\nfor costs against the appellant was also likely to give rise to undue delay and expense\n\nfor two reasons: Firstly, there is no arrangement for reciprocal enforcement of judgments\n\nbetween Singapore and USA, where the appellant is resident; secondly, the ruling inMalayan\n\nBankingmeant that the fact that the appellant was a joint tenant of a private\n\nresidential property in Singapore would not obviate there from being difficulties in\n\nenforcement of an order for costs (see 26)(8)        It was also clear that\n\nthe appellant was a person with means, hence there was no danger of her appeal being\n\nstifled by an order to furnish security. In view of all the circumstances, an order to the\n\nappellants to furnish further security of $30,000 was appropriate and just. (see\n\n27-28)",

        "Legislation referred to": "Rules of Court O 57 r 3(4)Rules of the Supreme Court (1965) [UK] O 59 r 10(5)JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1        This was an application by way of a motion,\n\nfiled by the respondent, in Civil Appeal No. 15/2002 for an order to require the appellant\n\nto furnish further security for the costs of the appeal. After hearing the parties, we\n\nallowed the motion by ordering that a further security of $30,000 be furnished by the\n\nappellant. The standard security of $10,000 was already furnished when the notice of\n\nappeal was filed. We now give our reasons.",
        "Background": "2        The appellant, Shirley Ooi Ching Ling\n\n(Shirley Ooi), is a substantial shareholder in a British Virgin Island company, Pacific\n\nRim Trading Ltd (Pacific Rim). It is an investment company. Pacific Rim, in turn, held\n\nshares of a Californian company, Agate Technologies Inc (Agate), which is involved in the\n\ndevelopment of software technology. Shirley Ooi is a shareholder of Pacific Rim and a\n\ndirector of both Pacific Rim and Agate.3        In June 1996, Shirley Ooi offered to sell\n\nto one Jamilah Binti Abu Bakar (Jamilah) 750,000 shares in Agate. The respondent company,\n\nJust Gems Inc (JGI), was incorporated by Jamilah also in British Virgin Island to hold the\n\nAgate shares for Jamilah. Some two months later, Shirley Ooi offered to Jamilah about 22%\n\nof Pacific Rim shares (or the equivalent of 1,000,000 Agate shares) for a sum of\n\nUS$500,000. This latter offer was accepted. Payment was to be by instalments. Jamilah\n\nclaimed that on 16 September 1996, she paid US$200,000 into Shirley Ooi’s Citibank\n\naccount. This was followed by US$250,000 on 6 November 1996 and US$100,000 on 20 November\n\n1996. In total, US$550,000 was paid. It was explained that an excess of US$50,000 was paid\n\nby mistake. The Pacific Rim shares so bought by Jamilah were to be registered in the name\n\nof JGI.4        On the other hand, Shirley Ooi asserted\n\nthat only US$450,000 had been paid. Eventually, a total of 126,001 shares in Pacific Rim\n\nwere, by mistake, registered in the name of Jamilah. Following a capital restructuring,\n\nthis shareholding of Jamilah became 900,007 shares, representing slightly more than 20% of\n\nthe shares in Pacific Rim. Despite numerous requests, and Shirley Ooi’s promise that\n\nthe shares would be transferred and registered in the name of the respondent, JGI, this\n\nwas never done. JGI instituted the present action seeking a declaration that the contract\n\nbetween JGI and Shirley Ooi was void for a total failure of consideration, as JGI never\n\nbecame a shareholder of Pacific Rim. It also asked for the return of the US$550,000 paid\n\nto Shirley Ooi.5        The trial judge, Judith Prakash J, found\n\nthat a contract was concluded between JGI and Shirley Ooi; that the contract was void due\n\nto a failure of consideration, and that Shirley Ooi should return the US$550,000 to JGI.\n\nShirley Ooi was dissatisfied with the decision and has appealed, and which appeal is\n\npending.6        On 21 May 2002, JGI applied by motion for\n\nfurther security for costs in a sum of S$100,000. On 2 July 2002, this was refused by a\n\nsingle Judge exercising the powers under s 36(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act\n\n(SCJA). Following that refusal, JGI applied to this Court to review the decision of the\n\nsingle Judge and asked that the application for further security be granted.",
        "Grounds for application": "7        The grounds upon which JGI sought to obtain\n\nfurther security for costs fell under three main heads.(i) Shirley Ooi is not ordinarily resident in Singapore;(ii) the conduct of Shirley Ooi showed that she was evasive and did not\n\n  want to satisfy the judgment debt owed by her and was likely to resist any enforcement of\n\n  any order for costs; and(iii) although she has an asset in Singapore, in the form of a flat\n\n  jointly owned with her husband, enforcement of any order on costs would be protracted and\n\n  expensive.8        It was not in dispute that Shirley Ooi was\n\nand is ordinarily resident in California, USA. According to her solicitors, she has been\n\nresiding in USA \"for at least the past six years\", if not longer. She is the\n\nChief Financial Officer of Agate.9        JGI also referred to the following facts\n\nregarding the residential address of Shirley Ooi. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief\n\nshe stated her address to be care of 519 Montague Expressway, Milipitas, CA 95035, the\n\ncompany address of Agate. At the trial she stated on oath that she resided at 1600\n\nCarmentia Road, Cerritos, California 90703, which was not the case. In her certificate for\n\nsecurity for costs, the address 16000 Carmentia Road was given as a \"care of\"\n\naddress. Then, by a search through the INTERNET, for the purposes of levying execution on\n\nthe judgment obtained against Shirley Ooi, JGI discovered the correct address to be\n\n\"16000 Carmenita Road\", and not \"16000 Carmentia Road\" and that the\n\naddress was the address of Agate.10        On 6 March 2002, JGI’s solicitors,\n\nM/s Peter Low, Tang & Belinda Ang (PL), requested Shirley Ooi, through her Singapore\n\nsolicitors, M/s Arthur Loke Bernard Rada & Lee (AL), to pay up the judgment sum. It\n\ndrew no response whatsoever. On 26 April 2002, JGI served a copy of an order to examine\n\nthe judgment debtor on Shirley Ooi’s Singapore solicitors. On the same day, PL asked\n\nAL if they had instructions to accept service of a statutory demand on Shirley Ooi. On 29\n\nApril 2002 AL replied to advise that they had no instruction to accept service of the\n\norder to examine the judgment debtor or the statutory demand.11        On 10 May 2002, PL sought to serve a\n\ngarnishee application on Shirley Ooi’s solicitors, AL. Again, AL replied stating that\n\nthey had no instructions to accept service.12        JGI submitted that by her conduct, Shirley\n\nOoi clearly evinced an intention not to pay the judgment sum and also intended to make it\n\nas difficult and/or costly as possible for JGI to enforce the judgment sum or any order on\n\ncosts. AL were and are, at all times, acting for her in relation to her appeal and could\n\nvery well have accepted service on her behalf. Yet she chose not to instruct them to do\n\nso.",
        "Appellant’s contentions": "13        In her affidavit filed to oppose the\n\napplication, Shirley Ooi, after giving her address, as \"care of 895 Dove Street, 3rdFloor, Irvine CA 92660\", made the following points:-(i) The notice of appeal was lodged on 28 February 2002. If JGI\n\n  required further security, the request should have been made, and the application should\n\n  have been filed, earlier. JGI’s solicitors only wrote to AL asking for further\n\n  security for the costs of the appeal on 15 May 2002.(ii) As she often travelled in relation to her work, and as the\n\n  assigned mailbox for her apartment was invariably small, it was convenient that her\n\n  mailing address be her office address. Because she had always used Agate’s office\n\n  address as her address for general correspondence, she adopted the same for the purposes\n\n  of the action and this appeal. Thus the indication \"care-of\".(iii) She had to change her place of residence whenever the office of\n\n  Agate moved. She wanted to live near to her place of work so that less time would be spent\n\n  on commuting. Sometimes she moved because the place she was staying was not satisfactory.14        We would observe that what was significant\n\nabout Shirley Ooi’s affidavit was not what she said but what she did not say. We were\n\naware that she did insert this caveat in her affidavit: \"the mere fact that I have\n\nnot commented on a particular paragraph or part thereof should not be taken to mean that I\n\nagree with its contents.\" Apart from the allegation about her address, the other main\n\npoint raised by JGI was the accusation that she did not intend to satisfy the judgment\n\ndebt and/or the order on costs and this was exemplified by the fact that she refused to\n\nappoint her solicitors to accept service of enforcement process on her behalf. Her caveat\n\nwas that her silence must not be taken as agreement. But her failure to rebut the\n\naccusation, or explain her conduct, certainly left us with the impression that there was\n\nprobably no satisfactory explanation.15        Before us, Shirley Ooi made the following\n\ntwo main arguments against the ordering of any further security:-(i) the application for further security was made too late and the\n\n  appellant had already incurred substantial costs of the appeal;(ii) the appellant, though resident in USA for the last six years, is a\n\n  Singapore citizen and is a joint owner, with her husband, of a private residential\n\n  property here worth many times more than what JGI asked as further security. It was\n\n  purchased some twenty years ago for S$200,000.",
        "The Law": "16        Order 57 r 3(4) provides that the Court of\n\nAppeal may \"at any time, in any case where it thinks fit\", order further\n\nsecurity for costs to be given. The power given to the Court here is clearly wider than\n\nthe corresponding rule in England then (before the introduction of the English Civil\n\nProcedure Rules 1998). The then English O 59 r 10(5) provided that the Court of Appeal\n\nmight \"in special circumstances, order that such security shall be given for the\n\ncosts of an appeal as may be just.\"17        Under the then English requirement, the\n\nfollowing were considered to be \"special circumstances\" , e.g., insolvency or\n\nimpecuniousity; difficulty or expense in enforcing costs order; abuse of the process of\n\nthe Court. Of course, even if an applicant for costs established a recognised head of\n\n\"special circumstances\", it did not follow that the court must grant the further\n\nsecurity asked for. The court still had a discretion in the matter. Here, we would like to\n\nquote from theSupreme Court Practice (1999 Edn) at para 59/10/39:-The approach which the Court adopts is that, if one of the heads of\n\n  special circumstances is established and the appellant is able to furnish security for\n\n  costs (either from his own resources or with financial assistance from someone else), then\n\n  security should be ordered. The view taken is that if the appellant can furnish the\n\n  security, then he should be ordered to do so in fairness to the respondent, and there is\n\n  no good reason for invoking the residual discretion.Where, however, an appellant contends that security should not be\n\n  awarded because it would prevent him pursuing his appeal, he has to satisfy the Court not\n\n  only that he is unable to furnish security for costs from his own resources, but also (and\n\n  the onus of proof is on him on this issue), that he is unable to raise the money\n\n  elsewhere; in assessing whether he could raise the money elsewhere the Court adopts the\n\n  same rigorous approach as in the O 14 case ofYork Motors v Edwards[1982] 1 WLR\n\n  444 at 449 and 450; [1982] 1 All ER 1024, at 1027 and 1028, HL. In addition, the appellant\n\n  has to demonstrate that his appeal has a sufficiently good chance of success to justify\n\n  exposing the respondent to the injustice of having to bear his own costs win or lose. The\n\n  appeal does not have to be bound to succeed, but to satisfy the merits test for the\n\n  exercise of the residual discretion the grounds of appeal must be \"real and\n\n  substantial\".18        In view of the fact that our rule is\n\nworded more widely than the then English rule, it must follow that a respondent who asks\n\nfor further security from the appellant under our provision need not necessarily show\n\n\"special circumstances\". The rule gives an unfettered discretion to the court to\n\nmake such orders as it thinks \"fit\". It seems to us that the term\n\n\"fit\" must encompass the concept of what is \"just\" in all the\n\ncircumstances. We do not think it would be desirable, nor possible, to circumscribe such a\n\nwide discretion by any specific categorisation or criteria, other than the broad concept\n\nthat further security should only be ordered where in all the circumstances it is\n\n\"just\" to do so.19        Under our rules, foreign residency is a\n\nfactor which may warrant the imposition of security for costs of a trial (O 23) or further\n\nsecurity in respect of an appeal. But it also does not follow that just because an\n\nappellant is resident abroad, that security must be ordered against him. The rationale for\n\nsuch an order against a foreign resident is the delay or expense that will arise in\n\nenforcing the costs order abroad: seeDe Bry v Fitzgerald[1990] 1 All ER 560 at\n\n565, CA.20        Finally, every application for further\n\nsecurity should be made promptly. If it is made so late that the bulk of the costs have\n\nalready been incurred, the application might well be refused. Of course, if the delay is\n\nsatisfactorily explained, then the position could be different.",
        "Our determination": "21        We now turn to consider the two main\n\ncontentions of Shirley Ooi. First is the question of delay. It is necessary to restate the\n\nessential facts. The notice of appeal was filed on 28 February 2002. On 6 March 2002\n\nJGI’s solicitors demanded the payment of the judgment sum. There was no response.\n\nThen between 26 April to 10 May 2002, PL, sought to take out enforcement proceedings and\n\nasked AL if they had instructions to accept service on behalf of Shirley Ooi. In each\n\ninstance the reply was a negative. Then on 15 May 2002, PL wrote to AL asking for the\n\nprovision of a sum of $50,000 as further security within 2 days. An interim reply was\n\ngiven by AL on 17 May 2002 querying the urgency and stating that the solicitor in charge,\n\nMr Benjamin Goh, was then overseas and would revert upon his return. But it would appear,\n\nwhatever might be the reasons, he never reverted. So on 21 May 2002 JGI applied by motion\n\nfor further security, which motion was on 2 July 2002 dismissed by the single Judge. On 10\n\nJuly 2002, the present motion was filed pursuant to s 36(3) of SCJA.22        In this regard, it must be pointed out\n\nthat this application for further security was not made on the ground of poverty or\n\nimpecuniosity of Shirley Ooi. It was on the ground that her conduct evidenced an intention\n\non her part to vigorously resist any costs awarded against her and it was likely that she\n\nwould deliberately make it more difficult and expensive for enforcement action to be taken\n\nagainst her. This ground only surfaced on account of her conduct in April/May 2002. Thus,\n\nwe found that there was really no delay on JGI’s part in making the application.23        Turning to the second point of Shirley\n\nOoi, that she is the joint owner of a property, while this may, on the face of it, show\n\nthat she has assets within jurisdiction to satisfy any costs order, the circumstances\n\nwould indicate that any enforcement of a costs order against her would not be without\n\ndelay or unnecessary expense.24        First, even accepting her explanations on\n\nwhy she often had to change her residence, or her postal address, this would mean that a\n\nthird party like JGI would have great difficulty in tracing her, unless she keeps her\n\nsolicitors informed and permits them to notify others, like JGI, of her updated address.25        Second, having regard to her previous\n\nconduct, she is likely to take every step to delay and/or place obstacles in the way of\n\nthe execution of a cost order. She did not apply for a stay of execution of the High Court\n\njudgment, and yet she resisted the request to pay up the judgment sum. She refused to\n\ninstruct her solicitors to accept service of the enforcement actions which PL intended to\n\npursue. We could not help feeling that she was trying to evade enforcement action. The\n\ncaseLek Swee Hua v American Express International Inc[1991] 2 MLJ 151is\n\nillustrative. There, there had been difficulties in effecting service of bankruptcy\n\nnotices on the appellant-plaintiffs in other proceedings and security for costs was\n\naccordingly ordered.26        Thirdly, enforcement of a costs order\n\nagainst Shirley Ooi would necessarily give rise to undue delay and expense. Again, looking\n\nat the previous behaviour of Shirley Ooi, we thought it was likely that JGI would have\n\nreal difficulties in enforcing such an order against her. Orders of this Court are not\n\nenforceable in USA as there is no arrangement on reciprocal enforcement of judgment\n\nbetween Singapore and USA. This then brings us to the flat which she co-owns with her\n\nhusband. InMalayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd[1999] 3 SLR 229, the High\n\nCourt held that a writ of seizure and sale issued under O 47 r 4(1)(a) is not enforceable\n\nagainst an immovable property in which the judgment debtor is a joint tenant. This is\n\nbecause a joint owner does not have a distinct and identifiable share in the property for\n\nso long as the joint tenancy subsists. Instead, the High Court indicated that in such a\n\nsituation the judgment creditor could proceed by way of equitable execution through the\n\nappointment of a receiver (under O 30 and O 51 of the Rules of Court). However, as a\n\nreceiver is not empowered to sell the property, it is clear that satisfaction of the\n\njudgment sum owing by the judgment debtor would entail further difficulties, or at least\n\nfurther delays, assuming that incomes received by the receiver are utilised to satisfy the\n\ncosts order. We have referred toMalayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltdonly to\n\nshow the difficulties thatcouldbe encountered. We have assumed the decision to be\n\ncorrect as no appeal was taken against it. These difficulties, coupled with the fact that\n\nShirley Ooi is not likely to cooperate, could only further enhance the impediments which\n\nJGI would encounter.27        In view of all the foregoing, it was our\n\nopinion that the circumstances warranted the making of an order for further security. The\n\nwhole point of ordering a foreign plaintiff or appellant to furnish security is to ensure\n\nthat a fund would be available within the jurisdiction of this court against which the\n\nsuccessful defendant or respondent could enforce the judgment for costs: seePorzelack\n\nKG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd[1987] 1 WLR 420 at 422. Without such further security there\n\nis a real risk that JGI could be left with a costs order which would be unenforceable or\n\nonly enforceable with great difficulty and expense, plus delay.28        Moreover, it was clear that Shirley Ooi is\n\na person with means. There was no suggestion that she would have difficulties in\n\nfurnishing such additional security which the court might reasonably order. Neither had it\n\nbeen said that if such security were ordered, her appeal would be stifled.29        Before we conclude, we ought to mention\n\nthat another factor which is relevant in the equation of determining whether it is just to\n\norder further security is the question of the merits of the appeal. For the purpose of the\n\npresent motion, we had assumed that there could be some merits in the appeal.Sgd:CHAO HICK TIN\n\n            TAN LEE MENGJUDGE OF APPEAL        JUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
