        "Background": "2.\n\n        On 17 August 2001, officers of the Central\n\nNarcotics Bureau (\"CNB\") conducted surveillance on an apartment at Cascadale, a\n\ncondominium in Upper Changi Road. At around 1.50 pm, they saw Azman going into Unit #02-02\n\n(the \"Cascadale apartment\"). He left the said apartment at around 2.05 pm and\n\ntook a taxi to the Kranji MRT station. At around 2.40 pm, a van drove by the MRT station.\n\nA person came out from the van and handed Azman a bag. Azman then boarded another taxi,\n\nwhich was stopped by CNB officers at the junction of Upper Changi Road East and Upper\n\nChangi Road West. Azman was arrested. His bag contained 30 packets of heroin. When Azman\n\nwas searched, the Cascadale apartment keys as well as $42,364.29 were found on him.3.\n\n        CNB officers next arrested Ruzaini at the\n\npathway of the Cascadale condominium at around 3.35 pm. Both Azman and Ruzaini were then\n\nescorted to the Cascadale apartment. The CNB officers could not enter the apartment as\n\nIsnin, who was then in the apartment, had pressed a chair against the front door. When the\n\nCNB officers finally entered the apartment, Isnin was in the master bedroom toilet, trying\n\nto flush some drugs down the toilet bowl. Isnin was arrested at around 3.43 pm. He was\n\nfound to have a set of the Cascadale apartment keys in his haversack.4.\n\n        When the CNB officers searched the apartment,\n\nthey found 23 packets of diamorphine above the false ceiling of the master bedroom toilet\n\nand another 20 packets of diamorphine above the false ceiling of the kitchen toilet. The\n\n43 packets of drugs contained 112.23 grams of diamorphine. In addition, 0.68 grams of\n\ndiamorphine were found in a plastic bowl, in an unsealed sachet and in a loose pile on the\n\nfloor of the master bedroom. Azman’s fingerprint was found on the false ceiling of\n\nthe kitchen toilet while Isnin’s fingerprint was found on the false ceiling of the\n\nmaster bedroom toilet.5.\n\n        Azman and Ruzini tried to distance themselves\n\nfrom the drugs in the Cascadale apartment, which had been rented by the latter’s\n\ngirlfriend, Rohaizan binte Buang (\"Rohaizan\") on his behalf. Azman said that he\n\nhad been asked by his friend, a Malaysian Malay named \"Brother\", to collect VCDs\n\non his behalf from someone at the Kranji MRT station. He had been instructed to proceed to\n\nthe Cascadale apartment to take some money to pay for the VCDs. He went there and took\n\n$40,000 from a bedroom. He added that he went to the kitchen for a drink before leaving\n\nthe apartment and that while he was in the kitchen toilet, he noticed that the false\n\nceiling above the toilet was slightly open. He climbed onto the toilet bowl and adjusted\n\nthe false ceiling board. That was why his fingerprint was found on the said ceiling board.6.\n\n        Azman claimed that while he was on the way to\n\nKranji, \"Brother\" called and told him not to pay for the VCDs. Instead, he was\n\nto collect the VCDs and hand them and the money he had collected earlier on from the\n\nCascadale apartment to someone who was waiting for him at the Cascadale condominium. He\n\nsaid that he assumed that the bag that he collected at the Kranji MRT station contained\n\nVCDs because he had collected VCDs on behalf of \"Brother\" two weeks ago.7.\n\n        In the face of evidence that he had instructed\n\nhis girlfriend, Rohaizan, to rent the Cascadale apartment on his behalf, Ruzaini claimed\n\nthat he had arranged for the rental of the said apartment on behalf of\n\n\"Brother\". While Azman said that \"Brother\" was a Malaysian Malay,\n\nRuzaini said that he was a Malaysian Chinese Muslim. He said that when he was arrested, he\n\nwas waiting for Azman at the garden of the Cascadale condominium as they had agreed to\n\nproceed together to Orchard Road. He added that he had not gone into the Cascadale\n\napartment and that he did not know anything about the drugs which were in the apartment.8.\n\n        Isnin’s statements to the CNB officers\n\ncertainly shed light on the appellants’ operations. He also claimed to have acted on\n\nthe instructions of \"Brother\" but he described him as an Indian Muslim. In a\n\nstatement recorded on 23 August 2001, he said that Ruzaini telephoned him on the morning\n\nof the day they were arrested to say that he needed help. He understood this to mean that\n\nhelp was required for the packing of drugs. Azman also called him to ask if he was going\n\nto \"the place\". He said that Azman told him that Ruzaini would also be there. On\n\n27 August 2001, Isnin explained in another statement that he had been to the Cascadale\n\napartment on other occasions prior to the arrest. During his first visit, he saw Ruzaini\n\nand his girlfriend, Rohaizan, at the apartment. Two or three days later, he went to the\n\nCascadale apartment to pack 50 sachets of heroin in the master bedroom. On the day before\n\nhis arrest, he went to the apartment to pack drugs again. On this occasion, Ruzaini let\n\nhim in and he, Ruzaini and Azman packed drugs together.The trial judge’s decision9.\n\n        The trial judge accepted Isnin’s evidence\n\nthat he, Azman and Ruzaini were packing drugs in the Cascadale apartment on 16 August\n\n2001. He took the view they did not complete their task of packing drugs on 16 August\n\n2001. As such, they had unfinished business at the apartment on 17 August 2001, the day\n\nthey were all arrested. For reasons which will be discussed in the latter part of this\n\njudgment, the trial judge had no doubt that when the appellants were arrested, they were\n\nin possession of the drugs in the apartment for the purpose of trafficking. That being the\n\ncase, he found them guilty of the capital charge faced by them.",
        "The appeal": "10.\n\n        The main thrust of the appellants’ appeal\n\nwas that there was insufficient evidence to show that they were in possession of the\n\n112.91 grams of diamorphine in the Cascadale apartment or that there was a common\n\nintention in relation to drug trafficking.11.\n\n        Azman’s appeal will first be considered.\n\nHe contended that the trial judge erred when he accepted Isnin’s evidence that he and\n\nRuzaini had packed drugs in the Cascadale apartment on 16 August 2001 or that he had\n\nspoken to Isnin on the following day about going to the apartment again. He also asserted\n\nthat the trial judge did not give due weight to the fact that anyone could have gained\n\nentry into the Cascadale apartment by obtaining a set of keys which had been placed in the\n\nletter box structure and could have put the 43 packets of drugs in the said apartment.\n\nFinally, he contended that the trial judge erred in holding that there was sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence to prove that he was in possession of the drugs found in the\n\napartment.12.\n\n        The trial judge noted that when Azman was\n\narrested, he had the Cascadale apartment keys on him and he had just collected 30 sachets\n\nof heroin for delivery to someone at the Cascadale condominium. After reviewing the\n\nevidence and listening to the witnesses, he chose to believe Isnin’s evidence that\n\nAzman had packed drugs at the Cascadale apartment on 16 August 2001 and had given\n\ninstructions, which Isnin understood to be in connection with returning to the apartment\n\nto pack more drugs on the day they were all arrested. He pointed out that Isnin was not\n\nseeking any advantage for himself when he made those admissions. He was not trying to\n\nshift the blame to Azman or Ruzaini. In fact, he was also implicating himself with his\n\nadmissions.13.\n\n        The trial judge pointed out that Azman’s\n\nconduct after his arrest and his account of material events raised serious questions about\n\nhis credibility. For instance, although he claimed that he thought that the bag which was\n\nseized from him after his arrest contained VCDs, he had in fact told the CNB officers that\n\nhe did not know of its contents when he was first questioned. Furthermore, although he\n\nclaimed to have adjusted the false ceiling board in the kitchen toilet because it was out\n\nof place, he had first denied that he touched the ceiling board. His evidence as to how he\n\ngot the Cascadale apartment keys also left much to be desired. He claimed, inter alia, to\n\nhave taken the said keys from some plants outside the said apartment when there were no\n\nsuch plants. In our view, it was not established that the trial judge erred when he\n\nrejected Azman’s defence that he had no knowledge of the drugs in the apartment and\n\nthat he had nothing to do with the drugs found there.14.\n\n        As for Ruzaini, the main grounds of his appeal\n\nwere that the trial judge should not have rejected his submission of no case to answer at\n\nthe end of the prosecution’s case, that there was insufficient evidence to prove that\n\nhe was guilty beyond reasonable doubt, that prejudicial and inadmissible evidence had been\n\nadmitted, and that it was not established that there was a common intention to traffic in\n\nthe seized drugs. He denied Isnin’s allegation that he was at the apartment on 16\n\nAugust 2001 and said that he was framed because Isnin had thought that he was a CNB\n\ninformer.15.\n\n        For a start, it was obvious that Ruzaini had a\n\nlot of explaining to do regarding the rental of the Cascadale apartment. It was not\n\ndisputed that his girlfriend, Rohaizan, had rented the apartment on his behalf, that she\n\nhad paid for the deposit and rental with money provided by him and that she had handed\n\nover the keys to the apartment to him. Although Ruzaini claimed that he had arranged for\n\nthe Cascadale apartment to be rented on behalf of \"Brother\", Rohaizan’s\n\nevidence was that he had said that he wanted the apartment for himself and his friends.\n\nHer unchallenged testimony was that she had gone to the apartment on several occasions to\n\nmeet him. Furthermore, Isnin testified that Ruzaini had packed drugs with him in the\n\napartment previously and that he was called by Ruzaini to help pack drugs in the apartment\n\non the day they were all arrested. Ruzaini claimed that he had called Isnin to help him\n\narrange for transport but it was not put to Isnin that this was the purpose of the phone\n\ncall. Finally, Azman, who said that he was to telephone someone called \"Boy\" and\n\ndeliver the bag collected at Kranji to him, admitted that \"Boy\" was Ruzaini, who\n\nwas at the Cascadale condominium at the material time. In view of the aforesaid, the trial\n\njudge rightly said that all these showed that Rozaini \"had more to do with the\n\napartment than merely being Brother’s proxy for renting it\". In the face of the\n\nevidence against him, Ruhaini’s contradictory evidence did not advance his case. For\n\ninstance, he denied knowing Azman or Isnin but subsequently admitted that this was a lie.\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that he was not at the Cascadale apartment on 16 August 2001 as he\n\nwas at a hotel in Geylang. However, no evidence was produced to support his alibi even\n\nthough such evidence could easily have been obtained from the hotel’s records. During\n\nthe hearing of the appeal, nothing credible was advanced to show that the trial\n\njudge’s finding that Ruzaini was guilty of the charge faced by him should be\n\noverruled.16.\n\n        As for Isnin’s appeal, his counsel\n\nsubmitted that there was insufficient evidence to prove his guilt. Isnin admitted that he\n\nhad packed drugs in the apartment on two previous occasions, once alone and the other time\n\nwith Azman and Ruzaini. He had in his possession the Cascadale apartment keys and his\n\nfingerprint was on the master bedroom toilet ceiling, which concealed 23 packets of\n\nheroin. His explanation that his fingerprint was on the master bedroom toilet ceiling\n\nboard because \"Brother\" had asked him to check the apartment for breakage and\n\ndamage was not believable. He had earlier said that he checked the apartment to see if\n\nthere were more drugs there as he was frightened after he found drugs in the master\n\nbedroom. All these did not prevent him from staying on to pack drugs in the apartment.\n\nIndeed, when the CNB officers managed to enter the apartment, he was trying to flush drugs\n\ndown the toilet bowl. There was no evidence whatsoever to counter the inference that he\n\nwas in a willing party in the plan to traffic in the drugs and that he knew about all the\n\ndrugs found in the false ceiling of the Cascadale apartment. That being the case, he\n\nfailed to establish that the trial judge’s erred by finding that he was guilty of the\n\ncharge faced by him.17.\n\n        It is trite law that an appellate court will\n\nnot disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly against the weight of the evidence\n\nand that in examining the evidence, an appellate court must be mindful of the fact that\n\nthe trial judge has had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses (See, for instance,Lim\n\nAh Poh v Public Prosecutor[1992] 1 SLR 713, 719). If one looks at all the\n\ncircumstances of this case, it was not established that the trial judge had insufficient\n\nevidence before him to prove the appellants’ common intention to traffic in the drugs\n\nfound in the Cascadale apartment or that his conclusion that the appellants were in\n\npossession of the drugs found in the Cascadale apartment for the purpose of trafficking\n\nwas wrong. In view of this, we dismissed the appeals of all the three appellants.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHAO HICK TINTAN LEE MENGChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
