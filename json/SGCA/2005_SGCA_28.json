        "The appeal": "8The Public Prosecutor, who was of the view that Teo’s sentence was manifestly inadequate for his crime, submitted that the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to the following factors: (a)the vulnerability of the deceased; (b)the manner in which the offence was committed; (c)the sentencing trend; and (d)the additional charge faced by Teo with respect to the fabrication of false evidence. 9As far as the vulnerability of the deceased is concerned, this court reiterated inPurwanti Parji v PP[2005] 2 SLR 220that the law recognised the need to protect vulnerable and defenseless persons such as the handicapped, incapacitated, elderly and children. We thus agreed that the fact that the deceased was only seven months old was not given sufficient weight. 10As for the manner in which the offence was committed, it may be recalled that the hapless infant’s face changed colour, her stomach became bloated, there was a watery discharge from her nostrils and she retched and tried very hard to get rid of the poisonous substance from her body before she finally became unconscious. Admittedly, Teo did not kick or throw the infant onto the floor but feeding the helpless infant medicated oil and causing her so much pain and suffering is not in any way less heinous. Teo had on no less than four occasions applied medicated oil on the lips, nostrils and mouth of the infant whenever she cried. He was fully aware of the fact that the infant felt a burning sensation on her lips and nostrils after he applied it on her on the first occasion and when he poured medicated oil into the infant’s mouth, he could see that she moved her tongue in and out of her mouth and groaned in discomfort. This did not stop him from continuing to put medicated oil on her lips and nostrils and into her mouth until it was too late. 11We accept that where the court has a discretion in sentencing an offender, the sentence meted out in a particular case may vary from that imposed in other cases because of special circumstances. However, in the present case, there was nothing to justify a departure from the range of sentences meted out in other cases involving the death of children, which is more than the four years of imprisonment imposed on Teo. In many of such cases, the accused were, like Teo, also irritated by the wailing of children. 12Three such cases may be noted. In the first case,PP v Sumarni bte PonoCriminal Case No 11 of 2001, the mother of a child, aged two years, was so incensed by his crying that she carried him from his mattress, which was on the floor, and lifted him up to the level of her waist before dropping him onto the mattress. She then pulled his ears and knocked his head several times against the mattress. She pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(b) of the Penal Code for causing the death of her child and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years. 13In the second case,PP v Dwi Arti SamadCriminal Case No 12 of 2000, the accused, a female aged 22 years, was also irritated by the cries of an infant, aged 15 months. She picked him up from his pram and dropped him onto the floor. The child was killed and she pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. She was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. 14In the third case,PP v Devadass s/o SuppaiyahCriminal Case No 41 of 1997, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(b) of the Penal Code. He had held a baby, aged three months, by the neck and slapped him hard several times for crying. The baby died after being thrown onto a mattress on the floor. The accused was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. 15When compared to the sentences imposed in the above three cases, the sentence imposed by the court below in the present case was manifestly inadequate. Furthermore, it ought not be overlooked that in Teo’s case, another charge under s 193 of the Penal Code of fabricating false evidence must be taken into account. Teo’s attempt to deceive the police and subvert the course of justice by getting another person to take the rap for him was deplorable. It is trite that the effect of taking into consideration other offences is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise be awarded (see, for instance,PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice[1999] 1 SLR 138). 16Before concluding, a few words ought to be said about what Teo’s counsel referred to as his “history of acute situational reaction”. There was no concrete evidence of what effect this had on his actions and we would like to stress that a person with a history of acute situational reaction cannot be given a carte blanche to act without taking responsibility for his actions. 17For the reasons stated, we set aside the sentence imposed by the court below and substituted it with a sentence of imprisonment for a term of seven years. The sentence is to be backdated to 30 July 2004. Appeal allowed."
