        "Introduction": "21The first – and threshold – legal issue is whether or not the doctrine of restraint of trade applies to the Termination Agreement in the first place. 22Counsel for the appellant, Mr Alvin Yeo SC, sought to argue that the Termination Agreement was, in substance and effect, a settlement agreement, and that the doctrine of restraint of trade did not (as a matter of public policy) apply to settlement agreements. This argument, however, begged the question: Was the Termination Agreement a settlement agreement to begin with?",
        "The facts": "3          The respondent was the managing director and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of the appellant, a brokerage company, since 2 August 1996. 4          In May 2005, the respondent suggested a change of role. He informed Kevin Davis of Man Financial Ltd, a company related to the appellant, that he wished to step down as the appellant’s CEO in order to focus on business development in the region. 5          On 13 June 2005, Kevin Davis informed the respondent that he had decided to have someone else replace the respondent as CEO. However, Kevin Davis stated that because it would be difficult for the new CEO to perform his role in the presence of a former CEO, the respondent was to resign with immediate effect. Accordingly, the respondent was placed on “garden leave” from 13 June 2005 (“the Termination Date”) to 13 September 2005 while he served out a three-month notice period. The respondent was also handed a proposed termination agreement dated 13 June 2005 (“the Proposed Agreement”). The Proposed Agreement contained,inter alia, restrictive covenants on non-solicitation and non-competition for a period of one year from the Termination Date. However, the respondent did not agree to the provisions suggested by the appellant and therefore did not sign the Proposed Agreement immediately. 6          Many rounds of negotiation between the parties as to the contents of the Proposed Agreement soon followed (see, generally, [26]–[38] below). The Termination Agreement was finally executed on 23 June 2005, albeit dated 13 June 2005 (viz, the Termination Date). The salient portions of the Termination Agreement were as follows: C.Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition C.1.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you agree that for a period of seven (7) months from the Termination Date, that is, up to 13 January 2006 you shall not directly or indirectly employ or solicit the employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant) any person who is or was at any time during the period 13 June 2004 to 13 June 2005 an officer, director, representative or employee of the Company [ie, the appellant]. For avoidance of doubt, you shall not be deemed to employ any person unless you are involved or have otherwise provided input into the decision to hire such individual. …. C.3.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you agree that you will not either directly or indirectly for a period of seven (7) months from the Termination Date, that is up to 13 January 2006, anywhere in the world, organize, own, manage, operate, participate in, render advice to, control, or have an investment or ownership interest in any business that engages in the marketing and/or sale of products, services and/or systems which are in competition with those provided by the Company. … D.Release and Discharge D.1.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you hereby unconditionally and irrevocably discharge and release the Company, its parent, officers and directors, and their successors and assigns from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, charges, violation and/or liability whatsoever, known or unknown involving any matter arising out of or in any way related, directly or indirectly, to your employment with the Company or the termination thereof other than your entitlements and benefits under this Termination Agreement. … 7          Accordingly, under the Termination Agreement, the respondent was prohibited from,inter alia, soliciting the employment of certain employees of the appellant (under clause C.1 of the Termination Agreement (“Clause C.1”)) and participating in or rendering advice to a competitor for a period of seven months from the Termination Date (under clause C.3 of the Termination Agreement (“Clause C.3”)). The respondent was also to receive shares in Man Group plc (the appellant’s parent company) and a goodwill payment (“the Compensation”) from the appellant provided he did not breach the terms of the Termination Agreement. 8          Sometime in September 2005, before the respondent was due to be paid the Compensation, the appellant was informed that the respondent had solicited the employment of its employees or former employees, namely, one Tricia Ng Geok Tin (“Tricia”) and one Tan Siang Hwee (“Siang Hwee”), for a competing company, Refco (S) Pte Ltd (“Refco”). This was contrary to Clause C.1. The appellant was also informed that the respondent had participated in or rendered advice to Refco in breach of Clause C.3. As a consequence, the appellant declined to provide the Compensation. The respondent then sued the appellant for the Compensation. Not surprisingly, the respondent denied having acted in the manner alleged.",
        "The Judge’s findings and decision": "9          On the facts, the Judge essentially found in favour of the appellant, and held that the respondent had solicited the employment of at least two of the appellant’s employees (ie, Tricia and Siang Hwee) during the period from 13 June 2005 to 13 January 2006 (“the Prohibited Period”) and had rendered advice to Refco (see GD at [14]–[141]). However, notwithstanding his finding of fact against the respondent, the Judge found that the respondent was entitled to receive the Compensation. 10        In relation to Clause C.1, the Judge accepted the respondent’s interpretation of the provision and held that Clause C.1 applied only if the respondent had solicited the employment of others as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant of Refco; since the respondent had not done so in any such capacity, he was notprima faciein breach of Clause C.1 (see GD at [142]–[143]). In any event, the Judge held that Clause C.1 was invalid and, hence, unenforceable for being an unreasonable restraint of trade (see [12] below). 11        The Judge held that the burden was on the appellant to show the existence of an interest which merited the protection of the court and to demonstrate the reasonableness of the covenants concerned in terms of their not being wider than what was reasonably necessary to protect that interest. Counsel for the appellant at first instance, Mr Andre Maniam (“Mr Maniam”), submitted that the interest which Clause C.1 sought to protect was the maintenance of a stable workforce. In reply, counsel for the respondent, Mr Chia Ho Choon (“Mr Chia”), argued that in Singapore, the maintenance of a stable workforce was not a legitimate interest that could be protected by a restrictive covenant as Singapore was a very small country with limited resources. The Judge did not rule on whether the maintenance of a stable workforce was a legitimate interest meriting protection. However, he stated that even assuming that there was such a legitimate interest, the Termination Agreement did not actually spell out the appellant’s interests which required protection (see GD at [165]–[166]). For reasons that will be apparent below, we will have to deal with this particular holding. 12        As to the reasonableness of Clause C.1, the Judge held (see GD at [176]–[183]) that, even if the appellant had established that it had a legitimate interest to maintain a stable workforce, Clause C.1 was wider than what was reasonably necessary for the following reasons: (a)        Clause C.1 applied toanyandeveryemployee of the appellant without reference to his or her experience or importance. (b)        Clause C.1 applied even to those who had already left the appellant within one year before the Termination Date. (c)        Clause C.1, as it stood, extended even to employees whom the appellant did not want to continue employing. 13        In relation to Clause C.3, the Judge found that the respondent wasprima faciein breach of the provision (see GD at [127]–[133]). The Judge then considered whether Clause C.3 was invalid as an unreasonable restraint of trade. To that end, Mr Maniam contended that the respondent’s access to confidential information was the interest which the appellant was protecting thereunder. However, as in the case of Clause C.1, the Judge found (see GD at [172]) that there was no evidence to prove the respondent’s access to confidential information as well as the nature of the alleged confidential information. Accordingly, the Judge found that the appellant had failed to establish any legitimate interest meriting protection under Clause C.3 (see GD at [175]). 14        The Judge was further of the view (see GD at [184]–[191]) that the purpose and scope of Clause C.3 was anti-competition, and listed the following factors which militated against the reasonableness of that provision: (a)        There was no mention in Clause C.3 about the use of confidential information. (b)        Clause C.3 was wide enough even to prohibit the respondent from buying shares in a competitor which was listed on a stock exchange, even though such conduct would not necessarily involve misuse of the appellant’s confidential information. 15        Whilst we agree with the Judge’s ultimate decision on Clause C.3 (viz, that Clause C.3 could not be invoked to disentitle the respondent from claiming the Compensation), we differ, with respect,somewhat from the precise reasoning which he adopted (as set out briefly in the preceding paragraphs). In particular, we do not think that the e-mails and the g-mail set out at GD at [127]–[128] (which were isolated and informal in nature, and which were the grounds upon which the Judge found that there had,prima facie, been a breach of Clause C.3) fell within the ambit of Clause C.3. However, we do agree with the Judge that there was insufficient evidence adduced by the appellant to demonstrate an underlying legitimate proprietary interest which Clause C.3 was intended to protect. We are also of the view that Clause C.3 was, in any event, simply far too wide, particularly with regard to the area covered. Further, we are, with respect, unable to agreewith his decision with regard to Clause C.1. For reasons which we will elaborate upon in more detail below (at [137]–[142]), we are of the viewthat Clause C.1 was reasonable. We are also of the view that Clause C.1 was in fact breached on the facts of the present case (see below at [18]). 16        The Judge proceeded to find that the restrictive covenants in the Termination Agreement (ie, clauses C.1–C.3 thereof) as well as the respondent’s agreement, pursuant to clause D.1 of the Termination Agreement (“Clause D.1”), to discharge and release the appellant from all claims (save for the claims specifically excluded by Clause D.1) constituted the main, though not the sole, consideration for the Compensation (see GD at [214]). The invalidity of Clause C.1 and Clause C.3 did not change the character of the bargain. In the Judge’s view, the invalidity of these two restrictive covenants merely meant that the appellant had obtained less in return for agreeing to provide the Compensation (see GD at [215]). As such, the Judge severed Clause C.1 and Clause C.3 from the Termination Agreement, and ordered the appellant to provide the Compensation to the respondent. We should point out at this juncture that whilst we agree with the Judge in so far as the established principles of law relating to severance are concerned (which we will consider briefly at [126]–[131] below), we do not, with respect, agree with hisapplicationof those rules and principles to the facts of the present appeal. In particular, we do not agree with the Judge’s finding (see GD at [216]–[218]) that Clause C.1 and Clause C.3 did not constitute all, or substantially all, of the consideration for the Compensation (see below at [128]). However, because we found, having regard to the applicable principles of law, that Clause C.1 was a reasonable clause, this issue did not, strictly speaking, arise for decision in the present appeal. 17        On a consideration of all the facts, we accept all thefactualfindings of the Judge(with the exception of the finding that there had,prima facie, been a breach of Clause C.3 (see above at [15])). In particular, we affirm the Judge’s finding that the respondent had, during the Prohibited Period, solicited at least two of the appellant’s employees to work for Refco. However, wediffer, with respect, from the Judge on one crucial point. As mentioned at [15] above, we are of the view that therehad, in fact, been a breach of Clause C.1 (which is reproduced above at [6]). In particular, we are of the view that the words in parentheses in that particular clause (viz, “whether as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant”) applied not to the capacity in which the respondent acted when soliciting the employment of others, but, rather, the position for which he solicited the latter’s employment. Significantly, in our view, the Judge would have arrived at the same conclusion but for the fact that the appellant had, at paragraph 8 of its re-amended defence, stated that the respondent had solicited the employment of the appellant’s employees “as an agent or consultant of a company in competition with [the appellant]” (see GD at [143]). At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer to the following observations made by this court in the recent decision ofLee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor[2007] 3 SLR 537at [81]–[82]: 81         The following observation by Bowen LJ inCropper v Smith(1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710–711, (albeit in the context of the amendment of pleadings), is apposite: I think it is a well established principle that the object of Courts is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights …I know of no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the other party. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline, but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy, and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or of grace. … It seems to me that as soon as it appears that the way in which a party has framed his case will not lead to a decision of the real matter in controversy, it is as much a matter of right on his part to have it corrected, if it can be done without injustice, as anything else in the case is a matter of right. [emphasis added] 82         We are fully in agreement with Bowen LJ. The rules of court practice and procedure exist to provide a convenient framework to facilitate dispute resolution and to serve the ultimate and overriding objective of justice. Such an objective must never be eclipsed by blind or pretended fealty to rules of procedure. On the other hand, a pragmatic approach governed by justice as its overarching aim should not be viewed as a charter to ignore procedural requirements. In the ultimate analysis, each case involving procedural lapses or mishaps must be assessed in its proper factual matrix and calibrated by reference to the paramount rationale of dispensing even handed justice. 18        Even if we adopt what appears to us to be an excessively strict view in so far as adherence to pleadings is concerned, we would nevertheless conclude that the respondent did, in fact, solicit the employment of the appellant’s employees as an “agent” of Refco for the purposes of Clause C.1. It is true that,technically speaking, the respondent could not,ex hypothesi, have been on the payroll of Refco at the material period – at least in so far as the first three months of the Prohibited Period were concerned (since the respondent was on “garden leave” then). However, this itself gives us a clue as to the substance – and, more importantly, the spirit – of Clause C.1. In particular, the clause was not intended by the contracting parties to operate in a vacuum. Furthermore, contracting parties do not enter into agreements which are futile. In the circumstances, therefore, the reasonable inference to draw is that the appellant and the respondent intended Clause C.1 to proscribe any form of soliciting the employment of the appellant’s employeesthroughoutthe Prohibited Period. The fact that the respondent was not, strictly speaking, on the payroll of Refco at the material time should not detract from such a construction as to how the clause was intended to operate. Indeed, the Judge himself acknowledged, at various points in his judgment, that the respondent was in fact soliciting the employment of the employees concerned for Refco (see, for example, GD at [108] and (especially) [113]). We are therefore of the view that the respondentdid, in fact, breach Clause C.1 by soliciting the employment of those employees. 19        Tosummarise, whilst we agree with the Judge that Clause C.3 did not pass muster under the applicable principles relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade, we find, however (and contrary to the decision of the Judge), that Clause C.1 was, in fact, both applicable on the factsandwas also reasonable (pursuant to the applicable principles relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade). Hence, the doctrine of severance did not arise for our decision. More importantly, there having been a breach of Clause C.1 by the respondent (see the preceding paragraph), the issue of the legal consequences of that breach arose for our decision. However, during the course of oral submissions before us, yet another issue – this time, a threshold one – arose: Did the doctrine of restraint of trade apply to the Termination Agreement in the first instance? Indeed, given the fact that a number of related issues (in particular, the last-mentioned one) were not, in fact, canvassed before us during the first hearing, we invited further written submissions from the parties and also heard further oral submissions thereon. In the circumstances, it would be helpful, therefore, if we first itemise the main issues which were ultimately crystallised before us for determination before proceeding to set out our decision on each issue, as well as on the appeal as a whole.",
        "The issues on appeal": "20        The main issues before this court, as eventually delineated by the parties, were as follows: (a)        Does the doctrine of restraint of trade apply to the Termination Agreement? (b)        Assuming that the doctrine of restraint of trade applies to the Termination Agreement, was Clause C.1 reasonable within the applicable principles of that doctrine? (c)        If Clause C.1 was reasonable within the applicable principles of the doctrine of restraint of trade, what were the consequences of a breach of that clause?",
        "Does the doctrine of restraint of trade apply to the Termination Agreement?": "",
        "Was the Termination Agreement a fresh contract or a settlement agreement?": "23We note, at the outset, that the Termination Agreement was precisely that – an agreement between an employer (here, the appellant) and an employee (here, the respondent) that sought to govern the ending or termination of the contractual employment relationship between them. Put simply, an agreement of this nature would – as was the case here – comprisefresh or newtermsvis-à-visafreshor newcontract thatsupplementsthe original employment contract between the parties by, as just mentioned, stipulating the legal rights and obligations which will govern the closure of their employment relationship. 24From this perspective, the Termination Agreement wasnota settlement agreement (the latter being a contract that seeks to compromise existing disputes between the contracting parties). What, though, about the various negotiations – in particular, the correspondence (which will be considered in more detail below) that led to the restraint of trade clauses in the Termination Agreement, which clauses did not hitherto exist in theoriginalemployment contract between the parties? In our view, the answer lies in the question itself. If,ex hypothesi, the restraint of trade clauses did not exist in the original employment contract but constituted terms within theTermination Agreementonly, then they were, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph,fresh or newterms in afresh or newcontract. In other words, these clauses wereneitherthe subject of aprior legal disputewhich had been settled,noragreed on to compromise an existing dispute, by way of the Termination Agreement. 25        Indeed, a close perusal of the relevant e-mail correspondence alluded to in the preceding paragraph demonstrates that the Termination Agreement was asupplementary contractentered into between the parties to effect closure of their then existing employment relationship. In this regard, looking at the context and the circumstances of the present case (which are set out in detail below), it is our view that the Termination Agreement was not a mere variation of the existing employment contract between the appellant and the respondent, but was, instead, a separate and independent contract in itself. However, to the extent that the Termination Agreement effected closure of the employment relationship between the parties, it can, in substance at least, be construed ascomplementingthe parties’ then existing employment contract. 26        The starting point of the Termination Agreement was a letter headed “Termination Agreement” from the appellant (signed by one of its directors, Christopher Smith (“Smith”)) to the respondent dated 13 June 2005 setting out the terms of the Proposed Agreement. 27        The respondent replied to Smith’s letter of 13 June 2005 via an e-mail of the same date. The material portions of the respondent’s reply were as follows: 1.         I have no issue with serving out my full notice period. 2.I trust that, as agreed to earlier today, my bonus for Financial Year 2005, will not be tied in any way to the termination notice period and that it will be duly paid. 3.As my employment agreement does not in fact provide for any restraint on what I can do after my employment ends, your request for me to accept such restraints for a period of one year is inappropriate. As a general rule we should proceedaccording to my employment agreement. 4.         You will appreciate that any agreement by me of any formal restrictions to what I can do prejudices my employment prospects after I leave you. 5.However, as a gesture of goodwill (in reciprocation of your gesture of goodwill), I am willing to consider a non-solicitation restraint (of both clients and staff) for a period of three months from the termination of my full notice period. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 28        We pause to note that the respondent’s original employment contract with the appellant did not, indeed, contain any covenants in restraint of trade at all. It is clear that by including such covenants in the Proposed Agreement, the appellant was attempting to tie the respondent down for the suggested period of one calendar year. This is not surprising in view of the nature of the appellant’s business and (correspondingly) the respondent’s employment. We also note that, notwithstanding paragraph 2 of the e-mail set out in the preceding paragraph, one of the terms in the Proposed Agreement, in particular, clause B.1(i) thereof, did in fact state that the appellant would pay the sum of US$1,147,353 to the respondent as his bonus for the financial year 2005 in consideration of,inter alia, “[his] serving out [his] Notice Period on leave from the office”. (This sum, as we shall see, was later adjusted down to US$1,092,325 in clause A.6 of the Termination Agreement.) 29        It is also interesting to note that in paragraph 5 of his e-mail to the appellant (ie, the e-mail reproduced above at [27]), the respondent stated that he was, “as a gesture of goodwill”, willing to consider thenon-solicitationcovenants suggested in Smith’s letter of 13 June 2005 (ie, the letter mentioned at [26] above). This remark by the respondent is significant because those non-solicitation clauses (in particular, Clause C.1) were precisely the terms that lay at the heart of the present appeal. It is equally important to note that the respondent’s e-mail shows that there wasno disputebetween the parties overpriorcovenants in the then existing (original) employment contract. 30        Smith then responded (also via e-mail on the same day,viz, 13 June 2005) on behalf of the appellant, referring, first, to a revised letter that sought to deal with paragraph 2 of the respondent’s e-mail (reproduced above at [27]) with regard to the payment of the bonus for the financial year 2005. Smith also stated: With regard to your other points we will think about this and come back to you. However, as Kevin [ie, Kevin Davis of Man Financial Ltd] suggested this morning, I think that it is best if this is discussed through our lawyers. 31        The respondent responded to the e-mail in the preceding paragraph via an e-mail dated 14 June 2005 (addressed to Smith). The material portions of the respondent’s e-mail read as follows: 1.         I actually see no need or role for any lawyer in this matter. 2.         We should simply proceed as is provided by my contract of employment. A reading of that will show: 2.1I have earned and am entitled to my bonus for the previous financial year, FY 05. Accordingly, the payment of this bonus should be unconditional. 2.2        I need to give three months notice of termination – I have done this and also confirmed that I will serve out the full period of notice, even going on gardening [sic] leave for the duration at your request. 3.My contract of employment provides for no post employment restraints.Any agreement on this issue is therefore a private agreement to be negotiated between us.I have had this confirmed legally already. The lawyers therefore have no role to play except to documentour agreement. I have already stated what I am willing to agree to as a gesture of goodwill.Whilst I see no point in discussing what is a commercial and private issue with or through lawyers, if you so wish for communications with yourselves to be via your lawyers, please have Ameera [Ms Ameera Ashraf, the appellant’s lawyer (“Ms Ameera”)] contact me directly. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 32        The appellant responded to the respondent’s e-mail of 14 June 2005 (ie, the e-mail set out in the preceding paragraph) through its lawyer, Ms Ameera, who sent the respondent an e-mail dated 15 June 2005. The material parts of Ms Ameera’s e-mail read as follows: 1.         Thank you for your email below. 2.         You have asserted that you are not obliged to accept the non-solicitation clauses in the Termination Agreement, as these clauses do not form part of your contract of employment.You will appreciate, having reviewed your contract of employment, that it does not provide for any additional sums to be paid to you upon your resignation.Thus Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd’s (the “Company”)[viz, the appellant’s]offer to make a substantial goodwill payment to you as well as give[sic]you shares which have not as yet vested under the Man Group plc’s Coinvestment Schemes, are not benefits that you are entitled to at law. The Company makes this offer in return for your agreement to the terms set out in the Termination Agreement. 3.         The Company, however, notes your offer to consider a clause which provides for non-solicitation of both clients and employees for a period ofthree months afterthe end of your Notice Period.Towards achieving an amicable resolution to this matter,in consideration of your agreement to the non-solicitation of both clients and employees for a period offour months[underlining in original]after the end of your Notice Period i.e. until 13 January 2006, the Company will agree to make payment of the benefits set out above at the end of your Notice Period. 5. [sic]  We regret to say that, in the interests of achieving a quick resolution to these issues, this is the Company’s final offer on the matters above and we trust that you will find this offer reasonable and acceptable. Please consult your solicitors if necessary. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 33The next material piece of correspondence is an e-mail (also dated 15 June 2005) from the respondent’s lawyers (the respondent having obtained his own legal representation by then) to the appellant’s lawyers. In essence, this piece of correspondence referred to a telephone conversation between the parties’ lawyers, in which one of the respondent’s lawyers, Mr Quek Li Fei (“Mr Quek”), who was also the writer of this particular e-mail, informed one of the appellant’s lawyers (viz, Ms Ameera) that his firm was now acting for the respondent in the matter. Mr Quek’s short e-mail also stated: As spoken, we are presently taking our client’s instructions on your email of even date to our client timed at 12.26pm [ie, the e-mail from Ms Ameera to the respondent referred to in the preceding paragraph] as well as on the terms of the draft Termination Agreement and hope to revert to you shortly thereafter. 34In follow-up to the e-mail in the preceding paragraph, Mr Quek sent a further e-mail (also dated 15 June 2005). This piece of correspondence is significant because it enclosed a copy of the Proposed Agreement set out in Smith’s letter of 13 June 2005 (see above at [26]),but with the respondent’s manuscript amendments appended thereto. These amendments (denoted in the following passage by the text which has been struck through and by the bold underlined text) constitutedthe respondent’scounterproposals, and included,inter alia, proposed amendments toClause C.1, as follows: C.1.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you agree that for a period ofone (1) yearseven (7) monthsfrom the date of this letter,that is, up to 13 January 2006[,] you shall not directly or indirectly employ or solicit the employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant) any person who is or was at any times [sic] duringthis past year2005 year to datean officer, director, representative or employee of the Company. For avoidance of doubt, you shall not be deemed to employ any person unless you are involved or have otherwise provided input into the decision to hire such individual. 35Another significant amendment proposed by the respondent was the addition of a new clause B.2, which read as follows: All sums expressed to be payable to you in this letter shall be paid by the Company in full and without deduction by or on their respective due dates. 36        Both of these clauses will figure prominently later in this judgment when we deal with the true nature of Clause C.1 in the context ofthe consequences of its breach. 37        Returning to the relevant correspondence between the parties, Mr Quek’s second e-mail of 15 June 2005 (see [34] above) was not yet the end of the matter inasmuch as the terms of the Termination Agreement had still not been finalised. Ms Ameera responded (on behalf of the appellant) to Mr Quek via an e-mail dated 17 June 2005 stating that the appellant was “not agreeable” to the respondent’s proposed amendments. In reply, Mr Quek sent Ms Ameera an e-mail of the same date basically acknowledging receipt of her e-mail. 38        The appellant and the respondent finally arrived at an agreement, embodied in the Termination Agreement, on 23 June 2005. It is interesting to note, in this regard, thatClause C.1in itsfinalisedform, whilst slightly different from the version proposed bythe respondent(which is set out at [34] above), nevertheless incorporatedthe respondent’s proposed time frame of seven monthsas the period of restraint. Thisfinalisedversion of Clause C.1 (which we reproduced earlier at [6]) read as follows: C.1.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you agree that for a period of seven (7) months from the Termination Date, that is, up to 13 January 2006 you shall not directly or indirectly employ or solicit the employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant) any person who is or was at any time during the period 13 June 2004 to 13 June 2005 an officer, director, representative or employee of the [appellant]. For avoidance of doubt, you shall not be deemed to employ any person unless you are involved or have otherwise provided input into the decision to hire such individual. 39        Another interesting point to note is thatclause B.2(in itsfinalisedform) of the Termination Agreement (“Clause B.2”) was, in fact,quite differentfrom the version proposed bythe respondent(see [35] above), and read as follows: B.2.Save in the event that you breach any of the terms of this Termination Agreement, the sums set out in B.1(b) above will be paid to you in full and without deduction at the end of the Notice Period, on 13 September 2005. [emphasis added] 40        On a more general level, we should emphasise thatif a particular agreement between existing contracting parties is intended to encompass or embody a settlement or compromise, it would be prudent for the parties concerned to state this clearly in the contract itself. If that is not done, the court will, as in thepresentcase, construe the contract concerned objectively, having regard to the relevant terms in thecontextin which they were arrived at and the substance of the contract. In the final analysis, substance is more important than form. In the present appeal, what is important is the fact that the correspondence set out above points clearly to one thing (and one thing alone):The very pith and marrow of the Termination Agreement centred on the closure of the existing employment relationship between the appellant and the respondent.This agreement wasnot, in other words, a contract that sought to compromise or settleexisting disputesbetween the parties in respect ofexisting covenants or clauses in restraint of trade. Indeed, in the respondent’s own affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) at paragraph 20.8, it was clearly acknowledged that the consideration set out in clause B.1 of the Termination Agreement (“Clause B.1”) consisted of the covenants which the respondent was to observe during the Prohibited Period. Not surprisingly, Smith’s AEIC (at paragraph 8 thereof) reflected a similar acknowledgment. 41We are therefore of the view that the Termination Agreement in the present appeal wasnot, in substance, a settlement agreement to begin with. It was instead, in substance and effect,an agreement that was complementary to the original employment contract between the appellant and the respondent. In the circumstances, all the terms of the Termination Agreement must – in the present appeal at least – therefore be subject to the doctrine of restraint of trade. 42However, since much time was spent on the question of whether or not the doctrine of restraint of trade applies to settlement agreements, we will set out our views on this particular issue, although, in view of our characterisation of the Termination Agreement (as set out in the preceding paragraph), the issue did not, strictly speaking, arise for a direct decision.",
        "Does the doctrine of restraint of trade apply to settlement agreements?": "The issue 43If we assume that the Termination Agreement was a settlement agreement (an assumption that, as we held above, wasnotborne out by the facts of this appeal), would it follow that the doctrine of restraint of trade is thereforeexcluded in limineon the basis that there is a clear public policy in favour of upholding genuine settlement or compromise agreements? By “genuine”, we mean a settlement or compromise agreement that isnotrendered either void or voidable byvitiating factors. If, of course, one or more vitiating factors operate, then that settlement or compromise agreement would not be recognised in law. 44        In analysing this issue, there are,in effect,two separate and distinct facets of public policyto be considered – one relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade, and the other relating to the upholding of genuine settlement or compromise agreements, respectively. The public policy underlying the doctrine of restraint of trade 45        Thefirstof the aforesaid aspects of public policy (viz, that relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade) is a clearly established one (for convenience of exposition, we refer to it hereafter as “Public Policy 1”). This doctrine is traditionally analysed in contract textbooks under the rubric of “illegality and public policy”. More specifically, the doctrine seeks to vindicate the legal right to freedom of trade while balancing, at the same time, the countervailing doctrine of freedom of contract. It remains the law, however, that covenants that fall foul of the doctrine of restraint of trade will (subject to certain conditions) be rendered unenforceable. To that extent, the doctrine endorses (with the requisite balance) the public policy which legally negates attempts to unreasonably proscribe freedom of trade. Whilst we wouldnotgo so far as to state that the doctrine of restraint of tradealwaysapplies ineverycontractual context, we note that its application in the context ofemploymentiswell established. Indeed, given the strength of therationalefor the application of this doctrine in the employment context, it is, in our view, clear that the doctrine would apply in this particular contexteven ifthere has beena compromiseof proceedings (subject to the qualification set out below (especially at [65])). The rationale for this is “the importance of the free flow of expertise in the context of the welfare of the country as a whole: a factor that presumably relates to the public interest” (seeButterworths Common Law Series: The Law of Contract(Michael Furmston gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) (“Butterworths Common Law Series”) at para 5.117). In other words, an individual’s freedom to exercise his skills as an employee as well as the benefit to the wider society that would ensue are, in one sense at least, two equally important sides of the same coin. Indeed, in the leading House of Lords decision ofHerbert Morris, Limited v Saxelby[1916] 1 AC 688 (“Herbert Morris”), Lord Atkinson (citing the judgment of Sir W M James VC inLeather Cloth Company v Lorsont(1869–70) LR 9 Eq 345 at 354) emphasised (at 701) that every person should be at liberty to work for himself or herself, and ought not (in principle) to deprive either himself or herself,orthe State, of his or her labour, skill and talents. 46        And, in the English Court of Appeal decision ofNagle v Feilden[1966] 2 QB 633, Lord Denning MR observed thus (at 646): [A] man’s right to work at his trade or profession is just as important to him as, perhaps more important than, his rights or property. Just as the courts will intervene to protect his rights of property, they will also intervene to protect his right to work. 47        All the various reasons which support both the substance as well as the spirit underlying the law on covenants in restraint of trade in the employment context are of universal importance, and hence apply, in our view, inSingaporewith equal force. 48        It should also be noted that, when comparing restraint of trade covenants in theemploymentcontext with those in the other well-established scenario where restraint of trade likewise features (viz, in the context ofthe sale of a business), the courts scrutinise the covenants in the former context far more strictly. (There are, of course, occasional cases where a hybrid situation might present itself, of which a prominent illustration is the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong) inRobin M Bridge v Deacons[1984] 1 AC 705, where the fact situation bore some resemblance to both the situations just referred to.) As has been observed (seeButterworths Common Law Series([45]supra) at para 5.114): The reasons for this [ie, a stricter application of the restraint of trade doctrine in the employment context] include the following. First, unlike contracts of employment, the purchaser in a sale of business of context in whose favour the covenant is made is buying something tangible, which includes (very importantly) the element ofgoodwillwhich would be necessarily depreciated if no restrictive covenant were permitted. An employer, on the other hand, would not be deprived of what he has paid for pursuant to the contract of employment (the employee’s services) when the employee leaves his employ, although (as shall be seen) there are other legitimate proprietary interests that may merit protection even within this context.Secondly, there is likely to be more equality of bargaining power in the case of the sale of a business compared to an employment contract situation; in the latter, there is, more often than not, a disparity in bargaining power between the employer on the one hand and the employee on the other.[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] The public policy in favour of upholding genuine settlement or compromise agreements 49        Thesecondfacet of public policy mentioned above at [44] (which we will hereafter refer to as “Public Policy 2” for convenience of exposition) raises the question of whether or not, assuming there has been a genuine settlement or compromise agreementvis-à-visdisputes over covenants or clauses in restraint of trade in an existing contract,thatsettlement or compromise agreement can bere-openedby way of the application of the doctrine of restraint of trade. The key argument that supports anegativeanswer to this question is the clear public policy in favour of upholding “genuine” (as defined at [43] above) settlement or compromise agreements. 50        One possible logical difficulty with adopting such an approach is that covenants in restraint of tradeprima faciefall within the vitiating factor of illegality and public policy. However, it is arguable that these covenants do not always fall within that category of illegality and public policy which taints a contract in such a legally indelible manner as to render it impossible to uphold. (This isa fortiorithe case with regard to a contract that is aimed at resolving an existing dispute over a restraint of trade clause in a prior agreement.) In this regard, it has been argued that there can be degrees of illegality (seeButterworths Common Law Seriesat paras 5.10–5.15). Indeed, and more importantly, in the English decision ofBoddington v Lawton[1994] ICR 478, Sir Donald Nicholls VC (at 490) drewa distinction between contracts in restraint of trade and other unlawful contracts such as one to commit murder(see also the analogous argument on the scope of application of the doctrine of severance, albeit with possible modifications with regard to certain common law rules, inButterworths Common Law Seriesat paras 5.223–5.224).Further, it might be argued that sincebothan individual’s freedom to work at his trade or profession and the sanctity of a compromise or settlement agreement are centred onpublic policy, the countervailing public policy which isstrongerought to prevail. We shall return to this specific difficulty later (at [64]–[68] below). Which facet of public policy (if at all) should prevail? (a)        A preliminary point – when does the doctrine of restraint of trade apply? 51        Put simply, if there is an actual or a potential conflict between Public Policy 1 and Public Policy 2, which (if at all) should prevail? 52        However, before the question in the preceding paragraph can be answered, it must necessarily be assumed that the doctrine of restraint of trade applies in the first instance. In this regard, this particular issue is more apparent than real in most cases before the court because the bulk of these cases deal, in the main, with either an employment situation or the sale of a business, where, as noted at [45] and [48] above, it is clear that the doctrine applies. 53        Indeed, theonlyarea where the threshold issue of whether or not this doctrine applies has been raised with any significance is in the context ofsolus agreements. A solus agreement is, in essence, one entered into between an oil company on the one hand and a garage proprietor on the other. The agreement will traditionally contain three covenants entered into by the garage proprietor (or, in the local context, the petrol station proprietor). The first is a “tying” covenant pursuant to which the garage proprietor undertakes to purchase all petrol and other allied petroleum products from the oil company. The second is a “compulsory trading” covenant pursuant to which the garage proprietor agrees to keep the garage (or petrol station) open at all reasonable times. The third is a “continuity” covenant pursuant to which the garage proprietor promises to extract similar undertakings from any potential buyer of his garage business during the period of the solus agreement itself. These three covenants benefit the oil company by enabling it to systematically plan as well as organise its business over a reasonably considerable period of time. The garage proprietor obtains, in return, rebates on the petrol and other products sold; it also often obtains advances of money or loans to aid in the purchase and/or development of the premises concerned. 54        So much by way of background in so far assolus agreementsare concerned. What is germane for our present purposes is the issue of whether or not, in order for the doctrine of restraint of trade to operate in the context ofsolus agreements, the covenantor (ie, the garage proprietor) must give up some freedom or right which it had prior to entering into the solus agreement. A paradigm instance of such a freedom or right would be where the garage premises areownedby the covenantor at the time it enters into the covenants in restraint of trade (see, for example, the leading House of Lords decision ofEsso Petroleum Co Ltd v Harper’s Garage (Stourport) Ltd[1968] AC 269 (“Esso Petroleum”)). 55There was, in fact, a difference of opinion inEsso Petroleumitself as to whether or not the covenantor had to give up some prior freedom or right before the doctrine of restraint of trade could be invoked. The majority of the House responded to this particular issue in the affirmative, whereas Lord Wilberforce preferred (idat 332–333 and 335–336) a more open-ended approach which centred, instead, on trade practice. 56The approach of the majority of the House inEsso Petroleumhas, in fact, been the subject of rather trenchant criticism by one of the foremost experts on the doctrine of restraint of trade in the Commonwealth (see, generally, J D Heydon, “The Frontiers of the Restraint of Trade Doctrine” (1969) 85 LQR 229 and, by the same author,The Restraint of Trade Doctrine(Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1999) at pp 51–54), with the main argument being that such an approach is based more on form rather than substance and could, therefore, lead to anomalous results. 57Interestingly, in theSingaporecontext, Lim Teong Qwee JC, in the Singapore High Court decision ofShell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd v Chuan Hong Auto (Pte) Ltd[1995] 3 SLR 281, expressed (at 290–291, [20]–[21]), albeit by way ofobiter dicta, a preference for the broader approach advocated by Lord Wilberforce inEsso Petroleum(Lim JC’s decision was affirmed on appeal, but without consideration of this particular point: seeChuan Hong Auto (Pte) Ltd v Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd[1996] 1 SLR 415). And, for a summary of the position in Australia, where the issue has not been conclusively decided by the case law thus far, seeButterworths Common Law Series([45]supra) at para 5.125). 58        It should, however, be noted that this court, inNational Aerated Water Co Pte Ltd v Monarch Co, Inc[2000] 2 SLR 24(“National Aerated Water Co”), appeared (at [29]) to endorse the approach of the majority inEsso Petroleumin the context of a licensing agreement under which the covenantor gave up some freedom in return for the right to produce, distribute and sell bottled carbonated water bearing a certain trade mark. In particular, the court observed (ibid) that there had, on the facts, been a restriction on the freedom of the covenantor to trade or sell any beverage of its choice which fell under the criteria listed in the agreement. However, this appeared to be a passing observation by the court. In any event, it does not impact adversely on the wider question that is germane to the present appeal,viz, whether or not the doctrine of restraint of trade applies to situations where there has been a settlement agreement or compromise arrangement. Indeed, the observation inNational Aerated Water Coitself appears to be rather broad and would tend to suggest that the doctrine of restraint of trade probably applies inmost (or virtually all)situations. It would appear, therefore, that this particular issue (ie, whether the covenantor must give up some pre-existing freedom or right before the doctrine of restraint of trade applies)remains openfor a definitive ruling in the future. (b)        ThePanayiotoucase 59        Assuming, however, that the doctrine of restraint of trade applies, what would be the effect of a genuine settlement or compromise agreementvis-à-visan existing dispute over a covenant or clause in restraint of trade? Would such an agreement still be subject to scrutiny to ensure that it does not fall foul of the doctrine of restraint of trade, or should Public Policy 2 take precedence instead? 60        In the English High Court decision ofPanayiotou v Sony Music Entertainment (UK) Limited[1994] EMLR 229(“Panayiotou”), there was a clear endorsement of Public Policy 2 in preference to Public Policy 1. There, Jonathan Parker J held that, notwithstanding the fact that the doctrine of restraint of trade wouldordinarilyapply to covenants or clauses in restraint of trade inemployment contracts, where such covenants or clauses werethe outcome of settlement or compromise of proceedings, there was “a clear public interestin upholding genuine and proper compromises” [emphasis added] (idat 345), and, hence, such covenants or clauses wouldnotfall within the ambit of the doctrine of restraint of tradein the first instance. 61        There are, in our view, compelling reasons in favour of the approach adopted inPanayiotou. If the contracting parties had a dispute over an existing covenant or clause in restraint of tradeandvoluntarily arrived at a settlement or compromise in respect of that particular covenant or clause, why should one party be permitted, in law, to re-open the matter all over again? If, in fact, the dissatisfied party was induced to enter into the settlement or compromise agreement by the other party’s utilisation of a vitiating factor, the former could invoke the particular vitiating factor concerned to impugn the settlement or compromise agreement. In the absence of proof of one or more vitiating factors operating on the facts of the case itself, there is no reason, in principle, why a court should allow a dispute which has already been settled or compromised to be re-opened all over again. Significantly, Jonathan Parker J did, inPanyiotou, suggest that where the settlement or compromise agreement was entered into in circumstances of extreme inequality which amounted to unconscionable conduct, the conclusion arrived at by the court would be quite different. 62We would add that there is nothing in Public Policy 1 which makes it undesirable to honour settlement or compromise agreements of this nature. The situation would, in our view, bequite differentif, for example, the parties had entered into a settlement or compromise agreement that sought to outflank a statutory provision or common law rule which quite clearly prevented the parties concerned from contracting out of it. (In this regard, whether or not a particularstatutory provisionprevents the contracting parties from contracting out of it depends on the policy of the statute concerned, which must be clearly expressedandwhich must seek to protect a sufficiently weighty public interest: see, for example, the oft-cited House of Lords decision ofJohnson v Moreton[1980] AC 37.) In contrast, if there is a genuine difference of opinion as to whether or not such a statutory provision or common law rule applies to the facts of the case in the first instance (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision ofBinder v Alachouzos[1972] 2 QB 151), there would, of course, be no difficulty in enforcing a settlement or compromise agreement. 63However, in the leading Commonwealth textbook on settlements and compromise (see David Foskett,The Law and Practice of Compromise(Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2005)), it has been observed (consistent with the rationale canvassed above) thus, at para 4-83: The common law approach to covenants in unreasonable restraint of tradeapply[sic]to the employer-employee relationship and, in particular, to the position of the employee after the termination of the contract of employment. Any compromise of a dispute between an employer and an employee that offends the principles encompassed within this approach will be unenforceable.[emphasis added] 64        The above argument appears, in fact, to adopt the view that the public policy inherent in Public Policy 1 is so important that it must perforce always override or trump the public policy inherent in Public Policy 2. However, with respect, that is, as we mentioned earlier at [51],preciselythe question that has to be answered. To this end, and having regard to the arguments canvassed above at [45]–[62], it is our view that logic, principle and fairness entail that Public Policy 2 ought to override or trump Public Policy 1. However, this isnotablanketproposition, and it is therefore imperative to delineatethe precise conditionsunder which Public Policy 2 will so prevail; to this, we now turn. Circumstances in which Public Policy 2 prevails over Public Policy 1 65In our view, Public Policy 2 overrides or trumps Public Policy 1 only where the following conditions arecumulativelymet: (a)        the settlement or compromise agreement relates to the settlement or compromise of aprior dispute over a covenant or clause in restraint of tradein anexisting contract; and (b)        the settlement or compromise agreement itself isnottainted by one or morevitiating factors. 66        We are cognisant of the possible argument that the above conditions cover too narrow a compass. However, we do not agree with this argument. The approach we strike is, in our view, an appropriate conceptual as well as practical balance between Public Policy 1 and Public Policy 2. In our view, the doctrine of restraint of trade ought not to be excluded out of hand whenever there is a settlement or compromise of a dispute over contractual termsother thanthose which relate to anexisting covenant or clause in restraint of trade. But, reverting to the facts of the present appeal, can it not be argued that there was, in this case, a settlement or compromise that resulted in the covenants in the Termination Agreement? As we have already explained above (at [24]), those covenants were arrived at through negotiations between the appellant and the respondent. More importantly, the Termination Agreement ultimately signed by the parties wasnota settlement or compromise agreement as such, but was, rather, anew and distinctcontract altogether (see [25] and [41] above). At themost literallevel, the toing and froing between the parties might be characterised as “disputes”. However, thesubstanceof their discussions on the Proposed Agreement (which culminated in the Termination Agreement) constituted no more than the usual disagreements on specific proposed terms that take place between parties negotiating a contract before they ultimately arrive at a final (and legally binding) agreement. 67        In any event, even if the approach we have adopted (ie, that Public Policy 2 prevails over Public Policy 1 only if the agreement containing the restraint of trade clause is a settlement or compromise of a dispute over another earlier (pre-existing) covenant in restraint of trade) is perceived to be somewhat narrow, this is, in our view, not an undesirable outcome, especially given the importance of protecting an employee against unreasonable covenants or clauses in restraint of trade (see, generally, [45]–[48] above). Moreover, our approach does not completely ignore the legal effect of a settlement or compromise agreement (provided it does not, we reiterate, fall foul of one or more vitiating factors). 68        Finally, we observe that the distinction drawn by Mr Chia between the compromise of a dispute over thevalidityof a covenant or clause in restraint of trade on the one hand, which, he argued, was the case inPanayiotou([60]supra) (and in which situation Public Policy 2 should take precedence over Public Policy 1), and a compromise that resulted in anagreementcontaining covenants or clauses in restraint of trade, which, he argued, was the case here (and in which situation Public Policy 1 should prevail instead), would have been broadly consistent with the approach adopted in the present appeal save for the fact that the latter situation doesnotconstitutea settlement or compromiseas such, but, instead, constitutes (as explained above at [66]) negotiations which lead to the parties arriving at afreshagreement containing covenants or clauses in restraint of trade.",
        "Was Clause C.1 reasonable within the applicable principles relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade?": "",
        "The applicable legal principles": "Introduction 152      The applicable legal principles relating to the consequences of a breach of contract were recently dealt with in some detail by this court inRDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd[2007] 4 SLR 413(“RDC Concrete”), especially at [89]–[112]. We will not retraverse the ground covered in that particular case. An extremely brief summary will suffice for the purposes of the present appeal. Situations justifying the innocent party’s termination of the contract 153      As stated inRDC Concrete, there are four situations which entitle the innocent party (here, the appellant) to elect to treat the contract as discharged as a result of the other party’s (here, the respondent’s) breach. 154      Thefirst(“Situation 1”) is where the contractual term in question clearly and unambiguously states that, should an event or certain events occur, the innocent party would be entitled to terminate the contract (seeRDC Concreteat [91]). 155      Thesecond(“Situation 2”) is where the party in breach of contract (“the guilty party”), by its words or conduct, simplyrenouncesthe contract inasmuch as it clearly conveys to the innocent party that it will not perform its contractual obligations at all (seeRDC Concreteat [93]). 156      Thethird(“Situation 3(a)”) is where the term breached (here, Clause C.1) is aconditionof the contract. Under what has been termed the “condition-warranty approach”, the innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract if the term which is breached is a condition (as opposed to a warranty): seeRDC Concreteat [97]. The focus here, unlike that in the next situation discussed below, is not so much on the (actual) consequences of the breach, but, rather, on thenature of the termbreached. 157      Thefourth(“Situation 3(b)”) is where the breach of a term deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended to obtain from the contract (seeRDC Concreteat [99]). (This approach is also commonly termed the “Hongkong Firapproach” after the leading English Court of Appeal decision ofHongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd[1962] 2 QB 26; see especiallyidat 70.) The focus here, unlike that in Situation 3(a), is not so much on the nature of the term breached, but, rather, on thenature and consequencesof the breach. 158      Because of the different perspectives adopted in Situation 3(a) and Situation 3(b), respectively (as briefly noted above), which differences might, depending on the precise factual matrix, yield different results when applied to the fact situation, this court inRDC Concrete([152]supra) concluded that, as between both the aforementioned situations, the approach in Situation 3(a) should beapplied first, as follows (idat [112]): If the term is acondition, then the innocent party would be entitled to terminate the contract.However, if the term is awarranty(instead of a condition), then the court should nevertheless proceed to apply the approach in Situation 3(b) (viz, theHongkong Firapproach). [emphasis in original] The condition-warranty approach – relevant factors in ascertaining whether or not a given contractual term is a “condition” (a)        Introduction 159      AsRDC Concretedidnotelaborate on an important aspect of the condition-warranty approach embodied inSituation 3(a), namely, whatfactorsare relevant in ascertaining whether or not a given contractual term is acondition, a consideration of this issue at this juncture is apposite. 160      It is important to note at the outset that there is no magical formula (comprising a certain fixed number of factors or criteria) that would enable a court to ascertain whether or not a given contractual term is a condition. This is not unexpected, given the very nature of the inquiry itself (which would include a countless number of permutations and variations, depending on the respective factual matrices and, more importantly, the intentions of the respective contracting parties themselves). However, as is inherent within the very nature of common law development, certain factors that might (depending, as just mentioned, on the precise factual matrix concerned)assistthe court in this regard have been developed. 161      Atbottom, the focus is onascertaining the intention of the contracting parties themselves by construing the actual contract itself (including the contractual term concerned) in the light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole(see the classic exposition on this point by Bowen LJ (as he then was) in the oft-cited English Court of Appeal decision ofBentson v Taylor, Sons & Co (No 2)[1893] 2 QB 274 at 281). (b)        The first factor: where astatuteclassifies a specific contractual term as a “condition” 162      Thefirstof the established factors mentioned above (at [160]) isvery specific: Where astatute(or, more often, a particular provision within a statute) classifies a specific contractual term as a “condition”, then that term will, of course, be a condition. 163      The paradigm model is the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c 54) (UK) (“the UK Act”), which is applicable in Singapore by virtue of the AELA (see s 4(1) read with Pt II of the First Schedule to the AELA). Indeed, the UK Act has been reprinted in the local context as the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1994 Rev Ed). This last-mentioned Act is, in fact, the classic statutory embodiment of the condition-warranty approach inasmuch as it classifies various contractual terms as conditions and warranties, respectively. 164      However, as alluded to above (at [162]), this is a very specific factor and would not cover any contractual terms that fall outside the particular ambit of the statute (or statutory provision) concerned. (c)        The second factor: where the contractual term itself expressly states that it is a “condition” 165      Thesecondfactor is an ostensibly obvious one: Where the contractual term itselfexpressly statesthat it is a “condition”, then that term would generally be held by this court to be a condition. 166However, we have added the word “ostensibly” because, even in what appear to be very clear-cut situations, there is case law that suggests that the express use of the word “condition” might (on occasion, at least) be insufficient to render that term a condition in law. In this regard, the House of Lords decision ofL Schuler AG v WickmanMachine Tool Sales Ltd[1974] AC 235 (“Schuler”) comes readily to mind. In that case, the majority of the House held that, although the word “condition” was expressly utilised, that word was being utilised not as a term of legal art, but, rather, in a lay sense. 167      At first blush, the approach adopted by the majority inSchuleris not a wholly untenable one. After all, it is true that the same word (here, “condition”) can take on different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. With respect, however, a close analysis of the reasoning of the majority inSchulerdemonstrates a preoccupation with theconsequencesof the breach of contract in that case, rather than a focus (in accordance with the condition-warranty approach in Situation 3(a)) on thenature of the termbreached. Indeed, there is a reference by Lord Kilbrandon (who was one of the majority judges) to the “grotesque consequences” (idat 272) of holding the term breached to be a “condition” in the strict legal sense of the word. 168      It is our view that the majority of the House inSchulerwere,in substance and effect, applying theHongkong Firapproach instead (which, it will be recalled, falls under Situation 3(b) and, more importantly, relates to the actualnature and consequences of the breachinstead). Indeed, there is a very powerful (and, in our view, persuasive) dissenting judgment by Lord Wilberforce (seeSchulerat 262–263), who warned against rewriting, in effect, what was the clear intention of the contracting parties that the term concerned be a “condition” in the strict legal sense of the word (in accordance with the substance and spirit of the condition-warranty approach under Situation 3(a)). 169      Indeed, it might well have been the fact situation inSchulerwhich prompted the majority of the House to adopt what was, in substance and effect, theHongkong Firapproach instead. With respect, however, the intention of the parties (pursuant to the condition-warranty approach) ought to take precedence for, as we pointed out inRDC Concrete([152]supra) at [100], although theHongkong Firapproach is conventionally associated with a sense of fairness (in that it allows termination of a contract only if the nature and consequences of the breach are so serious as to deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole of the benefit of the contract which it was intended to obtain from the contract), it isequallytrue that a sense of fairness (albeit from a different perspective)alsofeatures when the condition-warranty approach is applied inasmuch as it is fair to hold the contracting parties to their original bargain. 170      We also observed inRDC Concrete(especially at [110]) that general House of Lords decisionsafter Schulerin fact supported the approach that we adopted in that case (in particular, our stance that the condition-warranty approach in Situation 3(a) should take precedence over theHongkong Firapproach in Situation 3(b) in so far as it ought to be ascertained, first, whether or not the contractual term concerned is a condition): see, for example,Bunge Corporation, New York v Tradax Export SA, Panama[1981] 1 WLR 711 (“Bunge”) andTorvald Klaveness A/S v Arni Maritime Corporation[1994] 1 WLR 1465. (d)        The third factor: the availability of a prior precedent 171      Thethirdfactor is whether a prior precedent is available. An oft-cited illustration in this regard is the English Court of Appeal decision ofMaredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH[1971] 1 QB 164 (“The Mihalis Angelos”), where the court held (at 194, 199–200 and 205–206) that an “expected readiness” clause was a condition on the ground,inter alia, that the same conclusion had been reached in by its own previous decision (inFinnish Government v H Ford & Co, Ltd(1921) 6 Ll L Rep 188). 172      With respect, reliance on a prior precedent, whilst convenient when viewed from a practical perspective, does not really address the issue ofprincipleinasmuch as there would, in our view, still need to be an inquiry as to whether or not theanalysis and reasoningin the prior precedentpassed musterin principle. Indeed, this court is, in certain exceptional circumstances, permitted (as the final appellate court) to depart from its own prior decisions pursuant to the criteria set out in this court’sPractice Statement (Judicial Precedent)[1994] 2 SLR 689. This court is,a fortiori, free not to follow priorEnglish (or other foreign)decisions if finds the analysis and reasoning therein unpersuasive, or if the prior foreign decision in question is not applicable to the circumstances of Singapore (see, in this last-mentioned regard, s 3(2) of the AELA); alternatively, the prior foreign decision concerned can be subject to the necessary modifications, if so required by the circumstances of Singapore (see, again, s 3(2) of the AELA). (e)        The fourth factor: mercantile transactions 173      Thefourthfactor centres on the importance placed oncertainty and predictabilityin the context ofmercantiletransactions. Case law suggests that courts are more likely to classify contractual terms as conditions in this particular context, especially where they relate totiming(see, for example,Bunge([170]supra) andThe Mihalis Angelos([171]supra)). (f)        Summary of the relevant factors under the condition-warranty approach 174      The aforementioned factors are important. But, they are not exhaustive and, to use a familiar phrase (albeit in a somewhat different context), the categories of factors are not closed. The actual decision as to whether or not a contractual term is a condition would, indeed, depend very much on the particular factual matrix before the court. It also bears repeating that there is no magical formula. In the final analysis, the focus is onascertaining the intention of the contracting parties themselves by construing the actual contract itself (including the contractual term concerned) in the light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole(see also [161] above).",
        "Our decision on the reasonableness of Clause C.1": "134      It is clear, on the facts of the present proceedings, that the covenants in restraint of trade in the Termination Agreement in general, and Clause C.1 in particular, were all arrived at as part of an agreement which wasprima faciebinding as a matter of law on both parties. Indeed, Mr Chia did not seek to argue that the Termination Agreement was tainted, in any way, by any vitiating factor (including, in particular, duress, undue influence and/or unconscionability). Indeed, it would appear that even if the covenantor (here, the respondent) had entered into the Termination Agreementvoluntarily, it would not have made a difference to the application of the doctrine of restraint of trade. As Chao JA put it inNational Aerated WaterCo([58]supra) at [31], in determining the reasonableness of a restraint of trade clause: Itdoes not matterthat the parties havefreely entered intothe restraint as the rule against unreasonable restraint isbased on public policy and may not be excluded by mutual consent. [emphasis added] 135      In accordance with the principles set out above, Clause C.1 must satisfy the twin tests of reasonableness embodied in the statement of principle of Lord Macnaghten inNordenfelt(as set out at [70] above). It is appropriate, at this juncture, to reiterate Clause C.1 in full, as follows: C.1.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you agree that for a period of seven (7) months from the Termination Date, that is, up to 13 January 2006 you shall not directly or indirectly employ or solicit the employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant) any person who is or was at any time during the period 13 June 2004 to 13 June 2005 an officer, director, representative or employee of the [appellant]. For avoidance of doubt, you shall not be deemed to employ any person unless you are involved or have otherwise provided input into the decision to hire such individual. 136      To recapitulate, Clause C.1 must be reasonable not only as between the parties, but also in the interests of the public as well before it will be upheld by the court. The principles relating to the settlement or compromise of disputes in general, and inPanayiotou([60]supra) in particular, relate to the second aspect of reasonableness,viz, reasonableness in the interests of the public. Put simply, it is in the interests of the public to uphold the validity of covenants in restraint of trade where such covenants are agreed to pursuant to the settlement or compromise of existing disputes. However, there isalsothefirstaspect of reasonableness that Clause C.1 must satisfy as well. Before proceeding to consider this particular issue, we would pause to observe that although the Judge was of the view that there was no evidence to establish that the maintenance of a stable, trained workforce was a legitimate proprietary interest (as there was,inter alia, no evidence on the level of training of the appellant’s employees: see GD at [171]), we would respectfully disagree with that conclusion. It is clear from the evidence that the respondent, by virtue of his position and influence whilst in the employ of the appellant, possessed – and, more importantly, utilised – confidential knowledge gained in the course of his employment (in particular, knowledge relating to the relationship between the employees concerned and the appellant) to solicit the employment of those employees. Further, whilst trainingis a relevant factor, it is not conclusive. The main focus ought still to be on whether or not there is a legitimate proprietary interest in the employer (here, the appellant) maintaining a stable, trained workforce. Given the nature of the appellant’s business, we are of the view that there was indeed such an interest in the present appeal – and this wasa fortiorithe case in the light of the respondent’s access to and use of confidential knowledge gained in the course of his employment. 137      Turning, then, to the first aspect of reasonableness,viz, reasonableness as between the parties, it is clear, in our view, that all the terms in the Termination Agreement (of which Clause C.1 was an integral part) were arrived at in earnest and in good faith. Indeed, as we noted above (at [134]), Mr Chia admitted that no vitiating factors (such as duress, undue influence or unconscionability) operated to taint the validity of the Termination Agreement. This must be so as there was no evidence whatsoever to cast any shadow on the validity of this agreement. 138      Furthermore, if one examines the entire context within which the Termination Agreement was arrived at, it is clear thatallthe parties were in fact satisfied with, as it were, the final product. The context consisted of a series of negotiations between the parties (conducted primarily through the e-mail correspondence set out at [27]–[37] above) with a view to ensuring the respondent’s smooth exit from the appellant’s employment. In particular, the respondent had, initially, pointed out to the appellant that his original employment contract did not contain any covenants in restraint of trade (see [27] above). However, he later agreed to the inclusion of such covenants as a gesture of goodwill. He nevertheless proposed changes to the contents (in particular, the period) of the covenants suggested by the appellant. More specifically, the initial version of Clause C.1 (as drafted by theappellant) stated that the restraint therein was to last forone year. Therespondentproposed a period ofseven monthsinstead – a period that was ultimately agreed to by the appellant. In our view, this is significant. It is certainly not open to the respondent to now argue that the seven-month duration is unreasonable, a point which he conceded during cross-examination by Mr Maniam. 139      We also observe that the respondent received, in return for the covenants undertaken pursuant to the Termination Agreement, a not inconsiderable consideration (as set out in Clause B.1) which he was clearly not entitled to otherwise from a legal point of view. Although the respondent regarded the consideration as insufficient, it is clear, as noted above (at [40]), that the respondent had, in paragraph 20.8 of his AEIC, acknowledged that the consideration set out in Clause B.1 wasin return forhis undertaking to observe the covenants set out in the Termination Agreement during the Prohibited Period. Whilst this is not a conclusive factor, it is, in our view, a relevant one and should be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the reasonableness of Clause C.1 as between the parties. A learned author has suggested that “it is not benefits gained by an employee during employment which justify covenants, but detriments which the employee may cause after departure” (seeThe Restraint of Trade Doctrine([56]supra) at p 102). However, this suggestion was made in the context of a possible argument that (ibid): [T]here is less justification for the taking of a covenant in restraint of trade when the employee is leaving, without previously having been bound, than when it is taken at the commencement of the employment. ‘In the latter case some restrictions on post-employment competition may be justified by the benefit gained or to be gained by the employee through his contract of employment.’ [citingA Buckle & Son Pty Ltd v McAllister[1986] 4 NSWLR 426at 432]. 140      Even allowing for the fact that thedetrimentswhich the employee may cause after departure are relevant considerations that ought to be taken into account by the court in determining reasonableness as between the parties, where the employee concerned hasalsobeen conferred (under a legally binding agreement)substantial post-employment benefits(as is the casevis-à-visthe relevant terms of the Termination Agreement), this would, in our view, be another relevant factor that could render the covenants concerned reasonable (reference may be made, in this regard, to the observations in the United States Court of Appeals decision ofAmory H Bradford v The New York Times Company501 F 2d 51 at 58 (2nd Cir, 1974); butcfthe approach inA Buckle & Son Pty Ltd v McAllister[1986] 4 NSWLR 426, which was cited inThe Restraint of Trade Doctrinein the preceding paragraph and the position taken by the Judge (see GD at [156])). 141      Turning to a different (albeit related) point, can it be argued that Clause C.1 was still too wide to be reasonable inasmuch as it covered too broad a category of employees, which was the view adopted by the Judge (see GD at [176]–[179])? The principles applicable to this particular argument were canvassed earlier (at [106]–[110]). As we observed (at [110] above), much will depend on the precise factual matrix concerned. In this regard, Clause C.1 ought not – and cannot – be construed literally, wrenched out of its context. Looked at incontext, it is clear that Clause C.1 wasnotintended by the appellant and the respondent (who in fact held extremely high positions in the former) to apply to peripheral support staff. Instead, that particular clause was intended to prohibit only the solicitation of the appellant’s senior staff, particularly those who were in contact with the respondent during his stint as the managing director and CEO of the appellant. This is, in our view, especially so in the light of the nature of the appellant’s business, which centred on financial services. It is also clear that the respondent was in a position to exercise influence over such staff (and, as it turned out, he did exercise such influence). In contrast, it is highly unlikely that the respondent had any influence over peripheral support staff with whom he was not likely, in any event, to have had direct contact. 142      In the circumstances, it is clear, in our view, that Clause C.1 of the Termination Agreement was reasonable as between the parties. 143      There is a further point that applies specifically to Clause C.1 – namely, whether or not Clause C.1 protected a legitimate proprietary interest of the appellant. If it did not, then that clause could not possibly be reasonable as between the parties, and would certainly not be reasonable in the interests of the public. 144      In this regard, as we noted earlier (at [95] above), Clause C.1 was a non-solicitation clause. More importantly, as we likewise pointed out earlier (at [121]–[122]), there is a clear as well as cogent rationale underlying non-solicitation clauses. We will therefore not retraverse ground already covered, save to observe that therewasa legitimate proprietary interest belonging to the appellant that was in fact protected by Clause C.1 in accordance with the principles set out above (at [121]–[124]). 145If we assumethat the covenants in restraint of trade in the Termination Agreement in general, and Clause C.1 in particular, were agreed to as part of settlement or compromise proceedings (which we in fact found (at [41] above) wasnotthe case), the argument in favour of the reasonableness of Clause C.1 would, in our view, beeven stronger. Interestingly, there would, in such a situation (ie, where the restraint of trade provisions in question are part of a settlement or compromise), be anoverlapbetween the two aspects of reasonableness embodied in Lord Macnaghten’s statement of principle inNordenfelt(see [70] above). Put simply, the context of settlement or compromise, whilst relating (as we have seen at [136] above) directly to the second aspect of reasonableness (viz, reasonableness in the interests ofthe public), isequallyapplicable when assessing the reasonableness of Clause C.1 as between theparties. We would not go so far as to state that there is an inexorable correlation between these two facets of reasonableness whenever the non-solicitation clause concerned forms part of a settlement or compromise, but it would appear that there will invariably be at least some connection – if not a substantial one (as is the case here). 146      We would also add (and, in this regard, we agree with the Judge) that clause C.4 of the Termination Agreement (“Clause C.4”) did not, in our view, contribute anything of substance to the inquiry into the reasonableness or otherwise of the restraint of trade provisions in the agreement in general. Clause C.4 read as follows: You [the respondent)] agree that this Paragraph C is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the [appellant’s] interests, and that you have agreed to these clauses in consideration of the amounts to be paid to you as set out in Paragraph B above. 147      A similar clause was before the Singapore High Court inBuckman Laboratories (Asia) Pte Ltd v Lee Wei Hoong[1999] 3 SLR 333. In that case, the provision under consideration read as follows: 12.6      The Employee expressly acknowledges that the periods of one year in the above restrictions in his clause 12 [which contained various restraint of trade provisions] and the geographical extent of the above restrictions, are reasonably necessary to give adequate protection to the interests of [the plaintiffs] and each Associated Company in the Proprietary Information. Nevertheless, it is recognised that restrictions of this nature may fail for technical reasons. Accordingly, if any of the above restrictions is, either by itself or taken with others, adjudged to be invalid as exceeding of the interests of [the plaintiffs] and its Associated Companies, but would be valid and enforceable if any particular restriction or restrictions were deleted or restricted or limited in a particular manner; or if the period or area thereof were reduced or curtailed; then the said restriction shall apply with such deletions, restrictions, limitations, reductions, curtailments and modifications as may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 148      Judith Prakash J expressed the following observations on the above provision, as follows (at [27]): The plaintiffs [the employer in that case] appear to have recognised that the restrictive covenants in cll 12.1 and 12.2 were too wide and could not be well-received by a court.They therefore inserted cl 12.6 in an effort to save some minimum portions of these clauses in the event a court considered parts of them to be invalid. Whilst I have not heard full argument on this issue, I have grave doubts that an invalid clause can be saved in this manner because it would lead to uncertainty.An employee with a contract containing such clauses would have no way of knowing the extent of his obligations under them and would be put in an invidious position regarding his future employment if he ever sought to leave the plaintiffs’ employ. [emphasis added] 149      The above observations were expressed in relation to the specific language of the clause itself (as reproduced at [147] above). We are also of the view that there is a more general – and fundamental – reason why clauses such as this, as well as Clause C.4 in the present appeal, even taken at their highest, do not add anything of substance to the inquiry: Whether or not a covenant in restraint of trade passes legal muster depends on the applicable principles; if the covenant in question would not otherwise pass muster under these principles, it cannot be saved by clauses of this nature. To hold otherwise would be to sanction a covenant in restraint of trade which would otherwise be contrary to public policy (thoughcf TSC Europe([97]supra) at [35]). A moment’s reflection would reveal that such a result is legally undesirable and, indeed, untenable.",
        "Summary of our findings on Clause C.1": "150      For the reasons set out above, we hold, first, that the doctrine of restraint of trade applies to the Termination Agreement, which was not a settlement agreement. In any event, even if the Termination Agreement was a settlement agreement, the doctrine would still apply as, in our view, the doctrine of restraint of trade does apply to settlement agreements in general (subject to the qualification set out at [65] above). 151      Applying the principles embodied in the doctrine of restraint of trade, we find that Clause C.1 was reasonable both in the interests of the parties as well as in the interests of the public. In the premises, Clause C.1 was valid as between the parties. There having been a clearbreachof Clause C.1 by the respondent, it is now necessary to ascertain the legal consequences which ensued as a result of that breach.",
        "Consequences of a breach of Clause C.1": "",
        "Our decision on the facts of this appeal": "175      Applying the principles set out in the preceding part of this judgment, it is immediately clear that Cause C.1 didnotfall within either Situation 1 (as defined at [154] above) or Situation 2 (as defined at [155] above). This leaves Situation 3(a) and Situation 3(b) to be considered. 176      In so far as Situation 3(a) (defined at [156] above) and Situation 3(b) (defined at [157] above) are concerned, we have already noted that the former ought to be applied first (see, generally, [158] above). Hence, we must first ascertain whether or not Clause C.1 was acondition. If it was, then that would be the end to the inquiry inasmuch as the innocent party (here, the appellant) would be entitled to terminate the contract. 177      However, in accordance with the present approach adopted by this court (as elaborated inRDC Concrete([152]supra) at [100] and [107]), the approach in Situation 3(b) isnot,ipso facto, dispensed with if Clause C.1 is foundnotto be acondition(ie, under the condition-warranty approach set out in Situation 3(a), Clause C.1, if held not to be a condition, wouldnottherebyautomaticallybecome awarranty). In such a situation, this court would then have to apply theHongkong Firapproach embodied in Situation 3(b). 178      The immediate task at hand, therefore, is to ascertain whether or not Clause C.1 was acondition. To this end, the various factors set out above (at [162]–[173]) may be usefully referred to. 179      It is clear, on the facts of the present appeal, that none of the four factors considered above (at [162]–[173]) applies. However, this does not mean that this court is powerless to determine whether or not Clause C.1 was a condition. As we have emphasised more than once, the task of this court is to ascertain the intention of the contracting parties themselves with regard (in particular) to Clause C.1 by construing the actual contract itself (including Clause C.1) in the light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole. To this end, we found the background circumstances leading up to the conclusion of the Termination Agreement instructive. In particular, we found the relevant correspondence between the contracting parties which led to the finalisation of the Termination Agreement to be of particular assistance since it demonstrated (very clearly, in our view) the intention of the partiesvis-à-visthe Termination Agreement in general, and Clause C.1 in particular. 180      At this juncture, a fundamental point ought to be noted. It doesnotfollow thateveryterm in a contract (here, the Termination Agreement) willnecessarilybe accorded the same importance by the contracting parties. What is germane for the purposes of the present appeal is whether or not the appellant and the respondentintended Clause C.1 specificallyto be of such importance that any breach thereof, regardless of the actual consequences of the breach, would entitle the innocent party (here, the appellant) to terminate the contract. 181      A useful starting point would be to examine the language of Clause C.1 itself. This provision has already been reproduced earlier (at [6], [38] and [135]), but it would be appropriate, for present purposes, to reproduce it once more, as follows: C.1.      In further consideration of the foregoing, you agree that for a period of seven (7) months from the Termination Date, that is, up to 13 January 2006 you shall not directly or indirectly employ or solicit the employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent or consultant) any person who is or was at any time during the period 13 June 2004 to 13 June 2005 an officer, director, representative or employee of the [appellant]. For avoidance of doubt, you shall not be deemed to employ any person unless you are involved or have otherwise provided input into the decision to hire such individual. 182      As we held above (at [95]), Clause C.1 was a non-solicitation clause. It was also, as the opening words of the clause itself state, part of the consideration furnished by the respondent to the appellant in return for the Compensation which he was to receive under Clause B.1. But, and here is the crux of the present issue,how importanta term did the appellant and the respondent, as contracting parties, intend Clause C.1 to be? 183      It will be noticed that, in addition to Clause C.1, the respondent also furnished the appellant with consideration in the form of three further clauses (pursuant to sub-clause (b) of Clause B.1),viz, clause C.2 of the Termination Agreement (“Clause C.2”), Clause C.3 and Clause D.1, as well as (pursuant to sub-clause (a) of Clause B.1) by serving out his notice period on leave from the office. In return (and this constituted the consideration furnished by the appellant to the respondent), the respondent was to receive from the respondent the Compensation pursuant to Clause B.1 (which is set out in full below to furnish the necessary context): B.1.      In consideration of you:– (a)        serving out your Notice Period on leave from the office, and (b)        agreeingto the terms and conditions set forth herein, apart from paying you your full salary and allowances during the Notice Periodthe [appellant] agrees to pay you: (i)         13,014 shares in Man Group plc granted to you under the terms of the Man plc 2002, 2003 and 2004 coinvestment schemes (as at close of business 10 June 2005 valued at approximately US$330,000); and (ii)        a goodwill payment of US$263,000. [emphasis added] 184      The total value of what the respondent expected to receive under Clause B.1 was approximately S$1m. 185      It will be seen that Clause C.1 wasprima faciean important term of the Termination Contract. Indeed, it was of equal importance to – and formed part of the same context as – Clause C.2 and Clause C.3, all of which collectively constituted,quantitativelyat least, the lion’s share of the consideration furnished by the respondent to the appellant pursuant to the Termination Agreement. 186      Mr Chia sought to argue that Clause D.1 was also part of the consideration furnished by the respondent. This is a fair point, but not necessarily a sufficient argument in so far as the present issue before this court is concerned. This is because the preciseimportanceofClause D.1isnotnecessarilyconclusive (or even indicative) of the preciseimportanceofClause C.1, which was ultimately the clause that was at issue in this appeal. In other words, even if Clause D.1 was an important term (and, hence, a condition pursuant to the condition-warranty approach), it didnot necessarilymean that,inter alia,Clause C.1wasnota condition. To this end, we need (as mentioned in,inter alia, [179] above) to examine the surrounding circumstances leading up to the parties’ entry into the Termination Agreement in order to ascertain whether or not these contracting partiesintendedClause C.1 to be a condition. 187      Before proceeding to do so, however, an important point needs to be noted in relation toClause D.1. As we have explained in some detail earlier in this judgment (at [23]), the focus of the Termination Agreement was oneffecting closure of the employment relationship that hitherto existed between the appellant and the respondent. In other words, the focus wasnotonsettlingany disputes then existing between the parties as such. If so, then thepurposeof Clause D.1 might actually be theoppositeof what Mr Chia argued on behalf of the respondent in the preceding paragraph. In other words, Clause D.1 wasnotintended by the contracting parties to be animportantterm (at least when compared to theotherclauses, including Clause C.1). It might be construed, instead, asa general “catch-all”clause. However, as we have emphasised, the key focus is on whether or not the contracting parties intended Clause C.1 to be a condition. 188      To this end, we turn to the surrounding circumstances referred to earlier in this judgment (at [26]–[38]),viz, the various negotiations between the respondent and the appellant prior to the conclusion of the Termination Agreement (of which Clause C.1 was an integral part). These negotiations can be considered as they constituted part of the factual matrix surrounding the Termination Agreement itself (see, for example, the decision of this court inSandar Aung v Parkway Hospitals Singapore Pte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR 891at [29]–[37]). They comprised, in fact, as alluded to above, a series of correspondence between the parties. It is clear, in our view, that Clause C.1 was intended by the appellant and the respondent to be acondition. It was an integral part of an important cluster of clauses (under clause C of the Termination Agreement (“Clause C”)). Indeed, without complying with the sub-clauses under Clause C, the respondent would be unable to receive the Compensation set out in Clause B.1. So important were the sub-clauses under Clause C that the respondent himself took great pains to ensure that their ambit and scope were acceptable to him. As we saw above (at [38]), the respondent sought – and obtained – a reduction of the period of restraint under,inter alia, Clause C.1 fromtwelve months to seven months. 189      We also examine briefly Clause B.2 (reproduced earlier at [39]). For ease of reference and present analysis, it is reproduced again, as follows: B.2.Save in the event that you breach any of the terms of this Termination Agreement, the sums set out in B.1(b) above will be paid to you in full and without deduction at the end of the Notice Period, on 13 September 2005. [emphasis added] 190      It is significant, in our view, that the italicised words in Clause B.2 wereinserted by the appellant(andacceptedbythe respondent). It is clear that the appellant was not prepared to pay the relevant sums to the respondent without any qualification (which would have been the case had the respondent’s original draft of this clause (as set out above at [35]) been accepted). Indeed, the words (in italics) inserted by the appellant make it amply clear that those sums wouldnotbe paid to the respondent in the event that the respondent breached “any of the terms of this Termination Agreement” (which, of course, included Clause C.1). This is consistent with the general conclusion which we have arrived at to the effect that Clause C.1 was acondition.",
        "Conclusion on the consequences of breach of Clause C.1": "191      In summary, the present appeal concerned a fact situation that fell within neither Situation 1 nor Situation 2 inRDC Concrete([152]supra). In so far as Situation 3(a) and Situation 3(b) are concerned, since we have found that the present fact situation fell withinSituation 3(a)(ie, Clause C.1 was acondition), there was, consistent with the principles and reasoning enunciated inRDC Concrete, which were referred to briefly above at [158],no needfor us to consider the legal effect of Situation 3(b). 192      In the circumstances, the appellant was, in the light of the respondent’s breach of Clause C.1 as well as our finding that that particular clause was aconditionof the Termination Agreement,entitled to terminate the contract. It follows, therefore, that the respondent couldnotenforce his claim for the Compensation under the Termination Agreement.",
        "The implied duty of good faith and fidelity owed by an employee to an employer at common law": "193      It is trite law that there is animpliedterm in the employer’s favour that the employee will serve the employer with good faith and fidelity, and that he or she (the employee) will also use reasonable care and skill in the performance of his or her duties pursuant to the employment contract (see the oft-cited English decisions ofRobb v Green[1895] 2 QB 315 andHivac Limited v Park Royal Scientific Instruments Limited[1946] Ch 169; reference may also be made, in the local context, to the Singapore High Court decision ofAsiawerks Global Investment Group Pte Ltd v Ismail bin Syed Ahmad[2004] 1 SLR 234at [61]). 194      However, given the decision which we arrived at in relation to the consequences following thebreachof Clause C.1, it was unnecessary for us to consider the issue of whether or not there was also a breach of the implied term referred to in the preceding paragraph.",
        "Conclusion": "195      To summarise, for the reasons set out above: (a)        We hold that the doctrine of restraint of trade applies to the Termination Agreement in general, and Clause C.1 therein in particular. (b)        We hold thatClause C.1 was reasonable and, hence, valid, having regard to the applicable principles relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade. (c)        We agree with the Judge that there had been a breach of Clause C.1 on the facts of the present case. (d)        We hold that Clause C.1 was in fact aconditionof the Termination Agreement, which therefore entitled the appellant to terminate the said agreement. (e)        It follows, therefore, that the respondent was not entitled to the Compensation under the Termination Agreement which he sought in the present proceedings. 196In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed with costs, and with the usual consequential orders to follow. In so far as the quantum of costs is concerned, having regard to the overall manner in which the various issues were raised and argued, we award the appellant three-quarters of the costs of the appeal.  Although we differed from the Judge’s ultimate decision in the court below, we affirmed most of his factual and legal findings. In the circumstances, we see no reason to disturb the costs order made by the Judge in the court below, save that the appellant need not reimburse the respondent half of the total hearing fees paid by the respondent. If any further consequential orders are required, the parties have liberty to apply."
