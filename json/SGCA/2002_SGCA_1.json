        "The facts": "2.    The deceaseds body was discovered inside a NTUC Comfort\n\ntaxi (the taxi) at Pasir Ris Drive 1 at about 6 am on 15 June 2000. At about 9.15 am the\n\nforensic pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee (Dr Teo), arrived at the scene. He noted blood sprays\n\nand blood drips inside the taxi.3.    Dr Teo subsequently conducted a post-mortem. He found that\n\nthere were in the main four injuries on the deceaseds head: three lacerations and one bruise. In\n\nhis opinion, the cause of death was intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral contusions with\n\nfractured skull, and there were at least four blows inflicted on the deceaseds head, which\n\naccounted for the three lacerations and one bruise. In his report, he described them as follows:-(i) a 5.2 cm laceration on the back part of the head to the left, just left of\n\n  the midline, which was consistent with being caused by the narrow surface of the flat handle of a\n\n  hook hammer (a specimen being produced in court) with great and severe force being used;(ii) a 1.2 cm laceration on the back part of the head, also to the left, near\n\n  the mastoid region, which was consistent with being caused by the hook part or the flat edge of\n\n  the hook hammer with moderate force being used;(iii) a laceration on the back part of the head, again to the left, near the\n\n  midline, which was consistent with being caused by the hook part or flat edge of the hook hammer\n\n  with moderate force being used; and(iv) a bruise on the back part of the head, at the lower right, which was\n\n  consistent with being caused by the broader surface of the flat handle of the hook hammer with\n\n  moderate force being used.4.    Dr Teo said that the blows to the deceaseds head resulted\n\nin injury to the deceaseds brain which was the cause of the death. The deceased would most likely\n\nhave died within minutes of the blows being inflicted. In his opinion, the injuries (i) and (iv)\n\nabove described were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.\n\nThe injuries sustained by the deceased were probably caused by a blunt weapon. Although he suggested\n\nin his report that a hook hammer was the likely weapon, he did not rule out a steel pipe with jagged\n\nor sharp edges or even a spanner as being the weapon used. He added that the assailant was probably\n\nbehind the victim at the time the injuries were inflicted. He did not see any sign of struggle in\n\nthe taxi.5.    The other evidence tendered by the prosecution through Dr\n\nTeo was that when he first arrived at the scene to examine the deceased, he found that although the\n\ndeceased had a handphone clip on his belt, no handphone was found either attached to it or nearby.",
        "The appellants account": "6.    The appellant was arrested on 16 June 2000. He provided the\n\npolice with an account of what had transpired. He said that, on the night of 14 June 2001, he was at\n\na park near Golden Mile Complex with his friend, Wanchai Meeying (Wanchai). They got into a\n\nfight with a group of men from Thailand, in the course of which Wanchai was hurt and the appellant\n\npicked up a metal object, which belonged to their assailants. They ran towards the main road heading\n\nfor the bus stop opposite Golden Mile Complex. When they reached the bus stop the appellant\n\nconcealed the metal object by tucking it at his right waist and covered it with his longsleeve\n\njacket. He then noticed his jacket was stained with Wanchais blood. At the bus stop, they parted\n\ncompany, and the appellant decided to return to his living quarters at Pasir Ris. He hailed a taxi\n\nand the deceaseds taxi came along and he boarded it. He gave the deceased directions and\n\ncontinued to guide him on the route to be taken, as the latter was unfamiliar with the route.7.    During the course of the journey, the appellant noticed the\n\ndeceased looking at him through the rear view mirror, and also turning his head round to look at the\n\nappellant a few times. The deceased asked the appellant: You fighting? to which the appellant\n\nreplied: No. The appellant became worried about the bloodstains on his jacket. The deceased\n\nasked a few more times but the appellant did not reply. He began to worry that the deceased would\n\nreport him to the police, as the deceased kept looking at him and even attempted at one point to use\n\nhis mobile phone. When the taxi reached Lorong Halus, the appellant did not stop the deceased, but\n\ndirected him instead to Pasir Ris Drive 1. When the taxi stopped, the appellant saw the deceased\n\npressing the meter and, at the same time, picking up his mobile telephone. The appellant then hit\n\nthe deceased two to three times on the head with the metal object he took along from the\n\nfight, and after that he took the deceaseds mobile telephone and wallet, and fled.",
        "The trial below": "8.    It was not disputed that the appellant inflicted the\n\ninjuries on the deceased; nor was it disputed that the injuries (i) and (iv) above described were\n\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The appellants defence was that he\n\nwas suffering from an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for\n\nhis acts in causing the death of the deceased. Alternatively, his defence was that the case against\n\nhim had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt on the ground that at the time he inflicted the\n\ninjuries on the deceased he lacked the requisite intention to commit murder.",
        "The prosecution evidence": "9.    The prosecution called a succession of witnesses, including\n\nthe appellants friends, workmates and supervisors. The appellants friends and workmates\n\ntestified that they had not noticed any abnormal behaviour on the appellants part, and that he\n\nsocialised with them regularly. However, a fellow Thai worker, Samran Sathiakit, told the court that\n\non one occasion the appellant, after a drinking session, became annoyed with Samran as the latter\n\nwas questioning him about some missing monies; the appellant thereupon picked up a cooking knife and\n\nused it to injure Samrans dog.10.    The prosecution also called the appellants girlfriend,\n\nPhensuwan Netnapha (Phensuwan). Phensuwan testified that the appellant generally acted\n\nnormally, but that he was occasionally temperamental and withdrawn and there were times when he was\n\nonly pretending to be happy.11.    Another piece of evidence which was of some relevance was\n\nthat given by S/Sgt Raymond Tan. The sergeant testified that, whilst the appellant was in police\n\ncustody, he attempted to harm himself by knocking against the walls of the remand cell, and as a\n\nresult was transferred to a padded cell. There too he was observed to have attempted to remove the\n\nwire casing of the padded wall and attempted to pull the wire close to his neck. S/Sgt Raymond Tan\n\nconfirmed that he also learnt that the accused later attempted to commit suicide whilst at the\n\nQueenstown Remand Prison.12.    In anticipation of the defence of diminished\n\nresponsibility, the prosecution called Dr Tommy Tan to give evidence on the mental condition and the\n\ngeneral disposition of the appellant. Dr Tan is presently a consultant of Woodbridge Hospital and\n\nprior to that he was a psychiatrist attached to Changi General Hospital. He examined the appellant\n\non 19 July, 26 July and 2 August 2000. Arising from his examinations, Dr Tan prepared a report on\n\nthe appellant, which was admitted in evidence. In it he said, inter alia:In my opinion, he has a Depressive Episode, following his arrest and\n\n  imprisonment. It is reactive to his current circumstances. He is fit to plead. He is fully aware\n\n  of the charge against him and the consequence of pleading guilty. He is rational and lucid and\n\n  will be able to instruct his counsel and follow proceedings in court.In summary,1. The accused was not of unsound mind at the time of alleged offence.2. There was no mental illness before and during the alleged offence that\n\n    would impair his mental responsibility at the material time.3. He has a depressive episode following his arrest and imprisonment. His\n\n    depressive symptoms have improved with medication.4. He is fit to plead.The defence13.    The appellant gave evidence in his defence. His evidence\n\nwas briefly this. He was born in Thailand on 28 August 1974 and is the youngest in the family of\n\nseven children. His father is a farmer and his mother is mentally incapacitated and is unable to\n\nwork. He studied at a Thai medium school and attained secondary six level. As a child he had been\n\nabused by one of his brothers, and was unpopular in school. He left school at the age of 18 and\n\nstarted working as a factory hand and later as a construction worker.14.    His family has a history of mental illness. His mother has\n\nbeen mentally ill for some time and is on medication. One of his brothers also suffers from mental\n\nillness amounting to insanity. The appellant, when he was in Thailand, had mental problems. Whenever\n\nhe tried to think his head became hot. He suffered from bouts of stress, insomnia, paranoia\n\nand forgetfulness. His father brought him to see a doctor, Dr Samsak, and he was given medication\n\nfor his symptoms. Since then he had been on medication to alleviate his mental conditions. He also\n\nresorted to taking paracetamol tablets with a view to getting rid of his insomnia and other illness,\n\nand the dosage he took on each occasion increased from initially three tablets to six or seven\n\nlater.15.    He is married and has a child aged about three years old.\n\nHis wife left him for another man, which resulted in several suicide attempts by him. He was greatly\n\naffected by the separation from his wife and also his son. He wanted to take care of his son, but\n\nhis mother-in-law would not allow him. At times, he was not conscious of what he was doing;\n\nsometimes he went out naked, and he was forgetful. He became very suspicious for no apparent reason;\n\nand he did not trust anyone. Before he came to Singapore he always carried guns. Quite often when he\n\nwas under stress, he used to shoot aimlessly into the sky.16.    After the appellant came to Singapore in 1999, he worked\n\nwell until about May 2000, when he began losing concentration in his work and suffered constant\n\nheadaches and insomnia. He also drank a lot during this period. Referring to the incident in which\n\nhe hurt the dog, he said that at that time he was in the kitchen preparing food for himself and\n\nothers. His colleagues there included Samran who had a dog with him. He heard his workmates talking\n\nabout their families back in Thailand. At that point in time, while he was slicing meat, suddenly he\n\ngrabbed hold of the dog nearby and used the knife to slash its back. He did not know what he was\n\ndoing and regained his faculties only when he heard the dog crying. He did not know why he hurt the\n\ndog.",
        "The medical evidence in the defence": "17.    In support of his defence, the appellant called Dr Douglas\n\nKong Sim Guan (Dr Kong), a consultant psychiatrist in private practice. Dr Kong referred to\n\ntheDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(4thedition) (DSM-IV)\n\nand took the view that, in the case of the appellant, the DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive\n\nEpisode had been satisfied. DSM-IV requires that five or more of a given set of nine symptoms\n\nmust be present in the patient during the same two-week period. The symptoms must represent a change\n\nfrom previous functioning, and at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or loss\n\nof interest or pleasure. The nine symptoms are:-(i)    a depressed mood;(ii)    a diminished pleasure in daily activities;(iii)    significant weight loss or weight gain;(iv)    insomnia;(v)    observable psychomotor retardation;(vi)    fatigue;(vii)    feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt;(viii)    a diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness; and(ix)    recurrent thoughts of death.Dr Kong was of the view that all nine symptoms were present in the appellant,\n\nalthough he was only about 50% sure of the presence of symptom (vii).18.    According to Dr Kong, this Major Depression caused the\n\nappellant to lose control of himself, such as in the incident with the dog. Moreover, the appellant\n\nhad developed a fear of the police as he had been convicted and caned for illegal entry into\n\nSingapore in the past. The fight at Golden Mile Complex just before the appellant encountered the\n\ndeceased, combined with the deceaseds suspicions and the perceived likelihood of his calling the\n\npolice, caused a Paranoid Reaction that resulted in the attack on the deceased. The Major\n\nDepression had impaired [the appellants] perception, judgment, concentration, and executive\n\nfunction, such that he was not in full control of his mental faculties and was not aware of the\n\nconsequences of his actions.19.    Based on his observation of the appellants testimony, Dr\n\nKong was of the further view that the appellant suffered from dissociative amnesia, and the\n\nappellants account of events in the taxi was in actuality a reconstruction based on being told\n\nthe events by the police. Furthermore, the events in the taxi were the result of a brief psychotic\n\ndisorder on the appellants part. A psychotic disorder is defined in Kaplan & SaddocksComprehensive\n\nTextbook of Psychiatryas:(i)    delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech or grossly\n\ndisorganised or catatonic behaviour;(ii)    lasting at least one day but less than one month; and(iii)    which is not better accounted for by a mood disorder\n\nwith psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, orschizophrenia, and is not due\n\nto the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition.Dr Kong was of the opinion that these criteria were met as appellant was deluded\n\nas to the deceaseds suspicions of him, as well as exhibiting highly disorganised behaviour.",
        "Rebuttal medical evidence": "20.    The prosecutions expert witness, Dr Tan was recalled to\n\ngive rebuttal evidence. He opined that although the appellant appeared to have developed a mild\n\ndepressive episode after his arrest, as evidenced by his suicide attempts after arrest, he did not\n\nsuffer from an form of mental or major depressive illness before his arrest. The diagnostic\n\nguidelines in theInternational Classification of Diseases(ICD-10) state that for a\n\ndepressive episode to be diagnosed, there must be at least two of the following conditions present:-(i)    depressed mood(ii)    loss of interest and enjoyment(iii)    increased fatigabilityIn addition, there must also be present at least two of the following:-(i)    reduced concentration and attention(ii)    reduced self-esteem and self-confidence(iii)    ideas of guilt and unworthiness(iv)    bleak and pessimistic views of the future(v)    ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide(vi)    disturbed sleep(vii)    diminished appetite.Dr Tan opined that, on the evidence, the ICD-10 criteria were not met, as the\n\nappellant was able to function normally in the weeks before the murder, and had by his own admission\n\nbeen actively helping his friend Wanchai to look for a job the week before the murder. Dr Tan also\n\nplaced reliance on the appellants ability to give clear and precise directions to the deceased\n\nfrom Golden Mile Complex all the way to Pasir Ris. Dr Tans conclusion was that the appellant was\n\nnot suffering any mental illness that had impaired his mental responsibility for the offence which\n\nhe committed.21.    With leave of the court, the prosecution called one Noordin\n\nbin Mohd Amin who was employed by the same employer Lian Hin Lee as the appellant. Noordin testified\n\nthat between May and June 2000 he was a construction carpenter with Lian Hin Lee at the work site at\n\nLorong Halus. The appellant was in his team and Noordins role was to direct the Thai workers in\n\nthe work they carried out. He spoke little Thai and the instructions were given to the Thai workers\n\nby sign language. Noordin said that the appellant did not tell him that he (the appellant) was ill\n\nor that his memory was so bad that he was unable to work. Noordin said that the appellant was able\n\nto follow instructions and complete the job allocated to him. He described the appellants\n\nstandard of work as O K but the appellant was sometimes careless.",
        "The decision below": "22.    The trial judge found that the defence of diminished\n\nresponsibility had not been made out on the balance of probabilities. The appellant was in\n\npossession of all his mental faculties during the entire taxi journey, and the injuries inflicted on\n\nthe deceased were not inflicted while he was in a dazed and dissociative state; he was fully\n\nconscious of what he was doing. In preferring Dr Tans testimony to Dr Kongs, the judge found\n\nDr Kongs evidence to be inconsistent and replete with over-generalisation, while Dr Tans\n\nwas both objective and consistent. As for the appellants own assertions as to his prior mental\n\nillness, the judge was of the view that they could not lend weight to the appellants case as they\n\nwere unsupported by evidence and the appellant had had ample opportunity to procure evidence of it\n\nfrom Thailand, but had not done so. The judge also found that the defence based on lack of requisite\n\nintention was plainly unsustainable, as the appellant was not suffering from any abnormality\n\nof mind at the time he committed the offence and instead, he carried it out in a cold-blooded\n\nmanner.",
        "The appeal": "23.        Before us, there were only two\n\nissues. The first was whether on the balance of probabilities the appellant had made out a case of\n\ndiminished responsibility, and the second was whether, on the evidence, the case against the\n\nappellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.",
        "Diminished responsibility": "24.    We turn first to the defence of diminished responsibility.\n\nIn this defence, the evidence in support primarily came from two sources, namely the appellant\n\nhimself, and his expert, Dr Kong. In relation to the appellants own evidence of his mental\n\nillness in Thailand, the judge did not accept it on the ground that there was nothing to corroborate\n\nor confirm what he said. Turning to his evidence of his mental illness while he was in Singapore,\n\nthe judge found that it was totally inconsistent with the evidence given by his workmates and the\n\nwork records produced. The judge said at  104:[T]he accuseds claim was that during the months of May to June 2000, he was\n\n  unable to concentrate on his work; he had frequent headaches; his brain was not functioning\n\n  properly; he was suffering from extreme stress and as a result his work hours diminished. But the\n\n  evidence of his colleagues and the work records produced . . . . . narrated a different story. It\n\n  appeared from his work records that in the months of May and June he was working as usual. His\n\n  records established that he had clocked three days overtime in June. However, it should be noted\n\n  that he stopped work on 9 June 2000. His fellow workers at the worksite also testified that they\n\n  did not notice that there was anything wrong with the accused either in relation to his work or in\n\n  relation to his general disposition. The accuseds claim that he suffered from lack of\n\n  concentration also did not tie up with his gambling success when the accused asserted that he was\n\n  in fact netting about $4,000 to $5,000 a month from gambling alone and that he had lost only once\n\n  on 9 June 2000.25.    These findings of the judge were fully justified. We for\n\nour part did not find the appellants evidence of his mental illness whether in Thailand or here\n\ncredible. Like the judge, we found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution showed that the\n\nappellant was not in a depressed state and was able to go about in his daily routine no different\n\nthan others and maintained the normal social ties with his co-workers and his girlfriend. In\n\nparticular, his girlfriend did not notice that the appellant was in low and depressed mood most of\n\nthe time. He was able to enjoy her company whenever they were together.26.    As for the medical evidence given by Dr Kong, the judge\n\nfound that there were major inconsistencies in what Dr Kong said. The judge said:105 Returning to Dr Kongs evidence, with respect, I must say that it\n\n  contained some major inconsistencies. First of all Dr Kong who had earlier reported that the\n\n  accused had been suffering from a major depression \"since the beginning of 2000\"\n\n  modified it during cross-examination to read that the accused had been suffering from a major\n\n  depression \"which had its beginnings from January/February 2000.\". Secondly, in his\n\n  written report he did not mention that the accused was suffering from \"dissociative\n\n  amnesia\", a clinical term which is quite distinct from the \"dissociative state\" he\n\n  had mentioned in the report. Another notable inconsistency was in relation to the clinical term:\n\n  Paranoid Reaction. Dr Kong said that although he had used the term Paranoid Reaction in his\n\n  report, what he really meant was Brief Psychotic Disorder.27.    The judge found that Dr Kong relied only on the subjective\n\naccount given by the appellant himself and paid no attention to the objective facts that were before\n\nthe court. The appellant did not appear to have suffered any fatigue or loss of energy in carrying\n\nout his work. His supervisor, Noordin bin Mohd Amin, testified that the appellant worked like any\n\nother workers and was able to carry out his work and was not found to be lethargic.28.    The judge found that despite Dr Kongs claims, the DSV-IV\n\ncriteria for Major Depressive Episode were not supported by evidence. The judge said at  106:[F]rom the evidence proffered by witnesses, such an opinion was not founded on\n\n  any credible evidence. None of the witnesses had come across the accused being in a depressed mood\n\n  nearly every day (symptom 1 of Major Depressive Episode in DSM-IV) nor did he appear to have\n\n  suffered from a markedly diminished interest in all or almost all activities nearly every day\n\n  (symptom 2). On the contrary, the evidence of his girlfriend, the accuseds colleagues and\n\n  friends was that the accused was behaving no differently from the others. There was also no\n\n  credible evidence to support the defendants assertion that the accused had a decrease or\n\n  increase in his appetite nearly everyday (symptom 3), nor was there any evidence to suggest that\n\n  he was suffering from any psychomotor retardation (symptom 5). In fact the facts pointed to the\n\n  contrary since all his colleagues testified that they had not noticed anything abnormal about the\n\n  accused and that there was nothing to suggest that his reflexes were slow.29.    Referring to Dr Tans evidence, the judge found that Dr\n\nTan took into account the objective facts in assessing whether a person was suffering from any\n\ndepressive episodes. Dr Tan said that for the appellant to qualify as suffering from Major\n\nDepression, he had to satisfy five or more of the criteria stated in DSM-IV within the same two week\n\nperiod. In his opinion, the appellant qualified only for symptom 4 which is insomnia; he did not\n\nsatisfy any other criteria as set out in the DSM-IV for Major Depressive Episode. Dr Tan was unable\n\nto find any objective or independent evidence to support the appellants claim. Like the judge, we\n\nalso accepted Dr Tans evidence, which was far more objective than that of Dr Kong.30.    There was also the evidence given by the appellant himself\n\nthat he did not work on 9 June 2000 onwards until the date of the offence, because he was busy\n\nhelping his friend, Wanchai, to look for employment. With reference to this evidence, Dr Tan pointed\n\nout that if the appellants mental illness had come to a head on 15 June 2000, the appellant would\n\nhimself be in a poor state of health on 9 June 2000, and would have no will or capacity to help\n\nactively his friend to look for a job one week before the incident.31.    The judges final evaluation of the evidence on the\n\ndiminished responsibility was summed up by him at  121 as follows:121 Reviewing the totality of the evidence, in my determination, the defence of\n\n  diminished responsibility had not been made out on balance of probabilities. In this regard, I\n\n  found the accused had not been truthful in his assertions. His claim in the witness box that he\n\n  removed the metal object from his waist and hit the driver at the back of his head about two to\n\n  three times in his statement of 15 June 2000 was not something reconstructed as claimed by Dr\n\n  Kong. In my opinion, he appeared to be fully conscious and was in possession of all his mental\n\n  faculties throughout the entire taxi journey to the extent that he could give the driver very\n\n  clear instructions as to the path as well as the turnings to be taken throughout the entire\n\n  journey. In my determination, the injuries inflicted on the accused were not something done in a\n\n  moment of daze and dissociative state but in a moment of full clarity and consciousness. Dr Kongs\n\n  evidence in my view suffered from lack of consistency and appeared to be replete with over-generalisation.\n\n  In my opinion, Dr Tans analysis appeared to possess both objectivity and consistency. In the\n\n  event, I accepted the evidence of Dr Tan that the accused was not suffering from any abnormality\n\n  of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility that the time of the commission of the\n\n  offence although he suffered a post-arrest depressive episode.We could find no reason to disagree with the judges conclusion, which was\n\namply supported by evidence. In our judgment, the defence of diminished responsibility failed.",
        "Reasonable doubt": "32.    The appellants second ground of appeal was that due to\n\nthe depression from which he was suffering at the time of the offence, he could not have formed the\n\nrequisite intention to commit murder. The short answer is that there was no evidence that the\n\nappellant was suffering from any depression at the time. Dr Tans evidence was that the appellant\n\nwas not suffering from any delusion or any grossly disorganised behaviour, and that the appellant\n\nexhibited a purposive behaviour and knew what he was doing.33.    In this case, the appellant admitted that he used a metal\n\nobject to hit the deceased two or three times on the head. It was the evidence of the forensic\n\npathologist, Dr Teo, that the four injuries as described in  3 above were inflicted on the\n\ndeceased, and it was not disputed that these injuries were inflicted by the appellant. The evidence\n\nof Dr Teo was that, inter alia, two of the injuries inflicted on the deceased, namely, the\n\nlaceration and the bruise described as injuries (i) and (iv), in  3 above, were sufficient in the\n\nordinary course of nature to cause death. It was therefore proved beyond reasonable doubt that the\n\nappellant was the one who inflicted the injuries on the deceaseds head intentionally, and not\n\naccidentally; that two of the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n\ndeath; and that they did cause the death of the deceased. Thus, the requirements of s 300(c) of the\n\nPenal Code on which the prosecution relied had been satisfied:Virsa Singh v State of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465 at 467;Mimi Wong and Anor v Public Prosecutor[1972] 2 MLJ 75at 78; andPublic\n\nProsecutor v Visuvanathan[1978] 1 MLJ 159at 169.",
        "The requisite intention": "34.    We found that the appellants contention that he lacked\n\nthe requisite intent to inflict the relevant injuries on the deceased to be plainly untenable. In\n\nlight of the whole circumstances in which the attack on the deceased was carried out, we had no\n\nhesitation in agreeing with the following conclusion of the judge:122 In my determination, the prosecution had discharged its ultimate burden in\n\n  proving the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defence of diminished\n\n  responsibility as well as the defence based on lack of requisite intention raised on behalf of the\n\n  accused were plainly unsustainable. There was no evidence that the accused was suffering from any\n\n  abnormality of mind prior to or at the time of the commission of the offence. In my view, the\n\n  offence committed was willed and carried out in a cold-blooded manner. In the end, I was satisfied\n\n  that the prosecution had indeed proven its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt and that he\n\n  had not, on a balance of probabilities established his defence.",
        "Conclusion": "35.    For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
