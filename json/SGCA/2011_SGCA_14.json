        "Introduction": "1       This was an appeal by Ramalingam Ravinthran\n                    (“the appellant”) against the decision of the trial judge\n                    (“the Judge”) in Criminal Case No 29 of 2007 (seePublic Prosecutor v Ramalingam Ravinthran[2009] SGHC\n                    265 (“the GD”)) convicting him of two charges of trafficking in a\n                    controlled drug (ie, respectively, 5,560.1g of\n                    cannabis and 2,078.3g of cannabis mixture), an offence under\n                        s 5(1)(a) read with s 33 of and the\n                    Second Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the MDA”). 2       The two charges arose in the same transaction. A\n                    sports bag (“the sports bag”) containing eight blocks of vegetable\n                    matter, each wrapped in aluminium foil and transparent plastic cling wrap, was\n                    recovered from the rear left passenger seat of a motor car when the appellant\n                    was arrested after a car chase. The eight blocks of vegetable matter were put in\n                    three separate plastic bags inside the sports bag. At the time of his arrest,\n                    the appellant was alone in the car. The eight blocks of vegetable matter, upon\n                    analysis, were found to contain cannabis and cannabis mixture, both controlled\n                    substances under the MDA. This gave rise to two distinct charges, one for\n                    trafficking in cannabis and the other for trafficking in cannabis mixture, as\n                    cannabis and cannabis mixture are classified as different drugs for the purposes\n                    of the MDA. 3       At the conclusion of oral submissions before us,\n                    we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.",
        "Background": "4       The undisputed facts set out in the statements\n                    given by the appellant to the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”)\n                    were as follows. The appellant, a Singapore citizen, was in the business of\n                    supplying workers to the refinery, oil rig and marine industries, a business he\n                    set up in 1982. According to the appellant’s statements, he was introduced\n                    in 2001 to four labour supply contractors in Malaysia, two of whom were Anand\n                    and Kumar. The appellant would use their services when he had contracts in\n                    Malaysia. 5       Sometime in 2005 or 2006, the appellant met\n                    Anand and Kumar in a restaurant near a temple in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. With\n                    them were one Tamby, who was their foreman, and some other men. Tamby introduced\n                    one or more of them to the appellant, including one “Rajoo” (whose\n                    real name was Sundar Arujanan). Subsequently, Sundar Arujanan\n                    (“Sundar”) would telephone the appellant from time to time to ask\n                    if the appellant had work opportunities for him. They would also meet socially\n                    from time to time in Singapore, sometimes by chance and sometimes by arrangement\n                    over the telephone. 6       Sometime in April or May 2006, Anand and Kumar\n                    invited the appellant to a nightclub in Johor Bahru, where they had drinks and\n                    women for company. The appellant drank a glass of beer, which he later suspected\n                    to have been laced with drugs as he felt giddy after drinking it, even though,\n                    ordinarily, he could drink up to fifteen glasses of beer without difficulty.\n                    When he asked Kumar what was in the beer, Kumar replied, “party\n                    things” which were “good for the women”. After that, the\n                    appellant attended similar social events with Anand and Kumar weekly. On two or\n                    three such occasions, Anand gave the appellant cigarettes to smoke, which the\n                    appellant also suspected contained drugs. 7       On one of these social occasions, Kumar told the\n                    appellant that there were three or four incidents when people had\n                    “cheated him” in Singapore. He then told the appellant that he\n                    trusted him, and asked him to help him. When the appellant asked what kind of\n                    help Kumar meant, Kumar replied that it involved transportation of something,\n                    but had “nothing to do with drugs or explosives”. The appellant\n                    told Kumar that he would help him if he had the time. 8       Sometime in May or June 2006, the appellant\n                    received a telephone call from Kumar asking him to help transport a bag from the\n                    Sri Arasakesari Sivan Temple (“the SAS Temple”) at 25 Sungei\n                    Kadut Avenue, Singapore, to the “Sungei Kadut canteen” (properly\n                    known as the Hawkerway Food Court) at 16A Sungei Kadut Way. The appellant\n                    was told to go to the SAS Temple in his car, leave the car door unlocked and\n                    then go inside the temple to pray. Upon receiving the bag, the appellant was to\n                    bring it to the Hawkerway Food Court, although he was not told whom he should\n                    deliver it to. On a pre-arranged day in June 2006, the appellant drove to the\n                    SAS Temple, parked his car at the temple grounds and left the door unlocked as\n                    instructed. He then went inside the temple to pray. When he came out 20 minutes\n                    later, he saw that a bag had been placed on the back seat of his car. He drove\n                    to the Hawkerway Food Court with the bag, parked his car nearby and had a meal\n                    there. When he returned to his car 25 minutes later, the bag was no longer\n                    inside the car. The appellant entered his car and drove off. After about 10\n                    minutes of driving, Kumar telephoned the appellant and informed him that the bag\n                    had been collected. Kumar told the appellant further that he thought the\n                    appellant would have looked into the bag, which contained safety boots. During a\n                    social outing with Kumar after this incident, the appellant asked Kumar why the\n                    bag had to be left in and taken from his car, and why he could not have received\n                    it and delivered it face-to-face. Kumar replied by telling the appellant not to\n                    worry about it. 9       On the morning of 13 July 2006, the\n                    appellant received a telephone call from Tamby (see[5]above), who told him that Kumar or Sundar would call him in\n                    the afternoon. That afternoon, Kumar telephoned the appellant at his office at\n                    around 2pm and told him to meet Sundar at the SAS Temple at 3.30pm. Sundar\n                    himself telephoned shortly after to confirm this. The appellant drove to the SAS\n                    Temple at around 3.30pm, but found the gates closed. He then telephoned Sundar,\n                    who said he would take some time to get there. The appellant replied that he had\n                    work to do and was not sure if he would wait; he then drove off. 10     While he was driving, the appellant received\n                    another telephone call from an unknown person telling him to go to “the\n                    canteen”, whereupon the appellant drove to the Hawkerway Food Court at\n                    Sungei Kadut Way. The appellant did not recognise the voice of the caller at the\n                    time, but, later, it occurred to him that the caller was a person called Abang\n                    who had been introduced to him at Kumar’s office in Malaysia sometime at\n                    the end of 2005. 11     The appellant arrived at the Hawkerway Food\n                    Court at around 3.45pm, parked his car nearby and went to the food court to use\n                    the restroom. When he was in the restroom, a person approached him. The\n                    appellant addressed him as “Abang”, but did not immediately\n                    recognise him. However, he later recalled that it was the same Abang whom he had\n                    met at Kumar’s office in late 2005. Abang then asked the appellant,\n                    “Hasn’t the book arrived?”, to which the appellant replied,\n                    “No.” Abang then gave the appellant a bundle of currency notes and\n                    told him to give the money to whoever brought the book, saying that it was\n                    “workman’s money”. After Abang left the restroom, the\n                    appellant entered a toilet cubicle to count the money, which amounted to $4,000.\n                    The appellant then left the restroom, had a meal at the food court and left the\n                    food court. 12     Between 4.15pm and 5.00pm on the same day, the\n                    appellant drove around the Sungei Kadut area on work-related errands and had\n                    coffee at a coffee shop. He then drove to the SAS Temple, arriving at around\n                    5.15pm. As the gate was open, he parked in the compound and got out of the car.\n                    Sundar then approached the car, opened the door and placed the sports bag\n                        (ie, the sports bag defined at[2]above) on the back passenger seat. Both men\n                    then got into the car. The appellant gave the $4,000 which he had received from\n                    Abang to Sundar, saying that it was “workman’s money”. Both\n                    men then left the SAS Temple in the appellant’s car at about\n                    5.20pm. 13     The Judge’s findings in relation to what\n                    happened at the SAS Temple are summarised at [3]–[5] of the GD\n                    as follows: 3    Officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau\n                            (“CNB”) had kept the [appellant] on surveillance on the\n                            date of his arrest on 13 July 2006. He was observed to have driven\n                            his car SBR 4484 (“the car”) into the compound of Sri\n                            Arasakesari Sivan Temple (“the temple”) along Sungei Kadut\n                            Avenue at about 5.15 pm. The [appellant] parked the car and went\n                            out of it. He then met up with another man, Sundar Arujunan\n                            (“Sundar”) in the compound. Sundar was carrying a red and\n                            blue bag (“the [sports] bag”). Sundar placed the [sports]\n                            bag into the back seat of the car. The [appellant] and Sundar then went\n                            into the car, with the [appellant] driving and Sundar in the front\n                            passenger’s seat. He drove the car out of the temple compound and\n                            proceeded to Woodlands Road where Sundar alighted, leaving the [sports]\n                            bag in the car. 4    The CNB officers continued to keep surveillance on\n                            the [appellant]’s car. They trailed the car as it made its way to\n                            Kranji Expressway, Sungei Tengah Road, Bricklands Road, KJE, Pioneer\n                            Road North, Jurong West Streets 91, 92 and 93, Upper Jurong Road,\n                            Pioneer Road North, Pioneer Circle and Pioneer Road where the journey\n                            ended with the arrest of the [appellant]. 5    The route taken by the [appellant] showed that he\n                            was driving around in no particular direction. The officers noted in\n                            their pocket books after the arrest that the [appellant] was driving at\n                            a high speed, that he drove through two red traffic lights and made two\n                            turns around Pioneer Circle. 14     The appellant made no mention of the car chase\n                    in his statements to the CNB. The arresting CNB officers gave a full account of\n                    it and of the manner in which the appellant was arrested. When asked about it in\n                    cross-examination, the appellant did not dispute the route taken or the manner\n                    of his arrest; however, he denied that he had driven at a high speed at the\n                    material time, had driven through two red traffic lights or had been trying to\n                    elude the cars following him to avoid being caught with something illegal. The\n                    following was undisputed: while travelling along Pioneer Road towards Benoi\n                    Road, the appellant’s car was travelling in the left lane. When he reached\n                    the front of the ExxonMobil Refinery at 18 Pioneer Road, the appellant\n                    switched to the right lane and stopped at a red light. At this moment (about\n                    5.40pm), a car driven by Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Yee Chong overtook the\n                    appellant’s car on the right side, going against the flow of traffic along\n                    Pioneer Road, before swerving left in front of the appellant’s car at a\n                    45-degree angle. A second car driven by Staff Sergeant Lim Kim Hock stopped\n                    on the left side of the appellant’s car, while a third car driven by Woman\n                    Sergeant Chan Jee Yeng (“W/Sgt JY Chan”) stopped\n                    behind the appellant’s car. These manoeuvres all happened within about 10\n                    to 20 seconds. Three CNB officers, Senior Station Inspector Tan Yian Chye\n                    (“SSI YC Tan”), Senior Staff Sergeant Rahmat bin Toleh\n                    (“SS/Sgt Rahmat”) and Station Inspector M Subramaniam\n                    (“SI Subramaniam”), emerged from the first, second and third\n                    cars respectively and ran towards the appellant’s car. The appellant then\n                    reversed his car, whereupon W/Sgt JY Chan (who was in the car behind\n                    the appellant’s car) drove forward and stopped the appellant from\n                    reversing his car. SI Subramaniam then smashed the windshield of the\n                    appellant’s car with a hammer, while SSI YC Tan smashed the\n                    passenger-side window with some instrument. SS/Sgt Rahmat then opened the\n                    passenger-side door and handcuffed the appellant’s left hand. The\n                    appellant was then brought out of his car by other CNB officers. 15     After he was arrested, the appellant was\n                    brought to a trailer park along Pioneer Road, about 200 to 300 metres away. At\n                    around 5.55pm, a group of CNB officers from the CNB Special Task Force\n                    (“STF”) arrived at the trailer park to take custody of the\n                    appellant. At about 6.20pm, two STF officers recorded a statement from the\n                    appellant. Senior Staff Sergeant David Ng (“SS/Sgt Ng”)\n                    acted as recording officer, while Sergeant Chelliah Vijay\n                    (“Sgt V Chelliah”) acted as a Tamil interpreter. The\n                    relevant part of the statement recorded by SS/Sgt Ng was in the form of\n                    questions (from SS/Sgt Ng) and answers (from the appellant) as\n                    follows: Q1:The sport [sic] bag\n                            that found inside the car belong to who? A1:My friend ‘Rajoo’ [ie, Sundar]. Q2:What is inside the bag [ie, the sports bag]? A2:Something inside. Q3:What ‘something’ are you\n                            referring? A3:I’m not very sure. Q4:Why ‘Rajoo’ leave his bag inside your\n                            car when he alighted? A4:‘Rajoo’ said later, he will take his\n                            bag. Q5:After opened the bag in front of you, do you know\n                            what is inside there? A5:Yes. I know. Q6:What is inside the bag? A6:The ‘Grass’. Q7:How do you know is the ‘Grass’ whereby\n                            I did not tear opened the aluminium wrapper? A7:I knew it because the officers said\n                        so. Q8:What exact words did the officers\n                        said? A8:‘Grass’. In recording the last answer, SS/Sgt Ng instructed\n                    Sgt V Chelliah to spell out the words “grass” and\n                    “glass” to the appellant to confirm that he had answered\n                    “grass”. The appellant confirmed that he had answered\n                    “grass”. 16     The sports bag in the appellant’s car\n                    was searched, and was found to contain eight blocks of vegetable matter (placed\n                    in three separate plastic bags) wrapped in aluminium foil and transparent\n                    plastic cling wrap. The eight blocks of vegetable matter were handed over to\n                    analysts at the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on the next day,\n                    14 July 2006. The analysis showed that the vegetable blocks were found to\n                    contain 5,560.1g of cannabis and 2,078.3g of cannabis mixture. Two out of three\n                    urine samples taken from the appellant on 13 July 2006 were also handed\n                    over to the HSA (one to Analyst Lim Cheng Min and the other to\n                    Analyst Moy Hooi Yan) on 14 July 2006. The samples were analysed and\n                    certified (by Lim Cheng Min on 25 July 2006 and Moy Hooi Yan on\n                    24 July 2006 respectively) to contain tetrahydrocannibinol (or\n                    “THC”), the main intoxicating substance in cannabis. Searches were\n                    made at the appellant’s workplace at 53 Shipyard Road, a building at\n                    11 Warwick Road and the appellant’s home at Block 64, #02-196,\n                    Telok Blangah Drive, but nothing incriminating was found at any of those\n                    places.",
        "Statements of Sundar and the appellant to the CNB": "17     Several statements from Sundar and the\n                    appellant, taken in the course of investigations, were admitted in evidence at\n                    the trial below. At the appellant’s trial, Sundar was a prosecution\n                    witness. However, he turned hostile, and the Prosecution was given leave under\n                    s 156 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) to cross-examine\n                    him as a hostile prosecution witness under s 147 of the Evidence Act as he\n                    had previously given inconsistent statements to the CNB. Three investigation\n                    statements made by Sundar as well as the statement of facts which Sundar\n                    admitted to at his own trial for drug trafficking were admitted for this\n                    purpose. 18     We now set out the material portions of the\n                    statements made by Sundar and the appellant.",
        "Sundar’s statements": "19     The material parts of the statement recorded\n                    from Sundar on 17 July 2006 on what had happened after the appellant had\n                    driven out of the SAS Temple on 13 July 2006 at about 5.20pm read as\n                    follows: 37    We turned out from the carpark into the main road.\n                            I was in a happy mood then, thinking that I would be getting my work\n                            permit. But after travelling for about 5 to 6 minutes, [the appellant]suddenly asked if I knew what was inside the\n                                [sports] bag and I replied negatively. He then told me that it was\n                                ganja. I did not know whether he was telling the truth but I\n                                immediately told him that I want to get out of the car.\n                            [The appellant] did not utter another word, he just stopped the car and\n                            let me alight. I wished to add that while I was in the car, I did not\n                            see [the appellant] opening up the [sports] bag[.] 38    … After that, I went to buy some fruits from\n                            a fruit stall and then went to a nearby bus stop to take bus\n                            no. 170. 39    At about 5.30pm to 6pm, while I was waiting at the\n                            bus stop, a group of about 6 to 7 men in plain clothes came and\n                            identified themselves to be police. They asked me to kneel down and\n                            conducted a search on me. They found the roll of money and asked me how\n                            much was there. I replied that there was S$4000. I was then handcuffed\n                            and escorted to a police station. [emphasis added] 20     On 20 July 2006, a further investigation\n                    statement was taken from Sundar, in which he said: 52    The statement given by me on 13/07/2006 at\n                            8.10 pm in a police station was read back to me in Tamil and I\n                            confirmed it to be mine. I wished to add that I had told the police\n                            officers then that the [sports] bag contained ganja because I was\n                            informed by [the appellant], while I was in the car, that the [sports]\n                            bag contained ganja. I thought the police couldn’t have arrested\n                            me without any reason and so I just repeated to them that there was\n                            ganja in the [sports] bag. 21     On 6 July 2007, Sundar pleaded guilty to\n                    two charges of trafficking in cannabis in a quantity that made it a non-capital\n                    offence. At that hearing, Sundar admitted to a statement of facts dated\n                    5 July 2007, which stated,inter alia, as\n                    follows: 11    The accused [ie,\n                            Sundar] agreed. He took over the red and blue sports bag [ie, the sports bag] containing the 8 drug\n                            exhibits from “Sashi”. The accused thought that the red\n                            and blue sports bag contained “ganja”; but he did not open\n                            the red and blue sports bag to verify that there was\n                            “ganja” inside. ... 15    Shortly, both the accused and [the appellant] left\n                            the Sri Arasakesari Sivan temple in the car SBR 4484 S. [The\n                            appellant] was driving the said car.After travelling\n                                for about 5 minutes, [the appellant] said to the accused that there\n                                was “ganja” inside the red and blue sports\n                                bag. [emphasis added] Sundar was convicted on both counts of trafficking in a controlled\n                    substance and sentenced to a total of 20 years’ imprisonment and 24\n                    strokes of the cane. 22     After Sundar’s conviction, a further\n                    investigation statement was taken from him on 17 July 2007. In this\n                    statement, he said the following: 10    Inside the car, [the appellant] asked me whether I\n                            wanted to have a drink. I said I got no money. He said I was a stingy\n                            fellow and said I was a “kanjappaya” (Recorder[’s]\n                            notes: Accused said the “kanjappaya” meant stingy fellow).\n                            [The appellant] was not going to Tekka so I got out of the car to go to\n                            Tekka. I did not know where [the appellant] was going. 11I mistaken\n                                “kanjappaya” as “ganja” because back at\n                                CNB, the officers told me the [sports] bag contained\n                                ‘ganja’, I got the impression that [the appellant] has\n                                told me about the ‘ganja’. I am now saying\n                            its “kanjappaya” when [the appellant] told me this word in\n                            the car and not ‘ganja’. I was confused when I was\n                            arrested. [emphasis added]",
        "The appellant’s statements": "23     A cautioned statement was recorded from the\n                    appellant under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,\n                    1985 Rev Ed) on 18 July 2006. The statement read: Rajoo [ie, Sundar] rang me at around two\n                        something to three and told me to come to Sivan Temple at Sungei Kadut Road\n                        to meet him at 3.30 pm. At about 3.30 pm, I went to the temple and\n                        no one was around. The gate was closed. He called me again and told me to go\n                        to a food centre nearby and asked me to wait there. I parked my car near the\n                        food centre and went inside the food centre. I viewed the food stalls and\n                        then went to the toilet. I was in the toilet for about 7 minutes and then I\n                        came out. Ah Bang, who was a truck driver I knew previously, came into the\n                        toilet and confronted me.Ah Bang asked me whether the\n                            book had arrived. I did not know what is the book he referred but\n                            whenever Rajoo brought in something, they would refer to as book. I told\n                            Ah Bang the book had not arrived. He then gave me $4000 and\n                        asked me to pass to Rajoo. I called Rajoo later and I went to a coffeeshop\n                        later at Choa Chu Kang. Rajoo rang me up on my phone and asked me to meet at\n                        the temple. At 5 something, I arrived at the temple. The gate was opened and\n                        I parked my car inside. Rajoo arrived then. He was carrying a [sports] bag\n                            [ie, the sports bag defined at[2]above]. Rajoo asked me to open up the boot\n                        but I had other things in the boot, so he opened up the rear passenger door\n                        to put the [sports] bag on the seat. Rajoo came and sat in the car. He told me to drive off. While driving\n                        along Bukit Timah Road towards city, suddenly Rajoo asked me to stop the\n                        car. He dropped off and told me either Ah Bang or himself would call me\n                        later. I then drove off. Police arrested me later in the car.They asked me what was in the [sports] bag and I told them I\n                            don’t know. I did not commit the offence. I helped them\n                        because I am obligated to them. They used me because I am a soft man. I will\n                        fully cooperate and tell all the truth. [emphasis added] 24     On 20 July 2006, another investigation\n                    statement was recorded from the appellant. We set out below those portions that\n                    recount what happened after the appellant and Sundar left the SAS Temple on\n                    13 July 2006 at about 5.20pm: 40    While ‘Rajoo’ [ie, Sundar] was putting the [sports] bag down, I boarded\n                            my car as well. I then told ‘Rajoo’ to come into the front\n                            passenger seat so that I could pass him the S$4000. As I did not want to\n                            stay in the temple compound, I started the car and drove off. I was\n                            going in the direction towards my workplace in Jurong. While driving, I\n                            took out the money from my right pants pocket and gave to\n                            ‘Rajoo’. I could not remember if he counted the money then,\n                            but I told him that it was workman’s money. ‘Rajoo’\n                            then asked me where I was going and I told him that I was going to my\n                            workplace. Suddenly he told me to stop the car, which was just before\n                            the bus stop, along Bukit Timah Road, in the direction towards the city.\n                            ‘Rajoo’ then alighted from the car. 41    I drove off and headed for Jurong with the\n                            intention to go to my workplace then. Afterwhich I would wait for\n                            ‘Abang’ to call me and arrange for a meeting place to pick\n                            up the [sports] bag.During this entire time, I did\n                                not touch the [sports] bag at all. I did not notice whether the\n                                [sports] bag was locked but I had no intention to see the content\n                                inside. I did not want to check the [sports] bag as I thought it was\n                                better not for me to see. I suspected that something was not right,\n                                and the [sports] bag might contain something illegal. I had this\n                                suspicion because if the content was legal, they would not need to\n                                be so discreet. Only then I realized that they were using\n                                me. 42    While traveling, I could not remember the exact\n                            time then, I came to a stop at a traffic light along Pioneer Road, at\n                            the Esso Refinery and Petrol Kiosk. 3 cars then came by. 1 car stopping\n                            in front of my car, 1 behind my car and 1 at the passenger’s side.\n                            I saw several men in plain clothes coming out of the car. They smashed\n                            my windscreen and the side windows. They brought me out of the car and\n                            made me sit on the road. Afterwhich, they then handcuffed me. I did not\n                            struggle during the arrest. 43    I realized then that the men in plain clothes\n                            should be police officers. They then escorted me to a trailer carpark\n                            nearby. Shortly, another team of 4 officers took over me from the\n                            officers who arrested me. After about 15 minutes, everyone left the\n                            carpark expect [sic] the 4 new officers. 2\n                            of the officers then spoke to me. One of them acted as the Tamil\n                            interpreter and the other recorded a statement from me. 44    The statement given by me at the carpark on\n                            13/07/06 at 6.20pm was read over to me in Tamil. I confirmed that it was\n                            mine, true and correct. In the statement, I told the officers that\n                            ‘Rajoo’ would take the [sports] bag later. I wished to\n                            clarify that the [sports] bag was actually meant for\n                            ‘Abang’. I had mentioned ‘Rajoo’ instead because\n                            I was in a confused state then, from all the earlier\n                        commotion. 45When I was asked what was in the\n                                [sports] bag, I had replied that it was ‘grass’ because\n                                I had overheard officers mentioning the term ‘glass’ or\n                                ‘grass’ earlier. I did not know the context\n                            in which the term was used because I did not hear the entire\n                            conversation.I only heard the word\n                                ‘glass’ or ‘grass’. I had answered the\n                                officers that it was ‘grass’ in the [sports] bag because\n                                I overheard the term earlier and I just replied as\n                            such.

        "The appellant’s defence": "25     The appellant’s defence is summarised at\n                        [40]–[44] of the GD as follows: 40    The [appellant] did not know what was in the\n                            [sports] bag and thought that it may be some industrial articles or a\n                            book. He also thought that Sundar was going with him to deliver the\n                            [sports] bag. He gave the money he received from Abang to Sundar, and\n                            told him that it was money for workers, and then they drove out of the\n                            temple compound. When they were at Bukit Timah Road, Sundar suddenly\n                            asked him to stop at a bus stop. When he stopped there, Sundar got off,\n                            leaving the [sports] bag in the car. He asked Sundar about it, and\n                            Sundar told him that he or Abang will be calling him. 41    At that time, the [appellant] realised that there\n                            was a car in front and another car at the rear of his car, and he was\n                            suspicious about these cars. He drove off and kept observation on them.\n                            He drove for about 20 minutes with the cars trailing him. When he\n                            stopped at a traffic light junction along Pioneer Road, the other cars\n                            blocked his car and persons (the CNB officers) went to his car and\n                            arrested him. 42    After he was arrested, he was taken to a trailer\n                            park nearby, and was made to sit on the side of the road. He said that\n                            at the trailer park, he heard some CNB officers mention\n                            “grass” and “glass” in relation to the\n                            contents of the [sports] bag and he knew that “grass”\n                            referred toganja. 43    The prosecutor cross-examined the [appellant] at\n                            some length. The [appellant] confirmed that he had asked Sundar to buy\n                            him a meal, and had called Sundar akanjanorkanjappaya(a miser) when Sundar\n                            declined. He had said that as a joke, and they would both laugh over\n                            it. 44    The prosecutor also questioned him on the statement\n                            he made at the trailer park. The [appellant] clarified that he heard the\n                            officers talking, “they were talking among themselves, and I\n                            overheard the word ‘grass’”, and when his statement\n                            was recorded, he was asked in Tamil what the content of the [sports] bag\n                            was and he replied that it was “grass”.",
        "The Judge’s findings": "26     The Judge began his evaluation of the evidence\n                    by focusing on the critical issue as to whether the appellant had actual\n                    knowledge that the sports bag contained cannabis and cannabis mixture. After\n                    considering the appellant’s statements, Sundar’s statements and\n                    their respective testimonies, the Judge made the following findings of\n                    fact: (a)     “… I find as a fact\n                        that the [appellant] had answered ‘grass’ in English (which he\n                        knew to refer toganja[ie, cannabis]) and that he had not said\n                        ‘glass’” (at [59] of the GD); (b)     “… that the [appellant]\n                        had [not] saidkanja payalto [Sundar] rather\n                        thanganja, and I impeached [Sundar’s]\n                        credit …” (at [61] of the GD); (c)     “… that Sundar had said that the\n                        [appellant] had told him that the [sports] bag containedganja, and that he was not mistaken or deliberately lying\n                        when he made the statement. Consequently, I find that Sundar’s\n                        statement that the [appellant] told him the [sports] bag containedganjais admissible, and is truthful\n                        …” (at [64] of the GD); and (d)     that “[t]he [appellant] was in possession\n                        of the [sports] bag containing the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. The\n                        prosecution had proved that after his arrest, he acknowledged that the\n                        [sports] bag containedganja, and that he had\n                        also told Sundar that the [sports] bag containedganja, a term which covers cannabis and cannabis\n                        mixture” (at [65] of the GD). 27     The Judge also made an alternative finding\n                    against the appellant. He found on the evidence that the appellant was wilfully\n                    blind as to what was contained in the sports bag. The Judge referred to the\n                    decision of the Court of Appeal inTan Kiam Peng v Public\n                        Prosecutor[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“Tan\n                        Kiam Peng”). The Judge was a member of the panel of the\n                    Court of Appeal in that case. In making that finding, he rejected the\n                    appellant’s evidence that he (the appellant) had not had any opportunity\n                    to see what was in the sports bag (see the GD at [68]–[69] (reproduced at[40]below)). 28     On the basis of these findings of fact, the\n                    Judge held (at [70]–[71] of the GD) as follows: 70    In view of the\n                            quantities of cannabis and cannabis mixture in the [sports] bag (which\n                            were not disputed), a presumption arose under s 17 of the [MDA]\n                            that the [appellant] had those drugs for the purpose of trafficking, as\n                            “traffic” being defined in s 2 to be: (a)    to sell, give, administer, transport, send,\n                                deliver or distribute; or (b)    to offer to do anything mentioned in\n                                paragraph (a), and the [appellant] has not rebutted the presumption that the\n                        drugs were in his possession for the purpose of trafficking as his case is\n                        that he was keeping the [sports] bag for Sundar or Abang, ie, that he\n                        intended to send or deliver the [sports] bag to either of them. With those\n                        elements established, the [appellant] had trafficked in the drugs under\n                        s 5(2) of the [MDA]: a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he\n                            has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. 71    Consequently, I find the [appellant] guilty and\n                            convict him on the two charges that he faces, and I impose the death\n                            sentence on him for each charge.",
        "The appellant’s grounds of appeal": "29     The appellant’s grounds of appeal were\n                    that the Judge erred as follows: (a)     in believing that Sundar was telling\n                        the truth when he claimed that the appellant had told him that the sports\n                        bag containedganja(ie, cannabis); (b)     in finding that the appellant knew that the sports bag\n                        containedganja, when the question as to his\n                        knowledge of the contents of that bag was never put to him by the\n                        Prosecution; (c)     in\n                        finding that the appellant was wilfully blind as to what was in the sports\n                        bag; and (d)     in\n                        relying on the presumption in s 17 of the MDA (“the s 17\n                        presumption”) against the appellant. 30     With respect to ground (a), the\n                    appellant’s counsel contended that Sundar’s statement was a classic\n                    case of accomplice evidence where the accomplice sought to deflect blame from\n                    himself to another so as to establish his (the accomplice’s) own\n                    innocence. Sundar, so counsel submitted, wanted the CNB officers to believe that\n                    he did not know that the sports bag contained cannabis, and that it was the\n                    appellant who had told him of the bag’s contents when he was in the\n                    appellant’s car. Counsel contended that the Judge did not consider\n                    Sundar’s statement in its entirety, and that if he had done so, he would\n                    have found Sundar’s motivation to be clear. 31     Counsel further contended that other evidence\n                    also militated against a reasonable finding that part of Sundar’s\n                    statement (ie, that portion relating to what the\n                    appellant allegedly told Sundar about the sports bag containingganja) was true. Sundar’s oral testimony supported\n                    the appellant’s evidence that he (the appellant) had no knowledge of what\n                    was in the sports bag. Sundar did not implicate the appellant until he made his\n                    sixth statement on 17 July 2006,ie, until\n                    after four days of investigation following his arrest (and also the\n                    appellant’s) on 13 July 2006. For this reason, counsel contended,\n                    Sundar’s statement was an afterthought. In his s 122(6) statement,\n                    Sundar also did not mention that his knowledge that the sports bag contained\n                    cannabis came from the appellant. This was an important statement – Sundar\n                    could have exonerated himself if he established that his knowledge of the\n                    contents of the sports bag came from the appellant. 32     With respect to ground (b), the\n                    appellant’s counsel contended that the Prosecution never put it to the\n                    appellant that he had not derived his knowledge of what could be in the sports\n                    bag from the CNB officers at the scene of the arrest, and that when the\n                    appellant was first asked what was in the sports bag, he had said that he was\n                    not sure. Counsel also contended that the Prosecution made no attempt to verify\n                    whether the CNB officers at the scene had indeed said that “grass”\n                    was inside the sports bag. In the event, the identities of these officers (if\n                    any) could not be identified. 33     With respect to ground (c), the\n                    appellant’s counsel contended that the Judge had relied on para 41 of\n                    the appellant’s 20 July 2006 statement (reproduced at[24]above) to find that the appellant was\n                    wilfully blind as to what was in the sports bag, and had rejected the\n                    appellant’s evidence that he did not have any opportunity to inspect the\n                    sports bag on the ground that he had not mentioned that fact (ie, the lack of opportunity to inspect the bag) in any of his\n                    statements to the CNB officers. Counsel argued that the Judge was wrong to\n                    reject the appellant’s statement that he had no opportunity to check what\n                    was in the sports bag as no consideration had been given to the\n                    “mindset” of the appellant. 34     With respect to ground (d), it was\n                    contended that the Judge was wrong to have relied on the s 17 presumption\n                    as he had failed to consider every aspect of the defence with respect to the\n                    appellant’s lack of knowledge of what was in the sports bag, including,\n                    once again, the appellant’s mindset in relation to the finding that he was\n                    wilfully blind. 35     As to the appellant’s mindset in\n                    relation to the material facts, counsel contended that: (a)     as soon as Sundar entered the\n                        appellant’s car with the sports bag and placed it at the back, Sundar\n                        was in charge of it,ie, it was Sundar, and\n                        not the appellant, who was in possession of the sports\n                    bag; (b)     there was no\n                        allusion to a pre-arranged transaction of a sinister nature involving the\n                        appellant when Sundar, upon alighting from the car, responded to the\n                        appellant’s query on what to do with the sports bag by saying that he\n                        (Sundar) or Abang would pick it up later; and (c)     the appellant’s mental state after Sundar\n                        suddenly alighted was one of panic and suspicion, and given the\n                        circumstances after Sundar had alighted and considering that the appellant\n                        was then in the midst of driving the car, it could not be argued that the\n                        appellant had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the sports bag or make any\n                        inquiries as to its contents. 36     Counsel also argued that except for\n                    Sundar’s statement that incriminated the appellant, there was no evidence\n                    to hint or suggest that the delivery undertaken by the appellant had anything to\n                    do with anything illegal, let alone drugs generally or cannabis specifically.\n                    Counsel referred to the factual background that led to Sundar getting into the\n                    appellant’s car and putting a sports bag (ie, the sports bag) containing cannabis on the back seat,ie: the appellant’s previous dealings with Anand\n                    and Kumar, Kumar’s assurance that he did not intend the appellant to\n                    deliver anything illegal, the fact that the first delivery made by the appellant\n                    was of industrial safety boots, the appellant’s meeting with Abang at the\n                    restroom of the Hawkerway Food Court on 13 July 2006, Abang’s giving\n                    the appellant $4,000 to give to Sundar for workmen’s pay,etc(see[4]–[11]above).\n                    Counsel’s contention was that the Judge did not give these facts any\n                    consideration or thought for the purposes of understanding the appellant’s\n                    mindset in determining the issues of knowledge and in applying the s 17\n                    presumption.",
        "The Prosecution’s response to the appellant’s\n                case": "37     The Prosecution’s response to the\n                    appellant’s arguments may be summarised as follows: (a)     As the Judge’s decision was\n                        based on findings of fact, it was trite that an appellate court would not\n                        disturb such findings unless they were plainly wrong or clearly arrived at\n                        against the weight of the evidence, or unless there was a misdirection as to\n                        the law (citingPublic Prosecutor v Victor\n                            Rajoo[1995] 3 SLR(R) 189,Public\n                            Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik[2008]\n                        1 SLR(R) 601 andTan Kiam\n                    Peng). (b)     The appellant had physical control, and, therefore, physical possession of\n                        the sports bag when Sundar alighted from the appellant’s car: the\n                        appellant was transporting the sports bag back to his workplace to wait for\n                        Sundar or Abang to collect it. (c)     The appellant had actual knowledge of what was in the\n                        sports bag as he had admitted in his statement made at the trailer park\n                        shortly after his arrest that the sports bag contained\n                        “grass”. His explanation that he had no knowledge of the\n                        contents of that bag (and that he had said “grass” when asked\n                        about the sports bag’s contents merely because he had earlier heard\n                        the CNB officers say that the bag contained “grass”) was\n                        rejected by the Judge: if the appellant had not known what was in the sports\n                        bag, he should have maintained his earlier answer to the CNB officers that\n                        he was unsure what was in the sports bag (see[15]above). Further, when asked what was in the sports bag,\n                        the appellant had not replied that it contained “books” or\n                        “safety shoes” or “industrial things”, although\n                        those were the kinds of things that he was expected to transport for Kumar\n                        on 13 July 2006. (d)     The Prosecution had put to the appellant the proposition that he knew\n                        for a fact that the sports bag contained cannabis, which was why he replied\n                        “grass” when asked what the bag contained (which proposition\n                        the appellant denied). (e)     The appellant led the CNB officers on a prolonged car\n                        chase with a view to avoiding arrest. His explanation that he had thought he\n                        was being followed by “gangsters or thugs” in broad daylight\n                        on busy public roads was an affront to common sense as he could have called\n                        the police on his handphone for assistance if that had indeed been the\n                        case. (f)     Sundar\n                        implicated the appellant as to the latter’s knowledge of what was in\n                        the sports bag four days after his arrest. In contrast, he resiled from that\n                        statement implicating the appellant (by recalling that the appellant had\n                        said “kanjapayya” and not\n                            “ganja”) more than a year\n                        after his arrest, and only after he had been charged with and convicted of a\n                        non-capital drug offence in connection with his role in the material events.\n                        Accordingly, the Judge was entitled to rely on Sundar’s first\n                        statement, rather than on his testimony in court, to find that the appellant\n                        had informed Sundar that the sports bag containedganja. (g)     The Judge was correct in finding that the appellant was\n                        wilfully blind about the sports bag containing cannabis on the basis of the\n                        appellant’s own statements in para 41 of his 20 July 2006\n                        statement, where he said that he had “no intention to see the content\n                        inside”, that he “did not want to check the [sports] bag as\n                        [he] thought it was better not for [him] to see” and that\n                        “[he] suspected that something was not right, and the [sports] bag\n                        might contain something illegal”. What was admitted in this passage\n                        constituted wilful blindness as laid down by this court inTan Kiam Peng. (h)     Furthermore, the factual matrix showed that the appellant\n                        had such a level of suspicion about what was in the sports bag that he\n                        should have inquired about or inspected its contents. The appellant’s\n                        previous interactions with Kumar and Anand, the surreptitious manner of the\n                        receipt and delivery of the items alleged to be “industrial\n                        boots” or “books” on the first and second occasions,\n                        the appellant’s acting on a call from an unidentified person to go to\n                        the Hawkerway Food Court, the appellant’s failure to clarify with\n                        Abang what he meant by “books” and the appellant’s\n                        agreeing to hand over $4,000 to someone who would deliver a bag to him,\n                        taken together, all showed that despite the presence of suspicious\n                        circumstances which should have prompted the appellant to look into the\n                        sports bag to find out what was in it, he did not do\n                so.",

        "Actual knowledge": "38     We dismissed this appeal because, having\n                    regard to the totality of the evidence adduced at the trial, the Judge was\n                    entitled to find that the appellant had actual knowledge that he was trafficking\n                    in cannabis and cannabis mixture. In particular, the Judge accepted as voluntary\n                    and true the appellant’s reply, “The ‘Grass’”,\n                    when the appellant was asked by a CNB officer what was in the sports bag. The\n                    Judge rejected the appellant’s explanation as to why he had answered\n                    “The ‘Grass’”, instead of maintaining his previous\n                    reply that he was not sure what was in the sports bag. The fact that the\n                    appellant had replied “The ‘Grass’” was not disputed\n                    by his counselafter taking instructions from him(see the GD at [54]). The appellant’s defence was that he answered\n                    “The ‘Grass’” because he had heard the CNB officers\n                    talking among themselves and saying that “grass” was inside the\n                    sports bag. 39     The Judge, in evaluating the truth or\n                    otherwise of this piece of evidence, also took into account the statement of\n                    Sundar made on 20 July 2006, which implicated the appellant. Counsel for\n                    the appellant contended that that was a self-serving statement made by Sundar to\n                    the CNB officers with a view to exonerating himself from the offence of\n                    trafficking. In his testimony given after he had been charged and convicted of a\n                    lesser offence, Sundar tried to explain away this statement by saying that what\n                    the appellant had said was “kanjapayya” and not “ganja” in order to tease Sundar. This explanation was\n                    also rejected by the Judge – in our view, rightly.",
        "Wilful blindness": "40     The Judge found the appellant guilty of the\n                    offences charged on the alternative ground that he had the equivalent of actual\n                    knowledge that he was transporting cannabis and cannabis mixture because he was\n                    wilfully blind to that fact. In making this finding, the Judge referred to\n                    para 41 of the appellant’s 20 July 2006 statement (reproduced at[24]above), where the appellant\n                    explained why he had not wanted to look into the sports bag. The Judge’s\n                    findings are set out at [66]–[69] of the GD as follows: 66    The prosecutor\n                            argued that independently of the [appellant’s] admission and\n                            Sundar’s evidence, the [appellant] must be taken to have knowledge\n                            of the contents of the [sports] bag because he had deliberately kept a\n                            blind eye to that, and that was the effect of actual knowledge, as\n                            explained inTan Kiam Peng v PP[2008] 1\n                            SLR 1. 67    The prosecutor referred\n                            to para 41 of the [appellant’s] statement of 20 July\n                            2006 where he stated: I drove off and headed for Jurong with the intention to go to my\n                            workplace then. Afterwhich I would wait for ‘Abang’ to call\n                            me and arrange for a meeting place to pick up the [sports] bag. During\n                            this entire time, I did not touch the [sports] bag at all. I did not\n                            notice whether the [sports] bag was locked but I had no intention to see\n                            the content inside. I did not want to check the [sports] bag as I\n                            thought it was better not for me to see. I suspected that something was\n                            not right, and the [sports] bag might contain something illegal. I had\n                            this suspicion because if the content was legal, they would not need to\n                            be so discreet. Only then I realized that they were using me. 68    Although the [appellant] said in court that he had\n                            no opportunity to inspect the [sports] bag as he was trying to flee from\n                            the suspected gangsters and thugs in the cars which trailed him. I\n                            reject this explanation because he had not mentioned [it] in that\n                            statement. In addition to that, a further statement was recorded from\n                            him on 7 August 2006 after the statement of 20 July 2006 was\n                            read back and explained to him. In this later statement, he made two\n                            clarifications to the statement of 20 July 2006, but he again did\n                            not mention that he could not examine the [sports] bag because he was\n                            fleeing from those persons. 69    I therefore find that even if the [appellant] did\n                            not have actual knowledge of the contents of the [sports] bag, his\n                            wilful blindness has the same legal effect as actual\n                        knowledge. 41     We accepted that the circumstances in which\n                    the appellant received and took control and custody of the sports bag were\n                    highly suspicious. Besides the car chase mentioned at[14]above (which we found did indeed happen, based on the\n                    evidence of the CNB officers), there were all the other circumstances mentioned\n                    above at sub-para (h) of[37]above.\n                    Further, there was another cogent piece of evidence which the Judge did not\n                    mention, namely, that at no time while Sundar was in his car did the appellant\n                    ask Sundar what was in the sports bag that Sundar put on the back\n                seat. 42     All these circumstances in totality would\n                    support a rational inference that the appellant had actual knowledge that the\n                    sports bag contained cannabis. This approach would be consistent with the\n                    following statement of the law laid down by the Court of Appeal (per Wee Chong\n                    Jin CJ) inTan Ah Tee and another v Public\n                        Prosecutor[1979–1980] SLR(R) 311 (“Tan Ah Tee”) at [19] as follows: 19    With regard to the question of possession of the\n                            contents of the plastic bag it is submitted that the trial judges should\n                            have drawn the inference from her evidence thatshe\n                                did not in fact knowwhat was contained inside the\n                            plastic bag. In our opinion there was no plausible evidence before the\n                            trial judges to require them to draw the inference that she was an\n                            innocent custodian of the contents of the plastic bag. Indeed,even if there were no statutory presumptions available to\n                                the Prosecution, once the Prosecution had proved the fact\n                            of physical control or possession of the plastic bag and the\n                            circumstances in which this was acquired by and remained with the second\n                            appellant,the trial judges would be justified in\n                                finding that she had possession of the contents of the plastic bag\n                                within the meaning of the Act[ie, the then equivalent of the MDA] unless she gave an\n                            explanation of the physical fact which the trial judges accepted or\n                            which raised a doubt in their minds that she had possession of the\n                            contents within the meaning of the Act. [emphasis added] 43     By “possession … within the\n                    meaning of the Act” in the above passage, the court was referring to\n                    possession of a bag with knowledge of the contents of that bag. At [23] ofTan Ah\n                        Tee, the court quoted the speech of Lord Pearce inWarner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner[1969]\n                    2 AC 256 (“Warner”) at\n                    304–306. Lord Pearce continued at 307–308 ofWarnerto say: … There is a very strong inference of fact in any normal case that\n                        a man who possesses a parcel also possesses its contents, an inference on\n                        which a jury would in a normal case be justified in finding possession. A\n                        man who accepts possession of a parcel normally accepts possession of the\n                        contents. But that inference can be disproved or shaken by evidence that, although a\n                        man was in possession of a parcel, he was completely mistaken as to its\n                        contents and would not have accepted possession had he known what kind of\n                        thing the contents were. ... [I]f, though unaware of the contents, he did\n                        not open them at the first opportunity to ascertain (as he was entitled to\n                        do in his case) what they were, the proper inference is that he was\n                        accepting possession of them. (It would be otherwise if he had no right to\n                        open the parcel.) Again, if he suspected that there was anything wrong about\n                        the contents when he received the parcel, the proper inference is that he\n                        was accepting possession of the contents by not immediately verifying them.\n                        … 44     In our view, the inference of actual knowledge\n                    raised by the strong circumstantial evidence in this case – including, in\n                    particular, the appellant’s failure to ask Sundar what was in the sports\n                    bag and to see what was in the sports bag when he had many opportunities to do\n                    so – was consistent with the appellant’s reply that the sports bag\n                    contained “grass” (at[38]above). We agreed with the Judge’s finding (see[40]above) that the appellant had the opportunity to see what\n                    was in the sports bag. The evidence showed beyond any reasonable doubt that he\n                    had many opportunities to see what was in the sports bag, if he had wanted to.\n                    The first occasion was at the SAS Temple when Sundar brought the sports bag to\n                    the appellant’s car. Sundar asked the appellant whether he should put the\n                    sports bag in the boot, whereupon the appellant told him to leave it on the back\n                    seat (see para 39 of the appellant’s 20 July 2006 statement\n                    (reproduced at [14] of the GD)). The\n                    appellant could have inspected the sports bag before Sundar put it on the back\n                    seat or before driving off. Another occasion arose when, according to him,\n                    Sundar suddenly wanted to get out of his car, which caused him to be suspicious\n                    of Sundar’s conduct. Instead of looking inside the sports bag at this\n                    point, the appellant drove off to his destination by taking a circuitous (and\n                    potentially risky) route. At any time during his car journey thereafter, the\n                    appellant could have stopped the car to see what was in the sports bag (since on\n                    his own account there was no car chase by the CNB officers). His stated reason\n                    that he dared not stop because he thought he was being tailed by gangsters or\n                    thugs obviously was not credible to the Judge, or to us.",
        "Conclusion": "45     For the reasons given above, we dismissed the\n                    appellant’s appeal as we were satisfied with the Judge’s finding\n                    that the appellant had actual knowledge that the sports bag contained cannabis\n                    and cannabis mixture."
