        "Introduction": "35 The facts of the case giving rise to this appeal are straightforward. In July 2000, the respondents commenced an action in the Magistrate’s Court to claim for maintenance fees against the three appellants, who are the purchasers/owners of an apartment. The appellants bought the apartment from the respondents. In September 2000, the appellants filed a defence and counterclaim for damages on account of defects and for loss of use and/or rental. By May 2002, the amount of the counterclaim exceeded the jurisdictional limit of even the District Court. Thus, the appellants applied for the entire action, including their counterclaim, to be transferred for trial in the High Court. This application was refused by the High Court on the ground that it has no such power to effect the transfer. Thus, this appeal to us. The sole issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the High Court has the power to transfer a case instituted in the Magistrate’s Court for hearing in the High Court.  36 Having given the issue considerable thought, I have come to a conclusion different from that of the other members of the quorum. Thus, this separate opinion from me.",
        "Applicable provisions": "37 I shall first identify the applicable statutory provisions and the Rules of Court. Section 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (SCJA), read with ¶10 of the First Schedule, confers upon the High Court the – \"Power to transfer any proceedings to any other court or to or from any subordinate court, and in the case of transfer to or from a subordinate court to give any directions as to the further conduct thereof, except that this power shall be exercised in such manner as may be prescribed by Rules of Court.\" 38 Section 18(3) provides that this power, as well as the other powers set out in the First Schedule, \"shall be exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of Court relating to them.\" The expression \"written law\", is defined in the Interpretation Act to include statute law and subsidiary legislation. Thus, where in any written law or Rules of Court it is prescribed how this power of the High Court relating to the transfer of cases between the High Court and the Subordinate Courts etc is to be exercised, it must be complied with. 39 I now turn to ss 24 and 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (SCA), which contain provisions on the transfer of proceedings from the District Court to the High Court. Section 24(1) provides that – \"Where, in an action founded on contract or tort in a District Court, any counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim of any defendant involves a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court, any party to the action may apply to the High Court, within such time as may be prescribed by Rules of Court, for an order that the whole proceedings, or the proceedings on the counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim, be transferred to the High Court.\" 40 However, the power to transfer a case from the District Court to the High Court under s 38 is of a different nature from that laid down in s 24(1) because it does not rest on the fact that the counterclaim exceeds the District Court jurisdiction but on the ground that the proceeding involved \"some important question of law\" or it is a \"test case\" or for \"some other sufficient reason\".  41 Thus, where an action is commenced in the District Court and a counterclaim is filed exceeding the jurisdictional limit of the District Court, any party may apply to have the entire proceeding transferred to be heard in the High Court.  42 The civil jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s Court is set out in section 52 of SCA. There, Parliament renders specific provisions in SCA on the jurisdiction and powers of the District Courts to be applicable to the Magistrate’s Court. As the issue of this appeal centres mainly on the interpretation of this section, I shall set it out in full:- (1) Subject to Rules of Court, a Magistrate’s Court shall have the jurisdiction and powers conferred on a District Court by sections 20 (except 20[1][b]), 21, 29, 31(1), 32 and 43 in any proceedings where the amount claimed or the value of the subject-matter in dispute does not exceed the Magistrate’s Court limit. (2) In exercising its jurisdiction under subsection (1), a Magistrate’s Court shall be subject to the same limitations and provisions as are applicable to a District Court under this Act.\" Construction of s 52 43 It would be seen that the Magistrate’s Court’s jurisdiction and powers are confined to those of the District Court as set out in ss 20 [except 20(1)(b)], 21, 29, 31(1), 32 and 43, provided that the amount in question in the action does not exceed the Magistrate’s Court jurisdictional limit of $50,000.  44 What then is meant when s 52(2) says that a Magistrate’s Court in exercising its jurisdiction \"shall be subject to the same limitations and provisions as are applicable to a District Court\". It could not possibly refer only to those sections identified in s 52(1). It must mean something more. The respondents concede that. Does it also include s 24? The respondents contend that it could not mean that ss 22-24 also apply to a Magistrate’s Court.  45 Section 19 deals generally with the civil jurisdiction of the District Court. Section 20 deals with its jurisdiction in actions on contract or tort which do not exceed the District Court limit of $250,000. Section 21 deals with its jurisdiction in an action to recover money under any written law which, again, does not exceed the District Court limit. Section 22 permits the District Court to hear a claim exceeding the District Court’s limit provided the plaintiff abandons the excess. Section 23 permits the District Court to hear a case even where the claim exceeds the District Court limit provided that the parties sign a memorandum agreeing to the same. Section 24 enables a party to apply to the High Court to have a District Court action in contract or tort, where the counterclaim or set-off exceeds the District Court limit, transferred for hearing in the High Court. It seems clear that these three provisions supplement the jurisdictional provisions of ss 20 and 21. Sections 22 and 23 enable the parties to have the case heard in the District Court even where the claim exceeds the District Court limit. Section 24 assists the parties to get the case heard in the appropriate forum. Sections 25 to 29 deal with other specific jurisdictions of the District Court.  46 By providing in s 52(2) that a Magistrate’s Court, in exercising its jurisdiction conferred under s 52(1), is subject to \"thesame limitations andprovisionsas are applicable to a District Court\", Parliament must have intended that all those provisions in Part IV of SCA which concern the jurisdictions conferred upon the Magistrate’s Court are also applicable to it. I would emphasise in particular the word \"provisions\". Effect must be given to that word. Ordinarily, in an action in contract or tort, a plaintiff would commence his action in either the High Court, the District Court or the Magistrate’s Court, depending on the estimated quantum of his claim. But sometimes, subsequent events may occur which render the original estimation too conservative. Thus, the usefulness of ss 22 and 23. Otherwise, it would mean that a plaintiff would have to discontinue the action and start afresh. Section 24 is also such a facilitative provision. I am unable to see any cogent reasons why these very useful provisions should be denied to litigants in the Magistrate’s Court. In my view, s 52(2) renders ss 22-24 applicable to the Magistrate’s Court. Why should a litigant in the Magistrate’s Court be so discriminated against and handicapped? There is no logic in it.  47 It may be asked, if it was the intention of Parliament that ss 22-24 should apply to the Magistrate’s Court, why did it not so provide directly instead of doing it in such a seemingly roundabout manner. While I agree that the draftsman could have been more explicit, like identifying the specific provisions which are intended to be rendered applicable by s 52(2) instead of just using the terms \"limitations\" and \"provisions\", but this is really a matter of drafting style. Effect must be given to the two words \"limitations\" and \"provisions\" and, moreover, these two words must mean different things. It may be said that s 52(2) enables provisions, such as s 19(3) which provides for jurisdiction to be established when the defendant has been properly served or has submitted to the jurisdiction, ss 19(4) and (5) which contain express limitations on the exercise of jurisdiction and s 21(2) which explains that the jurisdiction conferred by s 21(1) does not apply to a fine to which any person is liable on conviction, to be applicable to the Magistrate’s Court. But s 52(2) nowhere says that the \"limitations and provisions\" are restricted to these.  48 It seems to me that the word \"provisions\" would cover all provisions in Part IV which relates to how the civil jurisdiction of the District Court set out in ss 20, 21 and 29 (which sections are extended to the Magistrate’s Court) should be exercised.  49 I should add that there is an interesting provision in s 24. Subsection (4) provides that where there is no application made to effect a transfer of the case to the High Court where the counterclaim exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the District Court, the latter shall have the jurisdiction to try the proceeding notwithstanding that the counterclaim may exceed the monetary limit of $250,000. The spirit of this provision is certainly in line with that in s 23, i.e., where no party makes an application to transfer the case to the High Court, they are deemed to have agreed to the District Court hearing the case. 50 Earlier, I touched on the question as to why Parliament did not in s 52(1) and (2) expressly refer to s 24. In a sense Parliament has. Section 52(1) confers upon the Magistrate’s Court the powers of the District Court set out in s 31(1). Section 31(1) provides, inter alia, that the District Court, and in turn, the Magistrate’s Court, is empowered to give the appropriate relief \"to every ground of defence or counterclaim equitable or legal (subject to section 24).\" These words in parenthesis could be considered to be an express reference or is, at least, an indication that Parliament intended s 24 to apply to the Magistrate’s Court. It is an established principle of statutory interpretation that express words in a statute should not be disregarded unless they are clearly redundant or the application of those words would plainly give rise to an absurdity.  51 I think I am fortified in my view that s 24 does apply to the Magistrate’s Court by virtue of the fact that the Rules Committee had prescribed rules enabling a case pending in the Magistrate’s Court to be brought up to the High Court. Order 89 rr 1 and 2 of the Rules of Court (\"the Rules\") provide:- \"1 – (1) Any application to the High Court under sections 24, 37 and 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Chapter 321) must be made by originating summons in Form 7. (2) The High Court hearing such an application may order the proceedings in the Subordinate Courts to be stayed until after the final determination of the application. 2 – (1) Where an order is made by the High Court for the transfer of any proceedings from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court, the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts must send to the Registrar of the Supreme Court the file of the proceedings, …\" 52 If a transfer is only possible from the District Court to the High Court, and not also from the Magistrate’s Court, the Rules Committee would have referred only to the \"District Court\", as is done in s 24, instead of using the generic expression \"Subordinate Courts\" which would encompass both the District Court and the Magistrate’s Court. In my humble opinion, the Rules Committee had correctly recognised that a case in the Magistrate’s Court, where appropriate, may also be transferred to be heard in the High Court. This is wholly in line with the provisions in ¶10 of the First Schedule of SCJA.  53 It is also of relevance to note the other rules in Order 89. Rule 3 sets out the procedure for the transfer of High Court cases to the \"Subordinate Courts\" and rule 4 provides for the transfer of cases between Subordinate Courts. When one considers O 89 as a whole what one sees is a flexible scheme of things where cases may be transferred from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court and vice-versa and cases may be transferred between one Subordinate Court and another, all of which is to ensure that cases are heard in the appropriate forum.  54 The rules in O 89 were made by the Rules Committee pursuant to explicit powers conferred upon it by SCJA and SCA. Under s 80(2)(d) of SCJA, the Committee is empowered to make rules – \"regulating and prescribing … the procedure in connection with thetransfer of any proceedingsfrom any Subordinate Court to the High Court or from the High Court to a Subordinate Court.\" 55 As regards transfer of cases within the Subordinate Courts, the Rules Committee is empowered by s 69(3)(b) of SCA to lay down rules \"prescribing the circumstances and procedure by which proceedings may be transferred from one court to another.\" Thus, there can be no question that the rules in Order 89 areintra viresthe powers conferred on the Committee.  56 The argument is made that with s 53 of SCA, a case in the Magistrate’s Court may only be transferred to be heard by the District Court where \"some important question of law or fact is likely to arise\". I do not think the existence of s 53 means that in no other circumstances may a case before the Magistrate’s Court be transferred to be heard in the District Court or the High Court. Section 53 is essentially a specific power given to the Magistrate’s Court, as a transfer under that section can be made even in a case which falls squarely within the Magistrate’s Court jurisdiction. It can be exercised whenever the case involves an important question of law or fact. To say that a case in the Magistrate’s Court can only be transferred to the District Court in the circumstances set out in s 53 would render r 4 of O 89 nugatory.  57 I should add that there is a similar kind of provision in s 38 of SCA, which reads:- \"38. Where it is made to appear to the High Court, on the application of a party to any civil proceeding pending in a District Court, that the proceeding by reason of its involving some important question of law, or being a test case, or for any other sufficient reason, is one which should be tried in the High Court, it may order the record to be transferred to the High Court.\" It will be seen that section 38 can apply even in a case where the amount in dispute does not exceed the District Court limit. It can hardly be argued that the existence of s 38 curtails or restricts the operation of s 24.  58 There are also two other provisions in SCA which may have a bearing on the issue under consideration. Section 37 provides that a party to a High Court writ action may \"for any sufficient reason\" apply for the proceedings to be transferred to a District Court. No mention is made about a transfer being made to a Magistrate’s Court. In s 29, jurisdiction is conferred upon a District Court to grant interpleader relief and which jurisdiction is also extended to the Magistrate’s Court by virtue of s 52(1). In subsection (2) of s 29, it is provided that the High Court may, in an interpleader proceeding in that Court, transfer that proceeding to the District Court if the subject matter does not exceed the District Court limit. An interesting question that arises is whether, by virtue of s 52(1) or otherwise, the High Court may in an appropriate case transfer the interpleader proceeding to a Magistrate’s Court. I have no doubt that the answer must be in the affirmative. There is no reason why if the subject matter of the interpleader proceeding should fall within the Magistrate’s Court limit, it should not be sent down to that court. Reverting to s 37, can the High Court transfer a case to a Magistrate’s Court, if the quantum of the claim falls within the jurisdiction of the latter? It seem to me to be wholly illogical to imagine that the answer has to be in the negative. All the more so when it is noted that O 89 r 3 assumes that such a transfer to the Magistrate’s Court is permissible.  59 In my opinion, s 52(2), and indeed those provisions in Part IV of SCA dealing with the civil jurisdiction of the District Court and Magistrate’s Court, should be given a purposive interpretation. Otherwise it would mean that Parliament has left a clear gap in the procedure for civil proceedings in the courts.  Alternative basis 60 Even if I am wrong, or there is a doubt, as to the interpretation of s 52(2) of SCA, there is an alternative basis to hold that the High Court possesses the power to transfer a case from the Magistrate’s Court to the High Court and vice versa. This is by virtue of s 18(2) and (3) (and ¶10 of the First Schedule) of SCJA, read with O 18 rr 1, 2 and 3 of the Rules.  61 Section 18(3) provides that the power of the High Court to transfer cases as set out in ¶10 of the First Schedule shall be \"exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of Court.\" There is nothing in SCA which expressly, or by necessary implication, provides or suggests that a case pending in the Magistrate’s Court cannot be transferred to the High Court or vice versa. Moreover, O 18 rr 1, 2 and 3, by referring to \"Subordinate Courts\" instead of \"District Courts\", clearly contemplate that a case pending in the Magistrate’s Court may be transferred to the High Court and vice versa. As mentioned in ¶¶ 54 and 55 above, there can be no question that the rules in O 89 areintra viresthe powers of the Rules Committee.  62 The point that I am making is that if the present application is granted, as I think it should be, it would not be an exercise of the power (under ¶10 of the First Schedule) in contravention of s 18(3). The exercise would have been in accordance with O 89 rr 1 and 2, and thus would have complied with s 18(3).  63 I am aware that there is, to some extent, an overlap as to what is provided in s 18(3) and ¶10 of the First Schedule. Section 18(3) provides that the powers in the First Schedule shall be exercised \"in accordance with any written law or Rules of Court.\" Paragraph 10 of the First Schedule (quoted in full in ¶37 above) also requires that the power be exercised in the manner prescribed by the Rules of Court. There seems to be an overlap. But they are consistent. I do not think this overlap alters the position I have sought to advance.  Conclusion 64 It is apparent from the scheme of things set out in s 18 of SCJA, ss 24, 37, 38 and 53 of SCA and O 89 of the Rules, that flexibility is really the order of the day. I do not think the statutory scheme is intended to penalize a litigant for instituting an action or counterclaiming in the wrong forum (or more likely to be the case, rendered to be so by subsequent events). It seems to me that the scheme of things is really to enable the litigants to have the action or counterclaim heard in the appropriate forum so that justice will be done as between them. And I cannot think of any good reason why rigidity should prevail in essentially a procedural matter such as this.  65 An incongruous consequence of holding that the High Court has no such power to transfer is that, in a case which is commenced in the Magistrate’s Court, and where the counterclaim by the defendant is instituted as a separate suit in the High Court because of the amount of the claim, and where the claim and counterclaim are connected, there is no way in which either party could apply to have the claim in the Magistrate’s Court transferred to be heard together with the counterclaim action in the High Court, running the risk of two trials with possibly differing results, not to mention the waste in terms of time and costs. The respondents’ counsel in his submission stated that the parties can \"thereafter apply for a consolidation of the two sets of proceedings.\" The question is, how do you consolidate a High Court case with a Magistrate’s Court case without bringing the Magistrate’s Court case up to the High Court?  66 I would finally add that if this appeal is not allowed what it means is that more time and costs would have to be incurred to enable the case to come up to the High Court. Two steps would have to be taken instead of one. First, a party would have to apply under O 89 r 4 to have the case transferred from the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court. Then he would have to apply again to have the case transferred from the District Court to the High Court. The same double steps would have to be taken if a High Court case should have to be transferred to a Magistrate’s Court pursuant to s 37 of SCA. Should a litigant be required to go through such a tortuous route to obtain justice instead of being allowed to come, in an appropriate case, straight up to the High Court, or straight down to the Magistrate’s Court, as is provided for in O 89? 67 For myself, I would have allowed the appeal and granted the application to have the entire case transferred from the Magistrate’s Court to the High Court."
