        "The increase by $14,700": "9.    The putting back of $2,736.31, being the excessive deduction for income tax,\n\nwas not challenged by the defendants before us. The challenge was only in respect of the judge\n\nputting back the sum of $14,700 which the Assistant Registrar deducted from what was assessed to be\n\nMs Tans loss of pre-trial earnings on account of Ms Tans failure to mitigate her loss from\n\nJanuary 1999 to the date of assessment. The Assistant Registrar was of the view that once the\n\nplaintiff learned that SIA would not put her back on flying duties then she should have, after the\n\nAsian economic crisis had subsided in late 1998 and early 1999, looked for an alternative non-cabin\n\ncrew job.10.    However, Woo JC disagreed with that decision and held that the plaintiff\n\nhad not acted unreasonably in failing to seek alternative employment in a different industry when\n\nshe was still employed by SIA and earning a decent salary. Furthermore, there was insufficient\n\nevidence to show that the plaintiff would have been likely to obtain alternative employment at a\n\nhigher salary. The determination of the figure of $700 p.a. was arrived at without any basis. He\n\ntherefore restored the sum of $14,700 back to the plaintiff.",
        "The appeal": "11.    On this appeal before us, the question that arose for consideration in\n\nregard to the sum of $14,700 was in relation to the principles applicable to the hearing of an\n\nappeal from an assessment made by the Assistant Registrar to the High Court. This was raised by the\n\nfirst defendant, SIA. Was the hearing before the High Court a hearingde novo? Was the High\n\nCourt entitled to vary the quantum awarded as it pleased or was it governed by the same principles\n\napplicable to an appeal against an award made by the High Court to the Court of Appeal, namely, that\n\nthe appellate court could only vary the quantum of damages awarded if it were shown that (i) the\n\ncourt below acted on wrong principles or, (ii) misapprehended the facts or, (iii) had for these or\n\nother reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages: seeDavies v Powell Duffryn\n\nAssociated Colleries Ltd[1942] AC 601 per Lord Wright.12.    The position taken by the first defendant was that the principles\n\napplicable to an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal are similarly applicable to an\n\nappeal from the Registrar to the High Court. The appellate court, having not seen and heard the\n\nwitnesses, should be slow to interfere and must be satisfied that the court below was clearly wrong\n\nbefore it should substitute its own decision for that of the court below.13.    There is no doubt that the principles inDavies v Powell Duffrynhave been accepted and applied by this court in relation to appeals on damages from the High Court\n\nto the Court of Appeal, e.g.,Chow Khai Hong v Tham Sek Khow & Anor, Lim Hwee Ming v Citadel\n\nInvestment Pte Ltd[1998] 3 SLR 601andPeh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong[1996] 2 SLR 305at\n\n310.14.    What the defendants, however, sought to argue was that thePowell\n\nDuffrynprinciples should also be applicable to an appeal on assessment from the Registrar to\n\nthe High Court. But in this connection there were two authorities of this Court which they had to\n\novercome. The first wasChang Ah Lek v Lim Ah Koon[1999] 1 SLR 82, and the secondHo Yeow\n\nKim v Lai Hai Kuen[1999] 2 SLR 246.15.    Mr Lawrence Teh Kee Wee, counsel for the defendants, went into a detailed\n\nanalysis ofChang Ah Lek. He had to do it as this case stared right at him. This was a case\n\nwhere the plaintiff was injured in a motor accident. Liability was determined by the trial judge\n\nwith assessment of damages being carried out by the Assistant Registrar who awarded the plaintiff,\n\ninter alia, $30,000 for general damages. On appeal, the High Court judge increased the amount to\n\n$35,000. On the defendants further appeal to the Court of Appeal, one of the issues raised was\n\nthat in enhancing the award for general damages by $5,000, the judge had overlooked the principles\n\ninPowell Duffryn.16.    It is true, as contended by Mr Teh that this court inChang Ah Lekdid, in fact, find that the Assistant Registrar had misapprehended the facts and the law and had\n\ncome to a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages suffered, applying thePowell Duffrynprinciples. But the parties there did argue that the High Court, on hearing such an appeal, was to\n\napply the same principles and, it was in response to these argument, that the court there proceeded\n\nto examine the question and offered its opinion.17.    The court first referred to s 62(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act\n\nwhich provided that the Registrar shall have the same powers and jurisdiction as the masters in\n\nEngland. Next, it referred to O 58 r 1 of the English Rules of the Supreme Court (like our O 56 r 6\n\nof the Rules of Court) which provided that an appeal from the master laid to a judge in chambers. It\n\nnext cited para 58/1/2 of theSupreme Court Practice 1997which stated that an appeal from\n\nthe master to the judge in chambers was dealt with by way of an actual rehearing of the application\n\nand the judge treated the matter as though it came before him for the first time; while the judge\n\nwould give the weight the previous decision of the master deserved, he was in no way fettered by the\n\nprevious exercise of discretion by the master. On appeal from the judge in chambers, the court of\n\nappeal would treat the substantial discretion as that of the judge, not of the master.18.    The court then examined the decision of the House of Lords inEvans v\n\nBartlam[1937] AC 473 where the House had to consider the question whether a masters exercise\n\nof discretion in refusing to set aside a judgment in default of appearance and giving leave to\n\ndefend could be supplanted by the discretion of the judge in chambers to whom an appeal from the\n\nmaster lay. The judge-in-chambers set aside the judgment and gave the defendant leave to defend on\n\nterms. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, held that the judge could not substitute his discretion\n\nin place of the master. The House reversed the Court of Appeal when it held that the judge was\n\nentitled to do so. The following passage of Lord Wright, which was also quoted by this court with\n\napproval, was pertinent:-\" The master had, in the exercise of his discretion under O. XXVII r\n\n  15, or O XIII r 10, refused to set aside the judgment. But it is clear that where the Court of\n\n  Appeal is required to review a discretionary order of a judge reversing the master the substantial\n\n  discretion is that of the judge, and it is the judges order which must particularly be\n\n  considered by the appellate court:Cooper v Cooper. The masters admirably exercise their\n\n  discretion in routine matters of pleading, discovery, interrogatories, venue, mode of trial, and\n\n  other interlocutory directions, without any appeal being necessary. But such matters may on\n\n  occasion raise questions most vital to the final issue of the case. The decision of such questions\n\n  is properly for the judge who will no doubt consider carefully the order of the master. If a\n\n  further appeal is taken to the Court of Appeal it is the judges discretion which that court has\n\n  either to support or vary or reverse.\"The court then concluded:-\"The same in our view applies to the assessment of damages. As Lord Wright\n\n  said in his speech inDavies v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltdwhich we have\n\n  quoted in 8 above, the assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion than an\n\n  ordinary act of decision. It is for this reason that an appellate court is particularly slow to\n\n  reverse the trial judge on a question of the assessment of damages.But registrars are not trial judges as we have seen from the observations of\n\n  Lord Atkin and Lord Wright inEvans v Bartlamnor do we think is an appeal from the\n\n  registrar to a judge in chambers an appeal in the true sense as an appeal from the judge in\n\n  chambers or a judge sitting in open court to the Court of Appeal is. As Lord Atkin said inEvans\n\n  v Bartlamthe judge in chambers deals with an appeal from the registrar as though the\n\n  matter came before him for the first time.\"19.    We should point out that inDavies v Powell Duffryn, Lord Wrights\n\npronouncement was that \"an appellate court is always reluctant to interfere with a findingof\n\nthe trial judgeon any question of fact, but it is particularly reluctant to interfere with a\n\nfinding on damages.\"20.    Essentially, two points were made by Mr Teh onChang Ah Lek. The\n\nfirst was that the views of the court inChang Ah Lekwereobiter. We did not agree\n\nwith that. It was clear that what the court did was also to hold the High Court judge was entitled\n\nto enhance the award from $30,000 to $35,000, for the reason that thePowell Duffrynprinciples\n\ndid not apply to an appeal to the High Court against the assessment of an Assistant Registrar. In\n\nany case, even if the views of the court on the point wereobiterand notratio decidendi,they must be given the highest consideration.21.    The second point was that the court inChang Ah Lekfailed to\n\nappreciate that our O 56 r 6 was not entirely in pari materia with the English O 58 r 1 because r 1\n\nexpressly stated it was subject to r 2 and r 2 provided that as far as assessment of damages was\n\nconcerned, an appeal lay direct from the master to the Court of Appeal, by-passing the High Court.\n\nSo in England an appeal against an assessment of damages made by the master was to be heard by the\n\nCourt of Appeal and not by a High Court judge. The Court of Appeal in England, when hearing such an\n\nappeal on assessment, would apply thePowell Duffrynprinciples. Therefore, on an appeal\n\nagainst the Registrar/Assistant Registrars decision on assessment, the judge-in-chambers should\n\nalso have applied the same principles.22.    Ordinarily, in England, on a matter of discretion when an appeal lay to the\n\nHigh Court, the latter was entitled to examine and decide the case without being affected by the\n\ndecision of the master, but of course, the judge would no doubt give due weight to the decision of\n\nthe master. Order 58 r 2 of the English Rules of Court provided for an exception in respect of an\n\nappeal from a masters decision on assessment of damages which would go direct to the Court of\n\nAppeal. Our Rules did not provide for such an exception and therefore all appeals from the Registrar\n\nwould first go to the judge-in-chambers and there was no reason why the ordinary manner in which the\n\njudge would carry out his function in this regard should be any different just because the appeal\n\nwas on a question of quantum of damages. Therefore, in considering the English practice, we must\n\nbear in mind their special rule, which was not present in our Rules of Court.23.    The principles which were enunciated inChang Ah Lekwere reviewed\n\nand affirmed by this court in the subsequent case ofHo Yeow Kim v Lai Hai Kuen & Anor[1999] 2 SLR 246.24.    In the result, we held that Woo JC was entitled to enhance the quantum of\n\nloss of pre-trial earnings by $14,700.",
        "Application ofPowell Duffrynprinciples": "25.    Furthermore, we would add that, even if we were to apply thePowell\n\nDuffrynprinciples to this case, the circumstances here warranted the interference, as we were\n\nsatisfied that the Assistant Registrar had erred on a matter of law and had also failed to\n\nappreciate the facts. It is necessary that we now set out how the Assistant Registrar viewed the\n\nquestion and why she thought the deduction for failure to mitigate was justified:-I was of the view that the Plaintiff did not act unreasonably in not seeking\n\n  alternative employment immediately after the 1stDefendants informed her in February\n\n  1997 that she was unfit to work on board flights, given the uncertain economic climate then and\n\n  the financial crisis which was soon to hit the Southeast Asian region. Even after economic\n\n  conditions improved in late 1998/early 1999, the Plaintiff could not be faulted for failing to\n\n  seek employment with other airlines as the residual weakness in her left hand made it highly\n\n  unlikely that she would be able to secure any other cabin crew position. The Plaintiff should,\n\n  however, have tried to look for an alternativenon-cabin crewjob [emphasis added] from\n\n  that time onwards. Given the Plaintiffs good service record with the 1stDefendants,\n\n  attractive personality, and commendable grades in the Malaysian equivalent of the GCE O and\n\n  A levels, I was of the view that she could have obtained non-cabin crew employment, for\n\n  instance as a secretary, which would have ameliorated the loss in allowances which she suffered\n\n  after she was taken off cabin crew duties. To reflect this failure to mitigate her loss, a\n\n  deduction of $700.00 per month for the period from January 1999 onwards  i.e., a total of\n\n  $14,700.00 ($700.00 x 21 months)  ought to be made from the lost earnings to be awarded to the\n\n  Plaintiff.26.    What we could not understand was, why should Ms Tan be required to look for\n\nan alternative non-cabin crew job when she was already in a non-cabin job with SIA as a grounded\n\nleading stewardess. If an employer of the size of SIA, and who no doubt had a wide range of jobs\n\navailable, and who also were in possession of her qualifications and work experience, could not\n\noffer her any other job, we did not think it reasonable to infer that another company or individual\n\nwould have offered her a job which was better than what she was given by SIA and would even pay her\n\nas much as $700 more per month. There was simply no evidence of that. The suggestion made was that\n\nshe could be a secretary. Then why did SIA not engage her as a secretary and instead only offered\n\nher a position as a grounded hostess? After all, SIA knew her better. Her previous job was with\n\nPublic Bank Malaysia, as a clerk. There was no evidence that a clerk would be paid more than what\n\nSIA was paying her as a grounded leading hostess.27.    It was thus understandable that Ms Tan did not make any effort to look for\n\nalternative employment. It was not as if she was out of employment. If she were, then she would have\n\nfailed in her duty to obtain a suitable job to mitigate her loss. Here, her own employer, who was\n\nliable for her injury, had offered her alternative employment. It must be assumed that that was the\n\nbest SIA could offer her.28.    Counsel for SIA, while conceding it was difficult to assess the quantum of\n\ndamages which could have been reduced if Ms Tan had not failed to mitigate, argued that in a\n\nsituation such as this, the court should apply the principle inChaplin v Hicks[1911] 2 KB\n\n786. This was what AR Tan did in arriving at the figure of $700 p.m. But, in our opinion, the\n\nsituations were hardly similar.Chaplin v Hickswas a case concerning breach of contract\n\nwhere a candidate in a beauty competition, who had successfully passed the earlier stages of the\n\ncompetition, was, in breach of contract, not allowed by the organisers to compete in the later\n\nstages. Notwithstanding that it was difficult to assess damages, substantial damages were awarded to\n\nthe candidate for the loss of the chance of being successful.29.    But the position here was quite different. It is settled law that the onus\n\nof proof on the issue of failure to mitigate is on the defendant: see the decision of this Court inTeo\n\nSing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat[1994] 1 SLR 634andMcGregor on Damages (1997 Edn)at p.190.\n\nEvidence should have been led by the defendants on alternative employment the plaintiff could apply\n\nfor and which could have paid her more. There was simply no evidence on these. This was not a\n\nquestion of assessment. It was a question of discharging the burden of substantiating the allegation\n\nof failure to mitigate and the defendants had failed to discharge that burden.",
        "Costs": "30.    We now turn to the question of costs. In the light of the decision of Woo\n\nJC, and as the amount of the offer made by the defendants was less than the total amount awarded on\n\nappeal by the High Court, there could be no question of O 22A r 9(3) coming into play as that rule\n\napplied only when the judgment obtained by the plaintiff was not more favourable than the terms of\n\nthe offer. Here, the judgment obtained by Ms Tan was more favourable, though only slightly.\n\nTherefore, we would agree with the judge below that once it was shown that the offer was less than\n\nthe judgment sum no matter how slightly, O 22A r 9(3) did not apply. Otherwise, there would be great\n\ndifficulties in drawing any line: what was slight and what was not so slight?31.    Mr Teh had sought to rely uponRoache v News Group Newspapers Ltd[1992] TLR of 29 November 1992, where the plaintiff, in a libel action, was awarded the same sum as\n\ndamages as that which was paid into court by the defendants. The plaintiff also obtained an\n\ninjunction against re-publication. The English Court of Appeal held that, in the circumstances, it\n\nwas the defendants who were, in substance, the successful party. Sir Thomas Bingam MR put the\n\nposition as follows:-\"The defendants did not wish to fight this action. If they had wished to\n\n  do so they would not have paid 50,000 into court. Plainly they wished to settle if they could do\n\n  so at an acceptable cost. Given that wish, it is in my view incredible that they would have\n\n  allowed a settlement to founder for want of an undertaking by them not to republish. No reason has\n\n  been suggested why they should have acted in such an uncommercial way, I do not accept the judges\n\n  view that \"the plaintiff had to pursue the matter to judgment in order to obtain an\n\n  injunction\". The overwhelming probability is, in my view, that if he had chosen to accept the\n\n  money in court he could have had an undertaking, equivalent in effect to an injunction, for the\n\n  asking. That he chose to go ahead can only, in my view, have been because he wanted to win a large\n\n  sum from the jury than the defendants had offered. There can in my view be no doubt that the\n\n  defendants emerged from this trial as the substantial winners: they had held the award to a sum no\n\n  greater than was already on offer. The injunction was a matter of no significance to them because\n\n  they did not intend to republish anyway.\"32.    We do not disagree with that reasoning. But it would be seen that the\n\nsituation inRoacheis quite different from that in the present case. There, the plaintiff\n\ngot the same sum as that paid into court by the defendants. The fact that the plaintiff was also\n\ngranted an injunction was not treated as a matter of any great moment, as it was not really a point\n\nof contention.33.    We would, of course, hasten to add that this is not the end of the matter.\n\nThere is still O 22A r 12 to consider.34.    It would be noted that Woo JC granted Ms Tan only $1,000/- as costs, for\n\nwork done after the offer, including the assessment before the Assistant Registrar. It seemed to us\n\nclear that the judge had only granted her nominal costs. In Ms Tans appeal she had contended that\n\nas the judgment she obtained was more favourable than the offer, which rendered inapplicable O 22A r\n\n9(3), she should be entitled to the full costs of the assessment on the standard basis, instead of\n\nonly a sum of $1,000.35.    At this juncture we would set out O 22A r 12:-Without prejudice to Rules 9 and 10, the Court, in exercising its discretion\n\n  with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle, the date the offer was made, the\n\n  terms of the offer and the extent to which the plaintiffs judgment is more favourable than the\n\n  terms of the offer to settle.36.    It will be seen that r 12 tampers the rigours of r 9 and gives the court a\n\nwide discretion to do justice as between the parties even in a case where the offer is less than the\n\nsum awarded in the judgment. Here, the judge, in deciding to grant Ms Tan only $1,000 costs, took\n\ninto account all the circumstances, including the fact that the difference between the offer and the\n\njudgment was marginal, that she had some six months to consider the offer, and that her claim of\n\n$1.1 million was manifestly excessive, about $750,000 more than what she was awarded by the court.37.    In our opinion, the judge was entitled to take all the circumstances into\n\nconsideration in awarding the plaintiff only nominal costs in respect of costs incurred after the\n\noffer was made. It must be emphasised that the whole object of O 22A is to spur the parties to bring\n\nlitigation to an expeditious end without judgment, and thus to save costs and judicial time. In the\n\nwords of Morden ACJO in the Ontario Court of Appeal Case,Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molner\n\nSystems Group (1991) 85 DLR (4th)392 at 398:-\"The purpose of r 49 (inpari materiawith our O 22A) is to\n\n  encourage the termination of litigation by agreement of the parties  more speedily and less\n\n  expensively than by judgment of the court at the end of the trial.\"38.    The scheme of things under O 22A is verily to encourage the plaintiffs to\n\nbe realistic in their assessment of what they are entitled to and on the part of the defendants, to\n\nmake reasonable offers, on pain of having to bear the costs on the indemnity basis if they should\n\npersist in their exaggerated claims or maintain their unreasonable position (in respect of an offer\n\nfrom the plaintiff). The Order seeks to promote responsible conduct on the part of both parties. It\n\ndiscourages obstinacy. The wide discretion given to the court in r 12 is to enable the court to take\n\nall pertinent facts and circumstances into account and arrive at an order on costs which is fair and\n\njust. In the present case, the excessively high claim of Ms Tan had no doubt caused the assessment\n\nproceedings to run into some 4 days. The judge below had taken all the pertinent factors into\n\nconsideration. It was not shown that he had erred on any matter of principle. Thus, we could see no\n\nreason to interfere in the exercise of his discretion.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINCHIEF JUSTICEJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGE OF APPEALSINGAPOREDATE: 16 OCTOBER 2001Copyright © Government of Singapore."
