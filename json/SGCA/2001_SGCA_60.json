        "The facts": "2 On 27 November 2000 at about 9.15pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau\n\n(\"CNB\") raided the appellant's flat at Block 331, Woodlands Avenue 1, #04-421.\n\nUpon gaining entry, the appellant was spotted dashing into the toilet, from where he was\n\nforcibly removed by the CNB officers and arrested. A quantity of yellowish granular\n\nsubstance (the \"substance\") was recovered from the drainage hole of the said\n\ntoilet. Apart from the substance, other items seized from the appellant and from various\n\nplaces in the appellant's flat included:-(a) Various substances, tablets and powders, including 60 tablets of Erimin 5, one\n\n  sachet of heroin and one straw of heroin;(b) One pager;(c) Three handphones;(d) One electronic weighing scale;(e) One sealer;(f) Numerous empty plastic sachets and bags, including \"Ziplock\" bags;(g) One drug supervisee card; and(h) Six uncensored video compact discs (\"VCDs\").The appellant's control of the flat at all material times was not in issue.3 Analysis by Dr Saw Chwee Guan of the Department of Scientific Services showed that\n\nthe 687.3 grams of dried substance contained not less than 58.83 grams of diamorphine.",
        "The prosecution's case": "4 The prosecution placed reliance on the appellant's long statement, made pursuant to s\n\n121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) (the \"CPC\"), in which the appellant\n\nadmitted to drug trafficking by assisting one \"Ah Chong\" in delivering heroin to\n\nAh Chong's purchasers. The appellant also trafficked in heroin by purchasing heroin from\n\nAh Chong for purpose of resale to his fellow addicts. The electronic scale was used to\n\npack heroin for resale. The appellant's clients would use the pager to contact him, while\n\nAh Chong would contact the appellant using one of the handphones. On the day of his\n\narrest, the appellant had collected three bags of heroin from Ah Chong's hireling, one bag\n\nof which he delivered. The appellant was holding on to the other two bags, pending further\n\ninstructions from Ah Chong, when the CNB raided his flat. These two bags of heroin\n\ntogether constituted the substance recovered from the drainage hole.5 The prosecution also pointed out that the appellant's cautioned statement, made\n\npursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC, disclosed no defence to the charge of trafficking.\n\nInstead, the appellant had simply pleaded for leniency as he had an aged mother who had no\n\none to look after her.6 Finally, the prosecution placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Choo Shiao Hoe\n\n(\"Dr Choo\"), who had treated the appellant for drug withdrawal at Changi Prison\n\nHospital. Dr Choo had testified that based on the withdrawal symptoms exhibited by the\n\nappellant upon admission to Changi Prison Hospital, the appellant was a moderate drug\n\naddict. A moderate drug addict would consume between 0.1 gram to 0.27 gram of diamorphine\n\na day, while a severe addict would consume between 0.28 gram to 0.67 gram of diamorphine a\n\nday. However, it would not be necessary for an addict to consume such an amount on a daily\n\nbasis because the 'high' from one session of drug-taking would last the addict a day or\n\ntwo.",
        "The defence": "7 The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He attempted to rebut the\n\nincriminating portions of his long statement by alleging that he had either been \"not\n\nsober\" during the recording sessions, or that he had not appreciated the\n\nramifications of what he had said until it was read out at the trial. The appellant also\n\nclaimed that he had not mentioned the consumption defence in his s 122(6) statement as he\n\nwas feeling cold and in a hurry to get the recording of it over with.8 Instead, the appellant based his defence on two claims. The first claim was that all\n\nthe substance seized was intended for his own consumption as he was a severe heroin addict\n\nwho consumed approximately 20 grams of impure substance a day. Moreover, he liked to buy\n\nhis heroin in big bags, sufficient for one to two months' use, as he had absconded from\n\ndrug supervision and feared arrest. Second, the appellant claimed that despite his having\n\ntold the CNB that he made approximately $800 to $1200 a month as a security guard, he had\n\nnot disclosed the additional income that he derived from the sale of VCDs. As such,\n\nalthough he had not worked between 30 June 2000 and his arrest on 27 November 2000, he had\n\namassed $30,000 in savings with which he supported his drug habit, and did not need to\n\nresort to drug trafficking.",
        "The decision below": "9 The judicial commissioner rejected the appellant's defence for the following\n\nreasons:-(a) The appellant was admittedly a heroin addict, but had failed to show that the\n\n  heroin was for his own consumption. The judicial commissioner was dissatisfied by his\n\n  explanations for the presence of the drug trafficking paraphernalia, finding that they\n\n  were indicative of a large-scale trafficking activity. He also disbelieved the appellant's\n\n  claim to be such a severe addict that he required all the heroin for himself.(b) The defence of consumption was not an elaborate legal defence and he would have\n\n  expected it to be raised in the s 122(6) statement but it was not.(c) In the light of the length and detail of the long statement, the judicial\n\n  commissioner could not accept that the appellant did not intend to make it, or was unaware\n\n  that he was incriminating himself.(d) The appellant's financial means were not an issue as he could have derived his\n\n  money from drug trafficking.10 The judicial commissioner hence convicted the appellant on the charge. As the amount\n\nof diamorphine seized was in excess of 15 grams, the appellant was sentenced to death\n\npursuant to s 33 and the Second Schedule of the MDA.",
        "The appeal": "11 The appeal to this court rested on two contentions:-(a) that the judicial commissioner should not have rejected the consumption defence as\n\n  raised by the appellant; and(b) that the judicial commissioner should not have rejected the appellant's explanation\n\n  for the presence of the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in the appellant's flat.",
        "The defence of consumption": "12 The appellant claimed in his written submissions that, contrary to the findings of\n\nfact made by the judicial commissioner, there was \"ample evidence\" to support\n\nthe defence of consumption. We took the view that this contention could not be supported.\n\nThe defence of consumption, as raised by the appellant, rested on a single unsubstantiated\n\nclaim: that he was a severe heroin addict who consumed approximately 20 grams of impure\n\nsubstance a day, such that 687.3 grams accounted for a 34-day supply. However, the\n\nappellant was unable to provide any evidence to show that he was indeed a severe heroin\n\naddict. The medical reports cited by the appellant in his written submissions could not\n\nhelp him, as they stated that the appellant was at worst only a mild addict, while the\n\nprosecution was willing to accept that he was a moderate addict.13 On the other hand, the prosecution was able to adduce expert evidence, in the form\n\nof Dr Choo's testimony, as to the degree of the appellant's addiction, which was\n\nunchallenged by the appellant at the appeal. Based on Dr Choo's assessment, this would\n\nleave the appellant with approximately 217 days' worth of heroin, a supply that could\n\nconceivably have lasted the appellant for over a year. Even allowing for the appellant's\n\nunsubstantiated claim that he bought his heroin in amounts sufficient for one to two\n\nmonths' use, this could not explain the extremely large amount of heroin seized from the\n\nappellant.14 The figures provided by Dr Choo on the rate of consumption of a severe heroin addict\n\nalso meant that even if we accepted that the appellant was a severe addict, we could\n\nnevertheless not accept his claim of consuming 20 grams of impure substance a day. As was\n\npointed out by the prosecution in the trial below, the purity of the seized heroin meant\n\nthat 20 grams of substance would yield approximately 1.71 grams of diamorphine, a figure\n\nwhich is over two-and-a-half times the upper limit of a severe addict's rate of\n\nconsumption.15 It is clear from cases such as Lim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713and PP v Hla Win[1995] 2 SLR 424that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact made by a trial\n\njudge unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence. In light of the\n\nforegoing, we took the view that the judicial commissioner had been entirely correct to\n\nreject the consumption defence.",
        "The drug-trafficking paraphernalia": "16 Drug-trafficking paraphernalia is relevant in establishing whether a person is a\n\ndrug trafficker or not - Low Kok Wai v PP[1994] 1 SLR 676. Moreover, it was stated in\n\nJusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP[1996] 3 SLR 29that \"the more directly the item is\n\nconnected to drug trafficking, the more weighty evidence of possession by the accused of\n\nthat item is in suggesting that the drugs found in his possession were for the purpose of\n\ntrafficking.\"17 The items seized from the appellant's flat indubitably constituted drug-trafficking\n\nparaphernalia. The appellant never disputed that the items belonged to him, but instead\n\ntried to offer alternative explanations for their presence in his home. For example, the\n\nappellant had claimed at the trial below that he had bought the electronic scale from an\n\nunidentified old man in Sungei Road because he felt sorry for him. As in the case of the\n\nconsumption defence, we saw no reason to overturn the judicial commissioner's decision in\n\nrelation to the drug-trafficking paraphernalia. We were of the view that the appellant's\n\nexplanations were extremely far-fetched. If he was to be believed, it would have been\n\nremarkably coincidental that he should have randomly assembled a collection of items which\n\njust so happened, when taken together, to constitute paraphernalia commonly used by drug\n\ntraffickers. We also noted that these claims were all in strict contradiction to the\n\nappellant's long statement, where he stated that the paraphernalia in question were used\n\nfor drug trafficking, and which the judicial commissioner had accepted as true.",
        "Other issues": "18 We noted in passing that the judicial commissioner's refusal to accept the\n\nappellant's explanations for the incriminating nature of his long statement was not\n\nchallenged before us. Mohamed Bachu Miah v PP[1993] 1 SLR 249establishes that an accused\n\nperson may be convicted on his own confession even when it is retracted, if the court is\n\nsatisfied of its truth. The contents of the long statement were sufficient to warrant the\n\ndismissal of the appeal.",
        "Conclusion": "19 For the reasons stated above, we found that a case of trafficking in 58.83 grams of\n\ndiamorphine had been properly made out against the appellant, and dismissed the appeal.YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINCHIEF JUSTICEJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGE OF APPEALCopyright © Government of Singapore."
