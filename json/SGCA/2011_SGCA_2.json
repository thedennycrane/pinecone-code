        "Introduction": "1       This is an appeal against the decision of the\n                    trial judge (“the Judge”), who dismissed the claim of Animal\n                    Concerns Research & Education Society (“the Appellant”) in the\n                    tort of negligence against Tan Boon Kwee (“the Respondent”), in\n                    the latter’s capacity as clerk of works (seeAnimal\n                        Concerns Research & Education Society v ANA Contractor Pte Ltd\n                        and another[2010] SGHC 85 (“the\n                    Judgment”)). 2       Despite the fact that the position of a clerk of\n                    works (now known as a “resident technical officer” (see\n                    regulation 2(e) of the Building Control (Amendment No 2) Regulations\n                    2007 (S 495/2007) (“the 2007 Regulations”)) and one of two\n                    species of “site supervisor” (the other being a “resident\n                    engineer”) (see regulation 24(2) of the Building Control Regulations\n                    2003) (S 666/2003) (“the 2003 Regulations”)) is mandated by\n                    ss 7 and 10 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29,\n                    1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), this appears to be the first\n                    time this role has arisen for consideration in the Singapore\n                courts. 3       Notwithstanding the change in terminology under\n                    the 2007 Regulations, the term “clerk of works” (rather than\n                    the term “residential technical officer”) will continue to be used\n                    throughout this judgment. The use of the term “clerk of works” is\n                    also more appropriate in the context of the actual facts of the present\n                    proceedings.",
        "Background facts and the decision below": "",
        "Background facts": "4       The Appellant is an Institution of Public\n                    Character under the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed), while\n                    the Respondent was and continues to remain a director of A.n.A Contractor Pte\n                    Ltd (“A.n.A”), the first defendant in the trial\n                below. 5       The Appellant had planned to establish a shelter\n                    (“the shelter”) for animals on a plot of land along Jalan Lekar\n                    (“the site”) leased from the Singapore Land Authority\n                    (“SLA”), and appointed A.n.A as the contractor for the project.\n                    A.n.A in turn appointed the Respondent as the clerk of works/site supervisor for\n                    the project (who was to be employed by A.n.A, rather than by the Appellant).\n                    A.n.A also appointed two qualified persons (“QPs”), a qualified\n                    architect (“QA”) and a qualified engineer (“QE”), as\n                    the QPs for the architectural works and supervision of structural works,\n                    respectively, under s 11(1)(d)(ii) of the\n                    Act. 6       The project, however, was beset by a number of\n                    problems, which led to the Appellant suing A.n.A for breach of contract (and\n                    negligence) in the proceedings below. 7       Firstly, there was considerable delay in the\n                    execution of the project. Secondly, the Appellant alleged that A.n.A had failed\n                    to construct the shelter in accordance with the specified building plans.\n                    Finally, it transpired that, in the course of levelling the site, wood chips had\n                    been used as landfill, resulting in a foul smell and a discharge of blackish\n                    effluence from the site. This came to the attention of the SLA and the National\n                    Environment Agency (“NEA”), which considered that it amounted to\n                    pollution of the surrounding environment and contamination of Kranji Reservoir.\n                    As a result, the Appellant is obliged to excavate the rear portion of the site\n                    and reconstruct the animal enclosures located there before work at the shelter\n                    can begin in earnest. 8       In addition to its claims against A.n.A, the\n                    Appellant also sued the Respondent in his capacity as clerk of works of the\n                    project, alleging that he had negligently failed to supervise the levelling of\n                    the site and, in particular, failed to ensure that wood chips were suitable\n                    landfill material.",
        "The decision below": "9       The Judge found that, as the land at the site\n                    was not level, A.n.A was under a contractual duty to level it (see the Judgment\n                    at[16]). A.n.A did so by raising the\n                    lower-lying areas of the site in a process known as “backfilling”,ie, bringing in earth from elsewhere to raise\n                    the lower regions (see the Judgment at[17]). A.n.A contracted with an entity known as Lok Sheng\n                    Enterprises (“Lok Sheng”) to bring in wet soil and wood chips as\n                    backfill material for this purpose. 10     The Judge found, based on expert evidence\n                    adduced by the Appellant, that the wood chips A.n.A had caused to be used as\n                    backfill material were the cause of the pollution and contamination (see the\n                    Judgment at [28]). 11     The Judge held that the Appellant had proved\n                    its claims against A.n.A for breach of contract in respect of the delay, the\n                    failure to comply with the building plans, and the use of wood chips (see the\n                    Judgment at [34]–[35]). He considered that it was therefore unnecessary\n                    for the Appellant to have proceeded against A.n.A in negligence. There is no\n                    appeal against this portion of the Judge’s decision. 12     However, the Judge dismissed the\n                    Appellant’s action in negligence against the Respondent, on the basis that\n                    s 10(5) of the Act did not impose a duty on the Respondent to supervise the\n                    backfilling (see the Judgment at [39]). Section 10(5) of the Act provides\n                    as follows: (5)    Every site\n                            supervisor appointed under this section in respect of any building works\n                            shall take all reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in giving\n                            – (a)    in the case of\n                                large building works – full-time supervision to the carrying\n                                out of the structural elements of the building works;\n                            and (b)    in the case of\n                                small-scale building works – immediate supervision to the\n                                carrying out of the critical structural elements of the building\n                                works, to ensure that the structural elements or critical structural elements, as\n                        the case may be, of the building works in question are carried out in\n                        accordance with the plans of the building works supplied to him in\n                        accordance with section 9(1)(c) by a qualified\n                        person, and with any terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of\n                        Building Control. There was no dispute that the project works were “small-scale\n                    building works” for the purposes of the Act. However, in the\n                    Judge’s view, s 10(5)(b) of the Act\n                    only obliges a site supervisor (including a clerk of works) to supervise the\n                    carrying out of “critical structural elements” of small-scale\n                    building works, and, according to s 2 of the Act, “structural\n                    elements” were “parts or elements of a building” (see the\n                    Judgment at [37]). Since earthworks (including backfilling) were not parts or\n                    elements of a building, much less “critical structural elements”,\n                    the Judge held that the Respondent was not obliged to supervise the\n                    backfilling. 13     In addition, the Judge considered that, even\n                    if the backfill could be considered a “critical structural\n                    element” for the purposes of s 10(5)(b), a clerk of works’ obligation under s 10(5) of the Act\n                    was merely to ensure that such elements were carried out “in accordance\n                    with the plans of the building works… and with any terms and conditions\n                    imposed by the Commissioner of Building Control”. On the facts, however,\n                    there was no evidence that the building plans specified a particular material to\n                    be used as backfill, or that the Commissioner of Building Control had imposed\n                    any terms and conditions relating to the backfill. 14     The Appellant appeals against this portion of\n                    the Judge’s decision.",
        "Arguments on appeal": "",
        "Appellant’s arguments": "15     The Appellant submits that, on its true\n                    construction, s 10(5) of the Act does impose a duty of care on the\n                    Respondent. The Appellant points out that s 2 of the Act includes\n                    “foundations” and “all other elements designed to resist\n                    forces and moments” within the definition of “structural\n                    elements”. Under regulation 2 of the 2003 Regulations,\n                    “foundation” means: that part of a construction immediately below the footings of a building,\n                        which is in direct contact with, and through which the weight of a building\n                        is transmitted to, the ground, and includes piling works … The backfill, the Appellant argues, falls within the definition of\n                    “foundation” in the 2003 Regulations. Further, according to the\n                    testimony of the Appellant’s expert witness, the backfill “wholly\n                    supports the weight of the structures built at the back of the [s]ite”\n                    and is “one of the critical factors that would affect the structural\n                    stability of the structures built on the [s]ite”. As such, the Appellant\n                    submits, the backfill is a “structural element” within the meaning\n                    of s 2 of the Act, as it is both a “foundation” as well as an\n                    element which resists forces and moments, and, given its crucial significance,\n                    is therefore a “critical structural element” of the building\n                    works. Consequently, according to the Appellant, the Respondent was obliged,\n                    under s 10(5)(b) of the Act, to take all\n                    reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in giving “immediate\n                    supervision” to the carrying out of the backfilling to ensure that they\n                    were carried out in accordance with the building plans, which the Respondent\n                    failed to do. 16     In addition, the Appellant submits that the\n                    Respondent owed it a common law duty of care to supervise the backfilling, and\n                    to ensure that material used as backfill was suitable for its purpose. In this\n                    regard, the Appellant submits that the test for the existence of a duty of care,\n                    laid down by this court inSpandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v\n                        Defence Science & Technology Agency[2007]\n                    4 SLR(R) 100 (“Spandeck”),\n                    is satisfied on the facts of this appeal, and that the Respondent breached his\n                    duty of care to the Appellant, which caused loss to the Appellant that was not\n                    too remote.",
        "Respondent’s arguments": "17     The Respondent, unsurprisingly, submits that\n                    the Judge’s construction of s 10(5) of the Act is the correct one,\n                    and therefore that the Act did not impose the duty of care for which the\n                    Appellant contends. 18     In addition, the Respondent argues that the\n                    Act is conclusive as to a clerk of works’ duties, and that there is no\n                    reason to impose any common law duty of care above and beyond the statutory\n                    duties prescribed by the Act. 19     Finally, the Respondent submits that, even if\n                    a duty of care was owed to the Appellant, there had been no breach of this duty\n                    by the Respondent.",
        "Issues on appeal": "20     The issues which arise for our determination\n                    in this appeal are as follows: (a)     whether s 10(5)(b) of the Act, on its true construction, imposes a\n                        duty on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling; (b)     whether, at common law, the Respondent\n                        owed the Appellant a duty of care to supervise the\n                    backfilling; (c)     whether, if a duty under (a) and/or (b) above existed, the Respondent\n                        breached either or both of those duties; (d)     whether, assuming that there had been a breach\n                        of either or both of those duties, such breach or breaches caused the\n                        Appellant’s loss and were not too remote; and (e)     assuming that he was otherwise liable\n                        to the Appellant, whether the Respondent can avail himself of any\n                        defences.",
        "Our decision": "",
        "Section 10(5)(b) of the\n                Act": "Remedying a misconception 21     We should highlight at the outset that even if\n                    the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5) of the Act is correct,\n                    s 10(5) is, strictly speaking, not determinative of the Respondent’s\n                    civil liability to the Appellant in an action for negligence, for it is trite\n                    law that there is no common law tort of “careless performance of a\n                    statutory duty” (see the House of Lords decision ofX (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council[1995]\n                    2 AC 633 (“X v\n                        Bedfordshire CC”) at 732–735). 22     In other words, what the courts in this area\n                    are looking for is still a duty of care at common law (see, for example, the\n                    English Court of Appeal decision ofConnor v Surrey County\n                        Council[2010] 3 All ER 905 at [102]),ie, the statutory duty which a plaintiff alleges sounds\n                    in negligence must have been previously held to give rise to a common law duty\n                    of care, or must be so declared by the court adjudicating the matter, applying\n                    the test inSpandeck. A statutory duty does notipso factoimpose a concomitant duty of care\n                    at common law. A statutory duty may, of course, form the backdrop to and inform\n                    the existence (or lack thereof) of a common law duty of care (see, for example,X v Bedfordshire CCat 739), but that\n                    does not mean the statutory dutyper seis a duty\n                    of care, even if it is phrased (as here) in terms of requiring the taking of\n                    “reasonable steps” and “due\n                diligence”. 23     Even if the Appellant’s construction of\n                        s 10(5)(b) of the Act is correct,\n                    therefore, themere existenceof a statutory duty\n                    on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling is not sufficient to establish an\n                    action in negligence at common law by the Appellant. 24     Nevertheless, if there is indeed such a\n                    statutory duty on the Respondent under s 10(5)(b) of the Act (as construed by the Appellant), and the\n                    Respondent had breached such a duty, another possible cause of action that the\n                    Appellant might have pursued against the Respondent would be one based on the\n                    tort of breach of statutory duty. However, this alternative legal route does not\n                    appear to have been adopted by the Appellant. Although s 10(5) of the Act\n                    clearly imposes some sort of statutory duty on site supervisors, the Act only\n                    states that breach of that duty will give rise tocriminalliability under s 10(8) of the Act. As the Act is\n                    completely silent on whether breach of s 10(5) also gives rise tocivilliability, and, if so, whether such liability is\n                    incurred to a private individual who has suffered loss as a result of the\n                    breach, the success of a claim for breach of statutory duty would, in the main,\n                    have depended on the construction of the Act in general and\n                        s 10(5)(b) in particular, in order to\n                    ascertain whether the Legislature impliedly intended to provide a right of civil\n                    action to enforce the statutory duty (see the leading House of Lords decision ofCutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd[1949] AC 398 at 407 and 412). 25     The key precondition, however, to the validity\n                    of an action for breach of statutory duty would have been the existence and\n                    nature of the statutory duty contended for,ie,\n                    the correctness of the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5)(b) of the Act, for the action would fail at the\n                    threshold if the relevant facts did not even fall within the ambit of\n                        s 10(5)(b) of the Act in the first place.\n                    Indeed, this is precisely what the Judge found, and it is to that finding that\n                    our attention now turns. Our decision 26     We are of the view that the Judge’s\n                    decision on the interpretation to be given to s 10(5)(b) of the Act is undoubtedly correct. The definition of\n                    “structural elements” in s 2 of the Act clearly refers to\n                    parts or elements of abuilding, and the\n                    definition of “building” in s 2 (“any permanent or\n                    temporarybuilding or structure” [emphasis\n                    added]) contemplates an artificial construct or edifice, and not the ground upon\n                    which that construct or edifice rests. 27     Further, the only example of a\n                    “building” given in s 2 of the Act which could come close to\n                    covering the backfill in the context of the present proceedings is the term\n                    “earth retaining or stabilising structure, whether permanent or\n                    temporary” found in example (b). However, the term “earth\n                    retaining structure” is, in turn, defined in s 2 of the Act as\n                    “any structure, structural system or other means used to maintain the\n                    shape of excavationduring … earth\n                    filling” [emphasis added], which suggests that earth fillingper secannot be a building. 28     Hence, the backfill does not form part of the\n                    “structural elements” of the building works, critical or\n                    otherwise, and s 10(5)(b) of the Act\n                    therefore imposed no statutory duty on the Respondent to supervise the carrying\n                    out of the backfilling.",
        "Common law duty of care": "Introduction 29     It follows from the discussion at[21]-[23]above, however, that the construction of\n                        s 10(5)(b) of the Act is not\n                    determinative of the issue of the Respondent’s common law duty of care,\n                    and it is therefore necessary to determine whether, under theSpandecktest, the Respondent owes a duty of care to the\n                    Appellant at common law. As this court observed inNgiam Kong\n                        Seng and another v Lim Chiew Hock[2008] 3 SLR(R) 674\n                        (“Ngiam”) (at\n                    [20]–[21]): 20    The general position\n                            in Singapore with respect to liability for negligence in cases of pure\n                            economic loss and cases of physical damage has now been settled by the\n                            recent decision of this court in Spandeck ([2] supra). Briefly stated,\n                            the position in Singapore follows, in the main, the two-stage test laid\n                            down by Lord Wilberforce in Anns v Merton London Borough Council\n                            [1978] AC 728 (“Anns”), where the learned law\n                            lord observed, as follows (at 751-752): [I]n order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular\n                            situation,it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation\n                            within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been\n                            held to exist. Rather the question has to be approached in two stages.\n                            First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the\n                            person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of\n                            proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of\n                            the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to\n                            the latter - in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly,\n                            if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to\n                            consider whether there are any considerations which ought to negative,\n                            or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of persons to\n                            whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may give rise ...\n                            [emphasis added] 21    More specifically,\n                            Chan Sek Keong CJ, delivering the judgment of the court inSpandeck, observed thus (at [73]): In our view, a coherent and workable test can be\n                                fashioned out of the basic two-stage test premised on proximity and\n                                policy considerations, if its application is preceded by a\n                                preliminary requirement offactualforeseeability. We would add that this test is to be\n                                    appliedincrementally, in the sense\n                                that when applying the test in each stage, it would be desirable to\n                                refer to decided cases in analogous situations to see how the courts\n                                have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity and/or\n                                policy. As is obvious, the existence of analogous\n                            precedents, which determines the current limits of liability, would make\n                            it easier for the later court to determine whether or not to extend its\n                            limits. However, the absence of a factual precedent, which implies the\n                            presence of a novel situation, should not preclude the court from\n                            extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into\n                            account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate\n                            liability against a tortfeasor.We would admit at\n                                this juncture that this is basically a restatement of the two-stage\n                                test in Anns, tempered by the preliminary requirement of factual\n                                foreseeability. Indeed, we should point out that this is the test\n                                applied in substance by many jurisdictions in the\n                                Commonwealth: see, for example, the Canadian case ofCooper v Hobart(2001) 206 DLR (4th) 193; the New Zealand case\n                            ofRolls-Royce New Zealand Ltd v Carter Holt Harvey Ltd[2005]\n                            1 NZLR 324 ... [emphasis added in bold italics] In a similar vein, the learned Chief Justice summarised the\n                        applicable law in Singapore at the end of the judgment inSpandeckin the\n                        following terms (at [115]): To recapitulate: Asingletest to determine the existence of a duty of\n                            care should be applied regardless of the nature of the damage caused\n                            (ie, pure economic loss or physical damage). It could be that a more\n                            restricted approach is preferable for cases of pure economic loss but\n                            this is to be done within the confines of a single test.This test is a two-stage test, comprising of, first,\n                                proximity and, second, policy considerations. These two stages are\n                                to be approached with reference to the facts of decided cases\n                                although the absence of such cases is not an absolute bar against a\n                                finding of duty. There is, of course, the threshold issue of factual\n                                foreseeability but since this is likely to be fulfilled in most\n                                cases, we do not see the need to include this as part of\n                                thelegaltest for a duty of\n                                care. [emphasis added in bold italics] [emphasis in original] 30     InNgiamitself,\n                    theSpandecktest was extended to encompass\n                    liability for psychiatric harm (thus confirming that it is, indeed, asingletest for the existence of a duty of care that is\n                    applicable across the board in the tort of negligence). In so far as the law in\n                    other Commonwealth jurisdictions was concerned, the following observations were\n                    made inNgiam(at [105]–[107]): 105    It should also be noted that although the\n                            two-stage test inAnns([20]supra), which forms the basis of the test\n                            laid down by this court inSpandeck, has not been followed in England,\n                            the law in that particular jurisdiction continues (as this court noted\n                            inSpandeckat [46]-[49]) to remain in a state of flux (see, for\n                            example, the House of Lords decision ofCustoms and Excise Commissioners\n                            v Barclays Bank plc[2007] 1 AC 181). 106    It is also interesting to note that the position\n                            in Canada is similar to that presently applicable in Singapore, where\n                            (as mentioned earlier at [98] above) a somewhat modified version of the\n                            two-stage test in Anns has been adopted. In particular, whilst affirming\n                            the two-stage test in Anns, the Canadian courts have considered both\n                            reasonable foreseeability and proximity under the first stage (see, for\n                            example, the Canadian Supreme Court decisions ofCooper v Hobart(2001)\n                            206 DLR (4th) 193 at [30]-[31];Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse(2003) 233 DLR (4th) 193 at [46]-[50];Hill v\n                            Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board(2005)\n                            259 DLR (4th) 676 at [47];Childs v Desormeaux(2006)\n                            266 DLR (4th) 257 at [9]-[12]; andSyl Apps Secure Treatment\n                            Centre v BD(2007) 284 DLR (4th) 682 at [23]-[30]). This\n                            approach is not necessarily at variance with that adopted inSpandeck,\n                            for (as we explained above at [104]) the concept of reasonable\n                            foreseeability is also an integral part of the process of ascertaining\n                            whether there is sufficient (legal) proximity between the plaintiff and\n                            the defendant, albeit on a preliminary (and factual)\n                        level. 107    The position in Australia appears to be somewhat\n                            in a state of flux (see generally Francis Trindade, Peter\n                            Cane & Mark Lunney,The Law of Torts in Australia(Oxford\n                            University Press, 4th Ed, 2007) at ch 9). 31     It is interesting to note that the respective\n                    situations in the various jurisdictions as summarised inNgiamabove have not – to the best of our knowledge\n                    – changed substantially since then (see, for example,\n                    W V H Rogers,Winfield & Jolowicz on Tort(Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2010) (“Winfield & Jolowicz”) at ch 5 (with\n                    regard to England); Allen M Linden and Bruce Feldthusen,Canadian Tort Law(LexisNexis, 8th Ed,\n                    2006) at ch 9, especially at pp 301-306, Lewis N Klar,Tort Law(Thomson Carswell, 4th Ed, 2008)\n                    at ch 5, especially at pp 165-185, as well as the Supreme Court of\n                    Canada decision ofFullowka et al v Pinkerton’s of\n                        Canada Limited et al(2010) 315 DLR (4th) 577 (with\n                    regard to Canada); and R P Balkin and J L R Davis,Law of Torts(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009)\n                    at ch 7, especially at paras 7.12-7.13 (with regard to\n                    Australia)). 32     Returning to the facts of the present appeal,\n                    as noted above (at[29]), this court decided\n                    inSpandeckthat a single test for the existence\n                    of a duty of care in the tort of negligence is applicable irrespective of the\n                    type of loss suffered, and it is therefore not fatal to the Appellant’s\n                    case that the loss for which it seeks to be compensated is pure economic loss,viz, the cost of remedial work. 33     TheSpandecktest requires this court to consider (assuming it was factually foreseeable that\n                    the Appellant would suffer damage from the Respondent’s carelessness)\n                    whether there was sufficient legal proximity between the Appellant and the\n                    Respondent for aprima facieduty of care to arise\n                    (seeSpandeckat [77]), and whether any policy\n                    considerations negated thisprima facieduty (seeSpandeckat [83]). This two-stage test is to\n                    be applied incrementally with reference to the facts of decided cases in\n                    analogous situations (seeSpandeckat\n                    [73]). 34     In essence, what this court has to decide, in\n                    the context of the present appeal, is whether, at common law, a clerk of works\n                    owes a duty to the person commissioning the building works (who may or may not,\n                    contractually, be his employer) to take reasonable care in supervising the\n                    carrying out of those works. Even if such a duty of care exists, there must,inter alia, have been a breach of such a duty\n                    of care by the Respondent resulting in damage that must not have been too remote\n                    in order for the Respondent to be liable to the Appellant. However, the\n                    establishment of a duty of care is an obvious threshold requirement that must\n                    first be established (in this case, by the Appellant). It is this issue (and, in\n                    particular, the legal criteria laid down in theSpandecktest) that we must now address. Factual foreseeability 35     The threshold requirement of factual\n                    foreseeability is easily fulfilled on the facts of this appeal: it was\n                    reasonably foreseeable that if the Respondent did not take care in supervising\n                    the backfill operation, the Appellant would suffer some sort of loss or damage.\n                    The land might not, for instance, have been backfilled to the proper depth,\n                    leading to subsidence and physical damage to any structures resting on the\n                    backfill. Proximity Introduction 36     As explained inSpandeck(at [78]–[79]), the focus of the inquiry at this\n                    stage of the test is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties,\n                    and it embraces physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, including (where\n                    the facts support it) any voluntary assumption of responsibility by the\n                    defendant and/or reasonable reliance thereon by the plaintiff (seeSpandeckat [81]). Physical proximity 37     There was evidently physical proximity between\n                    the parties: the Appellant was the lessee of the site, and the Respondent, by\n                    virtue of his appointment as clerk of works/site supervisor, was bound to be\n                    physically present at the site in order to carry out his duties (as to which see[44]below). Legal proximity Introduction 38     The concept of proximity requires more than\n                    just physical closeness between the parties, however, and in order to determine\n                    whether there was a sufficient degree oflegalproximity between the Appellant and the Respondent, it is necessary to examine,\n                    in some detail, the status and position of a clerk of works. The role of a clerk of works 39     According to theClerk of\n                        Works Manual(Institute of Clerks of Works and Royal Institute of\n                    British Architects, 3rd Ed, 1994) (at para 1.01), the term\n                    “clerk of works” was historically “given to the cleric or\n                    other person appointed tosuperintendbuilding\n                    operations” [emphasis added]. This is confirmed by\n                    John E Johnston,The Clerk of Works in the\n                        Construction Industry(Crosby Lockwood Staples, 1975)\n                        (“The Clerk of Works”), which\n                    states (at p 3) that: The title Clerk of Works has been in existence since the medieval period,\n                        when a clerk was recognised as a man of learning associated with Holy Orders\n                        … Medieval clerks were not always ordained priests, but acted in a lay\n                        capacity on behalf of the Church,those nominated as\n                            Clerk of Works being responsible for the construction and upkeep of\n                            buildings. Because of the similarity of their duties, the title was\n                            later conferred upon thosewho did not hold Holy Orders but\n                        whowere commissioned tosupervisethe erection and repairs to the Royal\n                            Buildings. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 40     It is interesting to note from the above\n                    materials that since the Middle Ages, the role of the clerk of works at a\n                    building site has been of a supervisory nature. For example,The Clerk of Workscites (at p 6) records from the time of\n                    the restoration of St Paul’s Cathedral in the seventeenth century which\n                    state that the clerk of works: … constantly attends the service of the work to take care that\n                        carpenters, labourers, etc, who work by the day, be employed in such\n                        business as the Surveyor has directed to be done … 41     TheClerk of Works\n                        Manualnotes (at para 1.01) that the attributes of\n                    “ability, integrity and vigilance” were considered the most\n                    appropriate qualities of a clerk of works, and that these continue to be\n                    reflected in the official coat of arms of the Institute of Clerks of Works of\n                    Great Britain. TheClerk of Works Manualfurther\n                    states (at para 3.03) that the functions and attributes of a clerk of works\n                    include (inter alia): -Inspection: detecting\n                            workmanship which does not comply or materials which do not conform to\n                            the contract standards. This will usually mean inspecting in detail, and\n                            checking measurements regularly. -Reporting: keeping the\n                            architect fully informed on a regular pre-arranged basis. It also means\n                            alerting the architect immediately when situations arise which require\n                            decisions or actions. [emphasis in original] 42     Indeed, it has been the common understanding\n                    of the construction industry for over three centuries that (seeThe Clerk of Worksat p 104): [t]he primary task of the Clerk of Works is to inspect the work as it\n                        proceeds to ensure it is carried out in accordance with the contract\n                        drawings and specifications. For instance, British Standards Institution,Glossary of Building and Civil Engineering Terms(Blackwell\n                    Scientific Publications, 1993), defines (at 160 2015) a “clerk of\n                    works” as a “[p]erson appointed to verify, on behalf of aclient, thatconstruction\n                        workis executed in accordance withdrawings, specifications and othercontract\n                        documents” [emphasis in original]. That this understanding\n                    is shared locally by construction professionals is confirmed by Chow Kok Fong,Construction Contracts Dictionary(Thomson,\n                    Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2006), who defines (at p 62) a clerk of\n                    works as: A representative of the architect, engineer or superintending officer in a\n                        construction contract who is deployed on site to assist the architect,\n                        engineer or superintending officer and to inspect the progress of the works\n                        on behalf of the architect, engineer or superintending officer. 43     Colin Tesch,Construction-Law and Duties(Butterworths, 1977), explains (at [215]) that: An architect, for his basic agreed fee, does not usually undertake to do\n                        more than periodic inspections. If the project is of a large size, or\n                        perhaps distant from the architect’s office or maybe only small but\n                        complex, full-time supervision may be required. This is provided for by the\n                        appointment of a clerk of works. 44     It appears, therefore, that the industry\n                    practice has been that clerks of works assist the architect by monitoring the\n                    work of contractors on behalf of the person commissioning the construction works\n                    (“the client”), in order to ensure that work is carried out tothe client’sstandards, specifications\n                    and schedule, that the correct materials are used and that proper workmanship is\n                    observed. 45     Turning to the relevant case law, in the\n                    English High Court decision ofLeicester Board of Guardians v\n                        Trollope(reported in Alfred A Hudson,The Law of Building, Engineering and Ship Building Contracts and of\n                        the Duties and Liabilities of Engineers, Architects, Surveyors, and Valuers;\n                        with Reports of Cases and Precedents, vol II,\n                    (Sweet & Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1914) at p 419)\n                        (“Trollope”), the defendant\n                    architect had contracted with the plaintiffs to supervise the building works. A\n                    clerk of works had been appointed, who permitted the builders to lay the\n                    flooring without the specified precautions, thereby deviating from the\n                    defendant’s design, and causing dry rot to set in some years later. The\n                    plaintiffs sued the defendant for breach of the contract of supervision, and the\n                    defendant denied liability on the ground that the damage had been caused by the\n                    negligence or misconduct of the clerk of works. In the course of his judgment,\n                    Channell J remarked (at p 423) that: I think there is no difficulty in seeing what are the respective functions\n                        and duties of an architect, and of a clerk of the works. I had a very clear\n                        idea of it myself, and the witnesses who have been called for the defendant,\n                        two gentlemen of position in the profession, and the defendant himself, who\n                        is a gentleman of position in the profession, all practical agree. They all\n                        agree thatthe clerk of the works has to see to matters\n                            of detail, and that the architect is not expected… to\n                        do so … Everybody knows that an architect cannot be there all the time, and\n                        everybody knows thatthe clerk of the works is appointed\n                            to protect the interests of the employer against the builder, mainly\n                            because the architect cannot be there. The same gentlemen who\n                        tell us that tell us also that the architect is responsible to see that his\n                        design is carried out. That fairly indicates what the respective duties of\n                        each are, but it leaves one in each case to say whether the matter\n                        complained of is a matter of detail or a matter of seeing whether the design\n                        is complied with. [emphasis added] On the facts, Channell J decided that the laying of concrete was\n                    a matter of design within the architect’s purview, and not a matter of\n                    detail that could be left to the clerk of works, and therefore rejected the\n                    defendant’s attempt to deny liability. 46     Although in stating that “the clerk of\n                    the works is appointed to protect the interests of the employer against the\n                    builder” (Trollopeat p 423, and\n                    reproduced in the preceding paragraph), Channell J used the term\n                    “employer”, we are of the view that the position is no different\n                    where the client does not formally (pursuant to a contract of service) employ\n                    the clerk of works. It is to be noted, however, that although\n                    Channell J’s comments inTrollopeon\n                    the scope of the duty of a clerk of works have generally been accepted (seeJackson & Powell on Professional\n                        Liability(John L Powell and Roger Stewart\n                    Gen Eds) (Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) at\n                    para 9-246), his eventual decision is more questionable. Even if the laying\n                    of concrete had been a matter of design, it appears that the clerk of works had\n                    fraudulently colluded with the builder in not taking the necessary precautions,\n                    and then concealed the wrongdoing (seeTrollopeat\n                    p 422). In such circumstances, we would have thought that there would be\n                    scope for arguments based on contributory negligence ornovus\n                        actus interveniens(see, for instance, the English decision ofGray and Others (The Special Trustees of the London\n                        Hospital) v T P Bennett & Son (a firm) and\n                        others(1987) 43 BLR 63). It should be borne in mind,\n                    however, thatTrollopehad been decided long\n                    before these defences were fully developed, and that, on the facts, the\n                    architect inTrollopemade no effort to ensure\n                    that his design had been complied with. 47     In the English High Court decision ofKensington and Chelsea and Westminster Area Health\n                        Authority v Wettern Composites and others(1984) 1 Con\n                    LR 114 (“Wettern Composites”),\n                    the plaintiffs were the board of governors of a hospital to which an extension\n                    had been built, consisting of (inter alia)\n                    artificial stone mullions erected as part of the outer cladding, and which was\n                    eventually discovered to be defective. The defendants were, essentially, the\n                    architects, whom the plaintiffs had sued in negligence for failing to adequately\n                    supervise the erection. In the course of his judgment holding the architects\n                    liable, Judge David Smout QC referred (at 133) with approval to the\n                    division of duties between the architect and clerk of works commented upon inTrollope, and (at 137–138) stated that\n                    the clerk of works: … has been aptly described as the Regimental Sergeant-Major. It is\n                        accepted thathe acts as the eyes and ears of the\n                            architects, and has a responsibility to keep the architects informed as\n                            to what is or is not happening on site. He is also described as employed\n                            “to act solely as inspector on behalf of the employer under the\n                            direction of the architects.” [emphasis added] 48Wettern\n                        Compositesis also notable because the clerk of works concerned\n                    was also held to be negligent in failing to detect the defects, which holding\n                    demonstrates that, even in matters of detail, the presence of a clerk of works\n                    may not exempt an architect from responsibility. As the clerk of works was\n                    employed by the plaintiffs, they were held vicariously liable for his\n                    negligence, and their damages were reduced by 20% as a result of contributory\n                    negligence. 49     Closer to home, in the decision of this court\n                    inChuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v Setron Ltd[1999]\n                    3 SLR(R) 771 (“Setron”),\n                    the first respondent (“Setron”) owned a building which had been\n                    designed by the second respondent (“the architect”), while the\n                    appellant (“the contractor”) was the main contractor who was\n                    responsible for tiling works on the building’s façade. As a result of\n                    defective design on the part of the architect and defective workmanship on the\n                    part of the contractor, tiles fell off the façade in such quantities that the\n                    entire façade had to be replaced. One of the issues on appeal was the\n                    architect’s failure to supervise the tiling works, in breach of its\n                    contractual duty to Setron to do so, and the architect attempted to argue that,\n                    as on-site supervision had been left to a clerk of works, who was employed by\n                    Setron, the architect was not liable for the clerk of work’s\n                    negligence. 50     Rejecting this contention, this court held (at[40]) that the clerk of works was the\n                    “ears and eyes” of the architects in respect of the day to day\n                    on-site supervision of the construction works, and that he was “duty\n                    bound to report to the architects of any defect or shortcomings in the\n                    construction works”. 51     This survey of authorities demonstrates that,\n                    both as a matter of industry practice and judicial observation, a clerk of works\n                    is regarded as being, by virtue of his functions and responsibilities at the\n                    building site, in fairly close proximity tothe\n                        client, regardless of whether they are in a formal\n                    employer-employee relationship. If, of course, the clerk of works is in fact\n                    employed by the client, then there would also be acontractual relationship(which would, naturally, entail the\n                    corresponding legal obligations) between the parties. The clerk of works\n                    protects the interests of the client against the builder, by inspecting and\n                    supervising the works to ensure that they conform to the client’s budget,\n                    standards and specifications, and that the client is getting value for money and\n                    proper workmanship. These matters have usually been described as matters of\n                    “detail”, but might be more accurately be termedoperationalmatters, in keeping with the military\n                    analogy employed inWettern Composites(see[47]above). In respect of such\n                    operational matters, the clerk of works is predominantly responsible, although,\n                    asWettern Compositesillustrates, depending on\n                    the circumstances, the architect may share some responsibility. In addition, as\n                    theClerk of Works ManualandSetronindicate (see above at[41]and[50],\n                    respectively), regardless of whether the matter is one of design or operations,\n                    the clerk of works should keep the architect abreast of developments at the\n                    worksite, especially if he notices defects or shortcomings in the\n                works. 52     All this having been said, however, we are\n                    inclined to think that, if a problem arises, the client would not generally sue\n                    the clerk of works concerned in either contract and/or tort. Indeed, we have\n                    seen that, even where a clerk of works has been at fault, the actual claim has\n                    (in the cases considered) been made against the architect (seeTrollope,Wettern\n                        CompositesandSetron, all of which\n                    have been discussed above), with the role of the clerk of works being relevant\n                    to the issue ofvicarious liabilityandcontributory negligence. This is not surprising as\n                    clerks of works are not generally substantial litigants in their own right\n                    (although, as we shall see, this is not the situation in the present appeal,\n                    which presents a rather exceptional fact situation). A more important point,\n                    however, is that, in thetortiouscontext, clerks of works might not even be liable to the client in the\n                        first instance. Let us elaborate. 53     It is important to acknowledge the very real\n                    fact thatthe qualifications of clerks of work can vary\n                        enormously. As has been observed in a leading textbook in the\n                    field (see I N Duncan Wallace,Hudson’s\n                        Building and Engineering Contracts(Sweet & Maxwell, 1995) vol 1 (at para 2-024)): Clerks of works are usually employed for a specific project, in many cases\n                        on the recommendation of the architect, though it is not unusual for\n                        building owners with their own building departments or organisations to put\n                        forward one of their own employees. They are almost invariably employed and\n                        paid for by the building owner. ... Their use is more common in building\n                        than in engineering contracts...Their qualifications may\n                            vary from those of a retired tradesman or foreman to a fully qualified\n                            archit[e]ct or engineer, but in general their position is considerably\n                            inferior to that of a resident engineer, and the extent of their\n                            authority much more rigorously circumscribed by the contract\n                            documents... [emphasis added] There are at least two legal consequences that arise from this\n                    variation in qualifications of clerks of works. 54     First, thescopeof any duty of care owed by a clerk of works willvaryfrom case to case and, depending on the fact situation, the\n                    scope of the duty of care may not include the acts or omissions complained of.\n                    If so, there is no duty that can bebreached, even\n                    assuming that a duty of care exists in the first instance. 55Secondly, at athresholdlevel,there\n                        might not even be a duty of care to begin with(and, on theoverlapbetween duty and breach, see below at[61]). We are, of course, assuming a\n                    situation in which there isno contractual nexusbetween the clerk of works concerned and the client to begin with. Whilst,\n                    following from the analysis above at[39]-[51], it might be argued that, in such a situation, there would,\n                    ordinarily, be a duty of care intortowed by the\n                    clerk of works to the client (cfStephen Furst and\n                    Sir Vivian Ramsey,Keating on Construction\n                        Contracts(8th Ed, London: Sweet & Maxwell,\n                    2006) (“Keating”) at\n                    para 13-049), we are of the view that, in order for such\n                        a duty of care to exist, there must first be demonstrated that, on the facts\n                        of the case concerned, there had been legal proximity between the parties\n                        – for example, that there had been an assumption of responsibility by\n                        the clerk of worksvis-a-visthe client. At\n                        this juncture, the universal and the particular (necessarily and, indeed,\n                        inevitably) intersect, with the focus tending towards the latter (as opposed\n                        to the former). This necessarily entails an application of the\n                    general legal principles to thefactsof the case\n                    itself. However, unlike the issue of thescopeof\n                    the duty of care referred to in the preceding paragraph, we arenothere stating that the existence of a duty of care isdependent onthe (variable) qualities of the\n                    clerk of works. Nonetheless, as we explain below,the precise\n                        factsarestillimportant in\n                    ascertaining whether there has been an assumption of responsibility by the\n                    defendant and (correspondingly) whether the element of reliance on the part of\n                    the plaintiff has been satisfied. 56     However, can it be argued that aparticular or specificconsideration of thefactsofa given caseisinconsistentwith thegeneralprinciple that a clerk of worksordinarilyowes a duty of care to his or her client? In our view\n                    there isno inconsistency(a key consideration in\n                    this regard, as we shall see, lies in the word “ordinarily”). 57     As already alluded to above, thegeneralprinciple is (necessarily) stated ata high level of\n                        abstraction andconsideration must therefore (and also necessarily) be given to theparticular or specific factsof the case itself. 58     One such example is to be found on the facts\n                    of the seminal House of Lords decision ofHedley\n                        Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners\n                        Ltd[1964] 1 AC 465 (“Hedley\n                        Byrne”), where, although the House of Lords held that it\n                    was possible, as a matter ofgeneral principle,\n                    for a defendant to owe a duty of care with regard tonegligent misstatements, there was no liability on thefactsof that particular case as the defendant bank had\n                    includeda disclaimer of responsibilityin the\n                    response it had given to the plaintiff firm. We would observe –\n                    parenthetically – that there is, once again,an\n                        intersection between the universal and the particularinasmuch as\n                    it could be argued that,in addition tothe effect\n                    of such a disclaimer on theparticular factsof\n                    the case itself, such a disclaimer represents (at the level ofgeneral principle) an instance of what might constitutean exceptionto the general proposition that a\n                    duty of care can be owed with respect to negligent misstatements at common law.\n                    However, what is important, for present purposes, is to acknowledgethe role of the particular factsin ascertaining whether\n                    or not a duty of care exists in a given case. 59     Consequently, it is necessary, in the context\n                    of the present appeal, to now turn to theapplicationof the general legal principles to thefactsof this case. 60     Before proceeding to do so, however, we would\n                    emphasise that we have hitherto consideredonlythe position between a clerk of works and the client. By way of asummaryof the analysis rendered thus far, where acontractual nexusexists between these two\n                    parties, there will be contractual liability if a breach of contract can be\n                    established by the innocent party. Further, where such a nexus exists, there\n                    could well beconcurrentliability for negligence\n                    intortas well. Where, however, a contractual\n                    nexus doesnotexist between these two parties, it\n                    doesnot necessarilyfollow that theremustbe liability for negligence intortbetween these parties simply because a duty of care might\n                    not even exist in the first place. As we have sought to emphasise, whilst it\n                    would be possible to argue that, on agenerallevel, a duty of care oughtordinarilyto be owed\n                    by a clerk of works to his client, whether or not such a duty of careisindeed owed in the case at hand would, in our view,\n                    depend on theprecise factsin question – in\n                    particular, whether there had been anassumption of\n                        responsibilityby the clerk of works concernedvis-a-visthe client (and a correspondingrelianceby the latter on the former). Indeed,even ifsuch a duty of care existed on the facts, there\n                    mightstillbenoliability if, again on therelevant factsof the\n                    case concerned, the clerk of works had notbreachedthat duty. 61     It is apposite, at this juncture, to point out\n                    that there is often anoverlapbetween duty and\n                    breach (see generallyWinfield & Jolowiczat para 5-23).\n                    Conceivably, in our view, whether the relevant facts of the case are considered\n                    at the (earlier) duty stage (as is the case in the present appeal) or at the\n                    later breach stage would depend very much on the characterisation as well as\n                    level of abstraction adopted by the court concerned. However, acknowledging (as\n                    we have done (see below at[66]-[74])) that the relevantcontractual\n                        matrixought (where it exists) to be considered (whether at the\n                    first and/or second stages of theSpandecktest)\n                    suggests that, in most of these cases, the court will probably consider (as we\n                    have in the present appeal (see below at[63]-[74])) theparticular facts in order to ascertain\n                        whether a duty of care exists. 62It is also important to\n                        note that we leave open the point as to whether or not a clerk of works owes\n                        a duty of care (even on a general level) to other third parties (who are not\n                        the clients as such). There might well be a strong argument in\n                    favour of excluding such a duty of care (even on a general level; andcf Keatingat para 13-049) but as this is not the\n                    fact situation before us, we say no more about this particular issue. We turn,\n                    instead, to a consideration of the facts of the present appeal. Conclusion on legal proximity 63     It should be noted that the Respondent was the\n                    main director of A.n.A and that he procured A.n.A to appoint himself clerk of\n                    works (see[64]below). In such\n                    circumstances, the Respondent wasvoluntarily assuming the\n                        various responsibilities the role carried and holding himself out as\n                        possessing the relevant qualifications and skills necessary to discharge\n                        that role. This is exactly the sort of relationship that\n                    Lord Devlin inHedley Byrneconsidered (at\n                    529) to be “equivalent to contract”,ie, where there is anassumption of\n                        responsibilityin circumstances in which, but for the absence of\n                    consideration, there would be a contract. 64     As for whether there wasrelianceby the Appellant on care being taken by the Respondent\n                    in circumstances where the latter knew or ought to have known of such reliance,\n                    it must have been obvious to the Respondent that the Appellant was relying on\n                    him as a clerk of works. Indeed, the Respondent intended that he should be so\n                    relied on, for he procured his own appointment as clerk of works by naming\n                    himself the site supervisor/clerk of works in an application form (“the\n                    BCA form”) submitted to the Building and Construction Authority\n                    (“BCA”), in which the Respondent declared that, as site\n                    supervisor, he was “not a partner, officer or employee of the\n                    builder”. This was, of course, patently false, but was no doubt\n                    calculated to convey the impression that the Respondent was an independent and\n                    reliable individual with no links to A.n.A, and could therefore be relied upon\n                    to act in the Appellant’s interest as a clerk of works. 65     The Respondent contends, however, that if the\n                    Appellant had wanted the Respondent to assume some liability to it in the\n                    conduct of his responsibilities, it could have sought a personal guarantee from\n                    the Respondent or introduced the Respondent as a further party to its contract\n                    with A.n.A, but it chose not to do so (see, similarly,Spandeckat [96]). In such circumstances, the Respondent argues,\n                    it cannot be said that he had assumed any responsibility to the Appellant and/or\n                    that the Appellant was relying on him. 66     Before we address this argument, we should\n                    note that the presence of a contractual matrix is a factor that, whilst\n                    considered to be among the “relevant policy considerations” inSpandeck(at [83]) (and, hence, falling under\n                    thesecondlimb of theSpandecktest), might, depending on the facts, be appropriately\n                    analysed, instead, in relation to the issue of proximity (under thefirstlimb of theSpandecktest). That there is, on occasion at least, an overlap between both limbs of theSpandecktest is not, perhaps,\n                    surprising. 67     Indeed, inSpandeckitself, the contractual matrix was treated as both a\n                    proximity factor (at [108]) as well as a policy consideration (at [114]).\n                    Similarly, in the English Court of Appeal decision ofPacific\n                        Associates Inc v Baxter[1990] 1 QB 993 (“Pacific Associates”) (which was, in fact, applied\n                    inSpandeck), the court did not adopt an\n                    altogether uniform approach towards this issue. Purchas LJ, for example,\n                    was of the view (at 1023-1024) that the precise reason adopted “may not\n                    in the present case matter very much” as the result would be the same,regardlessof whether it was held (inter alia) that there had been no proximity between the\n                    partiesorthat it would not be just and\n                    reasonable to find that a duty of care had been established. Ralph\n                    Gibson LJ, on the other hand, appeared (at 1031-1032) to base his decision\n                    on what is presently the second limb of theSpandecktest, whilst Russell LJclearlybased his decision on that particular limb (at\n                    1037-1039). 68     As was also observed in an article (see\n                    Andrew Phang, Cheng Lim Saw and Gary Chan, “Of\n                    Precedent, Theory and Practice – The Case for a Return toAnns” [2006] SJLS 1 (at\n                    p 54)): [D]espite the doctrinal separation of both limbs in theAnnstest [which was adopted inSpandeck(see above at[29])], there would, at the level of appli­cation,\n                        nevertheless be an interaction between them. This is only to be expected\n                        since the Court concerned has to base its final decision on aholisticconsideration ofbothlimbs as applied to the facts of the case itself.\n                        [emphasis in original] 69     The overlap just referred to is, in fact,\n                    neatly illustrated by the facts of this particular appeal. In this case, the\n                    Respondent is suggesting that the legal relationship between the parties has\n                    been exclusively defined by contract, leaving no room for the tortious doctrine\n                    of assumption of responsibility to operate. This bears more affinity to\n                    proximity (pursuant to the first limb of theSpandecktest), which is, after all, a question of the closeness\n                    of the relationship between the parties (seeSpandeckat [77]), than to far-reaching considerations of public\n                    policy (such as the notorious “floodgates” argument and the\n                    availability of insurance). However, we would observe – parenthetically\n                    – that the reasoningas well as(more\n                    importantly) the result would be thesameeven if\n                    we treat this particular issue under the second limb of theSpandecktest. This is not, of course, surprising, given the\n                    overlap just mentioned (see also, in a similar vein,Spandeck(at [114])). 70     Returning to the Respondent’s\n                    submission, although this sort of argument defeated the claim inSpandeckand inPacific\n                        Associates, in our view, on the facts of the present appeal, it\n                    is not as compelling. 71     The mere fact that there is a pre-existing\n                    contractual relationship or backdrop between the parties should not, in itself,\n                    be sufficient to exclude a duty of care on one of them to avoid causing pure\n                    economic loss to the other (the situation isa\n                        fortioriwhere, as here, there is in factnocontractual relationship between the parties, but merely a\n                    contractual backdrop, in the sense that each party was in a separate contractual\n                    relationship with a third party,viz, A.n.A). The\n                    true principle, in determining whether or not any contractual arrangement has\n                    this effect, should be whether or not the parties structured their contracts\n                    intending thereby to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care (see the\n                    House of Lords decision ofHenderson and others v Merrett\n                        Syndicates Ltd and others[1995] 2 AC 145 at\n                    193–194). 72     InSpandeckandPacific Associates, the presence of an\n                    arbitration clause pointed unequivocally to the fact that the parties\n                    deliberately wished for their contractual arrangements to exclusively govern\n                    their respective liabilities, and to prevent a tortious duty of care which would\n                    cut across and be inconsistent with that contractual structure (see generallySpandeckat [98]–[102],\n                    [108]–[109] and [114]). 73     Here, however, there is no inconsistency\n                    between, on the one hand, the contract between the Appellant and A.n.A, and, on\n                    the other, a duty of care owed by the Respondent to the Appellant. Certainly,\n                    there is no evidence to suggest that the Appellant and A.n.A had deliberately\n                    organised their contractual arrangements to exclude any potential tortious\n                    liability on the part of the Respondent. 74     Hence, in the absence of any positive steps\n                    taken by the parties during the negotiation and conclusion of the contract\n                    between A.n.A and the Appellant, we are unable to see how the contractual matrix\n                    militates against the existence of a duty of care owed by the Respondent to the\n                    Appellant. Policy considerations Introduction 75     Given that there is sufficient proximity\n                    between the Appellant and the Respondent for aprima\n                        facieduty of care to arise, it is necessary to consider whether\n                    any reasons of policy militate against the imposition of a duty of\n                care. 76     There are a number of such policy\n                    considerations,viz: (a)     whether imposing a duty of care on\n                        the Respondent might circumvent the prescribed statutory duties of a site\n                        supervisor; (b)     whether imposing a duty of care on the Respondent might amount to an\n                        impermissible lifting of the corporate veil; and (c)     the Respondent’s conflicts of\n                        interest. We will deal with each of these considerations\n                    seriatim. However, it is appropriate to make one preliminary\n                observation. 77     With regard to consideration (c) above, it\n                    will be seen (at[87]below) that our\n                    conclusion thereon is that, far from negating the Respondent’sprima facieduty of care, this particular consideration\n                    in factreinforcesit. It should not be thought,\n                    however, that this represents a departure fromSpandeck, and a return to the three-part test (“theCaparotest”) inCaparo Industries Plc v Dickman[1990] 2 AC 605\n                        (“Caparo”). The second limb of\n                    theSpandecktest is essentiallynegativein nature. Put simply, the court, having\n                    determined that aprima facieduty of care has\n                    been established, applies policy considerations to the factual matrix to decide\n                    whether thatprima facieduty isnegated or limited. In contrast, the third limb of theCaparotest is apositiveone: notwithstanding the existence of sufficient\n                    foreseeability of damage and proximity between the parties, a duty of care\n                    nonetheless cannot arise unless and until the factual matrix is “one in\n                    which the court considers it fair, just and reasonable” toimposea duty (seeCaparoat 618). In other words, unlike the third limb of theCaparotest, the second limb of theSpandecktest does not require the presence of policy\n                    considerations militating in favour of the imposition of a duty of care\n                    (“positive policy considerations”) – it merely requires the\n                    absence of policy considerations militating against the imposition of such a\n                    duty (“negative policy considerations”). We gratefully adopt the\n                    explanation of the difference between the two approaches supplied by\n                    Mark Lunney and Ken Oliphant,Tort Law: Text and\n                        Materials(Oxford University Press, 3rd ed, 2008) (at\n                    p 141): The difference may aptly be characterised as one between an approach that\n                        starts from a presumption of duty, and requires the invocation of policy\n                        factors if the duty is to be negated, and one that starts from a presumption\n                        of no duty, and requires the invocation of policy factors if a new duty is\n                        to be established (seeStovin v Wise[1996] AC 923 at 949, per Lord Hoffmann). Although it has been questioned whether the difference between theSpandeckandCaparoapproaches is truly as stark as the above passage\n                    suggests (see John Murphy,Street on Torts(Oxford University Press, 12th ed, 2007) at pp 43–44), for\n                    present purposes we would merely observe that this difference in approach doesnotmean that courts cannot, under the second\n                    limb of theSpandecktest, have due regard to the\n                    presence of positive policy considerations. While theSpandecktest does not require this, it does not prohibit it\n                    either, for courts may sometimes need to deploy such countervailing positive\n                    policy considerations in order to dismiss spurious negative policy\n                    considerations raised by the defendant (see, for example, the Singapore High\n                    Court decision ofAmutha Valli d/o Krishnan v\n                        Titular Superior of the Redemptorist Fathers in Singapore and\n                        others[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1091, where just such an\n                    exercise was undertaken by Lee Seiu Kin J at [81]). As this court stated inSpandeck(at [85]): The courts must, as far as possible, avoid giving the impression that\n                        there remain “unexpressed motives” behind their finding for or\n                        against a duty. 78     With this preliminary point settled, we turn\n                    now to consider the relevant policy considerations, both negative and positive,\n                    in this appeal. Statutory duty 79     One possible negative policy argument is that\n                    the duties of a site supervisor are clearly set out in s 10 of the Act, and\n                    therefore if (as in this case) the actions of a site supervisor or clerk of\n                    works fall outside the ambit of s 10, this might indicate that the\n                    Legislature did not intend for them to owe any duties in respect of such\n                    actions, and that the courts should not therefore seek to superimpose a common\n                    law duty of care wider than the statutory duty imposed by s 10, which would\n                    (on such reasoning) contradict such legislative intention in the\n                process. 80     Such an argument found favour with the House\n                    of Lords inMurphy v Brentwood District Council[1991] 1 AC 398 (“Murphy”)\n                    at 457, 472, 482, 491–492 and 498, where the House of Lords overruledAnns and others v Merton London Borough\n                        Council[1978] 1 AC 728 (“Anns”) and held that a local authority owed no duty of\n                    care to avoid negligently approving the purchase of houses with defective\n                    foundations, which would thereby cause a purchaser of a house to incur pure\n                    economic loss. A number of their Lordships considered that, in what was\n                    essentially a consumer protection field, the precise extent and limits that\n                    should be imposed on builders and local authorities in the public interest was\n                    best dealt with by the Legislature and not the courts. As the UK Parliament had\n                    seen fit to enact the Defective Premises Act 1972 (c 35) (“the UK\n                    DPA 1972”), which imposed on builders a liability falling short of\n                    that imposed byAnns, there was no policy reason\n                    for the courts to impose a higher common law duty on builders or local\n                    authorities. 81     On closer scrutiny, however, the argument\n                    based on s 10 of the Act is not, in our view, strong enough to prevent the\n                    imposition of a duty of care on the Respondent. First, the preamble to the UK\n                    DPA 1972 states quite clearly that it is: An Act toimpose dutiesin connection with\n                        the provision of dwellings and otherwise toamend the\n                            lawof England and Wales as to liability for injury or damage\n                        caused to persons through defects in the state of premises. [emphasis\n                        added] Further, s 1 of the UK DPA 1972 sets out in fairly substantial\n                    detail the persons to whom the duty is owed (s 1(1)(a) and (b)); the nature of the\n                    duty (s 1(1)); how the duty may be discharged (s 1(2) and (3)); and\n                    the persons on whom the duty is imposed (s 1(1) and (4)). In contrast,\n                    s 10 of the Act does not obviously create a private cause of action that\n                    sounds in damages (see[24]above). It would\n                    appear that a breach of s 10 of the Act results instead in purely criminal\n                    sanctions under sub-sections (7) to (9). In such circumstances, and given\n                    the rather general terms in which s 10 of the Act is phrased, it is\n                    unlikely that the Legislature had intended, when enacting s 10, to preclude\n                    common law civil remedies against negligent site supervisors or clerks of works.\n                    Second, the fact that the Act does not cover a particular situation is equally,\n                    if not more, consistent with the possibility that there is a lacuna in the law\n                    the courts should remedy, as opposed to the possibility that the Legislature\n                    intended for such a situation to be completely unregulated by the common law.\n                    Indeed, nothing in the debates during the Second Reading of the Building Control\n                    Bill indicates that the Legislature intended there not to be a civil remedy\n                    against negligent site supervisors (seeSingapore\n                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(16 February 1989)\n                    vol 52 at cols 668–686). Third, the question of what common law\n                    duties a clerk of works owes is not merely one of “consumer\n                    protection”, but is also one of public safety, especially in the local\n                    context, where construction takes place on an ongoing basis. In the field of\n                    public and workplace safety, there is no reason why the courts should not be\n                    astute to introduce minimum standards of skill and care via the tort of\n                    negligence. 82     For all these reasons, we consider thatMurphymay be distinguished, and that\n                    s 10 of the Act, in itself, is not inconsistent with the Respondent owing\n                    the Appellant a duty of care at common law. Lifting of the corporate veil 83     The Respondent also argues that the imposition\n                    of a duty of care in this case would in effect amount to an unwarranted lifting\n                    of the corporate veil. 84     This would only be true, however, if the\n                    Respondent was being sued for the tortious acts or omissions of A.n.A, rather\n                    than for his own tort (see, for example, the House of Lords decision ofStandard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping\n                        Corpn and others (Nos 2 and 4)[2003] 1 AC 959 at\n                    [22] (perLord Hoffmann) and [40] (perLord Rodger)). AsCompany\n                        Directors: Duties, Liabilities and Remedies(Simon Mortimore\n                    ed) (Oxford University Press, 2009) states (at para 27.22): A director is personally liable for his own torts committed in relation to\n                        the company’s affairs, whilst acting as a director or employee of the\n                        company. In such circumstances the company will also be vicariously liable\n                        for the director’s torts. In other words, the corporate veil argument depends on the Respondent\n                    acting as A.n.A, rather than as its employee or agent (or indeed in a personal\n                    capacity). On the facts of the present appeal, however, the Respondent’s\n                    liability is not predicated on any corporate actsquaorgan of A.n.A, but on his personal actsquaclerk of works (albeit therefore as an employee of A.n.A\n                    (see above at[5])). If all the elements of\n                    the tort of negligence can be established against the Respondent, he will be\n                    personally liable, and the fact that he is also a director of a company is\n                    irrelevant to his personal liability, although it may be relevant to the\n                    company’s vicarious liability, depending on whether (as here) the tort was\n                    committed in the director’s course of employment. 85     In the circumstances, therefore, the separate\n                    legal personality of A.n.A is irrelevant, and a duty of care cannot be denied on\n                    that ground. Conflicts of interest 86     One final positive policy consideration that\n                    pointsin favour ofthe imposition of a duty of\n                    care, and which merits special notice on the specific facts of this appeal, is\n                    the lack of checks and balances arising out of the Respondent’s conflicts\n                    of interest. 87     We have already adverted to the\n                    Respondent’s dual position as director of A.n.A and clerk of works (see\n                    above at[4],[63]and[64]), which would\n                    inevitably have compromised his ability to scrutinise the work of A.n.A and act\n                    in the Appellant’s interest (as he ought to have done as clerk of works).\n                    Not for nothing, after all, has the virtue of “integrity” been\n                    considered a core attribute of a clerk of works (see[41]above). Clerks of works should not be allowed to flout the\n                    system of checks and balances envisioned by the Act, to the detriment of their\n                    clients, without the latter having some form of recourse. Conclusion on duty of care 88     For all these reasons, theSpandecktest is satisfied, and we are of the view that the\n                    Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care at common law.",
        "Whether the Respondent breached his duty of care to the\n                Appellant": "89     Given that the Respondent was under a common\n                    law duty of care to the Appellant, it is necessary to consider whether, on the\n                    facts, this duty was breached. This raises, in turn, the issue as to what thescopeof that duty is, for, if the duty does\n                    not even include or encompass the matters complained of, then there is no duty\n                    to breach. This will obviously depend heavily on the specific fact situation of\n                    each case and will include such factors as the contractual duties, if any, that\n                    the clerk of works concerned has undertaken. 90     On the facts of the present appeal, it is\n                    clear, in our views, that,quaclerk of works, the\n                    Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care to supervise the backfilling works,\n                    which was undoubtedly an operational matter under the responsibility of the\n                    Respondent. This is because, as originally agreed, the levelling of the land was\n                    to be a relatively minor part of the contract, and was the product of\n                    negotiations and agreement between the Appellant and A.n.A, without any\n                    architectural input whatever. Although it is a question of fact in each case\n                    whether a matter is one of operation, as opposed to design, it is quite\n                    impossible to regard the backfilling in this case as a design element, unlike\n                    the concreting inTrollopeor the tiling works inSetron, especially when, as matters\n                    subsequently transpired, the backfilling operation was an unauthorised adventure\n                    on the part of A.n.A (see further at[93]below). 91     Also, as this court held inJSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)[2007]\n                    4 SLR(R) 460 (at [69]), in determining whether there has been a breach\n                    of a duty of care, the standard of reasonable care is to be objectively assessed\n                    on the basis of knowledge then reasonably available. 92     Although the Respondent attempted to draw a\n                    sharp distinction between what he knew in his capacity as director of A.n.A, and\n                    what he knew as clerk of works, we regard this distinction as somewhat unreal.\n                    This sort of approach has been rejected in the context of directors’\n                    fiduciary duties (see, for example, the English High Court decision ofIndustrial Development Consultants v Cooley Ltd. [1972]\n                    1 WLR 443 at 451 and the English Court of Appeal decision ofMohan Singh Bhullar & ors v Inderjit Singh\n                        Bhullar & anor[2003] EWCA Civ 424 at\n                    [41]), and we see no reason to adopt it in the context of the common law duties\n                    of a clerk of works. 93     Consequently, the knowledge reasonably\n                    available to the Respondentquaclerk of works was\n                    also the knowledge available to himquadirector\n                    of A.n.A, which included the following matters: (a)     As the site was not level, the\n                        Appellant’s contract with A.n.A envisioned that A.n.A was to level the\n                        land (see the Judgment at [16]) by using surplus earth from the higher-lying\n                        areas to raise the lower-lying areas (see the Judgment at [3]–[4]).\n                        The levelling operation was therefore supposed to be a\n                        “self-contained” job, involving no external\n                    elements. (b)     Instead,\n                        A.n.A departed from the terms of the agreement by engaging Lok Sheng to\n                        truck in backfill material consisting of wet soil and wood chips from\n                        off-site to raise the lower-lying areas of the site (see the Judgment at\n                        [17]). (c)     A.n.A\n                        did not know if Lok Sheng had any special qualifications in the area of\n                        earthworks (see the Judgment at [17]). During the course of the trial, it\n                        emerged that Lok Sheng’s principal business activities consisted of\n                        “construction and engineering” and “freight transport\n                        by road” – a far cry from the “specialist” in\n                        earthworks it was asserted to be by both A.n.A and the Respondent in their\n                        pleadings and affidavits. In addition, as the Judge observed, Lok Sheng was\n                        “a one-man operation” (see the Judgment at\n                    [17]). (d)     In the\n                        contract between A.n.A and Lok Sheng under which Lok Sheng was to supply the\n                        soil and wood chips as backfill material, there were no specifications\n                        regarding the type and/or quality of soil and wood chips to be provided. The\n                        contract was completely silent as to whether, for example, the wood chips\n                        were to be chemically treated or inert, or whether the soil was to consist\n                        of organic or inorganic material (or both), or whether precautions had been\n                        taken to ensure the absence of contaminants. (e)     A.n.A did not have to pay for the backfill\n                        material (see the Judgment at [17]), and in fact appears to have received\n                        $40,000 in “compensation” from Lok Sheng for transport and\n                        labour costs allegedly incurred by A.n.A in facilitating the supply and\n                        delivery by Lok Sheng of the wood chips. Whether A.n.A actually incurred any\n                        such costs is open to question, given the testimony of Choo Kong Leong\n                        (A.n.A’s project manager), that there were in factnoextra costs incurred in bringing in the backfill\n                        material. In any event, even if any such costs had been incurred, the fact\n                        of the matter is that A.n.A received the backfill material from Lok Sheng\n                        for free (see the Judgment at [17]). Indeed, under these circumstances, the\n                        Respondent ought, in our view, to have realised that something was amiss\n                        – particularly having regard to the dubious circumstances under which\n                        the wood chips were brought onto the site and used as backfill material. It\n                        bears repeating that these circumstances resulted in A.n.A being able to\n                        level the land with at minimal or no cost, utilising material (here, wood\n                        chips) which Lok Sheng was only too eager to offload free-of-charge. Indeed,\n                        as we have already noted, Lok Sheng appears to have paid $40,000 in\n                        “compensation” to A.n.A as well. 94     Given the circumstances set out above, a\n                    reasonably competent and prudent clerk of works, knowing of all these matters,\n                    would have taken special care and redoubled his efforts in supervising the\n                    backfilling and checking that the backfill material used by Lok Sheng was\n                    suitable. At the very least, he would have informed the QPs (and, more\n                    importantly, the Appellant) that A.n.A was backfilling the site in a manner not\n                    contemplated by the contract (see[93]above), as well as of all the other matters in the preceding paragraph. In\n                    short, it was the Respondent’s duty, as clerk of works, to act in a manner\n                    which was contrary to his interests as director of A.n.A. 95     The Respondent, however, did none of these\n                    things. There is no evidence that he took any steps to ensure that the wood\n                    chips were safe backfill material and would not contaminate the site, nor is\n                    there evidence that the QPs had been informed of the backfilling. Indeed, the\n                    Respondent himself admitted in cross-examination that, had the QE been informed\n                    of the backfilling, the QE would have applied for a permit from the Urban\n                    Redevelopment Authority (“URA”), as the backfilling involved a\n                    land area of more than 2,000m2and a change in the\n                    level of the land of more than 1.5m relative to the neighbouring land, and\n                    Condition 10 of the “Permit to Carry Out Structural Works”\n                    granted by the BCA to the Appellant required: A separate planning permission … from the Chief Planner, URA for\n                        earthworks at a remote site if the works for which this permit is granted\n                        also involve: (a) the borrowing or filling of earth at the remote site; and (b) such borrowing/filling of earth at the remote site involves a land\n                        area of more than 2,000m2or a change in level of\n                        land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the site relative to the neighbouring\n                        land. It is not disputed that, notwithstanding this requirement, no planning\n                    permission was applied for prior to the commencement of the\n                backfilling. 96     It should be added that, throughout this\n                    entire unhappy affair (ie, both before and during\n                    the trial, as well as at the hearing of the present appeal), the Respondent has\n                    repeatedly prevaricated and changed his story with regard to the provenance of\n                    the wood chips, attempting to suggest that they had been used on the access way\n                    of the site to provide traction for vehicles entering and leaving the site, and\n                    had been “accidentally buried” when they should have been removed\n                    at the end of the project (see, for example, the Judgment at [18]). These\n                    blatant attempts at evasion and dissemblance lead to the inevitable inference\n                    that the Respondent knew full well that A.n.A had no authorisation from the\n                    Appellant to use the wood chips as backfill, and was going to all possible\n                    lengths to hide the fact that A.n.A had gone off on a frolic of its own in\n                    engaging Lok Sheng to backfill the site. 97     In the circumstances, by reason of his failure\n                    to supervise the backfilling operation and to report it to the QPs, the\n                    Respondent was in breach of his duty of care to the Appellant.",
        "Causation and remoteness": "98     It is clear that, but for the\n                    Respondent’s negligence, the Appellant would not have suffered the loss it\n                    has. Had proper supervision been observed, it is more likely than not that soil\n                    and wood chips would not have been used as the backfill material. More\n                    importantly, had the QPs (or the Appellant) been informed of the unauthorised\n                    backfilling, they would very likely have put a stop to it. In addition, they\n                    would have applied for the necessary permit from the URA; and if that had been\n                    done, it is unlikely that the URA would have granted the permit in the absence\n                    of the SLA’s consent, and the SLA would not have consented because\n                    cl 6.11 of the Tenancy Agreement between the Appellant and the SLA obliged\n                    the former “[n]ot to dispose earth, debris or any other material”\n                    on the site. 99     With regard to the issue of remoteness, we do\n                    not consider the Appellant’s loss too remote for the purposes of the\n                    Respondent’s liability in negligence. The test for remoteness of damage in\n                    the tort of negligence is that of “reasonable foreseeability”,ie, a tortfeasor is liable only for damage of\n                    a kind which a reasonable man should have foreseen (see the leading Privy\n                    Council decision ofOverseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts\n                        Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)[1961] AC 388, as well as the decisions of this court inHo Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank[2007]\n                    2 SLR(R) 181 at [39] andSunny\n                        Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 at [56]). It was perfectly foreseeable that, if\n                    reasonable care was not taken by the Respondent in supervising the backfilling,\n                    ensuring that the backfill material was suitable and reporting the backfilling\n                    to the QPs, pure economic loss would have been caused to the Appellant in having\n                    to demolish any structures resting on the affected areas in order to excavate\n                    and replace the backfill. 100    Quite apart from this, as a result of the\n                    Respondent’s negligence, the Appellant has had to suffer the unnecessary\n                    stress and inconvenience of having to deal with a number of government agencies\n                    regarding the environmental damage from the contaminated backfill, delay the\n                    opening of the shelter and the commencement of the good work the shelter was\n                    intended for, as well as put up with the unsightly and noxious effluence being\n                    discharged from the site. While these may not be legally recoverable losses, it\n                    is a testament to the fortitude and determination of the Appellant’s staff\n                    that they were not deterred by these numerous setbacks.",
        "Defences": "101    We did not hear any argument on this issue,\n                    but we are of the view that the Respondent cannot avail himself of any defences\n                    to the Appellant’s claim in negligence. 102    As we observed at[90]above, we regard the backfilling as an operational matter\n                    falling under the supervisory responsibility of the clerk of works. The QPs were\n                    entitled to expect the Respondent to carry out his duties diligently and to keep\n                    them informed if for some reason their attention was required on site. That\n                    being so, we do not think it can be said that the QPs have, in this case, been\n                    guilty of contributory negligence.",
        "Conclusion": "103    For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude\n                    that the Respondent was in breach of his duty of care to the Appellant, and\n                    that, by reason of his negligence, he caused the Appellant to suffer pure\n                    economic loss. The Appellant’s appeal is therefore allowed with costs and\n                    with the usual consequential orders. The damages to be awarded to the Appellant\n                    are to be assessed by the Registrar."
