        "Procedural History": "2       The appeal was filed in the following\n                    circumstances. On 2 March 2012, the respondent filed Originating Summons\n                    No 196 of 2012 (“OS 196/2012”) under O 53 of the\n                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of\n                    Court”) for leave to bring the said judicial review proceedings for the\n                    following orders: (a)     declarations that “the Prime\n                        Minister does not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether to announce\n                        by-elections in Hougang Single Member Constituency\n                        (“SMC”)” and “the Prime Minister does not have\n                        unfettered discretion to decide when to announce by-elections in Hougang SMC\n                        and must do so within three months or within such reasonable time as [the]\n                        Court deems fit”; and (b)     a mandatory order enjoining the Prime Minister to\n                        (i) “advise the President to issue a Writ of Election mandating\n                        by-elections in Hougang SMC pursuant to Article 49(1) of the\n                        Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed Sing) and\n                        Section 24(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap 218, 2011\n                        Rev Ed)” and (ii) “tender such advice … within\n                        three months or within such reasonable time as [the] Court deems\n                        fit”. 3       On 3 April 2012, the Judge granted leave\n                    for the respondent to proceed with her substantive application (“the\n                    Leave Order”). On 4 April 2012, the appellant filed a Notice of\n                    Appeal against the Leave Order (registered as Civil Appeal No 35 of 2012\n                    (“CA 35/2012”)) and also Summons No 1676 of 2012\n                    (“SUM 1676/2012”) for the hearing of the appeal to be\n                    expedited. 4       On 5 April 2012 (“the 5 April\n                    hearing”), the parties attended before a Judge of Appeal for the hearing\n                    of SUM 1676/2012 and the respondent’s counsel, Mr M Ravi\n                    (“Mr Ravi”), argued that CA 35/2012 could only be heard after\n                    the Judge had issued his grounds of decision for OS 196/2012 (“the\n                    GD”). The Judge of Appeal adjourned the matter until after the Judge had\n                    issued the GD. 5       The GD was issued on 9 April 2012 (seeVellama d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General[2012] 2 SLR 1033) and parties attended before the Judge of Appeal on\n                    12 April 2012. Mr Ravi raised the preliminary objection that the\n                    Notice of Appeal was improperly filed as the appellant had not obtained leave to\n                    appeal from the Judge. The Judge of Appeal did not rule on the preliminary\n                    objection on the ground that the proper procedure was for the respondent to take\n                    out a separate application to strike out the Notice of Appeal. Accordingly, the\n                    Judge of Appeal made an order for the hearing of CA 35/2012 to be expedited\n                    and heard in the week of 14 May 2012. The hearing of CA 35/2012 was\n                    subsequently fixed for hearing on 16 May 2012. 6       On 13 April 2012, the respondent filed\n                    Summons No 1817 of 2012 (“SUM 1817/2012”) to strike out\n                    the Notice of Appeal on the ground that no leave had been obtained from the\n                    Judge to appeal against the Judge’s decision in\n                OS 196/2012. 7       On 9 May 2012, the President, upon the\n                    advice of the Prime Minister, issued the Writ of Election for the Single Member\n                    Constituency of Hougang (“the Hougang SMC”). On the same day, the\n                    Elections Department of the Prime Minister’s Office issued a press release\n                    announcing that 16 May 2012 would be Nomination Day and that Polling Day\n                    would be 26 May 2012 if more than one candidate stood nominated for the\n                    Hougang SMC by-election at the close of nominations on Nomination\n                Day. 8       On 11 May 2012, the respondent offered by\n                    way of letter (“the conditional offer”) to the appellant to\n                    withdraw her proceedings for judicial review under OS 196/2012, and\n                    SUM 1817/2012, on the conditions that: (a)     the appellant withdraws\n                        CA 35/2012; and (b)     the appellant does not seek any costs against the\n                    respondent. 9       On 12 May 2012, the appellant was quoted in\n                    a Straits Times news report as having stated,inter\n                        alia, that the proceedings were ill-conceived and that if the\n                    proceedings continued, the respondent would risk being penalised in costs. On\n                    13 May 2012, the respondent rescinded the conditional offer. 10     On 14 May 2012, the appellant informed\n                    the Court of Appeal and the respondent by letter that the appellant would be\n                    withdrawing the appeal against the Leave Order at the hearing on 16 May\n                    2012. 11     At the hearing before us on 16 May 2012,\n                    counsel for the appellant, Mr David Chong SC\n                    (“Mr Chong SC”), made an oral application to withdraw\n                    his appeal on the basis that the Writ of Election had been issued and therefore\n                    the matter was effectively academic, and that no costs should be ordered against\n                    the appellant. It was contended that the respondent was not entitled to costs,\n                    and that the proper order should be that each party should bear her or his own\n                    costs. We allowed the application to withdraw the appeal against the Leave\n                    Order, with the consequence that SUM 1817/2012 was deemed to be withdrawn.\n                    The respondent did not object to the withdrawal of the appeal but contended that\n                    she be paid for costs thrown away. 12     We reserved judgment on the issue until after\n                    the substantive hearing under OS 196/2012 was heard and decided. The\n                    substantive hearing under OS 196/2012 was eventually heard by the Judge\n                    under Summons No 2639 of 2012 (“SUM 2639/2012”) which\n                    the respondent filed on 29 May 2012 in accordance with O 53\n                        r 2(1)(a) of the Rules of\n                Court. 13     On 1 August 2012, the Judge gave judgment\n                    for the substantive hearing under OS 196/2012 (ie, SUM 2639/2012) and dismissed the respondent’s\n                    application. The Judge adjourned the hearing for costs to be determined in due\n                    course. The Judge heard parties’ submissions on costs on 8 and\n                    16 October 2012 and issued his decision on 1 November 2012 inVellama d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General[2012] SGHC 221.",
        "Costs of this appeal": "14     Under s 29 of the Government Proceedings\n                    Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed), the court has power to order costs for or against\n                    the Government or the public officer in the same manner and upon the same\n                    principles as in proceedings between private persons. Costs are governed by O 59\n                    of the Rules of Court. Order 59 r 3(2) states as follows: If the Court in the exercise of its discretion sees fit to make any order\n                        as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings, the Courtshall,subject to this Order,\n                            order the costs to follow the event, exceptwhen it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the\n                            case some other order should be madeas to the whole or any\n                        part of the costs. [emphasis added] 15     The general rule is that costs follow the\n                    event, but that rule applies only if the court in exercise of its discretion\n                    sees fit to make any order of or incidental to the proceedings. The question in\n                    this appeal is whether in the circumstances of this case, the court should make\n                    an order of costs in the proceedings. 16     In our view, the circumstances of this case do\n                    not justify this court in making a costs order. On 14 May 2012, the\n                    appellant notified the Registrar and the respondent that he would be withdrawing\n                    the appeal against the Leave Order. At the hearing on 16 May 2012\n                    (“the 16 May hearing”), the appellant formally appeared\n                    before this court and applied for leave to withdraw the appeal. We granted leave\n                    to withdraw the appeal. In the circumstances, no costs would have been incurred\n                    by the respondent with respect to any preparation for this\n                hearing. 17     There were no costs thrown away except for the\n                    filing fees incurred by the respondent in filing SUM 1817/2012 on 13 April\n                    2012 to strike out the Notice of Appeal on the ground that no leave had been\n                    obtained from the Judge to appeal against the Judge’s decision in\n                    OS 196/2012. This was an unnecessary application as the objection against\n                    the appellant’s Notice of Appeal could also have been taken at the\n                    16 May hearing as a preliminary point. Further, we are not satisfied the\n                    respondent would have succeeded in SUM 1817/2012, having regard to the\n                    recent decision of the Court of Appeal made on 15 October 2012 inOpennet Pte Ltd v Info-Communications Development Authority of\n                        Singapore(Civil Appeal No  81 of 2012) in relation to the\n                    same procedural objection. 18     In the circumstances, we make no order of\n                    costs in the proceedings before us."
