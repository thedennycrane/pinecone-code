        "Introduction": "1These appeals are very unfortunate. Substantively, they are unfortunate because they are the result of a dramatic breakdown in familial ties – which, as we shall see, has been exacerbated by the fact that the breakdown stretches across more than one generation. On the surface, the breakdown was caused by a dispute over money – in particular, the monies withdrawn by the defendant in Suit No 178 of 2012 (“S 178”), allegedly wrongfully, from the accounts of the six plaintiff companies (“the Companies”). But at a deeper level, the breakdown concerns control over the family’s (material) fate and direction. It is regrettable that differences over what the familyownshave come to so deeply compromise the wholeness of what a familyis; a greater value has been sacrificed in service of a lesser one. 2There is much to regret procedurally as well. In a dispute as large as this one, spanning many decades (and, for that matter, many years of litigation), engaging many issues, and involving large sums of money, it is particularly important that matters of procedure be carefully observed. In particular, the parties’ pleadings play a crucial role in defining the scope of the dispute and the parties’ positions. When parties enlarge the boundaries of a dispute by adducing evidence and making submissions on matters not originally within the scope of the dispute,without amending the pleadings to reflect this, the court is hobbled in its task of seeking the just and correct resolution of the dispute, and confusion can result. Sadly, that is precisely what has happened here. 3Regardless of which party is ultimately held to prevail, one thing is clear – the wishes and hopes of the patriarch of the family will never be fulfilled, at least in their original form. The best that this Court can do is to decide which party or parties are legally entitled to the assets concerned and in what manner that legal entitlement can be enforced. As will become apparent in the course of this judgment, not every issue which was argued and/or decided below is, in our view, an appropriate one to be decided here given the parties involved and the way the cases have been pleaded. Given the long-drawn and acrimonious nature of this litigation (as well as the accompanying emotional and other fallout and stress that it has engendered), it is our hope that the parties will be able to find some other means of attaining closure on the issues which must for now remain unresolved. This is desirable, if nothing else, to honour the memory of the patriarch of the family. 4The judgment of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) is to be found inCompaniaDe Navegacion Palomar, SA and others v Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala and another matter[2017] SGHC 14 (“the Judgment”). It is a meticulous and detailed judgment which sifts through a veritable mountain of both documentary as well as oral evidence and distils much of what is essential. Though we respectfully disagree with the Judge’s conclusions in some crucial respects, we were much aided in our analysis by the clarity with which the Judge laid the foundation by setting out the basic structure and issues, as well as his own analysis, of what was by any account an extremely complex case. Indeed, we agree with many of the Judge’s findings, particularly on the factual level. We mainly differ from the Judge in respect of two broad areas: first, the legal implications that follow from some of the facts, particularly those concerning beneficial ownership, and secondly, the impact of procedural issues such as the state of the pleadings. 5The ultimateeffectof the decision we have arrived at is, in substance, not dissimilar to that arrived at by the Judge. In brief, we find on the main claim that the Companies are the legal owners of the monies, that the defendant’s defence (that he was thefullbeneficial ownerof all the monies) was not made out, and that the monies should therefore be returned to the Companies. We do not agree, however, that the Companies own their assets absolutely; rather, they hold the assets on trust for two other companies, from which the assets were originally transferred for no consideration and not as gifts, and it appears that the defendant, his siblings and his mother’s estate have beneficial interests in these two companies. With that said, the way the parties have pleaded their cases makes it unnecessary for us to make findings as to the precise proportions of the beneficial interests in the two other companies that are the source of the Companies’ assets, nor does this need to be dealt with during the taking of accounts before the Judge subsequent to our judgment. 6Having decided the main claim in that way, the issue of the non-party’s intervention (which is the partial subject matter of one of the appeals and the entire focus of yet another appeal) becomes moot. For general guidance for the future, however, we express our views on the Judge’s order ordering the said intervention. With respect, we are of the view that, on the facts ofthisparticular case, the Judge oughtnotto have ordered the intervention. We elaborate below. 7We also differ from the Judge’s holdings with regard to fraudulent misrepresentation and whether certain correspondence between the parties was covered by without prejudice privilege. In this last-mentioned regard, we should add that the admission of such correspondence did not, in fact, impact the substantive decision of this Court and, to that extent, is a damp squib. 8We will begin by setting out the salient facts of the case, as well as the Judge’s decision, so as to set the context for the present appeals, Civil Appeals Nos 34, 35, 59 and 60 of 2017 (“CA 34”, “CA 35”, “CA 59” and “CA 60”, respectively).",
        "Facts": "",
        "Parties": "9S 178 is a dispute between two main factions of the De La Sala family over assets held by the Companies, which are: (a) The first plaintiff, Compañia De Navegación Palomar SA (“PAL”), a Panamanian company incorporated in 1958 as a subsidiary of JMC; (b) The second plaintiff, Cosmopolitan Finance Corporation (“CFC”), a British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) company incorporated in 1995; (c) The third plaintiff, Dominion Corporation SA (“DOM”), a Panamanian company incorporated in 1973, owned by Summit Finance Corporation SA (“Summit Corp”), which is in turn owned by PAL; (d) The fourth plaintiff, John Manners & Co (Malaya) Ltd (“JMM”), a Singapore company incorporated in 1948 owned by Cambay Prince Steamship Co Ltd (BVI) (“Cambay BVI”), which is in turn owned by the fifth plaintiff, PEN Peninsula Navigation Company Private Limited (“PEN”), a BVI company incorporated in 1995; and (e) The sixth plaintiff, Straits Marine Company Private Limited (“SMC”), a BVI company which is also owned by PEN. It was incorporated in 2008. 10The Companies collectively held assets (including but not limited to cash, shares of other companies and bonds) worth over US$584m in 2012. According to the Companies’ Statement of Claim, while the Companies used to be in the business of, among others, “shipping, marine engineering and supplies”, the Companies’ present activities are confined to “the holding and management of various investment assets (comprising principally cash, gold and shareholdings)”. Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala (“Ernest”), the defendant in S 178, also described the Companies as “holding vehicles with no day-to-day trading or operations except for any minor business that [JMM] may have had” in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”). It should be noted that CFC owns all the shares in PEN, PEN owns all the shares in PAL, and PAL owns all the shares in CFC. CFC, PEN, and PAL are organised in an “orphan” or circular structure, which is legal under Panamanian and BVI law but not under Singapore law. We will refer to CFC, PEN and PAL collectively as “the Orphan Companies”. The structure that they exist in will be referred to as “the Orphan Structure”. 11The Judgment sets out the relationships in the De La Sala family in great detail (at [7]–[14]). Since many of these background facts are not disputed and not material for the purposes of the present appeals, we will not repeat them except to introduce the key members of the family who are involved in the present state of affairs: (a) Robert Perez De La Sala Sr (“Robert Sr”) and Camila Vasquez De La Sala (“Camila”) were the patriarch and matriarch of the De La Sala family before their deaths in 1967 and 2005, respectively. Camila was the sole beneficiary of Robert Sr’s will. Robert Sr was the reason for the family’s tremendous wealth as he was a successful self-made businessman. He rose to become the chairman and majority shareholder of the shipping company John Manners and Company Limited (Hong Kong) (“JMC”), which was to be one of the key assets of the De La Sala family. Robert Sr also incorporated Lasala Investments Limited (“LIL”) in 1939, which was an investment company under his control. LIL was renamed North Enterprises Limited (“NEL”) some time after June 1959. In his later years, Robert Sr was preoccupied with reducing his exposure to estate duty as evidenced by his correspondence with his sons prior to his death. By the time of Robert Sr’s death, he had long divested himself of his shareholdings in JMC and NEL, which held much of his wealth. (b) Robert Sr and Camila had four children in the following order: Jerome Anthony Perez De La Sala (“Tony”), Ernest, Robert Perez De La Sala (“Bobby”) and Isabel Brenda Koutsos (“Isabel”). Camila and the four children were known collectively as “JERIC”. We will refer to Camila, Bobby, Isabel and Tony as “JRIC”. Ernest, apparently the most commercially astute of the four children, took over the management of the family’s business interests and assets after the death of Robert Sr, and was thede factohead of the De La Sala family after Camila’s passing. Ernest was the one who was responsible for heavily restructuring the family’s business interests and assets after Robert Sr’s death. Asde factohead of the family, he was based outside of Australia, unlike the rest of the family, for tax planning purposes, and disbursed funds to the rest of the family regularly. Ernest was married to Hannelore de Lasala-Debring (“Hannelore”), but they were divorced in May 1970. Hannelore gave evidence in S 178 and independently brought fresh proceedings in HCMP 1029/2013 against Ernest in Hong Kong (“the Hong Kong proceedings”) on the basis that he had misrepresented to her during the divorce proceedings that a very large part of his assets were family assets held by him on trust. Ernest’s witness statements in the Hong Kong proceedings are the subject of some summonses filed in these appeals (see [71] below). (c) Edward De La Sala (“Edward”) and Christina De La Sala (“Christina”) are Bobby’s children, and the nephew and niece of Ernest. Christina married James Copinger-Symes (“James”). They are the defendants in counterclaim in S 178 and will be referred to collectively as “ECJ”. ECJ came to Singapore in 2004–2005, having allegedly been invited by Ernest to come here to join him in the management of the Companies (and by extension, the De La Sala family’s assets). The nature and effect of Ernest’s representations to ECJ are issues on appeal. 12The directors of the Companies are all members of the De La Sala family. ECJ, Isabel and Ernest are directors of CFC, PEN, PAL, DOM and SMC. ECJ and Ernest are the directors of JMM. Edward and James were also shareholders with 5,000 shares each in SMC, but they purportedly held these shares on trust for PEN pursuant to deeds of trust.",
        "NEL and JMC and subsequent changes in structure": "13The corporate structure of the Companies today is a result of the various rounds of restructuring that have occurred since Ernest took over the reins of the family’s business interests after Robert Sr’s death in 1969. As we have noted above at [11], these business interests were concentrated in NEL and JMC at the time of Robert Sr’s death, and Ernest accepted during cross-examination that his main assets as of 1970 were his shares in JMC and NEL. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that NEL and JMC are in fact the origins of the Companies’ wealth that lies at the heart of the dispute in S 178. 14There also appears to be a third possible source for the Companies’ assets in dispute – a pool of assets called the “Five Stars”, evidenced by the February 1984 Memorandum that traces the value of the assets from 1970 to 1983. It is not clear from the record what “Five Stars” relates to and what has happened to these assets. Since none of the parties have attempted an explanation, we shall not dwell on this point. 15The various parties’ interests in NEL and JMC right after Robert Sr’s death are salient to the dispute in S 178, as Ernest’s claim to the Companies’ assets rests principally on his assertion that he had bought out JRIC’s shares in NEL and JMC after Robert Sr’s death, and that JRIC therefore had no claim to the assets in the Companies. Therefore, we will set out the facts relating to the shareholdings of NEL and JMC. 16It is undisputed that NEL’s shareholders, at the time of Robert Sr’s death, were JERIC in equal shares of 1,200 each (see the Judgment at [113]). On 26 August 1967, except for one share which Ernest retained, all of the 6,000 shares in NEL were transferred to San Roberto Steamship Company SA (“SR”), a nominee company under the control of Ernest. SR was wholly owned by San Miguel Navigation Company SA (“SM”), which was in turn owned by JMC. The reason for JRIC’s transfer of their NEL shares to SR is a matter of dispute – Ernest claimed that he acquired JRIC’s NEL shares using SR, one of his nominee companies, while the Companies and ECJ denied that such a sale ever occurred. 17In so far as JMC is concerned, it is undisputed that at the time of Robert Sr’s death, Ernest had a 37% stake in JMC, while JRIC held a 45% stake in JMC through their nominee company, Overseas Nominees Ltd. Overseas Nominees Ltd’s 45% stake was subsequently transferred to Compass Enterprises Inc (“CE”) on 1 September 1970. This stake in JMC remained with CE until 2011 at least. 18In December 1969, what the Judge termed as “the first orphan structure” was created when JMC sold its shares in SM to CE, which was in turn wholly owned by SR. CE, SM and SR were thus held in a triangular structure, with SR owning all of NEL’s shares except for one held by Ernest. We will continue to refer to this as “the first orphan structure”, in contradistinction to the Orphan Structure which currently exists. The following is a pictorial representation of the first orphan structure: 19The significance of this structure will become clear at [127] below.",
        "Background to the dispute": "20ECJ had, until the breakdown of their relationship with Ernest in August 2011, been working under Ernest’s direction in managing the assets held by the Companies. ECJ claim to have done so on the understanding that the Companies’ assets were part of a De La Sala family trust, while Ernest claims that ECJ were helping him to manage what were ultimately his assets. Ernest and ECJ’s relationship broke down sometime in August 2011, when Ernest instructed ECJ to transfer various US dollar deposits held by PAL, CFC and SMC with UBS (Singapore) and HSBC Singapore to CFC’s account with UBS (Vancouver). Ernest apparently asserted to Edward, for the first time, that the Companies’ assets belonged to Ernest personally. This triggered a series of actions by ECJ to alter Ernest’s role from sole signatory to the Companies’ bank accounts to a joint signatory with Bobby and Isabel, although Ernest’s sole signatory status was reinstated after Bobby and Isabel intervened. Disgruntled with this turn of events, Ernest transferred the assets in the Companies’ bank accounts, worth a total of CAD 663,033,557.61 at the material time, into his personal account with UBS (Canada).",
        "The disputes in S 178": "21As the issues crystallised through the pleadings are important to understanding why we differ from the Judge in respect of certain claims, we set out the parties’ main pleadings in greater detail.",
        "The Companies’ claim": "22The legal basis for the Companies’ claim in S 178 against Ernest is straightforward. The Companies, under the control of the majority directors ECJ, allege that Ernest had breached his director’s duties as he had transferred the Companies’ assets into his personal accounts without notifying or seeking the approval of the respective boards of the Companies. The Companies claim that: (a) On or around 23 August 2011, Ernest gave UBS (Singapore) instructions to transfer approximately S$1,244,308.90 out of JMM’s account to an account in Ernest’s own name, to close JMM’s account, and to retain all mail until further instructions; (b) On September 2011, Ernest gave UBS (Singapore) instructions to close two accounts, one in the name of PAL and the other in the name of CFC. The sums in PAL and CFC’s accounts were likely diverted to Ernest or applied for Ernest’s own benefit; (c) On or around 7 October 2011, Ernest entered his name as transferee on the stock transfer forms of shares in SMC, so as to transfer all of SMC shares to himself. This was despite knowing that James and Edward each held 5,000 shares in SMC on trust for PEN, and had signed the stock transfer forms to facilitate PEN’s dealing with SMC’s shares. Ernest then passed written resolutions as the sole shareholder of SMC on 10 October 2011 to remove ECJ as directors of SMC with immediate effect, and to replace them with a person whom Ernest trusted, Christian Ostenfeld (“Ostenfeld”). 23In terms of relief, the Companies collectively sought a declaration that their assets enumerated in the Schedule to the Statement of Claim (“the Schedule”) “belongbeneficially and absolutelyto the [Companies]” [emphasis added]. They also sought an order for Ernest to disclose to them all the correspondence with the banks in respect of the bank accounts identified in the Schedule, and an order to account to the relevant plaintiff where assets of the relevant plaintiff was found to have been disposed by Ernest. JMM, PAL and CFC also sought an order that Ernest account to each of them for the assets formerly standing to their credit in three accounts with UBS (Singapore), including what had become of the same, what interest had been earned thereon and what profits had been made with these assets, as well as an order that Ernest repay the amounts due after the account. PEN sought a declaration that the purported transfers in 7 October 2011 of the SMC shares previously registered in Edward and James’s names were void and of no effect, or alternatively, for rescission of the said transfers of shares in SMC.",
        "Ernest’s defence and counterclaim": "24Ernest’s defence is also straightforward. He denied any breaches of director’s duties on the basis that the Companies were his “personal investment holding companies used … to hold and invest his personal funds and assets”. 25Ernest first set out the background information explaining the source of what he claimed were his personal funds and assets. He averred that NEL was incorporated by Robert Sr in 1939, and came to own Robert Sr’s shares in JMC. Ernest averred that in or around 1967, he purchased his siblings’ and his mother’s shares in NEL through SR. In August 1969, he incorporated CE, and through CE purchased JRIC’s shares in JMC in 1970. 26Ernest asserted that he was the sole beneficial owner of all the Companies because: (a) He incorporated and/or acquired the Companies for his own use and thereafter exercised full and complete control over them and their assets and “employed them as his nominees or alter ego at all times” and “from time to time at his sole and unfettered discretion”; (b) The Companies were funded by him; (c) He had sole signing rights to the bank accounts of the Companies and was able to transfer monies between these bank accounts at his sole and unfettered discretion; (d) He appointed and removed directors of the Companies at his sole and unfettered discretion and dictated the actions of the directors that he appointed; and (e) He “routinely” dealt with the Companies’ assets as his own without regard to “corporate distinctions”. (f) In 2004, he set up a revocable trust called the REC–Hasta La Vista Trust (“the REC–HLV Trust”) as a settlor, on terms that the funds put into the REC–HLV Trust would include the funds that he had put into the Companies, that he had sole and unfettered discretion to appoint and remove trustees and beneficiaries of this trust, and that he would continue to manage and invest the assets held by this trust. 27Ernest admitted the Companies’ allegations that he had taken various steps to close and transfer monies out of banks accounts in the names of the Companies. However, his defence was that his actions were not wrongful, that all of the assets of the Companies were beneficially owned by him such that the actions taken by him were necessary to protect his assets. Therefore, the Companies were not entitled to the damages and/or relief they sought. Ernest also denied that James and Edward held the 10,000 shares in SMC on trust for PEN, and instead averred that he was the sole and ultimate beneficial owner. 28Pursuant to amendments, Ernest also averred in the alternative that even if the Companies were found to be absolute owners of the assets, he remains the sole and beneficial owner of the Companies’ shares. The basis for this claim is the same as the reasons he gave for asserting sole beneficial ownership over the Companies’ assets, as well as his claims that ECJ had effectively admitted his ownership of the Companies through their actions. Ernest averred that ECJ were appointed directors of CFC, PAL, DOM, PEN, and JMM (save for PEN and CFC, of which Edward was already appointed a director around 1995-1996 on Ernest’s instructions) so as to facilitate ECJ’s assistance to Ernest in the management of his personal assets and funds. 29Ernest’s counterclaims were against the Companies and ECJ. Ernest in his counterclaim averred that ECJ knew of his sole beneficial ownership of the Companies and the Companies’ assets, and owed him fiduciary duties. He catalogued actions by ECJ which he claimed were done with the purpose of taking control of his personal assets. He therefore counterclaimed against ECJ for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duties in failing to comply with his instructions regarding the management of his personal funds and assets, which were held through the Companies, and for procuring the Companies to institute S 178 as well as the applications thereunder. 30Ernest counterclaimed against PAL, CFC and SMC for breach of trust in respect of their refusal to comply with and/or delay in complying with Ernest’s instructions to transfer funds and assets beneficially owned by him to an account held by CFC with UBS (Vancouver), and against ECJ for dishonestly assisting in PAL, CFC and SMC’s said breaches of trust. Ernest also counterclaimed against the Companies for breach of trust by instituting S 178 and the attendant applications against him, as well as against ECJ for their knowing assistance in the Companies’ said breaches. 31Pursuant to amendments, based on the same facts relied upon for his counterclaims of breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duties, dishonest and/or knowing assistance, Ernest also counterclaimed against ECJ for conspiring to injure himvialawful means and/or unlawful means. 32In terms of relief, Ernest sought, among others: (a) A declaration that he is the sole beneficial shareholder of the Companies, or in the alternative, of the Orphan Companies; (b) A declaration that he is entitled to exercise all shareholder rights of the Companies, or in the alternative, of the Orphan Companies; (c) A declaration that the assets of the Companies are, and were at all material times, beneficially owned by him, and that the Companies hold the assets on trust solely for him; (d) Damages for ECJ’s breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duties, dishonest assistance, and/or conspiracy to injure; (e) A declaration that the shareholder resolutions of SMC passed on 10 October 2011 were valid; and (f) An order that ECJ execute and deliver to Ernest letters of resignation from the boards of the Companies.",
        "The Companies’ reply and defence to counterclaim": "33The Companies in their reply averred that Ernest’s defence that he was the sole beneficial owner of the shares and/or assets of the Companies was no answer to the fact that the Companies’ assets did not belong to the (legal or beneficial) shareholders of the Companies as a matter of law, and that even if the Companies’ assets were held on trust for Ernest, the assets still had to be handled by the Companies as trustees. Therefore, Ernest was “not entitled in any event to deal with or dispose of the assets without the approval of the [Companies]”. 34The Companies denied Ernest’s claim to sole beneficial ownership of the Companies’ shares and assets in any event. This denial was premised on the Companies’ denial of Ernest’s claim that he had bought out JRIC’s shares in NEL, or that he had become the sole beneficial owner of JMC through buying out the previous shareholders. 35The Companies averred that NEL was incorporated to hold Robert Sr’s assets, and that “Robert Sr had transferred all interests in his assets to [NEL] in exchange for shareholding in [NEL]”. The Companies did not dispute that Robert Sr transferred all his shareholdings in NEL to JRIC and Ernest in equal proportions in late 1958. The Companies averred that 5999 NEL shares (beneficially owned by Ernest and JRIC) were transferred to SR shortly after Robert Sr’s death in 1967, and SR was in turn owned by SM. The Companies denied that Ernest bought out JRIC’s shares in NEL and averred that both SR and SM were mere nominees for Ernest and JRIC. The Companies also denied that Ernest bought out JRIC’s interests in JMC, and averred that JRIC held 3600 shares (or 45%) of the shares in JMC through CE. 36The Companies averred that they were each “the legal and/or beneficial owner” of their assets identified in the Schedule, and that even if they were not, Ernest was not the sole beneficial owner of these assets. In the alternative, they averred that the assets were to be managed for the purpose of preserving the De La Sala family’s wealth and not for a single individual. The Companies denied that Ernest dealt with the Companies’ affairs and assets as if they were his own; for instance, Ernest’s powers to operate the Companies’ bank accounts were powers granted by the Companies for the purpose of managing the Companies’ funds and assets on behalf of the Companies. The Companies averred that the REC–HLV Trust was “set up and was a mechanism developed for the purpose of passing the assets and/or funds to future generations of the De La Sala family”. 37The Companies denied Ernest’s counterclaims for breach of fiduciary duties and/or breach of trust. The Companies averred that they were fully entitled to commence S 178 so as to protect their assets, and even if they held the assets on trust for Ernest in whole or in part, the Companies were still entitled to act as they did. The Companies also averred that they were not obliged to comply with Ernest’s instructions as to how to invest the Companies’ assets, as the assets belonged to the Companies legally and/or beneficially.",
        "ECJ’s defence and counterclaim": "38ECJ’s defence to Ernest’s counterclaim was where the distinction between the ownership of the Companies, and the ownership of the Companies’ assets, was initially mentioned. 39ECJ denied all of Ernest’s counterclaims. ECJ’s case, simply put, was that they were actingbona fidein the belief that the Companies were beneficially owned by JERIC and the descendants of Robert Sr, pursuant to a family trust established by Robert Sr. ECJ averred that even if there was no family trust established by Robert Sr, the beneficial ownership of the Companies did not belong solely to Ernest but to JERIC and Robert Sr’s descendants, or, alternatively, JERIC. 40In so far as the ownership of the Companies’ assets was concerned, ECJ averred that, at all times, ECJ did not believe that Ernest was the beneficial owner of the Companies’ assets, as they believed that the Companies were the legal and beneficial owner of their assets. Even if their belief was not true, JERIC and/or the descendants of Robert Sr were the beneficial owners of those assets, not Ernest alone. ECJ also took the position that even if some of the Companies’ assets were held on trust for Ernest or for others, the assets should still be handled by the Companies as trustees. Ernest was not entitled to deal with the Companies’ assets without the approval of the Companies, acting through their respective boards. 41ECJ also counterclaimed against Ernest for fraudulent misrepresentation, in the event that the court found that Ernest was the sole beneficial owner of the Companies and/or its assets. Those pleadings are canvassed in detail at [166] below. ECJ averred that they had relied on Ernest’s misrepresentation and therefore suffered detriment and loss, and hence sought damages as well as interest.",
        "Registrar’s Appeal No 352 of 2014": "42The Judge also dealt with Registrar’s Appeal No 352 of 2014 (“RA 352”) in the Judgement. Ernest obtained leave to appeal against the Judge’s decision in RA 352 on 22 March 2017. This is the subject matter of CA 60. We will set out the salient facts surrounding RA 352, although, as we noted in the introduction, the outcome of this particular appeal is ultimately inconsequential to the main issues in dispute. 43RA 352 was an appeal from the senior assistant registrar’s (“SAR”) decision to allow Ernest’s application to produce as evidence (i) a letter from Mr Ian Winter QC (“Mr Winter”), addressed to Ernest’s lawyer, Mr Harpreet Singh SC, dated 27 November 2013 (“the IW Letter”); and (ii) a letter from James to Isabel dated 27 November 2013 (“James’s E-mail”). 44The IW Letter was prepared on James’s instructions approximately a month before the parties exchanged AEICs. The IW Letter, which comprised 11 pages and was marked “without prejudice”, was sent on James’s behalf. On the same day, James e-mailed Isabel informing her that he had sent the IW Letter to Ernest. James’s E-mail was to the effect that James was informing Isabel that there was a letter from Mr Winter to Ernest, which could be of interest to her. 45No response was received from Ernest, Isabel, or their lawyers. After almost 10 months, on 3 October 2014, and after most of Ernest’s witnesses had given evidence at trial, Ernest filed a Supplementary List of Documents disclosing James’s E-mail and the IW Letter. This was challenged by ECJ on the basis that they were inadmissible as they constituted “without prejudice” communications. The Judge directed Ernest to file a formal application to affirm the production of the documents (see the Judgment at [485]). Summons No 5023 of 2014 (“SUM 5023”) was filed pursuant to O 24 r 12 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) on 9 October 2014, and the matter was heard by the SAR on 17 October 2014. 46On 20 October 2014, the SAR allowed the production of both documents. Her reasons were, in short, that (i) the IW Letter did not contain any admission against James’s interests and (ii) even if an admission was not necessary, the IW Letter was not written with the genuine purpose of reaching a settlement as it only pointed out alleged weaknesses in Ernest’s case and the consequences of proceeding to trial. 47ECJ then filed RA 352 against the SAR’s decision. The parties agreed that to avoid delays to the trial, they would address RA 352 in the closing submissions for the trial. Ernest was allowed to cross-examine James on the two documents, and ECJ was allowed to call Mr Winter to give evidence in respect of his instructions for the preparation of the IW Letter. The parties were also in agreement that the Judge could refer to the two documents in the context of deciding the issue of admissibility (see the Judgment at [486]).",
        "Decision below": "48Two issues were identified by the Judge as being at the heart of S 178 (see the Judgment at [60]): (a) Whether Robert Sr had set up a family trust before he died; and (b) If not, whether all the assets in the Companies belonged to Ernest. The Judge answered both questions in the negative. Given the many issues engaged in this dispute, it is necessary for us to set out the Judge’s reasoning on the two main issues, as well as the other disputed issues, in some detail.",
        "There was no family trust set up by Robert Sr before his death": "49Although the issue as to whether there was a De La Sala family trust set up by Robert Sr took up a substantial portion of the Judge’s deliberations below, the Judge’s findings in this regard have not been contested on appeal. We will thus summarise the Judge’s findings in this respect briefly (in so far as these findings, such as on the witnesses’ credibility, are relevant to other aspects of this appeal). 50The main witnesses in S 178 were Ernest, Tony, Isabel and Bobby, whom the Judge commented were the only surviving people who knew the truth (at [63] of the Judgment).The Judge was of the view that Ernest, along with Tony and Isabel who testified in line with his position, were not truthful because of their potential exposure to liability to the Australian tax authorities. It should be noted that Tony and Isabel disavowed any interest in the Companies’ assets in dispute at the time of the trial (although they appear to have altered their positions in their affidavits filed on 20 June 2017, which purport to reserve their rights to seek an account of their interests in the assets from Ernest). The Judge found that Bobby, who testified in line with ECJ and the Companies’ positions, was the most reliable witness of the four siblings (at [158]). Bobby, on his part, chose not to bring a claim in the proceedings, but maintained his position that Ernest held the shares and assets of the Companies for the benefit of the De La Sala family and that Ernest had never bought over Bobby’s share of the family’s assets. Bobby’s position was aligned with ECJ’s and so it would appear that he took the view that his interests were adequately protected by his supporting their case. 51The Judge considered the various letters written by Robert Sr to various members of the family prior to his death and found that there was no family trust. While there were letters suggesting that a trust was set up, there were also others, later in time, indicating that there was no such trust or that he had never treated LIL’s assets as such. There was some use of precatory words by Robert Sr, such as “it is my wish”, in describing the management of the family assets (at [95]). The Judge noted that it was odd that other than on one occasion, Robert Sr had never described LIL as a family trust, given how well versed he was with various business and corporate structures (at [133(b)]). On balance, the Judge found that the letters from Robert Sr did not show that a family trust had been created by Robert Sr for all his descendants, nor did they evince an intention to do so (at [137]). 52The Judge found that all the children of Robert Sr knew it was their father’s intent that NEL would remain a guarantee for the well-being of all his descendants, and though Robert Sr did not set up a formal and legal trust, his wishes were known and a corporate structure was in place when he died (at [388]). The Judge was of the view (at [124]) that if Robert Sr did not institute a family trust as ECJ claimed, then the transfer of the NEL (then named LIL) shares from Robert Sr to JERIC would have resulted in the full legal and beneficial ownership of NEL being transferred to JERIC.",
        "Ernest was not the sole beneficial owner": "53The Judge was of the view that contrary to Ernest’s claims, there was no documentary evidence of Ernest having bought out the shares of JRIC in NEL and JMC (at [393]), and Ernest’s claim was in fact contradicted by documentary evidence and tape recordings. 54Ernest’s final position regarding JRIC’s shares in NEL and JMC was that he had bought out JRIC’s shares in NEL and JMC through SR and CE, respectively, but had not paid them at the time of purchase,ie, in August 1967 and September 1970, respectively. Instead, he had paid the purchase price over time out of dividends that were declared by NEL and JMC subsequently. He termed this “vendor financing”. Ernest claimed that Tony and Bobby were fully paid the sums owed to them by 1987, evidenced by a memorandum of 6 April 1987 (“the 1987 Memo”) signed by Bobby, Tony and Ernest describing “Five Stars” as “alias ‘JERIC’” and stating that Tony and Bobby’s shares of the assets of “Five Stars” had been distributed to them in cash. Camila was said to have been paid her proceeds by the time of her death in 2005. Ernest also explained for the first time in his AEIC that JRIC had sold their shares to him because they had no experience in the shipping business and had not wanted to be subject to the vagaries and risks of the shipping business (at [184]). The Judge took the view that this explanation was contradictory; it was difficult to understand why JRIC would be willing to be paid out of dividends from NEL and JMC if the point of their purported sale was so that they would not be subject to the risks of the business that NEL and JMC were in. 55The Judge noted the number of changes in Ernest’s claims regarding how he acquired JRIC’s shares in NEL and JMC without explanation, the lack of documentary evidence supporting Ernest’s case, and took the view that Ernest was a “totally unreliable” witness (at [192] and [234]). 56In particular, the Judge noted the following pieces of objective evidence: (a) Ernest had sent documents, letters, micro-cassettes regarding the 20% shares that JRIC had in the funds and business ventures that Ernest managed, and large sums of money to his siblings and their children (at [195]) (b) Ernest’s evidence in two unrelated proceedings prior to this dispute directly contradicted his current case. In his divorce proceedings from Hannelore, he had said that he was merely the custodian of the family wealth (at [201]). He disputed Hannelore’s allegation that all of JERIC’s shareholdings in NEL was transferred to SR for US$10m (at [213]). Ernest made similar statements in proceedings brought in Alaska by Bertram Stanley Mitford, the trusted accountant of JMC, against Ernest and 22 companies seeking to enforce certain terms of his employment (“the Mitford Alaska proceedings”). In these proceedings, in a deposition taken in 1984, Ernest stated on oath that he was the trustee of family assets (at [224]), and denied personal ownership of any of the companies including JMC and its subsidiaries, NEL, SR, SM, and CE (at [233]). (c) A journal voucher of SM dated 27 January 1977, from which the Judge inferred that CE continued to hold a 45% stake in JMC on behalf of JRIC (at [231]–[232]). (d) In so far as the 1987 Memo was concerned, the Judge was of the view that it did not show any connection to JRIC’s alleged sale of NEL and JMC shares to Ernest, and hence was not probative of Ernest’s claim that Tony and Bobby had received the sale proceeds due to them from their sale of NEL and JMC (at [440]). In any event, it appeared that Bobby and his children had continued to receive large sums of money from Ernest from 1989–2008 (at [442]). (e) A memorandum dated 31 July 2006 from Edward and James to Ernest, recording that Ernest tasked them to suggest ways of “passing on the baton” and maintaining the current “critical mass” to provide for future generations (at [461]). (f) The REC–HLV Trust was more consistent with ECJ’s case that Ernest was managing assets on behalf of the family. There was an e-mail from Ernest which suggested that some of Camila’s assets were held within the REC–HLV Trust (at [456]), and it was not apparent that the Companies’ assets were all held within the REC–HLV Trust either. Other than Edward’s evidence that the REC–HLV Trust was settled with a nominal sum of S$5m, and the trust document indicating that only US$10 was settled under the trust (though further property and investments could be added to the trust fund at any time (see cl 1(k)(ii)), there was no other evidence of how much money was placed into the REC–HLV Trust. The correspondence with the bank leading up to the revocation of the REC–HLV Trust on 25 June 2009 also suggested that Ernest’s concern was that the Companies and its assets should be preserved and grown for future generations of the De La Sala family (at [460]). (g) The memorandum accompanying Ernest’s final (but ultimately unexecuted) draft of the trust or settlement termed the Safe Straits Settlement (“SSS”), which spoke of the De La Sala family’s legacy and Ernest working to preserve it (at [462]). 57The Judge also did not believe the testimony of Ernest’s witnesses, Tony and Isabel. He was of the view that Isabel was not an independent witness since she was the sole beneficiary of Ernest’s will and was financially provided for by Ernest. He was also of the view that Tony’s evidence was affected by witness coaching, especially due to the discovery of exhibit D3, a document titled “Possible Questions” (“D3”), which recorded a series of answers to questions which might be asked in cross-examination.",
        "JERIC were to have beneficial interests in SM, CE and SR": "58The Judge formed the view that the members of JERIC were intended to have an equal interest in SM, based on a memorandum of 15 December 1967 by Ernest (“the 1967 Memo”), the minutes of CE from 22 December 1969 (“the 1969 CE Minutes”) and an undated note entitled “San Miguel Navigation Co S.A.” (“the Mitford Note”) (at [401]–[402]). The 1967 Memo stated that SM had acquired all of SR’s shares and that SM shares were to be issued equally to JERIC. The 1969 CE Minutes showed that CE had purchased from JMC the entire issued capital of SM, thereby forming a triangular structure in which CE owned SM which owned SR, which in turn owned CE. The 1969 CE Minutes stated that Ernest had the power of authority to notify CE to transfer the shares in SM, and that Ernest had exercised this power of appointment in favour of JERIC for them to claim 20% of SM each. This was explained in the Mitford Note. 59The Judge reasoned that that having found that SM was beneficially owned by JERIC, it must follow that JERIC had a beneficial interest in the other two entities, SR and CE, which were owned in an orphan structure with SM, and with SR owning NEL, and CE owning 45% of the shares of JMC. This was supported by the fact that journal vouchers record JRIC as continuing to receive dividends from JMC after 1970. These dividends were credited into their current accounts with SM (at [406]).",
        "The Companies are not the beneficial owners of their shares and assets": "60The Judge applied BVI and Panamanian laws, and determined that Ernest was the beneficial owner of thesharesof the Orphan Companies as he had incorporated them and had always exercised full and complete control over the Orphan Companies and their affairs (at [476]). 61However, the Orphan Companies were not beneficial owners of theirassets, because while they had considerable assets, they had nominal or insubstantial paid-up capital and no apparent trading operations. It was therefore obvious that the assets were being held for someone else. Since the Companies’ assets were put into them by Ernest, it appeared that Ernest was the “putative beneficial owner” of the assets, but because some of the assets put in by Ernest stemmed from the pool owned by JRIC, he held a corresponding part of the beneficial interest in the shares and assets of the Companies on trust for his siblings and Camilla’s estate (at [477]). The Judge did not attempt to determine what proportion of the shares and assets that would be, leaving that inquiry for the assessment/accounts stage.",
        "Ernest was the putative owner of the Companies’ assets as he held part of them on trust for his siblings and his mother’s estate": "62The Judge held that: (a) The Companies did not beneficially own their assets; Ernest was the beneficial owner of all the assets held by the Companies, and was therefore entitled to call for ECJ to effect transfers of shares as he directed and was also entitled to call for ECJ’s resignation from their directorships and appoint new directors (at [499]); (b) However, Ernest had mixed the assets belonging to his siblings and Camila’s estate with his own assets into the pool of assets held by the Companies. Therefore, he held a part of the Companies’ assets on trust for his siblings and Camila’s estate, less any payments made by Ernest over the years to them (at [500]); (c) Camila’s estate had not been fully or properly distributed or accounted for, and so Ernest was liable to account for the due administration and distribution of Camila’s estate (at [501]); and (d) Bobby was at liberty to apply to intervene in the proceedings and apply for Ernest to account for Bobby’s share of the assets belonging to him less what he had been paid (at [503]).",
        "Ernest fraudulently misrepresented to ECJ that there was a family legacy": "63The Judge framed the main misrepresentation as being that “there was a family legacy instituted by Robert Sr which Ernest was looking after as custodian for the De La Sala family” (at [507] of the Judgment). This has to be read together with the Judge’s more detailed findings elsewhere in the Judgment (which we paraphrase for the sake of brevity) that Ernest had represented to ECJ: (a) That he was acting as custodian of the De La Sala family businesses, which were Robert Sr’s and/or the family’s “legacy”, and that this had been a “burden” on him (at [384(a)]); (b) That ECJ would eventually take over his role and would then manage the De La Sala “legacy” for the benefit of the whole family (at [378] and [384(b)]); (c) That ECJ would be well-rewarded financially for assisting him (at [384(c)]); and (d) That ECJ’s efforts would increase the value of the De La Sala family assets and thus benefit the whole family including their children, as they were all descendants of Robert Sr and Camila and were beneficiaries of the “legacy” (at [384(d)–(e)]. 64The Judge found that no “family legacy” existed, that Ernest had known that “Robert Sr had not … set up any family trust and/or family legacy”, and that the misrepresentations had induced ECJ to incur detriment in moving to Singapore and giving up career opportunities (at [507]–[508] of the Judgment). In particular, the Judge noted that “what counted with them was that they were serving the family interests in taking up this role” (at [508] of the Judgment). On that basis, the Judge allowed ECJ’s counterclaim.",
        "ECJ did not breach their fiduciary duties to Ernest nor did they render dishonest assistance": "65The Judge’s reasoning with regard to Ernest’s counterclaims was brief, comprising only one paragraph, which mirrors the lack of importance placed on these counterclaims by Ernest in the conduct of the trial. The Judge found that “ECJ had acted on theirbona fidebelief that the [Companies] were holding assets which belonged to the family legacy”, and was of the view that this was a reasonably held belief that was perpetuated by Ernest’s representations. The Judge therefore rejected Ernest’s claim that ECJ was “in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to the [Companies] as directors or had dishonestly assisted in breaches of trust or took part in a lawful or unlawful conspiracy to injure Ernest.” The Judge found that “Ernest was in a large part responsible … for the state of affairs in which ECJ acted, in my view, in accordance with their fiduciary duties as directors to protect the [Companies] when Ernest removed funds from them into his personal accounts” (at [506] of the Judgment). 66Therefore, the Plaintiffs’ claims against Ernest were dismissed in part, Ernest’s counterclaims against ECJ were dismissed and ECJ’s claim in misrepresentation was allowed.",
        "The IW Letter was protected by without prejudice privilege": "67The Judge observed that there were two prerequisites before without prejudice privilege may be invoked in respect of communications between the parties. First, “the communications (in respect of which privilege is claimed) must arise in the course of genuine negotiations to settle a dispute”, and second, “the communication must constitute or involve an admission against the maker’s interest” (at [489]). 68In so far as the first requirement was concerned, the Judge was of the view that the IW Letter was a genuine invitation by James to negotiate a settlement between the parties. This was the consequence of a number of findings. First, the Judge found that the IW Letter at paras 5, 9 and 52–55 demonstrated James’ desire for the parties to settle (at [491]). Second, while the Judge accepted that the bulk of the IW Letter emphasised the weaknesses of Ernest’s case and the potential consequences of the matter being litigated in open court, the Judge took the view that it did not undermine James’s genuine intention to negotiate a settlement. The Judge relied on the English High Court decision ofSchering Corporation v CIPLA Ltd and another[2004] EWHC 2587 (Ch) (“Schering”) in arriving at his conclusion. In that decision, in respect of the same issue of whether a particular letter was protected by without prejudice privilege, Laddie J observed, at [19] and [21], that it was common in correspondence between parties facing potential litigation that “the author maximises the strength of his case”, or “for one party to assert that its confidence is so great in the correctness of its position, that it feels that it is safe to proceed without regard to the other side’s position if negotiations are not entered into and resolved satisfactorily”. Third, the Judge also took the view that the contents of the IW Letter did not amount to “threats”, drawing a distinction between “highlighting to the other party the potential risks of proceeding with litigation, which may include investigations by the relevant authorities, and threatening to report the other party to those authorities unless the other party settled” (at [492]). The Judge was of the view that the IW Letter had made it explicit that James had no intention of sending any material or information to the authorities that might subject Ernest or Isabel to investigations. Fourth, the Judge accepted Mr Winter’s evidence that there was no intent to communicate threats in the IW Letter. Finally, the Judge observed that neither Ernest nor his lawyers had raised any objections to the IW Letter until 10 months after it was sent, and he was therefore of the view that the IW Letter had arisen in the course of genuine negotiations (at [492]). 69In so far as the second requirement was concerned, the Judge accepted ECJ’s submission “that a genuine invitation to negotiate a settlement is sufficient, in and of itself, to constitute an admission against interest” (at [494]). 70The Judge omitted to state his reasons for accepting that James’s E-mail was clothed by without prejudice privilege. It would appear that he agreed with the SAR that James’s E-mail was to be treated in similar fashion to the IW Letter, and since he found that the IW Letter was privileged, so was James’s E-mail.",
        "The appeals and summonses": "71As there are a number of appeals and summonses filed by the parties, it may be helpful for us to provide an overview of the issues at stake in the following table: CaseAppellant/ApplicantRespondentDetailsCA 34ErnestCompaniesAppeal against the Judge’s finding that Ernest held part of the Companies’ shares and assets on trust for JRIC.ECJAppeal against the Judge’s finding of Ernest’s fraudulent misrepresentation to ECJ.Appeal against the Judge’s dismissal of Ernest’s claims of breach of fiduciary duties, dishonest assistance and conspiracyviaunlawful and/or lawful means against ECJ.None (Bobby is not a party to CA 34)Appeal against the Judge’s decision that Bobby was at liberty to apply to intervene in the proceedings to apply for Ernest to account for Bobby’s share of the assets and/or funds belonging to him.SUM 88CompaniesErnestSummons for leave to adduce further evidence in the form of (a) Ernest’s witness statement dated 24 February 2017 and (b) a supplemental witness statement dated 18 May 2017 and the exhibits to these statements.

Since ECJ did not file an appeal against this aspect of the Judge’s decision, they should not be allowed to use their Respondent’s skeletal submissions to mount a back-door appeal. This is also not a case in which they are seeking to affirm the Judge’s decision on different grounds (which is permissible as part of a response to the other side’s appeal: see the decision of this Court inLCapital Jones Ltd and another v Maniach Pte Ltd[2017] 1 SLR 312 at [65]), since finding the existence of a trust by Robert Sr would lead to the substantial reversal of many of the Judge’s orders. We will therefore not consider these arguments any further. The Judge found that Robert Sr had not set up a trust before his death, and that finding must stand. 73Summonses Nos 85, 87, 88 and 92 of 2017 (“SUM 85”, “SUM 87”, “SUM 88” and “SUM 92”, respectively) were filed by the Companies and ECJ to adduce fresh evidence in the appeals, in the form of two sets of documents – the statements filed in proceedings in Hong Kong involving Ernest and his ex-wife, Hannelore, as well as the 1956 Form. Ernest stated that he had no objection to admitting the fresh evidence (though he was contesting its relevance and the weight to be given to it), and so we allowed the four summonses by consent by the end of the oral hearing. 74At this juncture, we first consider the 1956 Form that is the subject of SUM 92, as it is connected to ECJ’s arguments regarding the existence of the family trust. Edward deposed in his second affidavit dated 21 July 2017 that the 1956 Form, a torn document which was allegedly signed by both Bobby and Ernest, and shows Bobby transferring his NEL shares to Ernest to hold in his capacity as “Trustee of the Jeric Foundation”, is relevant to CA 34. Edward asserts that though the purported “Jeric Foundation” was never been put into effect, the 1956 Form shows that family members “had been contemplating trust arrangements over the [NEL] shares since at least 1956”, and is therefore consistent with ECJ’s belief that Robert Sr “established a sacred trust over [NEL]”. We place no weight on the 1956 Form for the same reason stated at [72] above – there is no appeal by ECJ against the Judge’s finding that Robert Sr did not establish a trust over the family’s assets. In any event, the 1956 Form preceded many of the key events in dispute in CA 34 by many years and is therefore of little relevance. 75We will deal with the relevance and weight of the statements filed in proceedings in Hong Kong involving Ernest and Hannelore that are the subject of SUM 85, SUM 87 and SUM 88 at the appropriate junctures in this judgment, as they relate to a number of the appeals.",
        "The issues": "76The following issues arise for determination: (a) In CA 34 and CA 35, who has the beneficial ownership of the Companies’ shares and assets, and if it is Ernest, whether he is entitled to transfer the assets and shares to himself; (b) In CA 34, whether ECJ owed and/or were in breach of their fiduciary duties to Ernest, or had dishonestly or knowingly assisted the Companies in their alleged breaches of trust; (c) In CA 34, whether Ernest made fraudulent misrepresentations to ECJ regarding the family legacy; (d) In CA 34 and CA 59, whether the Judge erred in finding that Bobby could intervene in the proceedings, and/or in granting leave for Bobby to intervene (“the Bobby Decision”); and (e) In CA 60, whether the two documents in RA 352 were subject to without prejudice privilege. Since the point of CA 60 is to have evidence admitted which may be pertinent to the substantive appeals, we begin by considering that particular appeal.",
        "The IW Letter and James’s E-mail in RA 352": "",
        "Ernest’s arguments": "191Ernest raises a number of arguments against the Judge’s decision to allow Bobby to intervene, but thegravamenof his complaint is that the Judge should not have exercised his discretion so as to grant a remedy to a person who had not sought a remedy and who had not filed a statement of claim or given discovery, amongst other things. By doing so, the Judge had deprived Ernest of procedural safeguards to which he was entitled. Moreover, the Judge had not substantially considered Ernest’s defences of limitation and laches, and whether Bobby had the standing to seek an account in respect of the claims of Camila’s estate.",
        "ECJ’s arguments": "169ECJ reiterate the facts relied upon by the Judge regarding the detriment suffered by ECJ. They also argue that the representation as to the “family legacy” was false because there is a great difference between a trust for a defined purpose and/or beneficiaries on the one hand, and a pool of assets which an individual owner might choose to apply for the benefit of others on the other. In so far as the pleadings are concerned, ECJ submit that their pleadings sufficiently define “family legacy”.",
        "Our decision": "212When the Judge allowed Bobby’s application to be joined to the action, the assessment of damages had not been done. It is thus clear that on a straightforward application ofThe Duke ofBuccleuch, the proceedings had not terminated, and the Judge was therefore entirely right to find that he didhave the powerto order joinder. The question is whether the power wascorrectlyexercised. The necessity limb was not satisfied 213We find, with respect, that the power was not correctly exercised. To begin with, it could not be said that the joinder of Bobby wasnecessaryto resolve the dispute before the Judge. The parties competing for the ownership of the Companies’ assets were the Companies and Ernest; no other party had claimed ownership. Thus, the Judge need only have determined whether the Companies’ claim of ownership over the assets transferred out by Ernest succeeded on a balance of probabilities. There was no need to join Bobby in order to give him a claiminsteadofthe Companies. At best, his joinder as a party wasdesirable, notnecessary. Thus, the necessity limb (O 15 r 6(2)(b)(i) of the ROC) cannot justify Bobby’s joinder. The just and convenient limb was not satisfied 214This leaves us with the just and convenient limb (O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC). This limb was also not satisfied. Although we can well understand the concerns of substantive justice which the Judge surely had in mind, it is anomalous for a court in a civil case to award a remedy to a party notwithstanding that party’sdenial of the very claim which forms the basis of that remedy. Since Bobby hadexpressly disavowedany personal claim to the Companies’ assets during the proceedings, it cannot be said that, as regards Bobby, there was or might be any “question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter” between the existing parties. 215Further, even acceptingarguendothat therewasa live “question or issue” of the required type, we are, respectfully, of the view that the threshold for review, set out at [211] above, had been crossed. A number of factors, which the Judge appears not to have fully considered, weighed strongly against allowing Bobby to be joined at the late stage at which the application was brought. 216First, joining Bobby in this manner resulted in procedural unfairness and a breach of natural justice. A defendant is entitled to be properly put on notice as to the claims against him in the form of pleadings, and thereafter to defend himself against, and to test the evidence for, the claims made against him. In the present case, the dispute over the Companies’ assets below concernedonlythe Companies and Ernest. It was neither asserted nor pleaded by either party that some other party – including, in particular, Bobby – had an interest in the Companies’ assets. Although Bobby was a witness at the trial of the proceedings, his evidence was in support ofthe Companies’ claimto the assets. He never asserted a personal claim to the assets, nor was it put to Ernest that he was holding the assets on trust for Bobby. On these plain facts, it should not have been open to the court to rule that some party who had made no ownership claims, owned the assets. 217Recognising the difficulty created by granting relief to a non-party, the Judge granted leave of court on 22 March 2017 to allow Bobby to intervene in S 178. However, this judgment was delivered some two monthsafterthe Judgment of 27 January 2017 had awarded various remedies to Bobby, despite the fact that he had not been a party at the time when the judgment was delivered. To recapitulate, those remedies included: (a) A declaration that Ernest held the mixed assets and funds on trust for his siblings and Camila’s estate (at [500] of the Judgment); (b) A declaration that Ernest was liable to account for the due administration and distribution of Camila’s estate (at [501]); (c) A declaration that the interests of Tony, Bobby, Isabel and Camila’s estate were intricately intertwined with the issues in S 178 (at [502]); and (d) An invitation to Bobby alone to intervene in S 178 in order for Ernest to account to Bobby for his share of the mixed assets and funds (at [503]). Evidently, these remedies were awarded to Bobby without pleadings and without the benefit of submissions from the parties. This was wrong in principle (seePAWournell, which was discussed at [209] above). In addition, this error in turn led, with respect, to a series of downstream errors. 218One such error concerns the time bar issue, which is the second factor weighing against allowing Bobby’s joinder. As stated earlier, joinder will not be permitted if the claim by or against the party sought to be joined is time-barred at the time of the application for joinder. The Judge ordered Ernest to account to Bobby for his share of the Companies’ assets from 27 May 1967 to the present. Based on this remedy, the claims would,prima facie,be time barred. It does not appear to us that Bobby can avail himself of either of the two relevant exceptions in s 22(1)(a)–(b) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) based on the available evidence on record. 219Section 22(1)(a) of the Limitation Act provides an exception for fraud and fraudulent breach of trust. However, fraud must be expressly pleaded and proved. This was not done. It is clear that Ernest has acted improperly, at least with regard to the 2011 transfers, inasmuch as he was not entitled to deal with the Companies’ assets as he did. It is also clear that the corporate structure set up by Ernest was designed to make it difficult to determine the ownership of the Companies’ assets. However, that does not necessarily mean that Ernest had actedfraudulentlyin respect of Bobby in his dealings prior to the 2011 transfers. The very nature of such an assertion requires proper pleadings and proof, neither of which has been provided by Bobby. 220Section 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act, which provides an exception for actions to recover trust property or the proceeds thereof, also does not assist Bobby (again, based on the relevant evidence on record). As was observed in the Singapore High Court decision ofAngToon Teck v Ang Poon Sin[1998] SGHC 67, there is a distinction between an action for an account and an action to recover trust property. An account is not, in itself, anaction to recovertrust property; it is a process which allows a beneficiary tofind out what has become of trust property, and thereafterpossibly– as a conceptually distinct step – to seek remedies in respect of that property: see the decision of this Court inChngWeng Wah v Goh Bak Heng[2016] 2 SLR 464at [22] and the Singapore High Court decision inLalwaniShalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal[2017] SGHC 90 at [26]. Section 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act therefore cannot apply to Bobby’s claim for an account, although it would apply if he were seeking to directly recover trust property or its proceeds which could be identifiedwithouttaking an account. Lest this distinction be thought to be an overly artificial or technical one, we observe that as a matter of fairness to defendants, it is one thing to allow a plaintiff tosue forthe returnof trust property, and quite another thing to require a defendant – through the mechanism of an account – to provide a comprehensive explanation of transactions which could stretch back across anindefiniteand unlimitedperiod of time. 221It bears mentioning that the characterisation of Bobby’s claim as a claim for an account rather than to recover trust property does not originate from Ernest; rather, it is how the Judge framed Bobby’s claim when he decided to grant Bobby reliefs which had not been asked for. Thus, it is clear to us thatthatclaim (based on the relevant evidence on record) is one which is time-barred, although we do not rule out the possibility that Bobby’s claim could be reframed and/or limited in its chronological scope such that it would not be time-barred. In any event, such a claim is not before us. 222Another error which, with respect, arose as a result of the granting of relief to Bobby without proper pleadings or full argument concerns Bobby’s standing to seek an account for the beneficial interest of Camila’s estate. The Judge (who, it should be noted, did not have the advantage of full submissions and authorities to assist him on this point) appears to have assumed that Bobby had standing. The true legal position is more complex. Under both Singapore law and Australian law, a personal representative (in this case, the executrix of Camila’s estate) obtains absolute title to the deceased’s assets, including assets falling within the residuary estate and assets which are subject to individual bequests: see the decision of this Court inSeahTeong Kang (co-executor of the will of Lee Koon, deceased) and another v Seah Yong Chwan (executor of the estate of Seah Eng Teow)[2015] 5 SLR 792 at [19] and [22] (“SeahTeong Kang”) andCommissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan Livingston[1965] AC 694 at 707 (a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the High Court of Australia, discussed inSeahTeong Kangat [19]). Therefore, what a beneficiary obtains is not an equitable interest in any of the estate’s assets, but a right to have the estate properly administered: see, for example, the recent Singapore High Court decision ofFong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Kao Chai-Chau Linda and others[2017] 4 SLR 1018 (“Fong Wai Lyn”) at [7], citing this Court’s decision inWong Moy (administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased) v Soo Ah Choy[1996] 3 SLR(R) 27 at [11]. 223As against the personal representative, a beneficiary also has, as a corollary to his chose in action to have the estate properly administered, the right to seek an account for a breach of duty which causes a loss of assets from the estate: seeParry andKerridge: The Law of Succession(Sweet & Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2016) (“Parry andKerridge”) at paras 24–01 and 24–02. However, with regard to claims against third parties (including other beneficiaries other than the personal representative), the rights of a beneficiary are significantly more constrained. Ordinarily, claims to recover assets which should be part of the estate are for the personal representative to bring: seeFong Wai Lynat [7]. However, a beneficiary may bring a claim in special circumstances including, but not limited to, a personal representative’s default (eg, breach of trust or a conflict of interest): seeFong Wai Lynat [8]–[9]. Even when he does so, he does so on behalf of the estate, and not in his own right as a beneficiary. In only one circumstance may he bring a claimin his own rightagainst a third party, and that is when the third party has wrongly received from the personal representative an asset which the claimant should have received, and the claimant has exhausted his primary remedies against the personal representative: see the English Court of Appeal decision ofReDiplock[1948] Ch 465 (“ReDiplock”) at 502–505 (affirmed on appeal, in relevant part, by the House of Lords inMinistry of Health v Simpson[1951] AC 251); as well asParry andKerridgeat paras 24-39 to 24-43. Such recovery is limited to the amount which the beneficiary is unable to recover from the personal representative: seeParry andKerridgeat para 24-43. 224In the present case, it is arguable that even though Bobby can have no direct claim against Ernest as a beneficiary of Camila’s estate, he may be able to bring himself within the special circumstances set out inFong Wai Lyn. However, the Judgedid not considerthe question, nor does he appear to have dealt with the fact that Bobby’s right to an account, if any, would not be his own entitlement, but one exercised on behalf of Camila’s estate. We hasten to add that the error was, in large part, a result of the fact that the Judge did not have the benefit of the parties’ submissions or their cited authorities to assist him on these (somewhat arcane, in the commercial context) points. This, together with the error relating to the time bar, illustrates the real prejudice which Ernest would, unfortunately, have suffered as a result of the way the Judge exercised his discretion. 225The third factor weighing against Bobby’s joinder is the lack of a good explanation for his excessive delay in seeking to intervene. In our judgment, the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision ofWhite City Tennis Club(see above at[208]) is illustrative of the difficulties with Bobby’s intervention. In that case, the third party sought to intervene after the action had been disposed of on appeal. The third party’s explanation for the delay in applying for joinder was that it had not seen a need to intervene until the outcome of the appeal was known, as the court below had made orders that were consistent with the third party’s interest and the third party had not expected the final outcome to be as it was on appeal. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held at [40] that the third party’s disappointed expectation was not sufficient to allow joinder. Simply put, a misprediction as to the outcome of a case is not an excuse for inaction. Parties with an interest in a dispute should involve themselves at the earliest opportunity in order to advance arguments in favour of the outcome they desire; they cannot wait and see how the court decides, and then expect to be allowed to intervene when the outcome is not to their liking. Here, Bobby’s intervention was clearly very late. He had been an active participant in the proceedings, at least as a witness, and must have been keenly aware of how much the dispute affected his own interests. Yet,had the Judge not granted Bobby leave to interveneof the Judge’s own motion, Bobbymight never have attemptedto intervene at all.Bobby’s only explanation for his delay on appeal is that he had expected a different outcome,viz, the finding of a family trust. This is not an acceptable explanation. With the benefit of legal advice, he could and should have foreseen that the case might be decided differently, and accordingly intervened to advance his alternative case. It is too late for him to do so now. 226For completeness, we should explain why the factor of abuse of process andres judicatais not engaged here despite its frequent overlap with the issue of delay. What Bobby is seeking to do is not torelitigatethe issues below, but rather to rely on the Judge’s findings. The situation is therefore not analogous to the scenario discussed inFamily Food Courtat [65] (see [207] above),ie, where a third party sought tochallengefindings that were made in his absence. 227Given that the relevant factors substantially weigh against allowing the joinder, we find that the decision to allow Bobby to intervene was not warranted. We also find that the Judge’s decision was, with respect, made on the basis of a misdirection as to the applicable principles. In effect, leave was granted to take effect retrospectively in that Bobby, a non-party, was first awarded various reliefs in the Judgmentbeforethose reliefs were, in a sense, regularised by inviting and allowing Bobby to intervene. The fact that the Judge certified that his grounds for allowing the intervention on 22 March 2017 had been set out in the Judgment confirms our understanding. In the result, the reasons for the granting of the leave were not separately analysed. Such a separate analysis was necessary, for the question of whether Bobby has an interest in the mixed assets and funds (which was examined in the Judgment) is distinct from the question of whether Bobby should be allowed to intervene and be joined. 228Additionally, the decision to grant remedies to Bobby prior to his intervention appears to have contributed to a situation in which there was no consideration of the possible defences which Ernest would have raised, including laches and time bar, if Bobby had been a party to the proceedings from the outset. The notes of evidence for the hearing of SUM 662 (the leave application) and the Judgment itself do not mention these issues. It thus seems that the principles governing the exercise of discretion (which include consideration of any prejudice to the parties) in granting leave to intervene had, with respect, been inadvertently overlooked. 229For these reasons, we find that the order to allow Bobby to intervene and be joined as a party was erroneous, and we allow CA 34 and CA 59 to the extent that they appeal against SUM 662 and against the portions of the Judgment concerning the joinder of Bobby.",
        "Whether the Judge erred regarding the beneficial ownership of the Companies’ shares and assets": "",
        "The Companies’ arguments": "107CA 35 revolves around the Companies’ argument that the structure of the Orphan Companies is valid and capable of existing without a natural ultimate beneficial owner (“UBO”). The Companies claim that they were to apply their assets for the purposes they were set up,ie, to manage the assets and distribute them to descendants of Robert Sr. 108The Companies first dispute Ernest’s claim of beneficial ownership of their shares, as they point out that it is not true that Ernest incorporated all of them; PAL was incorporated in 1958 as a subsidiary of JMC. They also contend that the Judge had erroneously equated beneficial ownership with control; in general, directors have full and complete control over the affairs of companies but that does not mean that they are the beneficial owners. The Companies also argue that Ernest has not proven that he was the owner of the first orphan structure of CE, SM and SR, which is related to the present Orphan Structure, and point out that Ernest had disavowed any interest in CE, SM, JMC, SR and NEL in the Mitford Alaska proceedings. 109The Companies then contend that even if Ernest were the beneficial owner of the Companies’ shares, he has failed to show that he is the beneficial owner of the Companies’assets. In this regard, they rely on the doctrine of separate legal personality and argue that ownership of the shares of a company do not translate to ownership of its assets. They also contend that the fact that they have nominal or insubstantial paid-up capital or no apparent trading operations is not inconsistent with their beneficial ownership of the assets. Given that there is no suggestion of an express trust or constructive trust over the assets, Ernest’s claim must be premised on there being a resulting trust over the assets,ie, one arising because Ernest had transferred his assets into the Companies with no intention to benefit to the Companies. The Companies argue that Ernest has failed to show that the Companies hold the assets on a resulting trust for him, since he cannot remember when and how exactly he put his assets into the Companies, and has also failed to show that these transfers were made without an intention to benefit the Companies. There is also no evidence that Ernest had transferred any of his own assets into the Companies to begin with. The Companies argue that Ernest is unable to recall when he did so simply because the assets originated substantially from NEL and JMC, and not from Ernest himself. 110As an alternative argument, the Companies contend that even if it is accepted that Ernest had a partial beneficial interest in the Companies’ assets, Ernest is not entitled to transfer the Companies’ assets to himself, call for the registered shareholders to transfer shares in the Companies to him, or call for the resignation of the other directors. They point out that the BVI and Panamanian law expert evidence adduced at trial related to how the sole UBO could procure for himself the shares and assets of a company, but the evidence was not applicable in Ernest’s case because Ernest is not the sole UBO. The Companies citeLewinon Trusts(Sweet & Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) for the proposition that a beneficiary can only be said to be an equitable owner of a trust asset if the asset is sufficiently ascertained and he is the only beneficiary interested in it. However, if the beneficiary’s rights or the assets in which they are to be enjoyed are not sufficiently ascertained, his equitable proprietary interest in the assets only allows him to require the trustee to administer the assets, but he cannot claim ownership over a specific asset. Given the Judge’s conclusion that the exact proportion of Ernest’s beneficial interests in the assets is unascertainable, Ernest has no basis to assert equitable ownership over the assets. 111The Companies also contend that under the well-known rule inSaunders vVautier(1841) 4 Beav 115 (“Saunders vVautier”), the consent of all the beneficiaries of a trust is required before they can require the trustee to return to them assets held beneficially for them under a trust. Since the Judge found that Ernest is not the sole beneficial owner, and that Camila’s estate and Bobby also have an interest in the Companies’ assets, Ernest cannot transfer the Companies’ assets to himself without first obtaining the approval of the other beneficiaries. 112In any event, even assuming that Ernest is able to overcome all the above legal obstacles, the fact remains that Ernest has to comply with the corporate formalities, such as passing appropriate resolutions, prior to transferring assets from the Companies to himself. 113Ernest’s response to these arguments is that the Companies have wrongly characterised the Judge’s findings as a finding that Ernest, Camila’s estate and Bobby are co-beneficial owners. Rather, the Judge found that Ernest held part of the shares and assets of the Companies on a sub-trust for Camila’s estate and Bobby. Therefore, assuming the Judge’s decision is upheld, as between the Companies and him, the former cannot withhold its assets from the latter, because he is the “full beneficial owner at ‘the first layer’”. Ernest cites the English Court of Appeal’s decision inNelson v Greening and Sykes (Builders) Ltd[2007] EWCA Civ 1358 at [56]–[58] as support for this argument. 114Ernest argues that he is entitled to transfer the Companies’ assets to himself even though he would hold part of it on sub-trust for his siblings and Camilla’s estate.",
        "Whether the Judge erred in dismissing Ernest’s counterclaims against ECJ": "",
        "Whether Ernest made fraudulent misrepresentations to ECJ regarding the family legacy": "166The representations which ECJ relied on as giving rise to their counterclaim for fraudulent misrepresentation were pleaded as follows: (a)  the Majority Directors [ie, ECJ] would assist EFL, and eventually take over EFL’s role as custodians of the De La Sala family legacy, which was constituted by the Companies and/or the Family Companies; (b)  the Majority Directors would earn substantially more than what they were earning and/or would earn in their current and/or previous jobs if they relocated to Singapore to assist EFL in the management of the Companies and the investment of the Companies’ assets; (c)  by managing the Companies and investing their assets, the Majority Directors would be increasing the value of the Companies for the benefit of the De La Sala family members; and (d)  the Majority Directors’ children would benefit from the management, protection, preservation and enhancement of the Companies, as the Majority Directors’ children were amongst the descendants of Robert Snr and [Camila] and the members of the De La Sala family who were beneficiaries of the family legacy. 167The Judge considered that the core representation which had been made was that “there was a family legacy instituted by Robert Sr which Ernest was looking after as custodian for the De La Sala family” (at [507] of the Judgment). This has to be read together with the Judge’s more detailed findings, which we paraphrased above at [63].",
        "Applicable legal principles": "193It is crucial to note that the joinder of Bobby in relation to the present case took place onlyafterthe Judgment was issued. The joinder was ordered on 22 March 2017, and the Judge stated his reasons for allowing the application as having been reflected in the Judgment itself. The joinder of a party post-judgment raises two distinct issues. First, under what circumstances will the court have the power to order such joinder? Secondly, what are the principles which guide the court in deciding whether to exercise the power? 194The key provision here is O 15 r 6(2) of the ROC, the material part of which provides as follows: (2) Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application — … (b) order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely: (i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon; (ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter. 195Both sub-paragraph (i) (“the necessity limb”) and sub-paragraph (ii) (“the just and convenient limb”) are controlled by a non-discretionary requirement that the joinder be done “at any stage of the proceedings”; the court has no power to order joinder after proceedings have concluded. After the court is satisfied that the proceedings are still afoot, and the power to order joinder thusexists, it will consider whether the power should beexercised. This second stage of the inquiry has both a non-discretionary and a discretionary element. We set out each of these in turn. The existence of the power 196Thelocusclassicusis the English Court of Appeal decision inThe Duke ofBuccleuch[1892] P 201 (“The Duke ofBuccleuch”). That was an admiralty case which turned on the interpretation of the phrases “at any stage of the proceedings” and “for the determination of the real matter in dispute”. The owners of the ship in that case argued that because a final judgment had been given on liability, it was too late to substitute a new plaintiff (at 207). The logic of that argument was that, following that judgment on liability, there could be no “proceedings” or “matter in dispute” to speak of. Both the first instance judge and the English Court of Appeal rejected this argument because, in short, it could not be said that the proceedings had terminated so long as damages had not been assessed. The test, as articulated by Fry LJ (at 212), was simply whether “anything remain[ed] to be done in the case”, the assessment of damages being one example of a thing remaining to be done. 197The Duke of Buccleuchhas been cited with approval in our courts inAbdulGaffar bin Fathil v Chua Kwang Yong[1994] 2 SLR(R) 99 (reversed on appeal on the basis that the joinder was not necessary on the facts, but without casting any doubt on the principle itself),LingKee Ling and another v Leow Leng Siong and others[1995] 2 SLR(R) 36 (for the purpose of determining whether an order was interlocutory or final, albeit in a context not concerning joinder), and (most recently) inSyed Ahmad JamalAlsagoff (administrator of the estates of Syed Mohamad bin Hashim bin Mohamad Alhabshi and others) and others v Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and others[2017] 5 SLR 299 (affirmed on appeal without written grounds being issued). The principle inThe Duke ofBuccleuchis supported as well by the Malaysian jurisprudence (specifically,Hong Leong FinanceBhd v Staghorn Sdn Bhd[1995] 2 MLJ 847 andUnited Asian BankBhd v Personal Representative of Roshammah (decd) & Ors[1994] 3 MLJ 327) and by the academic commentary of Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC inSingapore Court Practice 2017vol 1 (LexisNexis, 2016) at para 15/6/6. 198We agree with the reasoning used in these authorities, and find thatThe Duke ofBuccleuchdoes represent the current state of the law in Singapore in so far as the existence of the power to order joinder post-judgment is concerned –viz, it exists if and only if something remains to be done in the matter, such as the assessment of damages. 199For completeness, we note that later English cases appear to have adopted a more liberal standard. InCInc v L[2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 459 (“CInc”), the English High Court held (at [83]–[84]) that proceedings were to be considered ongoing (and thus joinder should still be available) so long as a judgment had not beenfully satisfied: 83. In my view the word “proceedings” should be given a broad interpretation in CPR Part 19.4. It should embrace all stages of an action from the time it has been started until it becomes finally complete or moribund.There are many “proceedings” in which a judgment is obtained but it is not satisfied.At that stage further action may be needed in order to enforce the judgment. The “proceedings” have not finished at that point.A claimant may wish to appoint areceiver by way of equitable execution to get in the assets of the defendant to satisfy the judgment. Or he may wish to obtain a freezing order in aid of execution. The “proceedings” must still be continuing in those instances.In my view the “proceedings” against Mrs. L are still continuing. 84. So Mr. Wood’s next argument has to be considered, which concerns CPR Part 19.4(2)(a). Are there “matters in dispute” in the proceedings?He says that there cannot be because a judgmenthas been obtained against Mrs. L. In my view that interpretation of the wording is too narrow.The whole point about that rule is that it contemplates there being matters in dispute in the proceedings which affect the putative new party.The rule does not say that the matter in dispute has only to be between the existing claimant and the existing defendant. As I read the wording the matter in dispute can be between any existing party and the new party.In this case the matter in dispute is whether the claimant can obtain a freezing order over the assets of Mr. L in aid of execution of the unsatisfied judgment against Mrs. L. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 200Although this is still an inquiry as to whether “anything remains to be done in the case”, it involves a much broader conception of what constitutes athing remaining to be donethan was contemplated inThe Duke ofBuccleuch. Under the rule inCInc, proceedings would be considered to be ongoingeven after the assessment of damagesand, indeed, even after a final judgment had been extracted and attempts at enforcement had commenced. Joinder of new parties would, it seems, be possibleso long asa single centof a judgment debt remained unpaid. This bold proposition was endorsed by the English Court of Appeal inPrescott v Dunwoody Sports Marketing[2007] EWCA Civ 461 and was subsequently applied in a number of cases, includingMediterranean Shipping Company v OMG International Limited & Ors[2008] EWHC 2150 (Comm),Starlight Shipping Company v Allianz Marine & Aviation Versicherungs AG & Ors[2011] EWHC 3381 (Comm),andJW v Kent County Council (SEN)[2017] UKUT 281 (AAC). 201For the reasons set out below, we are of the view that the present case falls within the orthodoxDuke ofBuccleuchprinciple, and we therefore do not need to decide in this appeal – nor did the parties address – whether an extension of the principle should be recognised in Singapore law. We only make two provisional observations on the more recent English cases. They were decided without consideration ofThe Duke ofBuccleuch, which had addressed the very point in contention. Further, since the only end-point to the existence of the power provided inCIncis thefull satisfaction of the judgment, the broad interpretation may have troubling implications for finality in litigation. We therefore have some doubts as to the desirability of following the current English position. We leave these doubts to be more fully explored on an appropriate occasion. The exercise of the power 202Once the power has been determined to exist (ie, it has been shown that something still remains to be done in a case), the court must then decide whether the power should be exercised. 203The first part of this inquiry is entirely non-discretionary. If the necessity limb is relied upon, the court must consider whether it isnecessary, and not merely desirable, to order joinder. The question is, in essence, whether “there [is anything] to prevent the action … as originally drawn, from being effectually and completely determined” (Abdul Gaffer binFathil v Chua Kwang Yong[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056 (“Abdul Gaffer (CA)”) at [16]). The fact that a plaintiff mightwishto bring a related claim against the third party would not satisfy the test of necessity. Such situations are more appropriately addressed under the just and convenient limb, which permits joinder where, in brief, there is as between the third party and any existing party some question or issue having a sufficient relation to the main dispute, and the court thinks it would be just and convenient to decide it. 204Even under the latter limb, however, it is not sufficient for there to be some factual overlap between the main dispute and the question or issue involving the third party. Rather, that question or issue must “relate toanexisting question or issuebetween theexisting parties” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]:Singapore Civil Procedure2017vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2017) at para 15/6/8, citingSpelling Goldberg ProductionsInc v BPC Publishing Ltd[1981] RPC 280 andAbdul Rahman v MUIS[1995] 2 SLR 705. The non-discretionary element here is the existence of a question or issue having the requisite relationship with the main dispute; the discretionary element is whether, “in the opinion of the Court”, joinder for the purpose of deciding that question or issue would be just and convenient. If the court determines that the non-discretionary requirement is satisfied, it turns next to a discretionary assessment as to whether joinder should be ordered. 205At the discretionary stage, the court’s concerns are substantially similar whether the necessity limb or the just and convenient limb is relied upon. It should not be thought that where the necessity limb is successfully invoked, and the non-discretionary requirement is met, joinder will follow as a matter of course. Although the need to effectually and completely determine a dispute is in itself a strong reason for joinder, it is entirely possible for countervailing concerns of fairness (among other things) to override it. Either way, the court will consider all the factors which are relevant to the balance of justice in a particular case. In our judgment, the following – in no particular order of importance – are of particular relevance to the present appeal. 206First, the court must consider the applicable limitation period to the potential claims arising from the joinder. Where the claim by or against the party sought to be joined is time-barred at the date of application, joinder will not be allowed: see the decisions of this Court inAbdul Gaffer (CA)at [16] andManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No3322 v Mer Vue Developments Pte Ltd[2016] 4 SLR 351 at [18]. 207Secondly, the doctrine ofres judicataand the related doctrine of abuse of process must also be considered. Where an applicant, whochosenot to involve himself in the proceedings at an earlier stage, belatedly seeks to reopen matters already litigated, joinder should not be allowed: see the decision of this Court inFamily Food Court(a firm) v Seah Boon Lock and another (trading as Boon Lock Duck and Noodle House)[2008] 4 SLR(R) 272 (“Family Food Court”) at [65]. 208Thirdly, the length of and explanation for the delay in seeking joinder is highly relevant. It is clear that an applicant’sdisappointed expectationthat a case would be decided differently isnota good explanation for delay: see the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision ofWhite City Tennis Club Ltd v John Alexander’s Clubs Pty Ltd and Another (No2)[2009] NSWCA 194 (“White City Tennis Club”) (a case which we discuss in greater detail at [225] below). This principle, in addition to going towards the sufficiency of the explanation for delay, overlaps with the principle ofres judicatadiscussed above. 209Fourthly, procedural fairness and natural justice must be considered. Joinder cannot come at the expense of procedural unfairness or a breach of natural justice in respect of an existing party (unless that party takes no objection). For instance, in the Canadian decision ofPAWournell Contracting Ltd. & Anor v Allen[1980] NSJ No 367 (“PAWournell”), an appeal arose from the trial judge’s decision to add, of her own motion, a party as plaintiff to the action and to award damages to the new plaintiff. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court Appeal Division was of the view (at [11]) that the trial judge ought to have made the new plaintiff file a statement of claim and given the defendant the right to contest the new claim (such as by filing defences, seeking discovery, and cross-examining witnesses) in the manner that it would have been entitled to had the new plaintiff been part of the proceedings all along. As this had not been done, the court found that the defendant had suffered an injustice when it was denied the right to make full answer and defence to the new claim by the new plaintiff. The court therefore set aside the trial judge’s decision. 210Fifthly, any other prejudice or inconvenience to any party should be considered.This would include the inconvenience of having to re-open pleadings, re-do cross-examination, and so on: see the decision of this Court inChan KernMiangv Kea Resources Pte Ltd[1998] 2 SLR(R) 85 at [23]–[24]. 211Finally, we note that since this is an exercise of discretion, this court will only interfere with the Judge’s decision as regards the discretionary stage of the inquiry if one of the following grounds stated in the decision of this Court inHong Leong BankBhd v Soh Seow Poh[2009] 4 SLR(R) 525 (at [45]) is present: (a) The trial judge was misguided with regard to the principles under which his or her discretion was to be exercised;(b) The trial judge took into account matters which he or she ought not to have or failed to take into account matters which he or she ought to have; or(c) The trial judge’s decision was plainly wrong.",
        "Whether the Judge erred in finding that Bobby could intervene in Suit 178 and in granting leave for Bobby to intervene": "190This issue concerns the propriety of allowing Bobby’s intervention. This and the attendant SUM 85 are rendered somewhat academic given our decision that the Companies’ claim against Ernest succeeds and that Ernest has to account for and return to the Companies the assets that he removed from them. Simply put, we have overturned the findings which formed the basis for Bobby’s intervention in the first place (ie, that Ernest holds the assets on trust, or sub-trust, for JRIC). Any remedy which ultimately flows to Bobby must therefore come from the relevant vehicles containing his beneficial interests in NEL and JMC, and would have to be obtained by Bobby bringing claims directly against NEL and JMC (provided that these claims are not time-barred). Bobby’s intervention and joinder is therefore no longer relevant to or necessary for the purposes of the present proceedings, if it ever was to begin with. Thus, even if the order to join Bobby had been properly made initially, it would be necessary for us to set it aside as a consequence of our decision with regard to the other issues. Nevertheless, as this is a significant and potentially confusing issue, we set out our analysis for future guidance.",
        "Bobby’s arguments": "192Bobby argues that it was necessary for him to be joined to properly dispose of the dispute before the Judge, that Ernest had already had (in substance) the opportunity to test Bobby’s claims during the course of the trial, that Ernest suffered no prejudice as a result, and that the Judge was therefore justified in exercising his discretion to join Bobby. On the remaining points regarding Ernest’s potential defences, Bobby’s arguments are the mirror image of Ernest’s.",
        "Conclusion": "230We allow CA 59 and CA 60 in totality, and CA 34 and CA 35 in part, as detailed above. To reiterate what we said at the beginning of this judgment, although we ended up taking a different legal route, the ultimateeffectof the decision we have arrived at is, in substance, not dissimilar to that arrived at by the Judge in the court below. 231A few things remain to be stated with regard to the consequences of our decision. Since Ernest has been found to be in breach of his fiduciary duties as a director of the Companies, Ernest is to disclose to the Companies all the correspondence with the banks in respect of the bank accounts identified in the Schedule, and account to the relevant plaintiff where assets of the relevant plaintiff were removed by Ernest, including what had become of the same, what interest had been earned thereon and what profits had been made with these assets. Ernest is to repay to the relevant plaintiffs the sums due after the account. Pending Ernest’s account to the Companies in relation to their assets, the injunctions currently in force shall remain. We also grant a declaration that the purported transfers on 7 October 2011 of the SMC shares previously registered in Edward’s and James’s names were void and of no effect. 232We also set aside the order granting Bobby leave to intervene and joining him as a party.  233Unless the parties are able to come to an agreement on costs, they are to furnish, within 14 days, written submissions limited to 15 pages each, setting out their respective positions on the appropriate costs orders, both here and below, in the light of the present judgment.
