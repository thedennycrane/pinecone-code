        "Facts": "3 The evidence adduced by the prosecution which was in effect not\n\nchallenged by the appellant was that on 14 March 2000 at about 5.35pm, he was arrested by\n\na party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) along a corridor at the\n\nSingapore National University Hospital. After his arrest, he was taken to his\n\nsister’s flat at Block 634 Bedok Reservoir Road, #04-11, Singapore. There, under the\n\nbed in the appellant’s bedroom, the CNB officers found a travelling bag with a lock\n\nat the end of the zipper. The appellant assisted the officers to locate a key to unlock\n\nthe bag inside which they discovered the following items:(a) Ten envelopes (B13) containing a total of 99 small transparent\n\n  sachets of granular substance;(b) Six brown packets (B7 to B12) inside which was a total of 357 small\n\n  transparent sachets of granular substance; and(c) Six transparent packets also containing granular substance (B1 to\n\n  B6).4 Also found in the seized bag were implements suggestive of drug\n\ntrafficking such as aluminium foil, envelopes, sticky tapes, a pair of gloves and a razor\n\nblade.5 Scientific analysis carried out by the Department of Forensic Science\n\nestablished the following:(a) The granular substance in the ten envelopes (B13) (ie, 99 sachets)\n\n  had a gross weight of 763.4g and upon analysis was found to contain not less than 1.80g of\n\n  diamorphine;(b) The granular substance (ie, 357 sachets) in the six brown packets\n\n  (B7 to B12) yielded a gross weight of 2,787g and upon analysis was found to contain not\n\n  less than 8.59g of diamorphine; and(c) The granular substance in the six transparent packets (B1 to B6)\n\n  had a gross weight of 2,762g and upon analysis was found to contain not less than 10.98g\n\n  of diamorphine.6 In the result, the gross weight of all the granular substance found\n\nin the seized bag was 6,312.4g and the nett total diamorphine content of all the substance\n\nseized was 21.37g.7 At the trial, upon the application of the prosecution, a number of\n\nstatements made by the appellant were admitted in evidence as being made voluntarily. In\n\nthese statements the appellant admitted to having been in possession of the drugs found in\n\nthe bag; neither the admissibility nor the authorship of the statements was challenged by\n\nthe appellant.8 At the close of the prosecution’s case, the learned trial judge\n\ncorrectly ruled that the prosecution had established a prima facie case which if\n\nunrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the appellant on the charge he faced. The\n\nstandard allocution was administered, the courses open to the appellant were explained and\n\nthereafter the trial judge called on the appellant to enter upon his defence.",
        "Defence": "9 In his defence, the appellant did not endeavour to materially resile\n\nfrom what he had told the CNB in his statements. He admitted that the offending drugs\n\nfound in his possession were collected by him from his supplier \"Glass\" two or\n\nthree days before his arrest. He claimed however, that he was a heroin addict and that\n\nhaving smoked some of the substance he had collected from \"Glass\" and having\n\nfound them to be of poor quality, he had decided to retain the six brown packets (B7 to\n\nB12) for his consumption. It should be observed presently that the gross weight of the\n\nsaid six packets was 2,787g and their nett diamorphine content was 8.59g.10 The appellant testified that during the period of about a month\n\nbefore he was arrested, his rate of consumption of heroin was about half a sachet per day.\n\nAlthough half a sachet per day was the appellant’s normal rate of consumption, he\n\nclaimed that owing to the poor quality of the drugs he had with him, his rate of\n\nconsumption from the present consignment was about four or five sachets per day.11 The appellant further claimed that he was unemployed at the time of\n\nhis arrest. He said that he had agreed to hold and deliver drugs for \"Glass\"\n\nbecause he needed the money to fund his drug addiction. He asserted that he intended to\n\nsell and deliver the drugs found in the ten envelopes (B13) and the six transparent\n\npackets (B1 to B6) with a view to buying the drugs in the six brown packets (B7 to B12)\n\nfor his own consumption. The appellant testified that although \"Glass\" had asked\n\nhim to sell each brown packet of drugs (B7 to B12) for $2,750.00, \"Glass\" had\n\npromised to sell to him each packet at a discounted price of less than $2,000 if the drugs\n\nwere for his own consumption.12 The prosecution did not and would not concede that the appellant was\n\na heroin addict. To support this, the prosecution to some extent relied on the evidence of\n\nthe investigating officer that the appellant appeared normal at the time of his arrest as\n\nwell as that of the evidence of doctors who examined the appellant just before and after\n\nhis statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (‘CPC’)\n\nwere taken. The learned trial judge, however, did not accept the contention of the\n\nprosecution in this regard. He found that the accused’s records spoke volumes about\n\nhis drug problems. Having considered the opinion of Dr Leow Kee Fong, a government doctor\n\nwho examined the appellant three days after his arrest, stating that the appellant was a\n\nmild heroin addict and the evidence of Dr Lim Yun Chin, a consultant psychatrist produced\n\nby the defence, who opined that the appellant was an active heroin-dependent individual,\n\nbased on the appellant’s drug history and what the appellant had told him, the\n\nlearned trial judge accepted the appellant’s claim that he was indeed a heroin\n\naddict.13 As to the amount the appellant was consuming each day prior to his\n\narrest, there was indeed a measure of prevarication in the evidence of the appellant. In\n\nthis regard, it was observed by the learned trial judge that the appellant had told Dr\n\nLeow that he was consuming half a packet per day but in court he claimed that he was\n\nsmoking about four to five packets per day. However, in his statements he had said that he\n\nconsumed only half a sachet of heroin per day. Having noted the explanation of the\n\nappellant that the quality of the heroin in the consignment under reference was rather low\n\nand that he needed four to five sachets to get high, the learned judge was prepared to\n\naccept the claim of the appellant that prior to his arrest he had smoked four to five\n\npackets a day to get high. This, however, did not dispose the matter at hand in favour of\n\nthe appellant for the issue before the trial court was not how many sachets the appellant\n\nwas consuming per day but whether the appellant had on the balance of probabilities\n\nestablished that the six brown packets (B7 to B12) were not for trafficking but for his\n\nown consumption.",
        "Decision by the trial judge": "14 In the end, after giving careful consideration to all the evidence,\n\nthe trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence. The learned judge’s concluding\n\ncomments in this regard bear reproduction and were as follows:The issue that I now have to consider is whether the accused’s\n\n  claim that B7 to B12 were not for trafficking but were for his own consumption should be\n\n  accepted bearing in mind that the burden was on the accused on a balance of probabilities\n\n  to establish that that was so.The accused in this case was a drug addict who had spent considerable\n\n  time under detention for his drug addiction. He was unemployed and did not have any\n\n  assets. By his own testimony, he agreed to hold and deliver drugs for \"Glass\"\n\n  because he needed money to fund his drug addiction. No evidence was led by the prosecution\n\n  as to what the street value of the drugs in the consignment found on him was but the\n\n  accused’s testimony was that each durian [the term used the appellant to refer to\n\n  a packet of heroin] was worth $2,750. The 14 durians in the consignment that the\n\n  accused received would therefore be worth $38,500. The street value of the 6 durians that\n\n  the accused claimed were for his own consumption would be approximately $16,500. Even\n\n  allowing for any special discounts on the price that the accused may obtain from\n\n  \"Glass\", that is an inordinately large sum of money for a person in the\n\n  accused’s financial circumstances to come by. The accused explained that he would\n\n  raise this sum of money from the profits he would obtain by selling the 99 sachets found\n\n  in the 10 envelopes. I find this explanation difficult to accept. It is made even more\n\n  implausible by the fact that the accused had not even told \"Glass\" that he would\n\n  be retaining 6 out of the 14 packets for his own consumption. Nor did the accused in his\n\n  CNB statements make any reference to the 6 packets being for his own consumption. I\n\n  therefore do not accept the defence that these packets were for his own personal\n\n  consumption. If at all any part of the consignment was for the accused’s own\n\n  consumption, it would certainly not be in the order of 6 packets and would not be of an\n\n  amount that would reduce the amount of diamorphine in his possession for the purposes of\n\n  trafficking to anywhere near 15g, leave alone below 15g. I therefore reject the defence\n\n  raised.",
        "The appeal": "15 The primary contention in this appeal was that the learned trial\n\njudge had erred in rejecting the evidence of the appellant that the six brown packets of\n\ndrugs (which contained 8.59g of diamorphine) were meant for his own consumption on account\n\nof the low quality of the drugs in question.16 The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in this regard was\n\nthat an addict with the appellant’s history and background would have to consume more\n\nin view of the low heroin concentration of the consignment which he was in possession of.\n\nIt was further suggested that there was nothing extraordinary for a drug addict with such\n\na long history of addiction to hoard such an amount of drugs for his personal consumption.\n\nIt was also contended by counsel for the appellant that although the gross weight of these\n\nsix packets of heroin was 2,787g, their pure heroin content was only 8.59g, ie, only 0.3%\n\npurity.17 In the appeal before us, it was never in doubt that the appellant\n\nwas in possession of the offending substance which upon analysis was found to contain not\n\nless than 21.37g of diamorphine. It was also not in dispute that the appellant knew the\n\nnature of the drugs he was in possession of. Consequently, by operation of s 17 of the\n\nMDA, he was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession for the purposes of\n\ntrafficking unless it was proven that his possession of the drug was not for that purpose.\n\nThe burden was thus on the appellant to rebut this presumption by establishing on the\n\nbalance of probabilities that the six brown packets of drugs (B7 to B12) found in his\n\npossession were not for trafficking but for his own consumption:Aziz bin Abdul\n\nKadir v Public Prosecutor[1999] 3 SLR 175at 189;Chia Song Heng v Public\n\nProsecutor[1999] 4 SLR 705at 706.18 To rebut the presumption of trafficking and to establish that a\n\nportion of the drugs in his possession was for consumption and not for trafficking, an\n\naccused had to adduce credible evidence to show that part of the offending substance was\n\nintended for self-consumption and in this regard a mere casual declaration by the accused\n\nwould not suffice. He would have to, in addition to the history of his addiction and\n\nconsumption habits, also satisfy the trial court of the rates of his consumption. If all\n\nthat the accused could conjure up was a bare allegation bereft of details, the trial judge\n\nwould be well entitled to reject his evidence as unworthy of belief and an appellate court\n\nwould be most reluctant to disturb any such finding:Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v\n\nPublic Prosecutor[1996] 3 SLR 29at 39;Fung Choon Kay v Public Prosecutor[1997] 3 SLR 564at 572. Another factor which would weigh in the mind of the court is the\n\nfinancial means or the ability of the accused to pay for the drugs:Public\n\nProsecutor v Dahalan bin Ladaewa[1996] 1 SLR 783at 814.19 Reverting to the appeal before us, we were of the view that the\n\nlearned trial judge’s evaluation of the evidence and the findings thereon were\n\nflawless and beyond reproach. His conclusion that the appellant was financially incapable\n\nof retaining the six ‘durians’ using the appellant’s own estimate of\n\ncurrent street price amounted to about $16,500 was also unassailable. The cost of the six\n\npackets, even allowing a generous discount his supplier \"Glass\" allegedly\n\npromised him or might have allowed him, would still set him back with a figure beyond his\n\nreach for he was by his own admission unemployed at the material time. Given the context,\n\nthe learned trial judge’s conclusion that it would entail an inordinately large sum\n\nof money for a person in the accused’s financial circumstances to come by, could not\n\nbe faulted. The learned trial judge also rejected the explanation of the appellant that he\n\nwould raise this sum of money from the profits he would obtain by selling the 99 sachets\n\nfound in the ten envelopes as unworthy of credit owing to the fact that the appellant had\n\nnot even told his supplier that he would be retaining the said six packets for his use.20 We agree with the learned trial judge that the explanations\n\nattempted by the appellant at the trial that the six packets were for his own consumption\n\ndid not feature anywhere in his CNB statements nor did the appellant proffer this\n\nexplanation in his s 122(6) CPC statement when charged with the offence. His failure to\n\nmention such a material aspect naturally led the trial judge to conclude, as he did in\n\nthis case, that his present claim that these packets were meant for his personal\n\nconsumption was implausible and therefore rejected. In this connection, we hasten to\n\nreiterate what the Court of Appeal observed inGoh Soon Huat v Public Prosecutor[1995] 1 SLR 634at 640:… it is not necessary for the appellant to minutely detail all his\n\n  defences in his s 122(6) statement. However, accepting this proposition does not mean that\n\n  the court must accept what the appellant said as true. This must still be weighed against\n\n  the other evidence. It may not always be clear when an omission to state details becomes\n\n  an omission to state material particulars. This is a matter for the trial judge on an\n\n  evaluation of all the evidence at the trial.21 In the appeal before us, the grounds of appeal averted to were\n\nsolely concerned with the trial judge’s findings of fact. It is trite law that as the\n\ntrial court has the advantage of hearing evidence and observing the demeanour of\n\nwitnesses, an appellate court would generally be slow to disturb the findings of the trial\n\ncourt. Nonetheless, the appellate court would intervene where the findings are clearly\n\nwrong or the balance of evidence is against the conclusion reached by the trial court or\n\nwhere the inferences drawn by the trial court are not supported by the primary facts on\n\nthe record or where upon available evidence, no tribunal acting judicially and properly\n\ninstructed on relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal:Opium\n\nFarm v Chin Ah Quee4 SLJ 33 at 35;Chia Han Kiat v R[1937] MLJ 261at 261;Goh Ah San v R[1938] MLJ 95at 99;In re AB Ltd[1956] MLJ 197at 200;Tan Choon Huat v PP[1991] 1 SLR 805at 808;Tan\n\nHung Yeoh v PP[1999] 3 SLR 93at 103 andChng Gim Huat v PP[2000] 3 SLR 262at 277.22 The facts and issues raised in the appeal before us bear some\n\nresemblance to the case ofFung Choon Kay v Public Prosecutor[1997] 3 SLR 565, where the Court of Appeal observed at page 571 that:… Although the fact that the appellant was an addict lent support\n\n  to the appellant’s defence of consumption, that fact by itself was not conclusive.\n\n  The trial judge had to look at the totality of the evidence and decide whether he was\n\n  satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that part of the heroin was for the\n\n  appellant’s own consumption. Here, apart from the medical evidence, the appellant was\n\n  unable to adduce any independent evidence to support his testimony in court that part of\n\n  the heroin was for self-consumption. Much thus depended on the trial judge’s\n\n  assessment of the appellant’s credibility. The trial judge had the advantage of\n\n  seeing the appellant give evidence in the witness box and was in the best position to\n\n  gauge his credibility. An appellate court would be most reluctant to disturb his finding.23 Although the appellant was found to be a drug addict and even if it\n\ncould be assumed that he was consuming four to five sachets a day prior to his arrest,\n\nthese factors by themselves were, in our determination, not sufficient to warrant the view\n\nthat those six packets were not for the purposes of trafficking. In our evaluation, the\n\nlearned trial judge had carefully considered the entire spectrum of defence raised and in\n\nthe end had seen fit to reject it on the basis that the accounts narrated by the appellant\n\ndefied credence.24 In our judgment, the prosecution had amply discharged the onus\n\nplaced on it by proving the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. The\n\nstatutory presumption that he trafficked in that quantity of drugs arose under s 17 of the\n\nMDA and as the trial judge found, he had not rebutted the presumption on the balance of\n\nprobabilities. On this, we entirely agreed with the learned trial judge. There was no\n\nmerit in the appeal and we accordingly dismissed it.Appeal dismissedL P TheanChao Hick TinM P H RubinJudge of AppealJudge of AppealJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
