        "Introduction": "1          When should the court lend its assistance to prospective or ongoing arbitration proceedings? How should the court exercise its powers in this regard? These issues often bedevil both counsel and the court alike given the present-day prevalence of arbitration agreements. In these grounds of decision, we attempt to elucidate the legal position in the hope that the arbitral community will find it helpful. In particular, we wish to clarify the circumstances in which it may be appropriate for parties to an arbitration agreement to seek the assistance of the courts. 2          This was an appeal by NCC International AB (“the appellant”) against the refusal of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) to grant an interlocutory mandatory injunction pending arbitration inNCC International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd[2007] SGHC 64(“the GD”). Having carefully considered the submissions of both parties, we dismissed the appeal. We now give the detailed grounds for our decision.",
        "The facts": "3          The appellant is the main contractor for the construction of underground train stations and tunnels at Upper Paya Lebar and Macpherson for the Circle Line of the Mass Rapid Transit system. Under the contract between the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) and the appellant (“the Main Contract”), the construction works (“the Works”) were scheduled for completion on 30 November 2007. 4          Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd (“the respondent”) was the supplier of ready-mixed concrete to the appellant pursuant to a letter of award dated 26 July 2006 (“the Letter of Award”) and a contract of the same date (“the Concrete Contract”). 5          The Letter of Award contained various terms on which the respondent was to supply ready-mixed concrete to the appellant. These included preparing the necessary submission requirements for approval by the LTA’s engineer (“the Engineer”), guaranteeing the quality of the ready-mixed concrete and guaranteeing delivery to the appellant subject to a minimum notice period of one day. 6          The Concrete Contract contained,inter alia, two additional terms. The first was a “firm price” clause (cl 10), which provided that: The Domestic Sub-contract rates [ie, the rates set out in para 1.0 of the Letter of Award] shall not be adjusted for any price fluctuation in the cost of labour, materials, goods … or for any changes in current legislation or regulations … The second was a dispute resolution clause (cl 80), which provided that: If any dispute or difference shall arise between the Domestic Sub-contractor [ie, the respondent] and the Main Contractor [ie, the appellant] in connection with or arising out of the Domestic Sub-Contract [ie, the Concrete Contract] … such dispute or difference shall be referred to the following course for settlement in the same manner as that stated under clause 71 in the Main Contract. 7          In turn, cl 71 of the Main Contract provided that any dispute was to be referred in the first place to the Engineer, and, if there was dissatisfaction with the Engineer’s decision, the dispute was to be referred to the Singapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”) for mediation in accordance with the rules of the SMC. If mediation was unsuccessful, the dispute would then be referred to arbitration according to the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“the SIAC Rules”). Before us, both parties accepted that cl 80 of the Concrete Contract read with cl 71 of the Main Contract constituted an arbitration agreement. 8          The present dispute arose following the decision of the Indonesian government in late January 2007 to ban the export of sand – one of the essential ingredients of ready-mixed concrete – to Singapore with effect from 6 February 2007. This decision sent shock waves throughout the local construction industry, which depended primarily, if not solely, on sand from Indonesia. 9          The Singapore government soon intervened via the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) and the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (“SCAL”). On 1 February 2007, the SCAL issued a circular to its members (including the appellant) stating that “BCA has agreed to supply sand directly to contractors for onward delivery to ready-mixed concrete suppliers, precaster [sic] and those contractors with onsite batching”. A few days later, on 3 February 2007, the SCAL issued a more comprehensive advisory (“the SCAL Advisory”) setting out in detail the BCA’s procedure for distributing sand which was to be released from the Government’s stockpile. 10        Unfortunately, the appellant and the respondent failed to agree on how to collect and pay for the sand distributed by the BCA. Although the BCA approved the appellant’s applications for a few weeks’ worth of sand supplies, the sand requested for by the appellant (“the allocated sand”) went uncollected. From 2 February 2007, the respondent stopped supplying ready-mixed concrete to the appellant, save for small quantities required to maintain the structural integrity of the Works. 11        In the ensuing exchange of correspondence between the parties, the appellant took the position that the respondent should collect the allocated sand and supply ready-mixed concrete to it at the fixed price stipulated in the Letter of Award, as provided for under cl 10 of the Concrete Contract. In contrast, the respondent took the position that the appellant should arrange for delivery of the allocated sand to the respondent’s batching site according to the BCA’s procedure and that the Concrete Contract should be renegotiated. However, neither party suggested submitting the dispute to the Engineer or commencing mediation or arbitration in accordance with cl 71 of the Main Contract. 12        On 15 March 2007, the appellant applied via Originating Summons No 429 of 2007 for an interlocutory mandatory injunction (“the Interim Injunction”) that would compel the respondent to deliver ready-mixed concrete which the former had ordered as well as perform the Concrete Contract by continuing to supply ready-mixed concrete in accordance with the terms of that contract. The title of the originating summons contained the words,inter alia, “In the Matter of AnIntended Arbitrationbetween [the appellant] as Claimants and [the respondent] as Respondents” [emphasis added]. In a supporting affidavit filed on the same day, the appellant’s authorised representative stated that the appellant undertook “to commence the arbitration expeditiously”. Nevertheless, at the hearing before us on 23 August 2007, approximately seven months after the dispute arose, counsel for the appellant confessed that he had not had any instructions to proceed with arbitration.Indeed, astonishingly, even the notice to commence arbitration had yet to be issued by the appellant.",
        "The decision below": "13        The Judge focused on the merits of the application for the Interim Injunction. Despite a request by counsel, the Judge made no finding as to whether he was exercising his jurisdiction under the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) or the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“AA”). 14        The Judge dismissed the application on the basis that the appellant had failed to show that it deserved the court’s assistance in terms of issuing the Interim Injunction. He gave three reasons for his decision (at [29] of the GD). First,the appellant was not justified in taking the position that because the Concrete Contract did not specify that the ready-mixed concrete was to be prepared using sand from Indonesia, the appellant did not have to do anything except insist on delivery of the ready-mixed concrete. Second, the appellant had failed to follow the process of dispute resolution set out in the Concrete Contract. Third, the appellant should have availed itself of the measures contained in the SCAL Advisory so as to obtain the sand which it needed. 15        Although the Judge expressed wariness about prejudging the appellant’s likelihood of succeeding at the arbitration proceedings to be initiated, he concluded that the arbitrator would most likely adopt “a broad perspective” (at [30] of the GD) in deciding the dispute and that the appellant could not be said to be assured of obtaining an order for specific performance of the Concrete Contract at the arbitration.",
        "The arguments on appeal": "16        Taking the Judge’s cue, both parties focused their arguments before this court on the merits of the application for the Interim Injunction. The appellant sought to persuade us that it had a high chance of succeeding at the arbitration (in terms of obtaining an order for specific performance of the Concrete Contract) based on a literal construction of the Concrete Contract and because damages would not be an adequate remedy since the respondent’s failure to supply ready-mixed concrete had halted the Works. The respondent, on the other hand, advanced the doctrine of frustration to show that the appellant was unlikely to succeed at the arbitration, and also argued that, even if the appellant did succeed, damages would be adequate compensation because the appellant’s damages could be quantified. Further, the respondent submitted that the appellant had failed to demonstrate any urgency warranting the grant of the Interim Injunction because,inter alia, the latter had not asked for the present appeal to be treated as an expedited appeal. 17        Unfortunately, both parties dealt only peripherally with the issue of whether the court could and should intervene in the light of the pending arbitration proceedings. The appellant’s position was that the court’s power to provide interim relief in these circumstances was founded on the IAA, and that such power should be exercised in this instance because the merits of the case warranted it. In contrast, the respondent contended that the applicable legislation was the AA, and not the IAA, because the appellant had a business office in Singapore and that, under the AA, the court had no power to grant an interim injunction when arbitration proceedings were either pending or ongoing.",
        "Our decision": "18        In the ensuing analysis, we set out our view on the proper role of the court in providing interim relief when arbitration proceedings are pending or in progress under the IAA and the AA, respectively. Based on the legal principles that emerged from our analysis, we came to the conclusion that the appellant’s conduct amounted to an abuse of process. As our decision was unaffected by whether the court’s jurisdiction was founded on the IAA or the AA, we did not make any finding as to which of these statutes was applicable on the facts of this appeal. 19        We also considered the substantive merits of the appellant’s application for the Interim Injunction. We found that the Judge had, in the exercise of his discretion, correctly refused to grant the relief sought, an interim mandatory injunction being, it must be emphasised, a very exceptional remedy.",
        "The role of the court in arbitration proceedings": "",
        "Abuse of process": "70        Given the legal principles established above, in view of the facts of the present appeal, the appellant’s conduct amounted to an abuse of the process of the court because the appellant, despite having no genuine intention to commence arbitration, sought the Interim Injunction from the court on the ostensible basis that it intended to commence arbitral proceedings against the respondent (see, in this regard, [12] above). In effect, the appellant was using the curial process to resolve its dispute with the respondent contrary to the arbitration provision in the Concrete Contract. 71        InCheeSiok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs[2006] 1 SLR 582(“Chee Siok Chin”), the High Court set out (at [34]) four categories of proceedings that would amount to an abuse of process, as follows: (a)        proceedings which involve a deception on the court, or are fictitious or constitute a mere sham; (b)        proceedings where theprocess of the court is not being fairly or honestly used but is employed instead for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper way; (c)proceedings which aremanifestly groundlessor without foundationor which serve no useful purpose; (d)        multiple or successive proceedings which cause or are likely to cause improper vexation or oppression. [emphasis in original] 72        AlthoughChee Siok Chinconcerned an application to strike out proceedings, the court’s pronouncement on what constitutes an abuse of process is equally pertinent in this appeal. It is also important to note that the four categories set out in that case are not closed; new categories may be created, depending on the circumstances of the case (seeGabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin[1998] 1 SLR 374at [22], which was endorsed inChee Siok Chinat [38]). 73        In the present appeal, the proceedings fell within the second category stated inChee Siok Chin(see the list in [71] above). The appellant used the court’s process in an improper way as interim relief should rightly have been sought from an arbitral tribunal, as provided for under cl 80 of the Concrete Contract read with cl 71 of the Main Contract (seeLeviathan Shipping([67]supra)). Yet, instead of either submitting its dispute with the respondent to the Engineer or having recourse to mediation or arbitration, the appellant’s first reaction was to apply to court forex parteinterlocutory relief in the form of the Interim Injunction. 74        Further, there was more than a hint that the appellant was using the court’s process for a collateral purpose because it took absolutely no steps to commence arbitration even after the lapse of more than seven months from the time the dispute arose (see [12] above). In addition, like the plaintiffs inChannel Tunnel Group([56]supra), the appellant sought from the court an interlocutory mandatory injunction, which meant that if the application for the Interim Injunction were granted, the court would effectively be ordering specific performance of the Concrete Contract. As this particular issue of whether specific performance of that contract should be ordered fell squarely within the province of the arbitral tribunal, the appellant was in essence requesting the court to nakedly usurp the functions of the arbitral tribunal rather than to assist in or support the intended arbitration.",
        "The exceptional nature of an interim mandatory injunction": "75        In any event, an interim mandatory injunction is a very exceptional discretionary remedy. There is a much higher threshold to be met in order to persuade the court to grant such an injunction as compared to an ordinary prohibitive injunction. Case law has established that the courts will only grant an interim mandatory injunction in clear cases where special circumstances exist (seeChin Bay Ching v Merchant Ventures Pte Ltd[2005] 3 SLR 142at [37] andLocabail International Finance Ltd v Agroexport[1986] 1 WLR 657 at 663–664). 76        In the present appeal, there was no reason to grant the Interim Injunction because there was simply no urgency or pressing need which warranted the ordering of such an interlocutory measure. By the time the appeal came before this court, a lengthy period of time had already elapsed since the dispute first arose. In our view, it could plainly be inferred from the appellant’s inactionvis-à-viscommencing arbitration that the appellant would not suffer inordinate prejudice by waiting for the arbitral tribunal to make a determination. The court was further entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that, by the time this appeal was heard, the construction industry had adjusted to the new market realities. Concrete prices had fallen from a high of about $200 per cubic metre to below $175 per cubic metre, and there were already ten suppliers of ready-mixed concrete in the market (seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(21 May 2007) vol 83 at col 702 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development)). The dire situation so colourfully narrated by the appellant no longer existed. 77        On the merits of the case, therefore, there were no exceptional circumstances which provided a basis for this court to grant the appellant the Interim Injunction.",
        "Conclusion": "78        For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal and awarded costs fixed at $10,000 to the respondent. We also made the usual consequential orders."
