        "Facts": "2.    The relevant facts giving rise to these two appeals are as\n\nfollows. Madam Ho is a widow and was the registered proprietor of a property with a house thereon\n\nknown as 124 Branksome Road (the property). The property comprises a relatively large piece of\n\nland measuring some 15,173 square feet in area. She had lived there for some fifty years since her\n\nlate husband, Dr Foo Chee Guan, purchased it in 1947.3.    Prior to 1996, Madam Ho had mortgaged the property to Keppel\n\nFinance Limited (Keppel) as security for the credit facilities extended to one of her sons,\n\nRobert. Sometime in 1996, Robert informed Madam Ho that he had defaulted on interest payments to\n\nKeppel and the latter had issued a notice recalling the loan granted to him and secured by the\n\nmortgage. Madam Ho then sought the advice of her solicitor, Mr Wong, a conveyancing partner of the\n\nlaw firm of Wong & Lim. She was advised of the consequences of default in payment to Keppel and\n\non his advice decided to sell the property in the open market in the hope of obtaining a better\n\nprice for it.4.    In or around April or May 1996, Madam Ho was introduced by\n\nher daughter, Jeanette, to Ms Lim and her husband, Mr Joseph Wee Woon Chuan (Mr Wee). Ms Lim\n\nwas both a shareholder and director of a property development company known as Derby Development Pte\n\nLtd (Derby), while Mr Wee who was also a director was its project manager. At that time, Ms\n\nLim and Mr Wee representing Derby were interested in purchasing the property and proposed a joint\n\ndevelopment with Madam Ho for the construction of three detached houses on the land, one of which\n\nwas to be retained by Madam Ho while the other two were to be sold to Derby. During the\n\nnegotiations, Madam Ho asked for a sum of $6m together with one of the houses to be built on the\n\nproperty as the price for the property. Derby, on the other hand, counter-offered the sum of $4.2m\n\ntogether with one completed house for the property, and required Madam Ho to mortgage the property\n\nto a bank or financial institution to raise the necessary finance for the proposed development. On\n\nMr Wongs advice, Madam Ho decided not to participate in the joint development.5.    Subsequently, on 15 July 1996, Derby offered to buy\n\ntwo-thirds of the property for the sum of $4.2m together with a fully-constructed house costing at\n\nleast $700,000 to be built by Derby on the remaining one-third of the land of Madam Ho. Madam Ho\n\nagreed to this offer. On 17 July 1996, she accepted a sum of $88,000 from Derby as Ernest Money\n\nfor the Re-development of 124 Branksome Road. Following the payment of this amount, on 25 July\n\n1996, Madam Ho gave written permission to Derby to apply to the relevant authority for planning\n\npermission for the redevelopment of the property, and Mr Wong, as her solicitor, was instructed to\n\nproceed with the preparation of the agreement for the sale of two-thirds of the property as\n\ncontemplated by the parties.6.    What Mr Wong came up with was an option to be given by Madam\n\nHo to Derby, which upon exercise thereof would become a contract. On 16 August 1996, he sent a copy\n\nof the draft option to WLAW, the solicitors for Derby, for their consideration.7.    There arose subsequently a change of parties to the proposed\n\npurchase. Ms Lim informed Madam Ho that Derby had failed to secure a construction loan for the\n\ndevelopment of the property but that Ms Lim herself was able to obtain an overdraft facility in the\n\namount of $6.1m from the bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC). Under the terms\n\noffered by OCBC, $3.7m of the facility was to be used to pay for part of the cost for the land,\n\n$2.2m was to be used to pay for the costs of construction of the three houses, and the balance of\n\n$200,000 was to be used to service the interest accruing on the amounts borrowed. The overdraft\n\nfacility was to be secured by a first legal mortgage on the entire property. A copy of the offer\n\ndocument from OCBC was furnished to Madam Ho, who on Mr Wongs advice, agreed to substitute Ms Lim\n\nas the purchaser of the property in place of Derby.8.    On 12 September 1996, Ms Jennifer Leong (Ms Leong),\n\nthe solicitor in charge of this matter at WLAW, returned the draft option to Mr Wong with various\n\namendments. There ensued some lengthy correspondence in exchange between the two firms of solicitors\n\non the terms of the draft option. Whatever difficulties there were confronting the parties in\n\narriving at a mutually satisfactory draft were probably compounded by the fact that, as the property\n\non completion of the purchase was to be mortgaged to OCBC, the interests of the bank would have to\n\nbe taken into account and incorporated therein. At that time, Ms Leong was also acting for OCBC in\n\nthe mortgage of the property. In one of her letters to Mr Wong, she wrote that her clients\n\nfinanciers ( i.e. OCBC) required the land area of Madam Hos plot to be capped at 5,030 sq. feet,\n\nand the relevant clause in the option should be amended to reflect this requirement. This was agreed\n\nto by Madam Ho.9.    Eventually all the terms of the option were settled and\n\nagreed. The salient terms were as follows:3 The Cash Sale Price of the property is SINGAPORE DOLLARS FOUR MILLION AND\n\n    TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ONLY (S$4,200,000), subject to special conditions enumerated below...17. The Purchaser is entitled to create a paramount mortgage over the\n\n    property.The Law Societys Conditions of Sale 1994 were incorporated in the terms of the\n\nsale, in so far as they were not inconsistent with those terms and were not varied thereby. The\n\ngeneral terms and conditions of sale are not contentious. In addition, there are special conditions\n\nto the sale and the material terms thereof are the following:SPECIAL CONDITIONS18(a). In addition to the payment of S$4.2 million by the Purchaser, the\n\n  Purchaser shall deliver a completed detached bungalow unit to the Vendor free from encumbrances.\n\n  The Vendor shall be at liberty to choose any one of the three units approved by the relevant\n\n  authority (\"the Vendors Unit\") within 1 month from the date full details of the\n\n  approved drawings by the Architect appointed by the Purchaser (\"the said Architect\")\n\n  have been presented to the Vendor18(b) Pursuant to clause 18(a) the Purchaser shall ensure that the approved\n\n  plan shall not comprise any individual unit with a land area exceeding 5,030 square feet or 5%\n\n  more than each of the other units. Should any unit exceed the land area stated above which compels\n\n  the Vendor to choose a unit of less than 5,030 square feet the Vendor shall be entitled to a\n\n  monetary compensation calculated at $503.00 per square foot for every square foot of the Vendors\n\n  Unit less than 5,050 square feet.19. The Purchaser shall obtain consent from the paramount mortgagee to allow\n\n  the Vendor to lodge a caveat over the Vendors Unit as soon as the private lot is allotted...22 In addition to the cash payment of S$4.2 million and the delivery of one\n\n  completed unit to the Vendor the Purchaser shall account to the Vendor as one-half of the\n\n  consideration in excess of S$3.8 million for each of the remaining 2 units after deduction of the\n\n  costs incurred in the sale thereof. ....25. Notwithstanding completion of sale and purchase herein the terms and\n\n  conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect between the Vendor and the\n\n  Purchaser in so far as the same are not fulfilled and shall not merge in the assurance of the said\n\n  property on completion of the sale and purchaser herein or upon registration of such assurance.\n\n  ..10.    The option was signed by Madam Ho on 26 September 1996 and\n\nwas issued soon thereafter to Ms Lim. On 14 October 1996, Ms Lim paid Madam Ho the sum of $332,000\n\nand exercised the option and thereupon a binding sale and purchase agreement was made between the\n\nparties. For convenience, we shall hereafter refer to this document as the sale agreement.\n\nBefore that date, in early October 1996, the layout plan for the development of the proposed three\n\nunits of detached houses had been drawn up and settled by Ms Lims architects, Atelier Group\n\nArchitect, and Madam Ho had selected the plot she wanted, namely the plot marked as Plot 3 on\n\nthe plan. This was evident from the letter dated 2 October 1996 written by Derby to WLAW as the\n\nsolicitors for OCBC, indicating the particular plot selected by Madam Ho. The letter said:",
        "RE: 124 BRANKSOME ROAD": "We refer to the above subject matter and as requested by Mrs Ong Lee Foong\n\n    from OCBC on the Plot as selected by Madam Ho Kon Kim, we enclose herewith a Plan from M/s\n\n    Atelier group Architect as\"Marked Plot 3\"as selected for your kind\n\n    attention and transmission.Kindly also be informed that Notice of Provisional Permission has been\n\n    granted 20.9.96 and it was our understanding and agreed between our undersigned and Madam Ho\n\n    that the proposed development for the three units must be of the same plot size and that Madam\n\n    Ho has the first Option to select her one unit for her own occupation and confirm that there are\n\n    no changes in the Plot sizes so as to comply to Chief Planner (URA) requirements.Enclosed in the letter was a plan which delineated the three lots of land on\n\nwhich the three houses were to be built. Hence, as at the date when the sale and purchase agreement\n\nwas made between Madam Ho and Ms Lim, the parties had already reached agreement on the particular\n\nplot of land which Madam Ho had selected and which was to be re-transferred to her on completion of\n\nthe house pursuant to the sale agreement. In other words, plot 3 had been earmarked as the plot\n\nbelonging to Madam Ho and to be transferred to her eventually.11.    The sale of the property to Ms Lim was completed on 15\n\nNovember 1996. On completion, the loan owing to Keppel was repaid and the mortgage in their favour\n\ndischarged. Simultaneously, the property was transferred to Ms Lim and was mortgaged to OCBC as\n\nsecurity for the overdraft facility (described in  7 above). In connection with the overdraft\n\nfacility, OCBC and Ms Lim entered into a Facility Agreement dated 15 November 1996. The relevant\n\nclauses of the agreement provided as follows:15(2) The Bank agrees to discharge the Vendors Unit upon the private lot\n\n    number being allocated to the Vendors Unit subject to the land area of the Vendors Unit\n\n    not being more than 5,030 square feet provided further that the Vendors Unit shall not have a\n\n    land area exceeding more than 5% of each of the other 2 Units.(3) The Bank hereby agrees that upon payment of the Facility of an aggregate\n\n    amount of $3,500,000.00 or 85% of the sale price whichever is higher paid into the Account by\n\n    the individual purchaser or purchaser in respect of each of the remaining 2 Units sold and\n\n    comprised in the Building Project other than the Vendors Unit, the Bank will at any time\n\n    thereafter at the cost of the Borrower, execute a Deed of Release or Partial Discharge of\n\n    Mortgage relating to that Unit.Under cl 1 of the agreement the term Vendor referred to Madam Ho, and the\n\nterm Vendors Unit referred to the unit selected by Madam Ho for her retention in\n\naccordance with the Sale and Purchase Agreement/Option between her and Ms Lim. As we have\n\nrelated, at that time, Madam Hos unit had already been identified and selected by her, namely\n\nplot 3, and this was known to all of them, Ms Lim, Ms Leong and OCBC. This was evident from Derbys\n\nletter dated 2 October 1996 written to Ms Leong (referred to in  10 above). The information stated\n\nin the letter was required by OCBC, and Ms Leong must have informed OCBC accordingly.12.    On 19 June 1997, planning permission for the proposed\n\nerection of 3 units of 2-storey detached dwelling houses each with a basement was granted by\n\nthe competent authority. More particularly, the grant of written permission stated the approved\n\ndevelopment in the following terms:Development of Lot 117-31 Mk 25 at Branksome Road as shown verged red on the\n\n    proposal/sketch plan (3) in DC414/73-2 for a residential development (comprising 3 units) as\n\n    follows:Plot (1) to (3)        edged red each for\n\n    the erection of a 2-storey detached dwelling house with a basement13.    On 17 July 1997, Madam Ho vacated the property and by a\n\nletter dated 18 July 1997, Mr Wong informed WLAW of that fact, and at the same time requested\n\nfor OCBCs permission to lodge a caveat on plot 3 which Madam Ho had selected. There was however\n\nno reply. Another letter dated 23 July 1997 from Mr Wong followed requesting for the same thing.\n\nThere was still no reply forthcoming. Mr Wong repeated his request the third time in August 1997,\n\nand the only response from Ms Leong then was that she was still awaiting her clients\n\ninstructions. Not a word was mentioned by Ms Leong to Mr Wong, nor by Ms Lim to Madam Ho direct, of\n\nthe material changes that Ms Lim had in the meanwhile made to the financing arrangement affecting\n\nthe property.14.    Regrettably, only on 11 June 1998, did Mr Wong lodge a\n\ncaveat on the property to protect Madam Hos interest. It was then discovered, from a title search\n\ncarried out at the Registry of Titles, that Ms Lim had on 9 May 1997 discharged the OCBC mortgage\n\nover the property, and had re-mortgaged it to RHB, as security for credit facilities extended to a\n\nthree-dollar company named Earling Builders Pte Ltd (Ealing) of which Ms Lim and her husband\n\nMr Wee were directors and shareholders. We shall refer to these facilities and the relevant terms\n\nthereof in detail in a moment.15.    When confronted by Madam Ho about the re-mortgage to RHB,\n\nMs Lim confirmed the transactions and explained that she needed more funds to complete the project\n\nand that the re-mortgage was a commercial decision taken by her to obtain borrowings at a better\n\nrate. She assured Madam Ho that she would however complete the project and would deliver one house\n\nto Madam Ho as agreed. As it turned out, that optimism was unwarranted. Not long thereafter, Ms Lim\n\nbecame insolvent and was made a bankrupt. Predictably, her three-dollar company, Earling, also\n\nbecame insolvent and a winding-up order was made against it. Construction works on the property had,\n\nin fact, ceased by September 1998, and the proposed three houses remained uncompleted.16.    Madam Ho, naturally upset and disgruntled at the turn of\n\nevents, decided, no doubt, on the advice of Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah, the latter being the litigation\n\npartner in the same law firm, to commence legal proceedings, claiming against Ms Lim, for breach of\n\ntrust, against RHB for knowing receipt of trust property and against their solicitors WLAW for\n\nknowingly assisting Ms Lim and RHB in the breach of trust.",
        "The decision below": "17.    The trial judge dismissed Madam Hos claims against all\n\nthe defendants. She held that the action for breach of trust against Ms Lim could not be sustained\n\nas there was no fiduciary relationship between her and Madam Ho and that Ms Lim had done her best to\n\ncomply with her obligations to Madam Ho under the sale agreement. Her eventual failure to convey a\n\nhouse back to Madam Ho was the result only of the 1997 regional economic crisis.18.    The judge referred extensively to the text of the sale\n\nagreement in reaching this conclusion, and in particular to its heading which read 124 Branksome\n\nRoad and to the words contained in the body of the sale agreement to the effect that Madam Ho\n\noffered to sell the above-mentioned property. Regard was further had to the transfer and the\n\nfact that Consideration therein was described as being Singapore dollars four million and\n\ntwo hundred thousand ($4,200,000) cash consideration and one (1) detached house to be constructed by\n\nthe Transferee for the Transferor. She held that all these, taken collectively, showed that\n\nregardless of whatever Madam Ho may have intended, the sale agreement had the effect of disposing of\n\nthe entire property to Ms Lim. No trust could be found in favour of Madam Ho as she had received\n\ngood and valuable consideration for the entire piece of land.19.    As for RHB and WLAW, the judge held that no constructive\n\ntrust could arise against them. With respect to the latter, she held that they did not owe any duty\n\nof care to act in the interests of Madam Ho, who was not their client. She went on to suggest that a\n\nfortiori, the action against RHB was unsustainable, given the lack of privity between them and Madam\n\nHo. In view of ss 47 and 49 of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157), the learned judge held that even\n\nactual knowledge on RHBs part of Ms Lims contractual obligation to build and convey a bungalow\n\nto Madam Ho did not amount to fraud, rendering RHBs title under the mortgage indefeasible.20.    In the light of the above, the judge dismissed Madam Hos\n\nclaims against all of the defendants. She found no evidence of a want of probity or any\n\nunconscionable conduct on the part of the defendants which warranted the imposition of a\n\nconstructive trust.21.    Pursuant to the courts powers under O 58 r 8 of the\n\nRules of Court, the judge further ordered Mr Ponniah and Mr Wong to pay the costs which Madam Ho was\n\nordered to pay to WLAW and RHB. In this regard, the judge held that Mr Ponniahs and Mr Wongs\n\nconduct in instituting a suit against WLAW and RHB amounted to an abuse of process of the court.Civil Appeal No. 164 of 200122.    We turn first to the appeal by Madam Ho against the\n\ndismissal of her claim against Ms Lim and RHB. The principal issues arising in this appeal are as\n\nfollows:(i) whether under the sale agreement Madam Ho has an equitable interest in the\n\n  property, after she had sold and transferred it to Ms Lim;(ii) if the answer is in the affirmative, whether Ms Lim acted in breach of\n\n  trust by discharging the OCBC mortgage over the property and re-mortgaging it to RHB;(iii) if the answers to the questions are in the affirmative, whether RHB hold\n\n  the mortgage subject to the equitable interest of Madam Ho.",
        "Matrix of circumstances": "23.    The first issue turns on whether under the sale agreement\n\nMadam Ho retains or has any interest in the property after she had sold and transferred it to Ms\n\nLim. In considering this issue, it is necessary to have regard to the matrix of circumstances in\n\nwhich the sale agreement was made. The first thing we note is that what the parties contemplated at\n\nthe material time was not an out and out sale of the entire property by Madam Ho to a developer for\n\ndevelopment, and a re-sale by the developer to Madam Ho of a subdivided lot of the property together\n\nwith the proposed development thereon. Initially, the developer contemplated was Derby, but later Ms\n\nLim was substituted as the developer for the simple reason that she was able to obtain financing\n\nfrom OCBC. Secondly, the property for development purposes has a limited area of 15,173 square feet,\n\nand its potential for development was limited. At most, only three detached houses would be allowed\n\nto be built thereon, and that was the development the parties had in mind when they were negotiating\n\nthe transaction. Thirdly, Madam Ho, who had been living there for nearly fifty years, not\n\nunnaturally required for herself one of the houses proposed to be built by the developer. This\n\nrequirement appeared to be acceptable to the developer, as initially the parties were talking of a\n\njoint development, which Madam Ho later rejected. What the parties then contemplated was a sale of\n\nthe property by Madam Ho to the developer with a view to it being re-developed by the construction\n\nof three detached houses thereon with one of them being earmarked for and eventually to be\n\nre-transferred to her free of any payment. If the development as contemplated had been successful,\n\nMadam Ho would at the end of the day have re-transferred to her a subdivided lot with a detached\n\nhouse built on it free of any payment, and the developer would retain or sell to third parties the\n\nother two subdivided lots with similar houses built on them respectively. Putting it in another way,\n\nif subdivision approval of the property into three subdivided lots had been obtained and separate\n\ndocument of title to each lot had been issued, the contemplated sale would be an out and out sale of\n\ntwo of the subdivided lots at a price comprising: (i) a certain sum in cash, and (ii) the\n\nconstruction of a house on the unsold subdivided lot retained by Madam Ho. As this was not the case,\n\nthe property could not be dealt with in that way; hence the parties proceeded by way of an agreement\n\nwith a view to giving effect to what the parties then contemplated. On that basis, rightly or\n\nwrongly, the agreement was drawn up and the terms were agreed to. It was in the form of an option\n\nwhich was exercised by Ms Lim. We do not find it necessary for our purpose to pass any judgment on\n\nthe merits of the sale agreement. We are only concerned with the construction of the sale agreement\n\nas agreed to by the parties.The subject of the sale24.    We now turn to the terms of the sale agreement. The subject\n\nof the sale was expressed to be the whole of the property and that was also expressed to be so in\n\nthe transfer, which was registered, and on the register of title Ms Lim is the sole registered\n\nproprietor of the entire property. The consideration for the sale as expressed in the agreement had\n\ntwo components: (i) the sum of $4.2m, and (ii) the construction of a house estimated to cost about\n\n$700,000 on the subdivided lot of the property which Madam Ho had selected and agreed to by Ms Lim,\n\nnamely the lot marked as plot 3, which was to be re-transferred to Madam Ho free of any payment.\n\nInsofar as first component is concerned, it had been paid, and nothing in the point arises. The\n\nsecond component is provided for in special conditions 18(a) and (b), the full terms of which have\n\nbeen set out in  9 above. Under special condition 18 (a), Ms Lim agreed to deliver to Madam\n\nHo a completed detached bungalow unit and to allow Madam Ho to choose one of the three units.\n\nThe second part of this condition had been satisfied in that Madam Ho had chosen the unit, namely,\n\nplot 3. Special condition 18 (b) was inserted as required by OCBC and was intended to limit\n\nexpressly the area of the subdivided lot to be re-transferred to Madam Ho, such subdivided lot not\n\nto exceed 5,030 square feet, which is approximately one-third of the area of the land. There was\n\ncertainly an obligation on the part of Ms Lim to build a house on the subdivided lot marked as plot\n\n3 lot estimated to cost about $700,000 and on completion to re-transfer that lot to Madam Ho free\n\nfrom encumbrances and without any payment from Madam Ho. The end result is that no amount will be\n\npaid by Madam Ho for this subdivided lot. The question is whether any amount was paid by Ms Lim for\n\nthis particular lot in the purchase of the property under the sale agreement. Plainly not, as a\n\nmatter of simple deduction. Obviously the price of $4.2m as stated in the sale agreement was\n\ncalculated on the basis of the area of the land alone, and obviously too that price did not, on our\n\nanalysis, include a sum payable for the particular lot earmarked for Madam Ho. In so far as any\n\npayment is concerned, no amount was paid by Ms Lim for that lot upon the purchase of the property by\n\nher under the sale agreement, and by the same token no amount will be paid by Madam Ho on the\n\nre-transfer. As this lot was to comprise only an area of 5,030 square feet, which is about one-third\n\nof the area of the land, Ms Lim paid only a price representing approximately two-thirds of the\n\nagreed value of the property.25.    As between the parties to the sale agreement, a subdivided\n\nlot, namely plot 3 had been earmarked for Madam Ho and was intended to be hers. There was certainly\n\nan obligation on the part of Ms Lim to build a house thereon and on completion to re-transfer that\n\nlot to Madam Ho. Special condition 19 of the sale agreement gave Madam Ho the right to lodge a\n\ncaveat as soon as the private lot was allotted to her unit, subject to the consent of the paramount\n\nmortgagee. The requirement of obtaining such consent did not detract from the right of Madam Ho to\n\nlodge a caveat in respect of the lot selected by and earmarked for her. It is also significant that\n\nin the facility agreement made between OCBC and Ms Lim a clause was inserted there to provide for\n\nthe unconditional discharge of Madam Hos unit without any payment, once the private lot had been\n\nallotted. Such a clause was intended to protect Madam Hos interest in the property,\n\nnotwithstanding the mortgage of the entire property. From the transaction as structured in the sale\n\nagreement it was intended that Madam Ho should retain and have a beneficial interest in the plot\n\nselected by her, namely plot 3, and in our judgment, Madam Ho has a beneficial interest in that plot\n\nand Ms Lim holds the beneficial interest of Madam Ho in trust for Madam Ho. The judge below, with\n\nrespect, erred in holding that Madam Ho had no equitable interest in the property on the ground that\n\nshe had transferred the entire property to Ms Lim who became the registered proprietor thereof.Indefeasibility of title of Ms Lim26.    What Ms Lim did at the trial and before us in defence of\n\nthe claim by Madam Ho is to set up the absolute character of the transfer of the property to her and\n\nher title to the property as the registered proprietor to defeat the equitable interest of Madam Ho.\n\nThis defence is presumably based on s 46(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1994 ed), which is to\n\nthe effect that a proprietor of registered land holds the land free from all encumbrances, liens,\n\nestates and interest whatsoever except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register.\n\nOn the basis of this section, it is submitted on behalf of Ms Lim that as Madam Ho had not lodged a\n\ncaveat to protect her equitable interest, Ms Lim by virtue of that section holds the property free\n\nfrom that interest. We shall consider this section together with s 47 of the Act in a moment. For\n\nthe present purpose, it is sufficient to say that the short answer to this argument is that s 46(1)\n\nhas no application as between Ms Lim and Madam Ho. Section 46(2) of the Act provides:2) Nothing in this section shall be held to prejudice the rights and remedies\n\n  of any person(a) ..(b) to enforce against a proprietor any contract to which that proprietor was\n\n    a party;(c) to enforce against a proprietor who is a trustee the provisions of the\n\n    trust;(d) ..(e) ..Therefore, as between Madam Ho and Ms Lim, who were the parties to the agreement,\n\nit is not open to Ms Lim to say that the titled she acquired to the property was held free of that\n\nequitable interest of Madam Ho.27.    If any further authority is required in support, we need\n\nonly to quote the following passage of the judgment of Skerrett CJ of the New Zealand Supreme Court\n\ninTataurangi Tairuakena and Ors v Mua Carr and Ors[1927] NZLR 688at 702:It was further contended that the registration of the lease under the\n\n  provisions of the Land Transfer Act confers an indefeasible title upon the respondent Carr. I\n\n  think that this contention is wholly untenable. The provisions of the Land Transfer Act as to\n\n  indefeasibility of title have no reference either to contracts entered into by the registered\n\n  proprietor himself or to obligations under trusts created by him or arising out of fiduciary\n\n  relations which spring from his own acts contemporaneously with or subsequent to the registration\n\n  of his interest. This principle appears to be well settled in Australia: SeeCuthbertson v Swan11 SALR 102,Groongall Pastoral Co Ltd v Falkiner35 CLR 157, 163, andBarry v Heider19 CLR 197.This passage was quoted with approval by this Court inHSBC Trustee\n\n(Singapore) Ltd and Anor v Lycee Francais de Singapur[1996] 2 SLR 24at 38.",
        "Breach of trust by Ms Lim": "28.    There is no doubt that the sale of the property by Madam Ho\n\nto Ms Lim in terms of the sale agreement was closely linked to the overdraft facility provided by\n\nOCBC and secured by the mortgage over the property. During their negotiations for the sale and\n\npurchase of the property, Ms Lim or Mr Wee gave to Madam Ho a copy of the letter of offer of\n\nfacility by OCBC, and the facility offered was expressly required by OCBC to be used for the\n\nconstruction of the development on the property. This was in a way an assurance to Madam Ho that\n\nthere would be a source of funds available for the development as contemplated by the parties. The\n\nsale agreement in draft  at that time it was a draft option  was shown to OCBC which was fully\n\napprised of the transaction, and OCBC required the area of the lot earmarked for Madam Ho to be\n\nlimited to 5,030 square feet, which is about one-third of the area of the property, and this was\n\nprovided for in special condition 18(b) of the sale agreement. Thus, the sale agreement as drafted\n\nincorporated the requirement of OCBC. OCBC in turn, in the Facility Agreement, which was\n\nsupplemental to the mortgage, by cl 15(2) recognised Madam Hos interest in the property. This\n\nprovision is of great importance to Madam Ho, and Ms Lim was clearly aware of it. It was a\n\nstipulation agreed to between her and OCBC and was intended to give some protection to Madam Ho of\n\nher interest in the property, notwithstanding the mortgage of the whole property to OCBC.29.    It is true that there was nothing in the agreement that\n\nprohibited or restrained Ms Lim from switching from OCBC to RHB and obtaining fresh finance from the\n\nlatter. Nor had Ms Lim given an undertaking separately to that effect. However, what Ms Lim did was\n\nmore than merely switching banks to obtain finance for the development to be carried out on the\n\nproperty. She made use of the property purely for her own purposes: she used the property to secure\n\nloans and advances made or to be made to her three-dollar company for purposes which had no relation\n\nto the proposed development of the three houses on the property. Madam Ho has an equitable interest\n\nin the property which Ms Lim holds in trust for her (Madam Ho). It is implicit in that trust that Ms\n\nLim was to use the property to secure facilities to be used for carrying out the proposed\n\ndevelopment on the property. There is no question that Ms Lim was aware of her obligation to Madam\n\nHo. She surreptitiously switched the banks and deliberately hid from Madam Ho the fact that she had\n\ndischarged the OCBC mortgage over the property and re-mortgaged it to RHB to secure facilities\n\ngranted or to be granted to Earling. This is evident from the fact that as late as July and August\n\n1997, when Mr Wong, very belatedly, wrote to Ms Leong seeking the consent of OCBC to lodge the\n\ncaveat, not a word was forthcoming from Ms Leong, or for that matter from Ms Lim, of the change of\n\nbanks and the facilities then granted and secured by the mortgage on the property. The only response\n\nfrom Ms Leong was that she was awaiting her clients instructions. Ms Lims conduct was truly\n\nindefensible and there was clearly a want of probity on her part. In our judgment, Ms Lim committed\n\na breach of trust in relation to Madam Hos equitable interest in the property.",
        "Appeal against RHB": "30.    The appeal against RHB raises a difficult of point of law.\n\nThe facts, however, are clear. In mid-April 1997 or thereabouts, Ms Lim and Mr Wee sought financing\n\nfrom RHB for their company, Earling, on the security of the property. There was evidence that in\n\ntheir application to the bank for finance, Ms Lim and/or Mr Wee disclosed the sale agreement made\n\nwith Madam Ho. Certainly the bank was aware of the proposed development of three detached houses on\n\nthe property. Ms Leong again acted for RHB as well as Ms Lim in the mortgage. It is not in dispute\n\nthat the bank had notice of Madam Hos interest in the property, and in particular was aware that\n\none of the three subdivided lots was earmarked for Madam Ho, and Ms Lim had an obligation to build a\n\nhouse thereon and to re-transfer it to Madam Ho free of payment. Further, the bank must have known\n\nthat plot 3 had been selected by Madam Ho and that that was the lot earmarked for Madam Ho which was\n\nto be re-transferred to her. Certainly Ms Leong was fully aware that plot 3 was the particular lot\n\nearmarked for Madam Ho which was to be re-transferred to her and acting for RHB she must have\n\ninformed the bank of that fact. After all, she had previously acted for OCBC in the mortgage and\n\nknew that this information was required by OCBC in connection with the mortgage of the property, and\n\nin her advice to RHB she must have conveyed this information the bank.31.    In the credit application form of RHB dated 14 April 1997,\n\nthe following note was made:One of the detached houses will be given to the previous owner as part of the\n\n    deal.and in addition the following comment was stated as the background information:Mr Wee bought the property at 124 Branksome Road Singapore for S$4.2m with\n\n    the condition that one of the newly constructed detached house be given to the seller. One of\n\n    the remaining 2 units will be sold to his good friend and a valued customer of Bukit Timah\n\n    Branch, Mr Tan Ang Piow of Sitley Timber Pte Ltd for S$3.5m. The other unit will be sold and is\n\n    expected to fetch at least S$4m.Further, in the internal memo dated 5 May 1997 and written by Mr Choong Siew Meng,\n\nthe branch manager, to Ms Fadlum A Kadir, the manager of the legal department, the following\n\nobservation was made:(1) OD is not meant for construction loan.(2) Note that T/L of S$3m is to be repaid upon the issuance of TOP, i.e. one\n\n    unit will be sold to repay the T/L.(3) Balance S$2m will therefore be secured by the last unit valued for S$4.2m\n\n    upon completion. Currently, there is an offer to buy over the 2nd unit for S$3.9 million.(4) Whilst the 3rd unit is to be transferred to the previous land owner free\n\n    of payment.Therefore we do not see the need to impose any condition in view that the\n\n  borrowing is based on land prices valued for $8m and T/L to be repaid upon the issue of TOP.Thus in their evaluation of the security RHB valued the property in a sum between\n\n$7m and $8m, excluding the value of the lot agreed to be re-transferred to Madam Ho.32.    Finally, in the Regulating Agreement made between Ms Lim as\n\nthe mortgagor, Earling as the borrower and RHB as the mortgagee, which was expressed to be\n\nsupplemental to the mortgage of the property and was dated the same date as the mortgage, i.e. 9 May\n\n1997, cl 6 of the agreement provided as follows:6. REPAYMENT(1) The Mortgagor and the Borrower hereby jointly and severally covenant to pay\n\n  to the Bank in full the Term Loan on the expiry of three (3) months from issuance by the relevant\n\n  authority of the Temporary Occupation Permit for the three (3) units of 2-storey detached houses\n\n  on the land comprised in the Mortgaged Property or by the 31stday of March 1999\n\n  whichever is the earlier.(2) In the event that partial discharge of any of the three (3) units of\n\n  2-storey detached houses is required, all payments received by the Bank from the sale price of the\n\n  units shall be applied towards repayment of the Term Loan and any of the banking facilities or any\n\n  moneys owing to the Bank in any manner deemed fit by the Bank subject as follows:-(a) A partial discharge of the Legal Mortgage will be given for the first\n\n    unit upon the Banks receipt of eight-five percent (85%) of the sale price which shall have to\n\n    be sufficient to make full payment of all moneys outstanding under the Term Loan;(b) A partial discharge of the Legal Mortgage will be given free of payment\n\n    for the second unit provided that the second unit is transferred to the previous land owner or\n\n    as he may direct in accordance with the agreement between the Mortgagor and the previous land\n\n    owner;(c) The third unit will remain mortgaged to the Bank to secure the balance of\n\n    the banking facilities and the Mortgagor and the Borrower shall seek the Banks prior consent\n\n    in writing on the sale price prior to selling the third unit. A discharge of the third unit will\n\n    be given upon the Banks receipt of eight-five (85%) of the sale price which shall have to be\n\n    sufficient to make full payment of all the banking facilities then outstanding by the Mortgagor\n\n    and the Borrower to the Bank under the Mortgage, this agreement and the loan Agreement.33.    Before we proceed further, we should deal with the\n\nconstruction of this clause. It provided for a partial discharge of the three units of detached\n\nhouses intended to be built on the property and was expressed to be subject to the three paragraphs\n\nfollowing, namely, (a), (b) and (c). It is quite clear from the contents of these paragraphs that\n\neach paragraph was independent of the others and each applied to a particular situation when it came\n\nto discharging the particular unit concerned. First, paragraph (a) applied to the unit which was to\n\nbe sold. The bank would discharge the mortgage on this unit upon receipt of 85% of the proceeds of\n\nsale of that unit which would be sufficient to pay off the full amount of the term loan. As stated\n\nin the internal memo of 5 May 1997 (referred to in  31 above), the term loan of $3m was to be paid\n\nfrom the proceeds of sale of one of two units intended to be sold. Next, we come to paragraph (b).\n\nThat paragraph applied to the second unit i.e. Madam Hos unit, and it provided specifically\n\nthat a discharge of the mortgage over this unit was to be given free of payment, and the only\n\ncondition or term attached to it was this: provided that the second unit is to be transferred to\n\nthe previous landowner, i.e. Madam Ho, or as she may direct in accordance with the sale\n\nagreement. Lastly, paragraph (c) applied to the third unit, which was to remain mortgaged to the\n\nbank to secure the balance of the banking facilities and would be discharged only on certain terms\n\nand conditions. We are therefor unable to accept the contention advanced on behalf of RHB that the\n\ndischarge of the mortgage of Madam Hos unit was subject to the payment of 85% of the proceeds of\n\nsale of first unit or the third unit.34.    Returning to cl 6(2) and in particular paragraph (b)\n\nthereof, we do not think that it is a term or condition which RHB on their own initiative offered or\n\nprovided. They were advised by Ms Leong and they knew that Madam Ho had an equitable interest in the\n\nproperty and that interest was an unregistered interest. At least, Ms Leong acting for them\n\ncertainly knew this, and this information must have been conveyed to them. The inference we draw is\n\nthat Ms Leong must have advised the bank accordingly. They could, as a mortgagee, have taken the\n\nmortgage of the property free of any unregistered interest. They did not have to acknowledge or\n\nrecognise such interest. But the fact of the matter was that they did. Indeed, they did more than\n\nrecognising it.35.    There was evidence that cl 6(2) was a term which was\n\nspecifically negotiated and agreed to between Ms Lim and RHB which reflected their common\n\nunderstanding of Ms Lims obligations to Madam Ho under the sale agreement. Ms Lim in her\n\naffidavit evidence said that by that provision, namely cl 6(2) she had taken the necessary\n\nprecautions to preserve the plaintiffs [Madam Hos] interest in obtaining one (1) bungalow unit\n\nfree from encumbrances as was [Ms Lims] obligations under the agreement. She then said:This understanding is bolstered by the fact that Sime Bank [RHB Bank] was\n\n  always aware of my said obligations to the Plaintiff. Sime Bank had clearly informed me that they\n\n  would respect my said obligations within the Regulating Agreement between Sime Bank and me so that\n\n  the Plaintiff would receive her bungalow unit free from encumbrances.In her evidence in court she said that if cl 6(2) were not inserted in the\n\nRegulating Agreement, she would not have taken the loan from RHB. There was no finding by the judge\n\nbelow on this point; however, it seems to us that what she said was substantially the truth. We\n\nthink that the term was specifically negotiated and agreed to between Ms Lim and RHB. In that\n\nrespect, Ms Leong, as the lawyer acting for both parties, must have played her part in advising on\n\nthe requirement of that clause. Her understanding of the purpose of this clause is also significant.\n\nIn her letter to Mr Wong on 23 August 1999, Ms Leong said:Sime Bank acknowledges that one unit (your clients) will be discharged\n\n  free of payment on condition that the said unit is transferred to you client being the previous\n\n  land owner or as she may direct in accordance with the agreement between you client and Madam\n\n  Betsy Lim.36.    Therefore in taking the mortgage on the property RHB not\n\nonly had notice and full knowledge of the equitable interest of Madam Ho in the property but also\n\nacknowledged and recognised her interest. In their evaluation of the property as security for the\n\nfacilities granted to Earling, they had discounted the value of her interest and was quite prepared\n\nto discharge the mortgage over her lot free of any payment. In addition, by the Regulating Agreement\n\nthey not only acknowledged the interest of Madam Ho in the lot earmarked for her but also agreed\n\n(with Ms Lim) that the lot would be discharged without any payment. In these circumstances, the\n\nquestion that arises is whether it is unconscionable for the bank to assert their absolute rights as\n\na mortgagee over the whole of the property and repudiate that interest of Madam Ho in respect of\n\nwhich they had earlier acknowledged and agreed with Ms Lim, and whether a constructive trust should\n\nbe imposed on RHB in respect of Madam Hos interest.Land Titles Act37.    If the property is not held under the Land Titles Act, the\n\nposition is very clear. As RHB took the mortgage with the full knowledge of Madam Hos interest in\n\nthe property, and also acknowledged her interest, their interest as the mortgagee would be subject\n\nto the prior interest of Madam Ho. Equity would impose a constructive trust on RHB to protect the\n\ninterest of Madam Ho. As the property is registered land held under the Land Titles Act, the\n\nquestion is whether such a constructive could and should be imposed in the circumstances.38.    The main argument advanced on behalf of RHB is that there\n\nwas no entry in the register of titles of Madam Hos interest, and therefore they took the\n\nproperty as a mortgagee free of that interest. They rely on the absolute character of their title as\n\nthe registered mortgagee. The relevant provisions of the Land Titles Act which they invoke are ss 46\n\nand 47 which, so far as relevant, are as follows:46.  (1) Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or\n\n  interest, whether derived by grant from the State or otherwise, which but for this Act might be\n\n  held to be paramount or to have priority, and notwithstanding any failure to observe the\n\n  procedural requirements of this Act, any person who becomes the proprietor of registered land,\n\n  whether or not he dealt with a proprietor, and notwithstanding any lack of good faith on the part\n\n  of the person through whom he claims, shall hold that land free from all encumbrances, liens,\n\n  estates and interests whatsoever except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register\n\n  .(2) Nothing in this section shall be held to prejudice the rights and remedies\n\n  of any person(a) to have the registered title of a proprietor defeated on the ground of\n\n  fraud or forgery to which that proprietor or his agent was a party or in which he or his agent\n\n  colluded;..47.  (1) Except in the case of fraud, no person dealing with a proprietor or\n\n  with a person who is entitled to become a proprietor shall be required or in any manner concerned\n\n  to inquire or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the current proprietor\n\n  or any previous proprietor is or was registered, or to see to the application of the purchase\n\n  money or any part thereof, or is affected by notice (actual or constructive) of any bankruptcy\n\n  proceeding, trust or other unregistered interest whatsoever, any rule or law or equity to the\n\n  contrary notwithstanding; and the knowledge that any unregistered interest is in existence shall\n\n  not of itself by imputed as fraud.39.    It is clear that both these sections are designed to\n\nprovide for indefeasibility of title of a registered proprietor of the land held under the Land\n\nTitles Act. On the basis of these provisions, persons dealing with the registered proprietor are not\n\nrequired to go behind the title in order to investigate the history of the latters title and to\n\nsatisfy themselves of its validity: per Lord Watson inGibbs v Messer[1891] AC 248 at 254.40.    There are of course exceptions to the indefeasibility of\n\ntitle. InTeo Siew Peng and Anor v Neo Hock Pheng and Ors[1999] 1 SLR 293, Lai Siu Chiu J\n\nconsidered two of such exceptions as relevant to the case before her. She said at p 302:18 [T]here are two exceptions to the indefeasibility of title conferred on the\n\n  plaintiffs that are of relevance here. Firstly, s 38(2) provides for the fraud exception and makes\n\n  clear that the fraud necessary to defeat the title of a proprietor must be brought home to the\n\n  proprietor or his agent. InGrgic v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd(1994) 33\n\n  NSWLR 202, while commenting on similar Torrens legislation, the New South Wales Court of Appeal\n\n  reaffirmed (per Powell JA at p 221):the position still remains that, for the purposes of s 42 of the [Real\n\n    Property] Act, fraud comprehends actual fraud, personal dishonesty or moral turpitude on\n\n    the part of the registered proprietor of the subject estate or interest or that registered\n\n    proprietors agentsAlthough it is now accepted that not all species of equitable fraud stand\n\n    outside the concept of fraud  those species of equitable fraud which are regarded\n\n    as falling within the concept of fraud  are those  in which there has been an\n\n    element of dishonesty or moral turpitude on the part of the registered proprietor or his agent.19 Secondly, cases such asFrazer v Walker[1967] 1 AC 569 andBahr v\n\n  Nicholay (No 2)(1988) 62 ALJR 268 established that the indefeasibility of title conferred by\n\n  s 38 does not prevent claims in personam being made against the registered proprietor by reason of\n\n  his own conduct. Such an exception was accepted by the recent local decision inUnited Overseas\n\n  Finance Ltd v Victor Sakayamary & Ors[1997] 3 SLR 211as being consistent with the scheme\n\n  of registration under the Act.Her decision on appeal was reversed in part; however, the above passage of her\n\njudgment remained unaffected.41.    For our purposes, we need to consider only these two\n\nexceptions. In this regard, we find helpful the decision of the High Court of Australia in the case\n\nofBahr and Anor v Nicolay and Ors164 CLR 604, 78 ALR 1. It is necessary to deal with this\n\ncase in some detail and consider the judgments there in extenso. The facts were not too complicated.\n\nThe appellants had a licence to occupy certain Crown land known as Lot 340. The licence carried with\n\nit the right to call for a Crown grant of Lot 340 upon the erection of commercial premises by 14\n\nAugust 1980. In order to finance the building on Lot 340, the appellants entered into an agreement\n\nwith the first respondent (the first agreement) under which they would sell Lot 340 to the\n\nlatter, lease it back for three years and thereafter buy it back. Clause 6 of the first agreement\n\nprovided as follows:6 The vendors hereby further agree that upon the expiration of the lease\n\n  contained in cl 5 hereof they will enter into a contract with the purchaser for the purchase by\n\n  the vendors of the land for a sum of FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($45,000) payable by way of TEN\n\n  (10) per cent deposit with the balance of the purchase moneys to be paid at settlement. Settlement\n\n  is to be effected thirty (30) days after payment of the deposit.The appellants interest was never at any material time noted on the register\n\nof titles. On 26 December 1981, the first respondent sold Lot 340 to the second respondents under an\n\nagreement (the second agreement). Clause 4 of this agreement merely provided that the second\n\nrespondents acknowledged that an agreement exists between the appellants and the first\n\nrespondent. The second respondents subsequently became the registered proprietors of Lot 340. Soon\n\nthereafter, the second respondents through their solicitors wrote to the appellants solicitors\n\nconfirming that they would sign an offer to sell Lot 340 to the appellants for $45,000 plus\n\nany improvement at cost. Prior to the lease expiring, the appellants solicitors confirmed that\n\ntheir clients intended to purchase the land and sent a cheque for $4,500 by way of deposit. This was\n\nnot accepted by the second respondents who then refused to sell the land to the appellants. The\n\nappellants brought an action against the first and second respondents claiming, inter alia, specific\n\nperformance of the first agreement. The claim was resisted, and ss 68 and 134 of the Australian\n\nTransfer of Land Act 1893 (the equivalent of ss 46 and 47 of our Land Titles Act) were relied upon\n\nin the defence. The High Court of Australia held unanimously that in the circumstances a trust arose\n\nin favour of the appellants and the second respondents held Lot 340 subject to the rights of the\n\nappellants. However, the reasoning of the judges in arriving at this conclusion differed.42.    Mason CJ and Dawson J in their joint judgment held that cl\n\n6 of the first agreement created an equitable estate or interest in Lot 340 enforceable against the\n\nfirst respondents and the second respondents. Turning to cl 4 of the second agreement, they\n\nconstrued it as follows (164 CLR 604 at 612, 78 ALR 1 at 4-5):By cl 4 of the agreement between the first respondent and the second\n\n  respondents, the second respondents \"acknowledged that an agreement exists\" between the\n\n  appellants and the first respondent, that agreement being the undated 1980 agreement. The clause\n\n  does not purport to create in favour of the appellants new rights over and above those previously\n\n  existing. In terms it acknowledges the existence of the earlier agreement. Although the precise\n\n  effect of the clause must be left for later consideration, it necessarily involves an\n\n  acknowledgment of such rights as the appellants may have had under the earlier agreement.Their Honours later considered the matrix of circumstances and said (164 CLR 604\n\nat 616, 78 ALR 1 at 7):Viewed in this setting, cl 4 of the later agreement was designed to do more\n\n  than merely evidence the fact that the second respondents had notice of the appellants rights.\n\n  If that were the only purpose to be served by the acknowledgment it would achieve nothing. It\n\n  would enable the second respondents to destroy the appellants interest and would leave the\n\n  first respondent exposed to potential liability for breach of contract at the suit of the\n\n  appellants. In the circumstances outlined it is evident that the purpose of cl 4 was to provide\n\n  that the transfer of title to Lot 340 was to be subject to the appellants rights under cl 6 of\n\n  the 1980 agreement in the sense that those rights were to be enforceable against the second\n\n  respondents.Their Honours found that cl 4 of the second agreement constituted an express\n\ntrust, and held (164 CLR 604 at 619, 78 ALR 1 at 9):The trust is an express, and not a constructive, trust. The effect of the trust\n\n  is that the second respondents hold Lot 340 subject to such rights as were created in favour of\n\n  the appellants by the 1980 agreement [the first agreement]:Even if we had not reached this conclusion, we would not have regarded the\n\n  registration of the transfer in favour of the second respondents as destroying the appellants\n\n  rights. Having regard to the intention of the parties expressed in cl 4 of the later agreement,\n\n  the subsequent repudiation of cl 6 of the 1980 agreement constituted fraud. The case therefore\n\n  fell within the statutory exception with the result that the appellants prior equitable\n\n  interest prevails over the second respondents title, the second respondents taking with notice\n\n  of that interest.43.    Wilson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment held also that\n\ncl 6 of the first agreement created an equitable estate or interest in favour of the appellants.\n\nTheir Honours did not find that there was sufficient evidence to impute fraud on the part of the\n\nsecond respondents, but they found that the second respondents bought the property on the\n\nunderstanding that they would be bound by the obligation to the appellants as contained in the\n\nagreement between the appellants and the first respondent, and held (164 CLR 604 at 638-639, 78 ALR\n\n1 at 24):The second respondents bought Lot 340 on the understanding common to vendor and\n\n  purchasers that they were so bound and cl 4 was included to give effect to that understanding.\n\n  Clause 4 may have been, of itself, insufficient for that purpose but the second respondents\n\n  letter of 6 January 1982 and their two offers of 8 January 1982 put beyond doubt their\n\n  acknowledgment of their obligation to the appellants.By taking a transfer of Lot 340 on that basis, and the appellants interest\n\n  under cl 6 constituting an equitable interest in the land, the second respondents became subject\n\n  to a constructive trust in favour of the appellants:Lyus v Prowsa Developments Ltd; Binions v\n\n  Evans[1972] Ch 359 at 368. If it be the position that the appellants interest under cl 6\n\n  fell short of an equitable estate, they none the less had a personal equity enforceable against\n\n  the second respondents. In either cases ss 68 and 134 of the TLA would not preclude the\n\n  enforcement of the estate or equity because both arise, not by virtue of notice of them by the\n\n  second respondents, but because of their acceptance of a transfer on terms that they would be\n\n  bound by the interest the appellants had in the land by reason of their contract with the first\n\n  respondent.44.    Brennan J (as he then was), the fifth member of the Court,\n\nlike the other four judges, held the same view that cl 6 of the first agreement conferred on the\n\nappellants an equitable interest in the land, and went on to hold (164 CLR 604 at 647-648, 78 ALR 1\n\nat 31) as follows:The consequence of inserting cl 4 into the Thompsons contract [second\n\n  agreement] was that the Thompsons [the second respondents] acknowledged not only the fact that the\n\n  Bahrs contract existed but also that the interest which they were purchasing was subject to the\n\n  interest which the Bahrs had under cl 6 of the Bahrs contract. But cl 4 is more than an\n\n  acknowledgment of a fact; in its context it appears to be a contractual stipulation. It is one of\n\n  a number of \"Conditions\" in the Thompsons offer to purchase Lot 340 which Nicolay, by\n\n  his attorney Robertson, accepted, and the offer was expressed to be \"subject to the\n\n  Conditions\". By reference to the Bahrs contract (to which cl 4 refers), it would have been\n\n  apparent to the parties to the Thompsons contract  or, more realistically, it ought to have\n\n  been apparent to their legal advisers  that Nicolay would be in breach of cl 6 of the Bahrs\n\n  contract unless cl 4 of the Thompsons contract is a contractual stipulation that the Thompsons\n\n  title on completion was to be subject to the Bahrs interest. Having regard to the context in\n\n  which cl 4 is found in the Thompsons contract and the relationship between the vendor Nicolay\n\n  and the Bahrs which appears on the face of the Bahrs contract, I construe cl 4 not as a mere\n\n  acknowledgment of a fact but as a term of the contract limiting the purchasers interest by\n\n  defining the interest to which the purchasers title should be subject.Dealing with the argument based on the indefeasibility of title under ss 68 and\n\n134 of the Transfer of Land Act, Brennan J held (164 CLR 604 at 653, 78 ALR 1 at 35) that the title\n\nof a purchaser who not only had notice of an antecedent unregistered interest but who purchased on\n\nterms that he would be bound by the unregistered interest was subject to that interest. Equity would\n\ncompel him to perform his obligation.",
        "Concept of fraud": "45.    We consider first the concept of fraud in relation to the\n\nconduct of RHB and determine whether there was any fraud committed by RHB in disregarding the\n\ninterest of Madam Ho in the property. The term fraud in the Land Titles Act means actual fraud, i.e.\n\ndishonesty of some sort, and not constructive or equitable fraud:Assets Company Limited v Mere\n\nRoihi and Ors[1905] AC 176, 210, andWaimiha Sawmill Company, Limited (in liquidation) v\n\nWaione Timber Company, Limited[1926] AC 101, 106. InBahr v Nicolay(supra), Mason CJ\n\nand Dawson J said (164 CLR 604 at 614, 78 ALR 1 at 6) that these authorities do not mean that all\n\nspecies of equitable fraud stand outside the statutory concept of fraud, and in their view the\n\nstatutory concept of fraud means actual fraud, personal dishonesty or moral turpitude. Their\n\nHonours held that fraud could arise both from dishonest repudiation of a prior interest which the\n\nregistered proprietor had acknowledged or had agreed to recognise as the basis for obtaining the\n\ntitle, as well as for fraudulent conduct which enabled him to obtain the title by registration. The\n\nCourt of Appeal of New South Wales inGrgic v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd(1994) 33 NSWLR 202 at 221 said:[F]or the purpose of s 42 of the Act, \"fraud\" comprehends actual\n\n  fraud, personal dishonesty or moral turpitude on the part of the registered proprietor of the\n\n  subject estate or interest or of that registered proprietors agents: seeBahr v Nicolay [No\n\n  2](at p 614) per Mason CJ and Dawson J; (at 631-632) per Wilson J and Toohey J. Although it\n\n  is now accepted that not all species of equitable fraud stand outside the concept of\n\n  \"fraud\" which has been adopted for the purposes of s 42 of the Act (see, eg,Latec\n\n  Investments Ltd and Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (In Liq)(1965) 113 CLR 265 at 273-274 per Kitto J;Bahr v Nicolay [No 2])those species of \"equitable fraud\" which are regarded as\n\n  falling within the concept of \"fraud\" for the purposes of s 42 are those  as for\n\n  example, a collusive and colourable sale by a mortgagee company to a subsidiary (Latec\n\n  Investment Ltd v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (in Liq)(at 273-274))  in which there has been an\n\n  element of dishonesty or moral turpitude on the part of the registered proprietor of the subject\n\n  interest or on the part of his or its agent.It has also been held that merely to take a transfer of land with notice of an\n\nexisting unregistered interest or with actual knowledge that its registration will defeat such an\n\ninterest is not fraud: seeMills and Anor v Stockmand and Anor(1966) 116 CLR 61, 78;Friedman\n\nv Barret, Ex p Friedman[1962] Qd R 498, 512.46.    There is no doubt that RHB repudiated the unregistered\n\ninterest of Madam Ho and reneged from the agreement made with Ms Lim with regard to Madam Hos\n\ninterest as provided in cl 6(2)(b) of the Regulating Agreement. However, such repudiation does not\n\namount to fraud, personal dishonesty or moral turpitude on their part. The facts in the instant case\n\ndo not justify a finding of dishonest repudiation of an unregistered interest. In our judgment, what\n\nRHB did certainly did not amount to fraud.",
        "Claim in personam": "47.    The next question is whether Madam Ho has a claim in\n\npersonam against RHB founded in law or in equity. InAlan Frederic Frazer v Douglas Hamilton\n\nWalker ([1967 1 All ER 649 at 655, [1967] AC 569 at 585), Lord Wilberforce said:[T]heir Lordships have accepted the general principle that registration under\n\n  the Land Transfer Act, 1952, confers upon a registered proprietor a title to the interest in\n\n  respect of which he is registered which is (under sections 62 and 63) immune from adverse claims,\n\n  other than those specifically excepted. In doing so they wish to make clear that this principle in\n\n  no way denies the right of a plaintiff to bring against a registered proprietor a claim in\n\n  personam, founded in law or in equity, for such relief as a court acting in personam may grant.\n\n  That this is so has frequently, and rightly, been recognised in the courts of New Zealand and of\n\n  Australia: see, for example,Boyd v Mayor, Etc of Wellington[1924] NZLR 1174, 1223, andTataurangi\n\n  Tairuakena v Mua Carri[1927] NZLR 688, 702.48.    Similar pronouncements were made by the judges of the High\n\nCourt of Australia inBahr v Nicolay(supra). Mason CJ and Dawson J said (164 CLR 604 at 612,\n\n78 ALR 1 at 5):Sections 68 and 134 give expression to, and at the same time qualify, the\n\n  principle of indefeasibility of title which is the foundation of the Torrens system of title. ..Neither the two sections nor the principle of indefeasibility preclude a claim\n\n  to an estate or interest in land against a registered proprietor arising out of the acts of the\n\n  registered proprietor himself:Breskvar v Wall(1971) 126 CLR 376 at 384-5. Thus, an equity\n\n  against a registered proprietor arising out of a transaction taking place after he became\n\n  registered as proprietor may be enforced against him:Barry v Heider(1914) 19 CLR 197. So\n\n  also with an equity arising from conduct of the registered proprietor before registration (Logue\n\n  v Shoalhaven Shire Council[1979] 1 NSWLR 537at 563), so long as the recognition and\n\n  enforcement of that equity involves no conflict with ss 68 and 134. Provided that this\n\n  qualification is observed, the recognition and enforcement of such an equity is consistent with\n\n  the principle of indefeasibility and the protection which it gives to those who deal with the\n\n  registered proprietor on the faith of the register.And Wilson and Toohey JJ, having referred toFrazer v Walker, said (164\n\nCLR 604 at 638, 78 ALR 1 at 23-24):The reference to ss 62 and 63 is a reference to the Land Transfer Act 1952\n\n  (NZ), roughly corresponding to ss 68 and 199 of the TLA. The point being made by the Privy Council\n\n  is that the indefeasibility provisions of the Act may not be circumvented. But, equally, they do\n\n  not protect a registered proprietor from the consequences of his own actions where those actions\n\n  give rise to a personal equity in another. Such an equity may arise from conduct of the registered\n\n  proprietor after registration:Barry v Heider(1914) 19 CLR 197. And we agree with Mahoney\n\n  JA inLogue v Shoalhaven Shire Council[1979] 1 NSWLR 537at 563 that it may arise from\n\n  conduct of the registered proprietor before registration.",
        "Constructive Trust": "49.    We once again return to the facts. At the time, when RHB\n\ntook the mortgage of the property, they had knowledge of the sale agreement made between Madam Ho\n\nand Ms Lim and recognised Madam Hos equitable interest in the property. They made an allowance of\n\nher interest and discounted it in their evaluation of the property as security for the overdraft\n\nfacilities offered to Earling. By cl 6(2)(b) of the Regulating Agreement they not only expressly\n\nacknowledged and recognised the existence of Madam Hos equitable interest in the property but\n\nalso committed themselves to discharging the mortgage on the plot of land of Madam Ho without any\n\npayment. As we have said, this was not a clause provided by RHB on their own initiative. It was\n\nobviously negotiated by Ms Lim with a view to protecting the interest of Madam Ho, and the bank\n\nagreed to it. That was certainly the understanding of Ms Leong the solicitor acting for both RHB and\n\nMs Lim. Thus, cl 6(2)(b) was a stipulation of the bargain RHB made with Ms Lim that they would\n\nbe bound by Madam Hos interest in the property. In our opinion, the effect of this stipulation is\n\nthat RHB had accepted the particular plot of Madam Ho as not being subject to the mortgage, thereby\n\npreserving Madam Hos interest in the property. Having taken the mortgage of the property on that\n\nbasis, it is, in our opinion, utterly inequitable for RHB to renege from their obligation and\n\ninsist on the absolute nature of their interest as a mortgagee of the whole of the property and\n\nrepudiate the equitable interest of Madam Ho in the property. Such a stand taken by RHB is certainly\n\nunconscionable, though not fraudulent or dishonest. In the circumstances, equity would compel them\n\nto honour their obligation and a constructive trust ought to be imposed. In our judgment, RHB took\n\nthe mortgage of the property subject to the constructive trust in favour of Madam Ho.50.    The present case is in a way not distinguishable fromBahr\n\nv Nicolay. There the second respondents by cl 4 of the second agreement merely acknowledged the\n\nexistence of the first agreement and subsequently through their solicitors they offered to transfer\n\nLot 340 on certain terms. Wilson and Toohey JJ held that by taking a transfer on that basis they\n\nagreed to be bound by the interest of the plaintiffs in the land. In the present case, RHB in taking\n\nthe mortgage acknowledged Madam Hos equitable interest in the property and by the Regulating\n\nAgreement made with Ms Lim agreed to be bound by that interest in the property.51.    Bahr v Nicolayis not the only authority in point.\n\nThe case ofBinions and Anor v Evans[1972] 2 All ER 70, [1972] Ch 359 is also of some\n\nassistance. There, the trustees of an estate, in which the defendants late husband had been\n\nworking, entered into an agreement with the defendant whereby she was allowed to stay at the cottage\n\nin the estate as a tenant at will free of rent for the remainder of her life or until determined\n\nas provided in the agreement. Later, the trustees sold the estate to the plaintiffs and gave them a\n\ncopy of the agreement so as to protect the defendants occupation, and as a result the plaintiffs\n\npaid a reduced price for the estate. Subsequently, the plaintiffs having bought the estate sought to\n\nrecover vacant possession of the cottage from the defendant. The judge at county court dismissed the\n\nclaim holding that the plaintiffs held the cottage on trust to permit her to stay there. On appeal,\n\nthe Court of Appeal unanimously held that, when the cottage was sold to the plaintiffs subject to\n\nthe defendants right under the agreement, the plaintiffs took the cottage on a constructive trust\n\nto permit her to reside there during her life or as long as she desired. Lord Denning MR in his\n\njudgment said ([1972] 2 All ER 70 at 76, [1972] Ch 359 at 368):Suppose, however, that the defendant did not have an equitable interest at the\n\n  outset, nevertheless it is quite plain that she obtained one afterwards when the Tredgar Estate\n\n  sold the cottage. They stipulated with the plaintiffs that they were to take the house\n\n  \"subject to\" the defendants rights under the agreement. They supplied the plaintiffs\n\n  with a copy of the contract: and the plaintiffs paid less because of her right to stay there. In\n\n  these circumstances, this court will impose on the plaintiffs a constructive trust for her\n\n  benefit: for the simple reason that it would be utterly inequitable for the plaintiffs to turn the\n\n  defendant out contrary to the stipulation subject to which they took the premises. That seems to\n\n  me clear from the important decision ofBannister v Bannister[1948] 2 All E.R. 133, which\n\n  was applied by the judge, and which I gladly follow.This imposing of a constructive trust is entirely in accord with the precepts\n\n  of equity. As Cardozo J once put it: \"A constructive trust is the formula through which the\n\n  conscience of equity finds expression,\" seeBeatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co(1919)\n\n  225 N.Y. 380, 386: or, as Lord Diplock put it quite recently inGissing v Gissing[1971]   A.C. 886, 905, a constructive trust is created \"whenever the trustee has so conducted himself\n\n  that it would be inequitable to allow him to deny to the cestui que trust a beneficial interest in\n\n  the land acquired.\"Later, in the same page, the learned Master of the Rolls said:Whenever the owner sells the land to a purchaser, and at the same time\n\n  stipulates that he shall take it \"subject to\" a contractual licence, I think it plain\n\n  that a court of equity will impose on the purchaser a constructive trust in favour of the\n\n  beneficiary. It is true that the stipulation (that the purchaser shall take it subject to the\n\n  rights of the licensee) is a stipulation for the benefit of one who is not a party to the contract\n\n  of sale; but, as Lord Upjohn said inBeswick v Beswick[1986] A.C. 58, 98, that is just the\n\n  very case in which equity will \"come to the aid of the common law.\" It does so by\n\n  imposing a constructive trust on the purchaser. It would be utterly inequitable that the purchaser\n\n  should be able to turn out the beneficiary.52.    Another case in point isLyus and Anor v Prowsa\n\nDevelopments Ltd and Anor[1982] 2 All ER 953, [1982] 1 WLR 1044. The plaintiffs there entered\n\ninto a contract with the developer to purchase a plot of land, plot 29, together with a house to be\n\nbuilt on it by the developer. The developer subsequently became insolvent and the bank as the\n\nmortgagee of the entire estate sold the land including plot 29 to the first defendant. The first\n\ndefendants had full knowledge of the plaintiffs contract in respect of plot 29. Although the bank\n\nas the mortgagee was not in fact bound by the contract with the plaintiffs, they nevertheless sold\n\nthe land which included the plot 29 subject to and with the benefit of that plaintiffs contract.\n\nHowever, the subsequent transfer contained no mention of the contract. The first defendant then sold\n\nplot 29 together with other parcels of land to the second defendants who were the builders. By a\n\nspecial condition in their agreement, plot 29 was also sold subject to and with the benefit of the\n\nplaintiffs contract. On completion of the sale, the second defendants became the registered\n\nproprietors of, inter alia, plot 29 and the register of titles was clear of any reference to the\n\nplaintiffs or their contract. The plaintiffs instituted proceedings against the first and the second\n\ndefendants, claiming specific performance of their contract on the ground that the defendants by the\n\nspecial conditions in their respective contracts were bound by the constructive trust to complete\n\ntheir contract. Dealing first with the contract between the bank and the first defendant, Dillon J\n\nheld that the special condition was not inserted for the protection of the bank but was a\n\nstipulation of the bargain between them that the first defendant would give effect, in relation to\n\nplot 29, to the plaintiffs contract. That being so, the first defendant having accepted the land\n\nunder the agreement made with the bank and the consequent transfer, held plot 29 under a\n\nconstructive trust to give effect to the plaintiffs contract. Such constructive trust was also\n\nimposed on the second defendants by virtue of the special condition in the contract with the first\n\ndefendants. The learned judge said at p 961:I conclude that cl 11 was not inserted in the agreement of 18 October 1979\n\n  solely for the protection of the bank, like cl 7 of that agreement which sets out other matters\n\n  subject to which the property was sold, and I conclude that it was a stipulation of the bargain\n\n  between the bank and the first defendant that the first defendant would give effect, in relation\n\n  to plot 29, to the contract which had been made between the vendor company and the plaintiffs.If that is correct, it would follow, in my judgment, from the judgment of Scott\n\n  LJ inBannister v Bannister, and from the judgment of Lord Denning MR inBinions v Evans,\n\n  that, unless the Land Registration Act requires a different conclusion, the first defendant,\n\n  having accepted the land under the agreement of 18 October 1979 and the consequent transfer, holds\n\n  plot 29 on a constructive trust in favour of the plaintiffs to give effect to the plaintiffs\n\n  contract. That trust is also imposed on the second defendants by virtue of condition (b) of their\n\n  agreement with the first defendants.53.    Turning to the Land Registration Act, Dillon J held that\n\nalthough it was not fraud to rely on the legal rights conferred by the Act, the first and second\n\ndefendants could not rely on the Act as an instrument of fraud to renege from the bargains which\n\nthey had made in acquiring the land. He said at p 962:It seems to me that the fraud on the part of the defendants in the present case\n\n  lies not just in relying on the legal rights conferred by an Act of Parliament, but in the first\n\n  defendant reneging on a positive stipulation in favour of the plaintiffs in the bargain under\n\n  which the first defendant acquired the land. That makes, as it seems to me, all the difference. It\n\n  has long since been held, for instance inRochefoucauld v Boustead[1897] 1 Ch 196, that\n\n  the provisions of the Statute of Frauds 1677, now incorporated in certain sections of the Law of\n\n  Property Act 1925, cannot be used as an instrument of fraud, and that it is fraud for a person to\n\n  whom land is agreed to be conveyed as trustee for another to deny the trust and relying on the\n\n  terms of the statute to claim the land for himself.Rochefoucauld v Bousterwas one of the\n\n  authorities on which the judgment inBannister v Bannisterwas found.It seems to me that the same considerations are applicable in relation to the\n\n  Land Registration Act 1925. If, for instance, the agreement of 18 October 1979 between the bank\n\n  and the first defendant had expressly stated that the first defendant would hold plot 29 on trust\n\n  to give effect for the benefit of the plaintiffs to the plaintiffs agreement with the vendor\n\n  company, it would be difficult to say that that express trust was overreached and rendered\n\n  nugatory by the Land Registration Act 1925. The Land Registration Act 1925 does not, therefore,\n\n  affect the conclusion which I would otherwise have reached in reliance onBannister v Bannisterand the judgment of Lord Denning MR inBinions v Evans, had plot 29 been unregistered land.In the result, the learned judge held that the second defendants held plot 29 on\n\nconstructive trust to complete the house and he was ordered to convey the plot back to the\n\nplaintiffs for the price agreed in the original contract.",
        "Conclusion": "54.    We therefore allow the appeal against the dismissal of\n\nMadam Hos claim against Ms Lim and RHB and set aside the judgment below in so far as it relates\n\nto such dismissal. We now turn to the question of the relief we should grant. Under the sale\n\nagreement, the lot earmarked for Madam Ho is the lot marked plot 3, the area of which is about\n\none-third of the area of the property. As no subdivision approval has been obtained, it would be\n\nimpracticable to grant a declaration of her equitable interest in this plot. We therefore make the\n\ndeclarations and orders as follows:(1) As against Ms Lim, we make a declaration that she holds an undivided\n\n  one-third share of the property on trust for Madam Ho and further that Ms Lim committed a breach\n\n  of trust and is accountable to Madam Ho for the loss she has sustained. There will be judgment for\n\n  payment of damages for such loss. As Ms Lim is now a bankrupt, we do not think that any point will\n\n  be served by directing an assessment of damages. We therefore give Madam Ho liberty to apply for\n\n  assessment of damages, if she so wishes;(2) As against RHB, we make a declaration that RHB as the mortgagee of the\n\n  property hold the undivided one-third share of Madam Ho in the property on trust for Madam Ho and\n\n  that, as and when they exercise the power of sale, to account to her one-third of the net proceeds\n\n  of sale after deducting all the expenses incurred in the sale.There may be other orders we should make consequent on our decision given above.\n\nParties are at liberty to tender written submissions on such further orders within seven days from\n\nthe date hereof.55.    We award costs here and below to Madam Ho as against Ms Lim\n\nand RHB. There will be the usual consequential order for the refund to Madam Ho of the deposit in\n\ncourt, with interest, if any.Civil Appeal No. 167 of 200156.    We now turn to Civil Appeal No. 167 of 2001 which is an\n\nappeal by Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah against the learned judges order that they bear Madam Hos\n\ncosts payable to WLAW and RHB.57.    The courts power to make such an order for costs against\n\nan advocate and solicitor is derived from O 59 r 8 of the Rules of Court. The relevant part of the\n\nrule states:(1) Subject to this Rule, where it appears to the Court that costs have been\n\n  incurred unreasonably or improperly in any proceedings or have been wasted by failure to conduct\n\n  proceedings with reasonable competence and expedition, the Court may make against any solicitor\n\n  whom it considers to be responsible (whether personally or through an employee or agent) an order(a) disallowing the costs as between the solicitor and his client; and(b) directing the solicitor to repay to his client costs which the client has\n\n    been ordered to pay to other parties to the proceedings; or(c) directing the solicitor personally to indemnify such other parties\n\n    against costs payable by them.58.    The scope of this jurisdiction was comprehensively\n\nconsidered by the English Court of Appeal inRidehalgh v Horsefield & Anor[1994] 3 All\n\nER 848, [1994] Ch 205 which dealt with a corresponding provision in the English Rules of Supreme\n\nCourt. There, the court approved the three-stage test as conceived in the earlier case ofRe A\n\nBarrister (Wasted Costs Order) (No 1 of 1991)[1992] 3 All ER 429 at 435, [1993] QB 293 at 301.\n\nThe Court laid down the three-stage test, ([1994] 3 All ER 848 at 861, [1994] Ch 205 at 231):(1) Has the legal representative of whom complaint is made acted improperly,\n\n  unreasonably or negligently? (2) If so, did such conduct cause the applicant to incur unnecessary\n\n  costs? (3) If so, is it in all the circumstances just to order the legal representative to\n\n  compensate the applicant for the whole or any part of the relevant costs? (If so, the costs to be\n\n  met must be specified and, in a criminal case, the amount of the costs.)The tests and propositions of law laid down in that case were cited with approval\n\nby this Court inTang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor and other appeals[1998] 1 SLR 97,\n\nand it is not necessary to repeat them here.59.    The question here is whether Mr Ponniah and Mr Wong can be\n\nsaid to have acted improperly, unreasonably and negligently in advising Madam Ho to claim against\n\nWLAW and RHB and also in acting for her in pursuing the claim. It is submitted on their behalf that\n\ntheir actions in so advising Madam Ho and acting for her in pursuing her claim against WLAW and RHB\n\nwere not improper, unreasonable or negligent. Madam Ho had a prima facie case against Ms Lim for\n\nbreach of trust or for the imposition of a constructive trust. Since WLAW and RHB both knew about\n\nthe agreement between Madam Ho and Ms Lim, and in view of what was provided in the security\n\ndocuments executed by Ms Lim and RHB, it is contended that there was also a prima facie case against\n\nthem and as such it could not be said that the institution of proceedings against WLAW and RHB had\n\nno legal basis.60.    In so far as the claim against RHB is concerned, as we have\n\nheld that Madam Ho has a claim against RHB as a constructive trustee of her equitable interest in\n\nthe property, it follows that Mr Ponniah and Mr Wong had not acted improperly, unreasonably or\n\nnegligently in advising Madam Ho to claim against RHB and also in acting for her in pursuing the\n\nclaim against the bank.61.    We need to consider whether they had acted improperly,\n\nunreasonably or negligently in advising Madam Ho and acting for her in pursuing her claim against\n\nWLAW. As we have held, Madam Ho certainly has a claim against Ms Lim for a breach of trust. The law\n\nfirm of WLAW through Ms Leong acted for the following parties: first, for Ms Lim in the sale and\n\npurchase of the property, secondly, for both Ms Lim and OCBC in the mortgage of the property to OCBC,\n\nand finally for both Ms Lim and RHB in the mortgage of the property to RHB. It must have been clear\n\nto Ms Leong that Madam Ho under the sale agreement has an equitable interest in the property and\n\nthat Ms Lim holds the property on trust to protect that interest. She was also involved as a\n\nsolicitor in the discharge of the OCBC mortgage and the re-mortgage of the property to RHB by Ms\n\nLim. It must have been obvious to her that these transactions were carried out by Ms Lim\n\nsurreptitiously without the knowledge of Madam Ho and the mortgage of the property to RHB could\n\njeopardise Madam Hos interest in the property in that the property was being used to secure loans\n\nand advances to a three-dollar company of Ms Lim and not for the specific purpose of financing the\n\nconstruction of the proposed development on the property. In such circumstances, it is arguable that\n\nequity may well impose liability on Ms Leong for having been involved as an accessory to or having\n\nassisted in Ms Lims disposition of a property in breach of trust. A third party knowingly\n\nassisting a trustee in the disposition of a trust property in breach of trust may be held liable as\n\na constructive trustee. On this, we need go no further than quote the classic statement of Lord\n\nSelborne LC inBarnes v Addy(1874) 9 Ch App 244 at 251-252:strangers are not to be made constructive trustees merely because they act\n\n  as the agents of trustees in transactions within their legal powers, transactions, perhaps of\n\n  which a Court of Equity may disapprove, unless those agents receive and become chargeable with\n\n  some part of the trust property, orunless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and\n\n  fraudulent design on the part of the trustees. [Emphasis added]62.    In these circumstances, it cannot be said that Mr Ponniah\n\nand Mr Wong had acted improperly or unreasonably in advising Madam Ho and acting for her in pursuing\n\na claim against WLAW. It is impossible for us to second-guess now what course of action another firm\n\nof lawyers might have advised Madam Ho to take, had they been consulted at the start. The mere\n\nfailure of Mr Ponniah and Mr Wong to advise Madam Ho to seek independent legal advice or to\n\ndischarge themselves could not be said to have caused Madam Ho to incur the costs of the action\n\nagainst WLAW and RHB, as it cannot be said with reasonable certainty that any other independent or\n\nprudent or reasonable lawyer would not have given the same advice.63.    It may be that for obviously good reasons Mr Ponniah and Mr\n\nWong should not have acted for her in these proceedings. First, they knew fully well that Mr Wong\n\nhimself would be a material witness in the proceedings to be taken against Ms Lim, and second that\n\nthey had a personal interest in the case as it was their firm which had acted for Madam Ho in the\n\nsale of the property and mortgage to OCBC. Without expressing any view on this matter, we would just\n\nmention that it may be said that prima facie the problem that had arisen could be said to have been\n\ncaused by the way in which Mr Wong had handled the transaction for Madam Ho. Both Mr Wong and Mr\n\nPonniah should have discharged themselves from acting for Madam Ho and should have advised her to\n\nseek independent legal advice. That, however, is a different matter and for the purpose of O 59 r 8\n\nis not quite relevant.Conclusion64.    We therefore allow this appeal and set aside the order\n\nbelow. Before we make an order for costs we would like to hear arguments on costs here and below,\n\nand the relevant parties are invited to submit written arguments on such issue within 7 days from\n\nthe date hereof.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
