        "The facts": "2.    On 20 March 2000, at about 12.55pm, officers from the\n\nCentral Narcotics Bureau (CNB) raided the flat. Present in the flat were the owner of the flat, one\n\nMr Syed Omar bin Syed Kassim, the appellant, his wife, Rosminah bte Ali, and their son. The\n\nappellant and his family were permitted by Syed Omar to stay there. The flat was a small one-room\n\nunit.3.    Following a search of the flat, the officers found a grey\n\nplastic box under the bed. In it were three plastic bags containing a total of 175 sachets of\n\ngranular substance which were later analysed to contain a net weight of 78.04 grams of diamorphine.\n\nThose 175 sachets of granular substance formed the subject matter of the charge brought against the\n\nappellant. The appellant and his wife was accordingly placed under arrest.4.    A white plastic bag, wherein there were packets of\n\nenvelopes, was found on the top of a cupboard. Another packet of envelopes was also found on the\n\ndining table.5.    The appellant was asked by one of the CNB officers, Cpl\n\nKhairy, in Malay, what were in the grey plastic box. He answered that they were heroin. His\n\nstatement was reduced into writing and no objection was taken by the appellant as to its\n\nadmissibility in evidence.6.    On the ground floor of the block, beneath the flat, the\n\nofficers found a small black plastic case containing a straw of powdery substance, two syringes and\n\na piece of silver foil. The appellant admitted that those things were his, having thrown them out\n\nfrom the flat.",
        "Voire dire": "7.    On 24 March 2000, the appellant gave a cautioned statement\n\nto the Investigation Officer (IO), Inspector Saherly. Later several other statements under s 121 of\n\nthe Criminal Procedure Code were also given to the IO. The prosecution sought to admit the cautioned\n\nstatement, and the first of the other statements, which was recorded on 27 March 2000. The appellant\n\ncontended that both these statements were not voluntarily given. Accordingly, avoire direwas held.8.    In relation to the two statements, what the appellant\n\nalleged was that the IO threatened to also charge his wife. He was thus coerced into making the\n\nstatements. He said to protect his wife, the statements were made.9.    It is important to note that in the cautioned statement, the\n\nappellant did not admit that the drugs were his. Furthermore, earlier on 21 March, the appellant\n\nalready knew that his wife was jointly charged with him for trafficking. Why was there a need to\n\nmake such a threat? In re-examination, he said he gave the statements to get her released. There was\n\na shift in position here.10.    With regard to the 27 March 2000 statement, the appellant\n\nalso alleged that it was not accurate in that the IO failed to record several answers he gave.\n\nFurthermore, some of his answers were not correctly interpreted into English. However, these\n\nallegations were not put to the IO or the interpreter who was present during the recording. Moreove,\n\nthe interpreter told the court that when the completed statement was read back to the appellant, he\n\nhad nothing to add. The appellant also said that before the statement was taken, the IO told him\n\nagain to cooperate and admit that the drugs were his. However, the fact remained that the appellant\n\nnever admitted that the drugs were his.11.    The trial judge, having carefully considered the evidence\n\ntendered in thevoire dire,came to the conclusion that the appellant had not raised a\n\nreasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the two statements. He was satisfied that the statements\n\nwere made voluntarily without any threat or inducement. This was his reasoning:-At the end of thevoir direI reviewed the evidence. I found it hard to\n\n  accept that the inspector had threatened to charge the accuseds wife if he did not co-operate.\n\n  The accused and counsel alleged that the inspector said that he will or shall charge the wife. It\n\n  did not make sense for the inspector to issue such a threat to the accused when the accused knew\n\n  that his wife had already been charged.I also did not accept the accuseds assertion that he yielded to the threat.\n\n  His evidence was that the inspector wanted him to admit the drugs were his. However, he agreed\n\n  with the prosecutor that he did not admit ownership of the drugs in either statement.I did not believe that the inspector had made the threats alleged, or that the\n\n  accused had offered his co-operation and made the statements because of any threats. The accused\n\n  had not raised a reasonable doubt on the voluntariness of the two statements. I therefore ruled\n\n  that the two statements were voluntary and admissible.",
        "The statements": "12.    In his cautioned statement, the appellant saidI do not intend to traffic the drugs. I only helped my friend to keep the drug.\n\n  He would call me the next day to collect the drugs and pay me some commission. My wife has no\n\n  knowledge of the drugs. I plead for leniency.13.    In his statement of 27 March 2000, the appellant stated:-I am currently staying at a rented flat  with my wife and my adopted son\n\n   The owner, Syed Omar stays together with us.On 20.3.2000 at about 12.55pm, I was arrested in my house. At that time, I was\n\n  having a meal with the owner, my wife and son. There was a knock on the door and the owner, opened\n\n  the door. A group of men identifying themselves as CNB officers then entered the house. I then\n\n  threw out a black plastic container out of the kitchen window. Inside the container, are two\n\n  syringes and a straw of heroin. The straw of heroin is for consumption together with my wife. The\n\n  group of men then handcuffed us and made a search in the house and us. They found a syringe in my\n\n  pouch. The syringe is also used by me. They then found heroin under the bed, in a grey plastic\n\n  container.There are a total of 175 sachet of heroin in the grey container in three\n\n  different plastic bags. The first two plastic contains 58 sachet while the third one contains 59\n\n  sachets. There is also one weighing machine in the container. In the grey container, there is also\n\n  some empty plastic sachets. The things recovered were given to me by a friend called M. His\n\n  contact number is 98754115.On 19.3.2000, at about 9.00pm, M came to the house. Nobody was around at that\n\n  time. He brought along with him a white plastic bag saying that it contains heroin. I did not know\n\n  how much heroin is there. He had asked me to keep it for him for the night. He told me to wait for\n\n  his call the next day to arrange for the heroin to be either collected by him or sent by me. He\n\n  then took out another plastic bag from the white one to show me the heroin. I then took the white\n\n  plastic bag with some brown envelopes inside it and placed it on top of the cupboard. From the\n\n  plastic bag, he took out three different plastic bags. He told me that two of them contained 58\n\n  sachet of heroin each and the third contains 59 sachet. I then took the three plastic bags and\n\n  placed them in the grey plastic container. He then took out the weighing machine and some empty\n\n  plastic sachet and I also kept them in the grey plastic container. After we had kept the drugs, we\n\n  sat down and talked for a while. M said that he would collect the drugs tomorrow and give me a\n\n  commission. He did not state how much commission I would get. After a while my wife and son came\n\n  home. The owner also came home soon after. M then left.",
        "Appellants wifes evidence": "14.    The appellants wife, Rosminah, who was called by the\n\nprosecution, told the court that she found the grey box along the corridor of her flat three or four\n\ndays before the raid by the CNB officers. She took it home, washed it and left it under the bed,\n\nintending to use it to store her sons clothings.15.    A day before the raid, M, also known as Emran bin Tahir,\n\ncame to see the appellant. Rosminah heard Emran offering the appellant a job. The appellant and\n\nEmran then left the flat to buy a handphone. They came back later with the appellant carrying a\n\nwhite plastic bag, which was the bag found by the CNB officers on top of the cupboard.16.    That night at about 2.00 to 3.00 am, as she had\n\ndifficulties sleeping, Rosminah got out of bed and wanted to store her sons clothings in the grey\n\nbox. She opened the grey box and saw a number of plastic bags therein and in one of the plastic bags\n\nshe saw yellow substances which she recognised to be drugs. She woke up the appellant and asked him\n\nto whom did the things in the grey box belong. She also asked him to return the things to the owner.\n\nThe appellant appeared to be in fear and used his handphone to call someone.",
        "Appellants evidence": "17.    The appellant admitted that he and his wife were drug\n\naddicts and they would consume about one sachet of heroin a day. His defence was that he had\n\nunwittingly come into possession of the drugs. His story was this. He knew Emran from 1989, when\n\nboth of them were inmates at the Selarang Drug Rehabilitation Centre. On 17 March 2000 he met Emran\n\nat the Bedok Interchange. Emran sold to him a sachet of the drugs at $180/-, with payment to be made\n\nthe next day. On 18 March 2001, the appellant paid Emran for the sachet he took the previous day and\n\nalso took another sachet of drugs from Emran on credit. The appellant and Emran continued their\n\ndealing on this basis on 19 March 2001. However, on this day, Emran, on learning that the appellant\n\nwas unemployed, offered the latter a job without telling the latter what the job entailed. As Emran\n\nwas then a contract worker, the appellant assumed that the job offer would be a cleaning job.18.    In the afternoon of that same day, Emran came to the\n\nappellants flat to discuss about the job he had for the appellant. Emran also suggested that the\n\nappellant obtained for himself a handphone for easy communication. Emran offered to pay for it\n\nfirst. Together, they left for Bedok Interchange where the appellant made the purchase. They then\n\ncame back to the flat where Emran bid his goodbye to the appellant without entering the flat.19.    Later in the evening, Emran telephoned the appellant to say\n\nthat he was coming to the appellants flat. It was around 9.00  10.00pm when Emran arrived,\n\ncarrying a big plastic bag. Emran left the plastic bag with the appellant, indicating that he had to\n\nattend to something urgent and would return to collect the bag later. Ten minutes later the\n\nappellant received a call from Emran telling him that the bag contained three bundles of 58, 58 and\n\n59 sachets of drugs, besides a weighing machine. The appellant checked the bag and became\n\nfrightened. He asked Emran to take the bag away. Emran agreed. But by midnight when Emran failed to\n\nturn up to take away the bag, he had thoughts of, inter alia, throwing them away or calling the\n\npolice. However, he could not bring himself to taking any of these steps. Instead, he poured the\n\nstuff which was in the plastic bag into the grey box, which he then placed underneath his bed.20.    Sometime in the middle of the night his wife woke him up to\n\nask about the stuff in the grey box. At her insistence, he tried unsuccessfully to contact Emran as\n\nthe latters handphone was switched off. It was only at 11.00am to 12.00 noon on 20 March 2001\n\nthat Emran called the appellant to say that he was coming to collect the drugs from the appellant\n\nand would pay the latter a commission.21.    The appellant did not challenge Cpl Khairys evidence\n\nthat he found seven packets of envelopes in a carrier bag at the top of the cupboard and another\n\npacket of envelopes on the dining table. The appellant said that the carrier bag and the envelopes\n\nwere left with him by Emran after they returned from buying the handphone on 19 March 2000. As\n\nregards the packet of envelopes on the dining table, he said it was placed there by a Chinese\n\nofficer who took it out from the carrier bag. However, he could not identify who this officer was.\n\nNeither was this fact put to Cpl Khairy or any of the CNB officers who testified at the trial.22.    The primary defence raised by the appellant was that in the\n\nevening of 19 March 2000, when he took over the plastic bag from Emran for safekeeping, he did not\n\nknow it contained drugs. It was only when Emran rang him 10 minutes later and told him what was in\n\nit, that he knew of the contents in the bag. He explained that what he said in his statements should\n\nbe viewed in that light. He was keeping the bag for a friend not knowing what it contained. The\n\nstatement of 27 March 2000 was also not accurate as the IO did not fully record what he said.23.    Emran was subpoened by the defence to testify. While\n\nacknowledging that he met the appellant at the Bedok Interchange on 17 March 2000 and visiting the\n\nappellants flat on 19 March 2000, he denied offering the appellant a job or buying the latter a\n\nhandphone. He also denied having, on 19 March 2000, handed over to the appellant a bag containing\n\ndrugs for safekeeping.",
        "Finding below": "24.    The trial judge did not accept the appellants claim that\n\nhe did not know the bag contained heroin when he took possession of it. Without deciding whether the\n\ndrugs belonged to the appellant, the judge held that the appellant was certainly in possession of\n\nit, and even if the drugs did not belong to him, he had kept them for the owner, intending\n\nthereafter to return the drugs to the owner, and that was sufficient to constitute the offence\n\ncharged. The trial judge did not believe the appellants assertion that he wanted to throw the\n\ndrugs away when he knew what they were. He held that the appellant had possession of the drugs for\n\nthe purpose of trafficking.",
        "Appeal": "25.    Before the scheduled hearing of the appeal, counsel for the\n\nappellant informed this Court that he would not be making any written submission as he was not able\n\nto advance any credible argument to challenge the findings of the court below. On the day of the\n\nhearing of the appeal, counsel reiterated that view. However, we noted that in the Petition of\n\nAppeal filed on behalf of the appellant, it was stated that the trial judge had erred in his finding\n\nas he failed to consider:-1. That the appellant had no knowledge as to the contents of the plastic bag\n\n  when he received it from \"Emran\".2. That the appellant upon realising that the plastic bag contained drugs\n\n  instantly formed an intention to return the same to \"Emran\".3. That the appellant had reason to believe that Emran would collect the drugs\n\n  immediately upon being told to collect the same.4. That the appellant was not in a state of mind to rationalise and alert the\n\n  Police instead of waiting for \"Emran\" to collect the drugs as he was also in a state of\n\n  panic and in fear that \"Emran\" would harm him if the drugs were not returned to him.5. That the appellant had any mens-rea to facilitate \"Emran\" to\n\n  traffic in the drugs or any knowledge that \"Emran\" would be trafficking in the drugs\n\n  upon receipt of the same.26.    All these points revolved round the assertion that at the\n\ntime the appellant received the bag, he did not know that they contained drugs and, upon being\n\nnotified subsequently by Emran of the same, he panicked and had thought of throwing them away. These\n\nvery points were carefully considered by the trial judge who could not accept the appellants\n\nassertion that he did not know that the bag contained heroin when he took possession of it. This was\n\nhow the trial judge analysed the situation:-In his cautioned statement, he admitted knowledge of the drugs from the time he\n\n  came in possession of them. In the investigation statement he elaborated on the circumstances of\n\n  his possession. In the trial-within-a-trial, he claimed that he did not make the statements\n\n  voluntarily. After the statements were admitted in evidence, he claimed that they did not reflect\n\n  what he had said. He alleged that parts of what he said were not recorded, but that was denied by\n\n  the inspector and the interpreter. He also alleged that substantial portions were put by the\n\n  inspector to which he acquiesced, but this was not put to the inspector or the interpreter.The accuseds account of the events in his defence raised many questions. He\n\n  said Emran offered him a job, but he did not know what work he was required to do. He said he\n\n  thought it was a cleaning job although he knew that Emran was a drug trafficker selling heroin in\n\n  sachets.I did not believe that the accused had wanted the drugs removed from the flat.\n\n  If he had that intention, he would not separate the drugs from the bag they came in. There was no\n\n  reason for him to take them out of the bag and hide them in the grey box under the bed. He would\n\n  not throw the bag away, as he said he may have done.27.    We were unable to see any merit in the grounds set forth in\n\nthe Petition of Appeal. The crux of the appellants contentions related to the question of mens\n\nrea, namely, knowledge as to the things in the bag. The appellant himself was a drug addict. He was\n\naware that Emran was a drug trafficker, as the latter had supplied drugs to him. It defied belief\n\nthat he did not even ask Emran or look into the bag to see what was inside, unless he already knew\n\nwhat was in it by prior arrangement with Emran. This, together with what the appellant had said in\n\nhis cautioned statement, as well as in the statement of 27 March 2001, established overwhelmingly\n\nthat he knew what was in the bag and the trial judge was amply justified to have rejected his plea\n\nof ignorance and the story he tried to spin. There was no basis at all for us to disturb the\n\nfindings of the trial judge. Accordingly, we affirmed the conviction recorded by the court below and\n\ndismissed the appeal.28.    In passing, we would add that even assuming the appellant\n\nreally did not know the bag contained drugs when he received it, and only knew of it ten minutes\n\nlater when notified by Emran, the fact that he kept it by putting them in the grey box constituted\n\npossession of the drugs on his part even though he intended to return them to Emran the next day. By\n\nvirtue of s 17 of the Act, that possession was presumed to be for the purpose of trafficking. The\n\nfact that the appellant intended to return the drugs to the person to whom they belonged would not\n\nrender the act of possession any less a possession for the purpose of trafficking: seeLee Yuan\n\nKwang & Ors v Public Prosecutor[1995] 2 SLR 349andLee Lye Hoe v Public Prosecutor(unreported, Criminal Appeal No 5/2000)."
