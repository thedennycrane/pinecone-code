        "Introduction": "1       This\nappeal brings into acute focus the challenging task of sentencing an\noffender who suffers from a mental disorder falling short of unsoundness\nof mind, but falling within the meaning of Exception 7 (diminished\nresponsibility) to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)\n(“the Code”). 2       The\nappellant, Lim Ghim Peow (“the Appellant”), pleaded guilty to and\nwas convicted of a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder\nunder s 304(a) of the Code. The\nAppellant had set his ex-lover, one Mary Yoong Mei Ling (“the Deceased”),\non fire at her residence on 25 May 2012 by dousing her with petrol\nand setting her ablaze with a lighter. Later on the same day, the\nDeceased passed away due to her burn injuries. The Appellant was\ndiagnosed as suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time\nof the offence. The trial judge (“the Judge”) sentenced him to 20 years’\nimprisonment. His decision is reported inPublic\nProsecutor v Lim GhimPeow[2014]\n2 SLR 522 (“the Judgment”). 3       The\nAppellant appealed against his sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment\non the ground that it was manifestly excessive. He submitted that\nthe Judge failed to appreciate the significance of his psychiatric condition,\nand instead accorded undue weight to the sentencing principles of\nretribution and prevention. 4       After\nhearing the submissions of the parties on 11 July 2014 and carefully\nconsidering all the circumstances of the case, we affirmed the sentence\nimposed by the Judge and dismissed the appeal. We now give the detailed\ngrounds for our decision.",
        "Background to the offence": "5       It\nis apposite to begin with a quick summary of the background facts. These\nfacts are extracted from the statement of facts submitted to the\ncourt below by the Prosecution, which the Appellant admitted to\nwithout qualification. 6       The\nAppellant is a 46-year-old divorcee. At the time of the offence,\nhe was working as a taxi driver and was staying at a rental flat\nin Bendeemeer (“the Rental Flat”). The Deceased was also a divorcee\nand was aged 43 at the time of her death. 7       The\nAppellant and the Deceased first met more than 17 years ago when\nthey were still married to their respective spouses. Their romantic relationship\nstarted sometime in September 2008, and the Deceased moved into\nthe Rental Flat and cohabitated with the Appellant. However, by\nlate 2011, their relationship began to deteriorate and the Deceased\nmoved out of the Rental Flat. Between late 2011 and April 2012,\nthe Deceased alternated between staying with her friend, Justina\nCher Siow Wei (“Justina”), her grandaunt and her aunt. Throughout\nthis period, the Appellant attempted to reconcile with the Deceased,\nbut to no avail. At the time of her demise, the Deceased was already\nin a relationship with another person, Choo Lye Weng (also known\nas “Steven”), and was staying with her cousin, Phua Duan Kai (“the\nVictim”), and his family at their Compassvale flat (“the Flat”). 8       On\n16 February 2012, the Appellant sent the Deceased a text message threatening\nto set fire to Justina’s home if the Deceased refused to meet him.\nAs a result, the Deceased agreed to meet him in the presence of\nhis brother. During the meeting, an argument ensued, in the course\nof which the Deceased accused the Appellant of making empty threats.\nThe Appellant immediately drove to a petrol kiosk to purchase a\nfour-litre tin of petrol, and returned to the meeting place where\nthe Deceased and his brother were still waiting. He showed the tin\nof petrol to the Deceased to prove that his threat was real. The\nAppellant’s brother advised him not to “act crazy”. The meeting\nended without anything untoward happening and the Appellant brought\nthe tin of petrol home. 9       Sometime\nin March 2012, the Deceased entered into a relationship with Steven.\nBetween April and May 2012, the Appellant continued to call the\nDeceased and send her text messages, but she did not respond. On 22 May\n2012, the Deceased made a police report against the Appellant for harassment. 10     On\n23 May 2012, when the Deceased returned to the Flat after running\nan errand, she found the Appellant lying in wait for her. The Deceased\ntried to run away from the Appellant, and called the Victim and another\nmale friend to rescue her. The police were also eventually called\nin. It was after this incident that the Appellant realised that\nthe Deceased had no intention of reconciling with him. Therefore,\nhe resolved to kill the Deceased by burning her and then commit\nsuicide. 11     On\nthat same day (ie, 23 May 2012),\nupon returning to the Rental Flat, the Appellant proceeded to fill\nthree plastic bottles with petrol from the tin of petrol which he\nhad purchased in February 2012. He sealed the caps of the bottles\nwith transparent tape before placing them into a plastic bag. Later\nthat night, the Appellant went to the void deck of the Flat and\nslept at the nearby playground. 12     On\nthe morning of 24 May 2012, the Appellant woke up and kept watch\nat the staircase beside the Flat. However, as he did not see the Deceased,\nhe left after some time. Later that night, the Appellant poured\nthe remaining petrol in the tin of petrol into three other plastic\nbottles. He likewise sealed the three bottles with transparent tape\nand put them into the same bag as the three bottles from the previous\nday. 13     On\n25 May 2012, sometime after 1.00am, the Appellant arrived at the vicinity\nof the Flat. He placed the bag containing the six bottles of petrol\non a plant rack outside the Flat. The Appellant then slept at the\nstaircase landing near the Flat and lay in wait for the Deceased.\nSometime before 8.30am, the Deceased opened the door and the gate\nof the Flat. The Victim was still asleep in his room then. When\nthe Appellant heard the door being opened, he rushed down the staircase\nwith one plastic bottle of petrol in his left hand and a lighter\nin his right hand. He had retrieved the bottle of petrol earlier\nafter a false alarm from a resident of another unit. A brief exchange\nbetween the Deceased and the Appellant ensued. The Appellant asked\nthe Deceased to give him one last chance, but the Deceased reiterated that\nthere was no possibility of reconciliation between them. The Appellant then\nuncapped the bottle of petrol which he was holding and told the Deceased\nthat “he wanted to take her together with him to die” (see the Judgment\nat [26]). 14     The\nDeceased ran back inside the Flat and closed and locked the gate. The\nAppellant reached his right arm through the gate and grabbed the Deceased.\nHe doused the Deceased with petrol from the plastic bottle which he\nheld in his left hand. The Deceased struggled to free herself and screamed\nfor the Victim to save her. The Victim was awakened by the Deceased’s\nscreams and rushed out of his room. The Victim tried to close the\ndoor and pull the Deceased away, but the Appellant managed to keep the\ndoor open. At this point, the Appellant quickly dropped the bottle\nand used the lighter to set the Deceased on fire. The Deceased was\nset alight immediately. The Appellant then released the Deceased\nand let the door close. Inside the flat, the Deceased was engulfed\nin flames. The Victim’s left arm and left leg were also on fire,\nand the fire spread to the door and the ceiling. 15     Eventually,\nthe Deceased and the Victim managed to put out the fire on their\nbodies, and the fire in the Flat was extinguished with the help\nof neighbours. Singapore Civil Defence Force officers and the police\narrived separately at the scene. Upon questioning by the police,\nthe Appellant admitted that he had started the fire because the\nDeceased wanted to leave him and he wanted to die with her. The\nDeceased, the Appellant and the Victim were conveyed to the hospital. 16     The\nmedical report on the Deceased showed that she sustained 75% total\nbody surface area burns with inhalational injury. Most of the burns were\nof full thickness. Her condition subsequently deteriorated and she succumbed\nto her injuries on the same day (ie,\n25 May 2012) at about 10.56pm. The cause of death was stated in\nthe autopsy report as “extensive severe burns”. The Victim and the\nAppellant both sustained some non-fatal burn injuries from the incident.",
        "The sentence imposed by the\nJudge": "17     The\nprescribed punishment for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting\nto murder under s 304(a) of the\nCode is either life imprisonment with the option of caning, or a\nterm of imprisonment which may extend to 20 years with the option\nof a fine or caning. It was against this statutory framework that\nthe Judge decided to sentence the Appellant to the maximum fixed\nterm of imprisonment,viz, 20 years’\nimprisonment. 18     It\nshould be noted that the charge faced by the Appellant was one of culpable\nhomicide not amounting to murder by operation of Exception 7 to s 300\nof the Code. The Prosecution conceded at the hearing below that\nat the time of the offence, the Appellant was suffering from an\nabnormality of mind (namely, a major depressive disorder) which\nsubstantially impaired his mental responsibility for the commission\nof the offence and therefore reduced the offence from that of murder\nto that of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. At the hearing\nbefore the Judge, the Prosecution did not press for the maximum\npunishment of life imprisonment, but argued instead for an imprisonment\nterm of 16 to 20 years. The Appellant, on his part, pleaded for\nan imprisonment term in the region of ten years. 19     Given\nthe Appellant’s major depressive disorder, the Judge was of the view\nthat while rehabilitation of the Appellant was important, it should\nnot be the sole or principal consideration in this case. He felt\nthat there was a need to balance the public interest in protecting\nsociety against the interests of the Appellant. Considering the\ngravity of the offence and the circumstances of the case, the Judge\nheld that the public interest should prevail over the interests\nof the Appellant, and that the primary operative sentencing principle\nin this case ought to be retribution rather than rehabilitation.\nRetribution would entail consideration of the concept of “just deserts”\nand the principle of proportionality. In addition, there was a need\nto consider the principle of prevention, given the Appellant’s latent violent\ndisposition. 20     The\nJudge further noted that there were many aggravating factors in this\ncase. First, there was a strong element of premeditation on the\npart of the Appellant, who formed the motive and made preparations\nto kill the Deceased two days before the offence. Second, the Judge\ntook into account the fact that the Appellant’s mental disorder\n“[did] not appear to … [have] dispossessed him of his self-control”\n(see the Judgment at [60]) or to have made him unable to fully appreciate\nthe consequences of his actions. Third, the Appellant’s attack on\nthe Deceased was vengeful and vicious, causing her severe injuries.\nThe Appellant also did not pay heed to the consequences of his actions\non others, such as the Victim and the residents of neighbouring\nflats. Fourth, the Appellant had a violent temperament, a history\nof substance abuse and drug consumption, as well as previous detentions\nfor gang-related offences. This led the Judge to conclude that pursuant\nto the sentencing principle of prevention, society had to be protected\nfrom the Appellant, who was quick-tempered, impulsive and had a\nlatent violent disposition. 21     However,\nthe Judge also took into account a number of mitigating factors.\nThe Appellant had pleaded guilty to the charge. Further, at the\ntime of the offence, he was suffering from a major depressive disorder\nthat significantly impaired his judgment. The Judge noted the findings\nin the psychiatric reports that the Appellant required psychiatric\ncare and treatment for an indefinite period of time in a correctional\nsetting, and that his condition would inevitably relapse should\nhe leave a correctional environment. The Judge also considered the\nfact that the Appellant’s three daughters had filed affidavits indicating\nthat they would support the Appellant upon his release from prison. 22     Applying\nthe sentencing principle of retribution and the principle of proportionality\nin sentencing, the Judge stated that the maximum sentence of life\nimprisonment might not be appropriate. However, he was of the view (at\n[80] of the Judgment) that notwithstanding the Appellant’s mental disorder,\n“a very substantial sentence” was required to meet the community interest\nin retribution because of “the very aggravating features of the\ncase”. A long custodial sentence was also warranted by virtue of\nthe principle of prevention. The Judge therefore sentenced the Appellant\nto 20 years’ imprisonment.",
        "Our decision": "",
        "Overview": "23     The\nissue before us was whether, given the circumstances of the case, the\nsentence imposed by the Judge was manifestly excessive. It is trite\nlaw that an appellate court has only limited grounds for intervention\nwith respect to sentences meted out by a lower court, one of the\ngrounds being that the sentence concerned is manifestly excessive.\nTo establish this ground, it must be shown that the sentence is\nunjustly severe, and “requires substantial alterations rather than\nminute corrections to remedy the injustice” (seePublic\nProsecutor v Siew Boon Loong[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at [22]).\nIn this regard, as pointed out inAngliss Singapore\nPte Ltd v Public Prosecutor[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [14]: … The mere fact that an appellate court\nwould have awarded a higher or lower sentence than the trial judge\nis not sufficient to compel the exercise of its appellate powers,\nunless it is coupled with a failure by the trial judge to appreciate\nthe facts placed before him or where the trial judge’s exercise\nof his sentencing discretion was contrary to principle and/or law.\n… 24     It\nwas evident that the offence committed in the present case was both premeditated\nand heinous in nature. The Appellant doused the Deceased with petrol\nand set her on fire, causing extensive and severe burns which ultimately\nresulted in her death. Indeed, the Deceased must have suffered excruciating\npain before she eventually succumbed to her burn injuries. This\ncase was therefore one of the more serious cases of culpable homicide not\namounting to murder to have come before our courts. 25     That\nsaid, the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender\nis always a relevant factor in the sentencing process. The manner and\nextent of its relevance depends on the circumstances of each case,\nin particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder. In\nfact, the existence of a mental disorder often gives rise to contradictory\nsentencing objectives. As V K Rajah JA noted inPublic\nProsecutor v Goh Lee Yin and another appeal[2008] 1 SLR(R)\n824 (“Goh Lee Yin (2008)”) at [1],\n“the paradox of sentencing the mentally ill” is that “[s]uch illnesses\ncan be a mitigating consideration or point towards a future danger\nthat may require more severe sentencing”. This echoes what was stated\nby the High Court of Australia inVeen v The\nQueen (No 2)(1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476–477 (cited with\napproval by the Singapore Court of Appeal inPublic\nProsecutor v AnizabteEssa[2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (“Aniza”) at [70]): … The purposes of criminal punishment are\nvarious: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of\nothers who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The\npurposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation\nfrom the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence\nin a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence\nbut sometimes they point in different directions.And\nso a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society\nwhen he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for\na particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects:\none which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards\na shorter.[emphasis added]",
        "Sentencing principles for mentally\ndisordered offenders": "26     In\nsentencing a mentally disordered offender, there is generally a tension\nbetween the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence on\nthe one hand, and the principle of rehabilitation on the other.\nThe approach which our courts have adopted is that the element ofgeneraldeterrencemaybe\ngiven considerably less weight if the offender was suffering from\na mental disorder at the time of the offence, particularly if the\nmental disorder was causally related to the offence. This was stated\nby Yong Pung How CJ in the Singapore High Court case ofNg So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor[2003]\n3 SLR(R) 178 (“Connie Ng”) at [58]\nas follows: … [T]he element of general deterrence can\nand should be given considerably less weight if the offender was\nsuffering from a mental disorder at the time of the commission of\nthe offence. This is particularly so if there is a causal link between\nthe mental disorder and the commission of the offence. In addition to\nthe need for a causal link, other factors such as the seriousness\nof the mental condition, the likelihood of the [offender] repeating\nthe offence and the severity of the crime, are factors which have\nto be taken into account by the sentencing judge. In my view, general\ndeterrence will not be enhanced by meting out an imprisonment term\nto [an offender] suffering from a serious mental disorder which\nled to the commission of the offence. 27     The\nproposition in the passage above has been cited with approval in numerous\nSingapore authorities (see,eg,Public Prosecutor v Lim Ah Liang[2007]\nSGHC 34 at [40],Public Prosecutor v Lim Ah\nSeng[2007] 2 SLR(R) 957 at [49],Public\nProsecutor v Aguilar GuenGarlejo[2006]\n3 SLR(R) 247 (“Aguilar”) at [44]\nandGoh Lee Yin (2008)at [94]).\nThe policy rationale underlying this proposition is that an offender\nwho suffers from a mental disorder is usually not an appropriate\nobject for exemplary punishment. 28     That\nsaid, we should clarify that the element of general deterrence may\nstill be accorded full weight in some circumstances, such as where\nthe mental disorder is not serious or is not causally related to\nthe commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious one.\nIn this regard, it is pertinent to note that the passage inConnie Ngquoted at [26] above can be\ntraced to the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia inR v Wiskich[2000] SASC 64 (“Wiskich”). InConnie\nNg, Yong CJ referred toSentencing\nPractice in the Subordinate Courts(Richard Magnuset aleds) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003)\nat p 93 and noted that the authors had cited an excerpt fromWiskichat [62], which was reproduced\ninConnie Ng(at [57]) as follows: An assessment of the severity of the disorder\nis required. A sentencing court must determine the impact of the\ndisorder upon both the offender’s thought processes and the capacity\nof the offender to appreciate the gravity and significance of the\ncriminal conduct. …It is not difficult to\nunderstand that the element of general deterrence can readily be\ngiven considerably less weight in the case of an offender suffering\nfrom a significant mental disorder who commits a minor crime, particularly\nif a causal relationship exists between the mental disorder and\nthe commission of such an offence.In some circumstances,\nhowever, the mental disorder may not be serious or causally related\nto the commission of the crime, and the circumstances of the crime\nso grave, that very little weight in mitigation can be given to\nthe existence of the mental disorder and full weight must be afforded\nto the element of general deterrence. In between those extremes,\nan infinite variety of circumstances will arise in which competing\nconsiderations must be balanced. [emphasis in original] 29     It\nis evident from the passage cited above that there isnoblanket rule that the court will give\nless weight to the element of general deterrence on the basis that\nthe offender was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of\nthe offence. In fact, the court inWiskichfound\nthat weight should be given to general deterrence notwithstanding\nthe existence of a mental disorder on the part of the respondent\noffender in that case. 30     InWiskich, the respondent pleaded guilty\nto the offence of murder and was sentenced to the mandatory sentence\nof life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years. The Prosecution\napplied for leave to appeal against the non-parole period on the\nground that it was manifestly inadequate. Amongst other things,\nthe Prosecution argued that the trial judge erred in reducing by\nseven years the non-parole period that he would otherwise have imposed\nby reason of the “mental condition” of the respondent (seeWiskichat [1]). 31     The\nfactual background against which the offence inWiskichwas committed\nbears much similarity to that in the present case. The respondent\nthere had been in a relationship with a young woman (“J”), which\nbegan to deteriorate when J went to university. Attempts by J to\nend the relationship were strongly resisted by the respondent. Subsequently,\nthe respondent discovered that J was in a relationship with the\ndeceased and became intensely jealous, even threatening to kill\nhimself on a few occasions. The trial judge found that in the weeks\npreceding the offence, the respondent was constantly preoccupied\nby his jealousy and eventually formed the intention to kill the\ndeceased and then himself. The respondent undertook preparations\nfor the commission of the offence, such as placing a small axe (described\nas a “tomahawk”) in a backpack in his vehicle and keeping watch\non the deceased’s house. On the day of the offence, the respondent\nwaited near the deceased’s home and trailed the deceased in his vehicle\nwhen the deceased left his home on a bicycle. The respondent ran the\ndeceased down from behind and proceeded to strike the deceased,\nwho was still conscious on the ground, on the head at least nine\ntimes with the tomahawk. The deceased died at the scene soon after\nthe attack. 32     At\nfirst instance, the trial judge found that the respondent was at\nthe material time suffering from “three independent but interacting\nmental disorders” (seeWiskichat\n[15]), which were set out in the reports of three psychiatrists.\nThose mental disorders were, namely: (a) obsessive compulsive disorder\nsince childhood; (b) depressive illness since about two years before\nthe commission of the offence; and (c) difficulties in social relationships\nand obsessive suspiciousness. Significantly, the trial judge also stated\nthat although the respondent’s mental illness was such that it had significantly\nimpaired his capacity for self-reason and self-control, he remained\ncapable of understanding the nature and implications of his actions\n(seeWiskichat [15]). Notwithstanding\nthis, the trial judge allowed a reduction of seven years from the\nnon-parole period on account of the respondent’s diminished sense\nof responsibility stemming from his mental disorder, and fixed a\nnon-parole period of 14 years (seeWiskichat [16]–[17]). 33     On\nappeal before the Supreme Court of South Australia, Martin J, who\ndelivered the leading judgment, held that the trial judge had erred\nin giving little or considerably reduced weight to the element of\ngeneral deterrence, and had imposed a non-parole period which was\nmanifestly inadequate. Martin J therefore fixed a new non-parole\nperiod of 18 years. He noted (at [69] ofWiskich)\nthat “the respondent knew what he was doing and knew that it was\nwrong”, and further, that the respondent “formulated a plan to kill\nthe deceased, armed himself for that purpose and carried out the\nplan”, albeit in “an obsessive manner and with disordered thinking”. Martin J\ntherefore stated (also at [69] ofWiskich): … The element of general deterrence is,\ntherefore, of particular importance in fixing non-parole periods\nfor crimes of murder committed in such circumstances, particularly\nwhere the crime was not committed on impulse, but was planned over\na period of time before being carried into effect with the brutality\nI have previously described … 34     Martin J\nalso made the following statement inWiskichat\n[62], which was omitted from the passage reproduced inConnie Ng: … [A]s a general proposition, if an offender\nacts with knowledge of what is being done and with knowledge of\nthe gravity of the criminal conduct, the importance of the element\nof general deterrence otherwise appropriate in the particular circumstances\nis not greatly affected. … 35     We\nwould therefore reiterate that the existence of a mental disorder on\nthe part of the offender does not automatically reduce the importance\nof the principle of general deterrence in sentencing. Much depends\non the circumstances of each individual case. If the nature of the\nmental disorder is such that it does not affect the offender’s capacity\nto appreciate the gravity and significance of his criminal conduct,\nthe application of the sentencing principle of general deterrence\nmay not be greatly affected. 36     Similarly,\nthe sentencing principle ofspecificdeterrencemaybe of limited application in cases\ninvolving mentally disordered offenders. Whereas general deterrence\nis directed at educating and deterring other like-minded members\nof the general public by making an example of the particular offender\nconcerned, specific deterrence is directed at discouraging that\nparticular offender from committing offences in future (seePublic Prosecutor v Tan Fook Sum[1999]\n1 SLR(R) 1022 at [18]). The reason why specific deterrence may not\nbe a relevant consideration when sentencing mentally disordered\noffenders is that specific deterrence is premised on the assumption\nthat the offender can balance and weigh consequences before committing\nan offence (seeTan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor[2006]\n4 SLR(R) 10 at [32]). The aim of specific deterrence is to deter\nthe particular offender concerned from committing any further offences.\nIt follows that where that offender’s mental disorder has seriously inhibited\nhis ability to make proper choices or appreciate the nature and quality\nof his actions, it is unlikely that specific deterrence will fulfil\nits aim of instilling in him the fear of re-offending. Conversely,\nspecific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence\nis premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the\noffence (seePublic Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng[2007]\n2 SLR(R) 814 at [22]). This remains the case notwithstanding the\nexistence of a mental disorder on the part of the particular offender\nconcerned. 37     Rehabilitation\nmay take precedence where the sentencing principle of deterrence\nis rendered less effective by virtue of a serious psychiatric condition\nor mental disorder on the part of the offender (seeGoh\nLee Yin v Public Prosecutor[2006] 1 SLR(R) 530 at [29]).\nRehabilitation, however, has both a public and an individual dimension\n(seeGoh Lee Yin (2008)at [99]). On\nthe one hand, the courts are concerned about the welfare of the\noffender and the manner of reform and treatment which is most suitable, particularly\nif the offender suffers from a psychiatric illness or other special psychiatric\ncondition. On the other hand, the underlying aim of rehabilitation\nis to advance the greater public interest by reducing the risk of\nrecidivism. 38     It\nis, moreover, erroneous to assume that rehabilitation necessarily dictates\nthat a lighter sentence be imposed on a mentally disordered offender.\nThis again depends very much on the nature of the offence as well as\nthe nature and severity of the offender’s mental disorder. The case\nofPublic Prosecutor v KwongKokHing[2008]\n2 SLR(R) 684 serves as a useful illustration. In that case, the\nrespondent was charged with attempting to commit culpable homicide\nby pushing the victim into the path of an oncoming train at a train\nstation. He was diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder at\nthe time of the offence. In the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence,\nthe Court of Appeal observed (at [37]) that “[w]hile the respondent’s\nrehabilitation was a relevant consideration, there was no suggestion\nthat he could not be similarly rehabilitated in prison”, and that “even\nif one were to place considerable weight on rehabilitation as a sentencing\nprinciple, it did not necessitate a light sentence in the current case”. 39     In\ncases involving serious offences, there is no reason why the retributive\nand protective principles of sentencing should not prevail over the\nprinciple of rehabilitation, notwithstanding the offender’s mental disorder.\nAs Rajah JA stated inGoh Lee Yin (2008)at\n[107]: … [T]his is not to say that inalloffences committed owing to a psychiatric disease,\nrehabilitation must be the foremost consideration. Indeed, assuming that\nan offender suffers from a psychiatric disease which causes him\nto commit a particular heinous offence, it would surely not be correct\nto say that such an offender ought to be rehabilitated to the exclusion\nof other public interests. Rehabilitation may still be a relevant\nconsideration, but such rehabilitation may very well have to take\nplace in an environment where the offender is prevented from recommitting\nsimilar offences. [emphasis in original] We also note with approval the commentary in Kow Keng Siong,Sentencing Principles in Singapore(Academy\nPublishing, 2009) at para 18.125 that “the retributive principle\nfeatures prominently in the sentencing of mentally disordered offenders\nor intellectually challenged offenders where the offence isparticularly serious or heinous” [emphasis\nin original]. The principle of retribution will be particularly\nrelevant if the offender’s mental disorder did not seriously impair\nhis capacity to appreciate the nature and gravity of his actions.\nProtection of the public will also be a relevant consideration in\ncases involving serious offences and “dangerous” offenders, notwithstanding\nthe fact that at the material time, the offender was suffering from\na psychiatric disorder which caused the commission of the very offence\nconcerned (seeGoh Lee Yin (2008)at [108]).\nIndeed, there is no reason why the public interest of protecting society\nshould necessarily cease to be a relevant consideration when dealing with\na mentally disordered offender. Ultimately, the court must balance\nthe interests of society against those of the offender. In every\ncase, it is often this search for the right balance which poses\nthe greatest difficulties.",
        "The Appellant’s psychiatric\ncondition": "40     In\nthe present case, the relevant clinical evidence on the Appellant’s mental\ndisorder consisted of four psychiatric reports issued from July\n2012 to December 2013 by Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”), a consultant psychiatrist\nat the Institute of Mental Health (“the IMH”). Those reports were\nbased on,inter alia, Dr Goh’s examination\nof the Appellant on various occasions, interviews with the Appellant’s\nfamily members and friends, as well as a review of the clinical\nnotes from a previous visit to the IMH by the Appellant in December\n2011. 41     In\nDr Goh’s first psychiatric report dated 5 July 2012 (“the 1st Psychiatric\nReport”), he diagnosed the Appellant as having a major depressive\ndisorder which preceded the offence. The Appellant had sought consultation\nat the IMH in December 2011, and had been diagnosed as having a\nmajor depressive episode then. He did not follow up after that visit.\nIn Dr Goh’s opinion, the Appellant was “still labouring under symptoms\nof major depressive disorder around the time of the … offence” and\nhis major depressive disorder led him to adopt desperate acts to\nget the Deceased to resume their relationship. Dr Goh stated: … When [the Appellant] concluded [that\nthe Deceased] would never return to him, his depressive mental state\nwould have limited the options available to him and tip[ped] his\ndecision making towards his plans to kill [the Deceased] and himself.\n… 42     The\nnature and severity of the Appellant’s major depressive disorder was\nfurther explained by Dr Goh in his second psychiatric report dated 6 September\n2012 (“the 2nd Psychiatric Report”). In that report, Dr Goh opined\nthat the Appellant’s major depressive disorder amounted to an abnormality\nof mind, and that there was clinically significant impairment in\nhis decision-making capacity with regard to the offence. However, Dr Goh\nalso stated that the Appellant “did not appear to lack the capacity\nto comprehend the events or the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness\nof his actions”, noting that the Appellant had: (a) said that he\nintended to kill the Deceased and then himself; (b) made the necessary\npreparations; (c) left “final instructions” for his daughters; (d) monitored\nthe scene; and (e) waited for the Deceased to emerge from the Flat.\nDr Goh explained the impact of the Appellant’s mental disorder on\nthe commission of the offence as follows: His depressive outlook, especially given\nthe severity of his depression and significant psychosocial impairments\nthat he had, had contributed to the commission of the act, in that\nit led him to conclude that he had no other choices and that his\nlife had no meaning when the [D]eceased refused to reconcile with\nhim. A depressed individual like the [Appellant] can be prone to\n“catastrophizing” and focus only on the negative aspects of his\nsituation, leading to a failure to consider prosocial alternatives\nin his relationship with the [D]eceased or with others, and to conclude\nthere was “no way out” other than the course of action that led\nto the death of the [D]eceased. [The Appellant] already has a violent and\nimpulsive propensity related to his personality attributes, and\nhe was also abusing drugs. Relating to the offence, his major depressive\ndisorder would have further impaired his degree of self-control\nsignificantly. 43     The\nAppellant’s “violent and impulsive propensity” was also noted by Dr Goh\nin his other reports. In the 1st Psychiatric Report, Dr Goh observed that\nthis “violent and impulsive propensity” predated the offence, and\nhad contributed to the Appellant’s conflicts and fights with his\nfamily and other persons as well as to his suicide and other self-harm\nattempts. In addition, Dr Goh stated that the Appellant had a history\nof substance abuse, which he had resumed shortly before the offence\nby consuming methamphetamine and marijuana. In Dr Goh’s third psychiatric\nreport on the Appellant dated 4 April 2013 (“the 3rd Psychiatric\nReport”), Dr Goh opined that the Appellant had violent tendencies\nand an impulsive personality trait: [The Appellant] has a severe mental illness\nand history of treatment discontinuation, conduct problems in his\nchildhood, substance misuse and history of violence and suicide\nattempts. Furthermore, his past behaviours, including being involved\nin fights from a young age, two self-harm attempts, and the circumstances\nleading to the index offence, strongly suggest [an] impulsive personality\ntrait. … 44     As\nfor the Appellant’s likelihood of recidivism and his need for follow-up\npsychiatric care and treatment, Dr Goh stated in the 3rd Psychiatric\nReport: Given the severity of the offence, the\n[Appellant] would require psychiatric care and treatment for an\nindefinite period of time, and close supervision and monitoring\nof his psychiatric treatment, in order to manage the above risk factors\nwell to mitigate his violence and self-harm risks. … Further, Dr Goh stated that “[t]he supervision and monitoring\nof [the Appellant’s] psychiatric condition to manage such risks\ncould be carried out in a correctional setting”. 45     In\nhis final report on the Appellant dated 4 December 2013 (“the 4th Psychiatric\nReport”), Dr Goh noted that the Appellant’s depressive symptoms\nhad resolved with treatment and that his depressive illness was in\nremission at the time of that report. Dr Goh, however, expressed\nconcern that the Appellant’s “insight into his need for treatment\nfor his depression and the role of medications appear[ed] limited”,\nand that the Appellant “appeared over-confident that his depressive\ndisorder would not recur and that he would not resume his substance\nmisuse in the community”. According to Dr Goh, the Appellant had\nalso expressed a preference for living on his own after his release\nfrom prison, which “would raise concerns about the monitoring and\nsupervision of his psychiatric care in the community”. Dr Goh strongly\nadvised that the Appellant should receive “long-term psychiatric\nfollow-up and treatment, to maintain his remission and reduce the\nrisk of relapse of his major depressive disorder”. Dr Goh also suggested\nthat the Appellant could receive “close monitoring and supervision\nwith regards to his psychiatric condition and early detection of any\nrecurrence of depressive symptom[s]” in a controlled environment\nlike a prison.",
        "Whether the Judge failed to\nappreciate the significance of the Appellant’s mental disorder and/or\naccorded undue weight to retribution and prevention": "46     Having\nregard to the four psychiatric reports issued by Dr Goh, we did\nnot think the Judge failed to appreciate the nature or significance\nof the Appellant’s mental disorder. 47     A\npreliminary point raised by the Appellant was that the Judge had unfairly\nstated that the offence would have been one of murder had the Appellant\nnot been diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive disorder at\nthe time of the offence. As an example of such a statement, the\nAppellant pointed to [43] of the Judgment, where the Judge stated\nthat “[t]his would have been a clear case of murder if it had not\nbeen for his major depressive disorder diagnosed by Dr Goh”. At\nthe hearing before us, counsel for the Appellant also suggested\nthat comments such as the above showed that the Judge had prejudged\nthe case. 48     In\nour view, the Judge, in making the above statement, was merely stating\nthe fact that but for the Appellant’s major depressive disorder, which\nthe Prosecution conceded amounted to an abnormality of mind, the Appellant\nwould, in all likelihood, have been charged with and convicted of murder.\nThe evidence was clear that the Appellant had made up his mind that\nunless the Deceased agreed to reconcile with him, he would kill\nher and then take his own life. He did precisely that on the fateful\nday when the Deceased persisted in rejecting his plea for reconciliation.\nIt was not disputed that this was a case where the Prosecution had\nproved the fault element for murder, but the offence was reduced\nto that of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by operation\nof the special exception of diminished responsibility (see [18]\nabove). In the circumstances, we could not see anything unfair in\nwhat the Judge stated as quoted above. 49     The\nmain issue raised by the Appellant related to the Judge’s findings at\n[60] of the Judgment, which reads as follows: Accused appeared\nnormal to family members and friends 60This is not a\ncase in which the accused suddenly snapped because of his mental\ncondition. This also does not appear to be a case in which the major depressive\ndisorder had dispossessed him of his self-control. Anyone looking\nat the facts of this case will not come to the conclusion that the\naccused was suffering from a major depressive disorder.His\nfriends and family members, according to Dr Goh, did not observe\nhim to manifest any psychotic behaviour. He was only diagnosed to\nbe suffering from major depressive disorder when he was sent to\n[the] IMH for an assessment after his arrest. What the accused had\ndone here was methodological and meticulous. He had prepared his\nmurder tool, the petrol, by filling it up in plastic bottles which made\nit convenient for him to douse the [D]eceased with the petrol. He\ntaped the caps so as to prevent anybody from detecting the petrol\nwhich he intended to use to kill the [D]eceased. He lay in wait\nfor the opportune moment to ambush the [D]eceased. He also carried\nwith him a lighter just in case the [D]eceased were to attempt to\nrun away, proving that he had considered contingencies as well.\nThe entire plan to kill the [Deceased] was devised in a cold, conscientious\nmanner over a span of two days. Also, the accused was in no hurry\nto kill the [D]eceased. He was patient and had no qualms about waiting\nuntil the next day when no opportune moment arose when he first\nlay in wait for the [D]eceased. Instead of giving up, he was persistent\nin carrying out his plan.There was nothing\nto suggest that the accused’s major depressive disorder made him\nunable to fully appreciate the consequences of his actions. Therefore,\nthe accused deserves a harsher sentence than an offender who had\ncommitted the offence on impulse arising from a severe mental disorder. [emphasis added] 50     We\ndid not think that the remarks made by the Judge in the above passage\nindicated that he failed to appreciate the significance of the Appellant’s\nmental disorder or the impact of the same on the commission of the\noffence. While Dr Goh did state in the 2nd Psychiatric Report that the\nAppellant’s major depressive disorder would have impaired his degree of\nself-control and his decision-making capacity with regard to the\noffence, Dr Goh also opined in that report that the Appellant did\nnot appear to lack “the capacity to comprehend the events or the\ncapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions” (see [42]\nabove). Dr Goh’s opinion was that the Appellant’s major depressive\ndisorder, coupled with his violent and impulsive personality, led\nhim to decide on the course of action that resulted in the death\nof the Deceased. This, however, did not mean that the Appellant\ncould not comprehend the gravity of his actions or the wrongfulness\nof his conduct. As both Dr Goh and the Judge noted, the Appellant\nformed the intention to kill the Deceased some time before the commission\nof the offence, and carried out his plan in quite a meticulous manner. 51     The\nJudge therefore did not err in drawing a distinction between, on the\none hand, the present case and, on the other hand, cases where the mental\ndisorder had completely dispossessed the offender of his awareness of\nthe nature and illegality of his actions or where the offender had committed\nthe offence on impulse due to his mental disorder. Here, the Appellant\nhad carefully planned his moves – he had decided to take the Deceased’s\nlife and his own too, reasoning that if he could not have the Deceased,\nthen no one else should have her. We should clarify at this juncture\nthat there is an erroneous statement of fact at [60] of the Judgment (quoted\nat [49] above). The Appellant was first diagnosed as having a major depressive\ndisorder in December 2011,beforethe\ncommission of the offence, and not (as the Judge stated) after his\narrest for the offence. However, this error was not material and\ndoes not detract from what we have said in the previous paragraph. 52     In\nthe light of the nature of the Appellant’s major depressive disorder and\nits effect on the commission of the offence, we were of the view\nthat the Judge did not err in considering retribution and prevention\ninstead of rehabilitation to be the primary sentencing principles\nthat were applicable in this case. A mental disorder, even if it\nsubstantially impaired the offender’s mental responsibility for\nthe commission of the offence and thereby reduced the offence (in\nthe context of the offence of culpable homicide under s 299 of the\nCode) from that of murder to that of culpable homicide not amounting\nto murder, cannot be invoked as a blanket excuse for every aspect\nof the offender’s criminal conduct. In every case, it is imperative\nthat the sentencing court examine the nature and gravity of the offender’s\nmental disorder and its impact on the commission of the offence before\narriving at a sentence that takes into account and balances the relevant\nsentencing objectives. This echoes what we have said above at [35]–[39]\nthat if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and\nof the gravity of his actions, and the offence is particularly serious\nor heinous, the principles of deterrence, retribution and protection\nmay assume primacy in the sentencing process. In the present case,\nthe offence committed was horrendous, causing severe pain and suffering\nto the Deceased. No doubt, the Appellant’s major depressive disorder\ncontributed to his decision to kill the Deceased by limiting his\nperception of the choices available to him. However, as we have\nstated above, there was nothing to indicate that the Appellant lacked\nthe capacity to comprehend his actions or appreciate the wrongfulness\nof his conduct. In the circumstances, it was open to the Judge to\ngive precedence to the consideration of protecting the public as\nwell as the need to punish the Appellant appropriately for his offence. 53     That\nsaid, this did not mean that the Appellant’s rehabilitation ceased to\nbe a relevant consideration at all. In fact, there was every suggestion\nin this case that the Appellant’s rehabilitation would be best carried\nout in a structured and correctional environment. According to Dr Goh,\nthe Appellant would require psychiatric care and treatment for an\nindefinite period of time, coupled with close supervision and monitoring\nof his psychiatric treatment. While we agreed with the Appellant\nthat Dr Goh did not state that the Appellant’s mental disorder,\nwhich is now in remission, would inevitably relapse should he leave\na correctional environment, Dr Goh’s reports did indicate that the\nAppellant did not seem to appreciate the need for continued treatment\nof his mental disorder if he were to be released into the community\nand be left to his own devices. 54     Dr Goh\nidentified several risk factors in the 4th Psychiatric Report (see\n[45] above), which pointed towards the need for a long custodial sentence\nfor the Appellant’s rehabilitation. First, the Appellant appeared\nto have a limited insight into his need for treatment and the purpose\nof medication. Second, the Appellant had a history of treatment discontinuance\nand his motivation for psychiatric treatment had been low prior\nto the offence. He had discontinued his treatment at the IMH after\nhis first visit in December 2011. Third, at the time of the 4th\nPsychiatric Report, the Appellant had expressed a preference for\nliving on his own after his release from prison. We note that the\nAppellant did subsequently present additional affidavits from his\nthree daughters stating their commitment to provide him with support\nand look after his welfare upon his release from prison. We agree\nwith the Judge that such family support is heartening and is to\nbe encouraged. However, the practicalities of the situation need\nto be taken into account. The Appellant has been identified by Dr Goh\nas having an impulsive personality trait and violent tendencies, and\nhis history includes several attempted suicide and self-harm episodes\nas well as periods of substance abuse. Given this background and\nthe inherent character traits of the Appellant, the ability of his\ndaughters to provide him with the supervision and care necessary\nfor his continued psychiatric well-being may be limited.",
        "The sentencing precedents": "55     Although\nthe Appellant submitted that the Judge erred in appreciating the\nrelevant sentencing precedents, we did not think that the cases\nrelied on by the Appellant were of much assistance. In the first\nplace, comparisons with the sentences imposed in individual cases\nare of limited utility, given the wide variety of circumstances\nin which offences of culpable homicide are committed. This was noted\nby the Court of Appeal inPublic Prosecutor\nv Tan Kei Loon Allan[1998] 3 SLR(R) 679 at [33], where\nit stated that sentencing for culpable homicide should, for this\nreason, remain a matter within the trial judge’s discretion and\nbe left to be determined on the facts of each particular case. 56     Second,\nthe difficulty with comparing the sentences imposed in other cases\nof culpable homicide not amounting to murder is intensified by the fact\nthat the maximum fixed term of imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Code was increased from ten\nyears to 20 years under the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51\nof 2007), which came into effect on 1 February 2008. This amendment\nwas intended to give the courts greater flexibility in sentencing\noffenders for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder. Cases based on the pre-1 February 2008 version of s 304(a) (“pre-amendment cases”) therefore have\nto be viewed with this legislative background in mind. However,\nit should be noted at the same time that the increase in the maximum\nfixed term of imprisonment under the present version of s 304(a) does notper sewarrant\nthe imposition of a more severe sentence, and the punishment imposed\nmust still reflect the gravity of the offence (seePublic\nProsecutor v VitriaDepsiWahyuni (alias Fitriah)[2013] 1 SLR 699\nat [35]). 57     The\npre-amendment cases cited by the Appellant did not indicate that the\nAppellant deserved a lighter sentence in the present case. The offenders in\nbothAguilarandPublic\nProsecutor v Ong Pang Siew (No. 2)[2011] SGHC 177 (“Ong Pang Siew”) were each sentenced to\nten years’ imprisonment (viz, the\nmaximum fixed term of imprisonment prior to 1 February 2008), while\nthe offender inAnizawas sentenced\nto nine years’ imprisonment. The only pre-amendment case where the\nsentence imposed was not close to the then maximum fixed term of\nimprisonment of ten years wasPublic Prosecutor\nv Han John Han[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1180 (“Han\nJohn Han”), where the offender’s sentence was enhanced\nby the Court of Appeal from three to five years’ imprisonment. 58     Furthermore,\nthe nature and severity of the mental disorders suffered by the\noffenders in the above cases as well as the circumstances in which\nthe offences were committed were not analogous to those in the present\ncase. There was no element of premeditation or planning of the offence\ninAguilar,Ong\nPang SiewandHan John Han.\nInHan John Han, the sentencing\ncourt also took into account the low risk of recurrence of the offender’s\npsychotic condition and the fact that he had had good familial and\nprofessional relationships up until the time of the offence (seeHan John Hanat [9] and [12]). As forAniza, a key distinguishing factor would appear\nto be that it was accepted in that case that the offender “was suffering\nfrom an impairment of her cognitive appreciation of what she was doing”\n(at [68]); moreover, the offender’s psychiatric illness was “transient” and\nits dominant cause was “prolonged spousal abuse by the deceased towards\nher” (at [35]). In contrast, the clinical evidence in the present\ncase was that the Appellant did not appear to lack the capacity\nto comprehend his actions at the material time, and that his mental\ndisorder required long-term psychiatric treatment and care. Moreover,\nunlike the offender inAniza, who\nhad been a victim of persistent spousal abuse, in the present case,\nthe Appellant was the aggressor throughout his relationship with\nthe Deceased. 59     With\nregard to the cases cited by the Appellant based on the post-1 February\n2008 version of s 304(a), the sentences\nimposed in those cases for the offence of culpable homicide not\namounting to murder ranged from five years’ imprisonment to 18 years’\nimprisonment. InPublic Prosecutor v Wu Yun\nYunCriminal Case No 16 of 2009 (11 December 2009, unreported),\nthe accused purchased a knife two weeks prior to the offence as\nshe had become jealous of the deceased and the victim, who were\nher brother-in-law and her sister-in-law respectively. About two\ndays before the offence, the accused decided to carry out her plan\nto stab either the deceased or the victim in the early hours of\nthe morning. She stabbed the victim twice in the neck and the deceased\nthrice in his chest and abdomen. She was found to be suffering from\na major depressive disorder at the material time, and was sentenced\nto a total of 16 years’ imprisonment, comprising 12 years’ imprisonment\non one charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and four\nyears’ imprisonment on a second charge of attempting to commit culpable\nhomicide not amounting to murder. 60     InPublic Prosecutor v Goh Hai EngCriminal\nCase No 4 of 2010 (24 February 2010, unreported) (“Goh\nHai Eng”), the accused, who was suffering from a bipolar\ndisorder at the material time, killed her younger daughter by stabbing\nthe latter in the chest while the latter was asleep. The accused\nhad been depressed over her recent divorce and financial burdens, which\nled her to decide to kill her younger daughter and then commit suicide.\nThe accused was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment on a charge of\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. 61     InPublic Prosecutor v Kumaresen a/lMuthian @ RathuCriminal Case No 16 of\n2011 (18 July 2011, unreported) (“Kumaresen”),\nthe accused, pursuant to a quarrel with the deceased: (a) used a\n30cm-long metallic angle bar to hit the deceased’s head several\ntimes; (b) punched the deceased’s face with his fist; and also (c) used\nhis feet to stamp on the deceased’s chest and abdomen. The deceased\nlater died from multiple injuries. The accused, who was suffering\nfrom a major depressive disorder at the time of the offence, was\nsentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment. 62     InPublic Prosecutor v Luo Faming[2011]\nSGHC 238 (“Luo Faming”), the accused\n(“Luo”) stabbed and killed his colleague (“Gong”) and also hit his\nsupervisor (“Ng”) on the head with a hammer. The day before the incident,\nthe accused had quarrelled with Gong, and Ng had intervened. The\naccused felt that Ng had favoured Gong and resolved that night to\ntake revenge on Gong and Ng by killing them the next day. The accused\nwas found to be suffering from a major depressive disorder which\nsubstantially impaired his mental responsibility for his actions\nat the time of the offence. The accused pleaded guilty, and was\nsentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment on a charge of culpable homicide\nnot amounting to murder and six years’ imprisonment on a second\ncharge of attempting to commit culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder, making a total sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment. 63     In\nview of the aforesaid cases, we did not think that the Judge’s sentence\nof 20 years’ imprisonment was out of line. In the first place, most of\nthe above cases were unreported, and thus, we do not have any significant\ndetails as to the nature and severity of the mental disorders suffered\nby the offenders concerned, nor do we have details of the impact\nof those mental disorders on the commission of the offence. This,\nas we have mentioned earlier, is crucial in determining which sentencing considerations\nshould apply and what the final sentence to be imposed on the offender\nshould be. Moreover, there were factors distinguishing the above\ncases from the present case. There was no element of premeditation inKumaresen. While there was premeditation\nin the other three cases, we note that inGoh\nHai Eng, the offender and the victim were mother and child.\nMoreover, in contrast to the three cases in which the offences were premeditated,\nthe method of killing employed in the present case was particularly\ncruel and vicious (cf, for example,Luo Faming, where it was stated at [19]\nthat “[o]ffences under s 304(a)\nof the Penal Code are usually violent but there was no sadistic\nfeature in this case”).",
        "Conclusion": "64     For\nthe reasons elucidated above, we did not think that the sentence of\n20 years’ imprisonment imposed by the Judge was manifestly excessive. A\nlong custodial sentence was warranted in the light of the many serious aggravating\nfactors in the present case, notwithstanding that the Appellant was\nat the material time suffering from a major depressive disorder\nthat substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the commission\nof the offence. Moreover, on the clinical evidence, particularly\nthe factors mentioned at [54] above, the Appellant’s need for rehabilitation\nwould be better met in a correctional setting as compared to in\na less structured environment. In our view, the sentence imposed\nby the Judge served the interests of both the Appellant and society.\nThe appeal was therefore dismissed."
