        "The background": "29        In 1919, a large piece of land along Grange Road, then owned by Mutual Trading Ltd (a company which had long ceased to exist), was subdivided into smaller lots, namely, Lots 111-30, 111-31, 111-32, 111-33 and 111-34. All these lots came under Town Sub-Division 21. The positions of the various lots are shown in a rough sketch (not drawn according to scale) attached to the judgment of the majority which I will adopt for reference. 30        It will be seen that Lot 111-31 is a narrow irregular strip, with a total area of about 9,300 sq ft. It was earmarked as a road reserve. In selling and conveying the other four lots (“the dominant tenements”), Mutual Trading Ltd granted to each purchaser a right of way over Lot 111-31 (“the servient tenement”) in the following terms:",
        "Issue estoppel": "49        The rationale for issue estoppel, which is an aspect of estoppel by record, is two-fold. First, it is in the public interest that there should be an end to litigation. Second, no one should be proceeded against twice for the same cause: seeHalsbury’s Laws of England(LexisNexis UK, 4th Ed Reissue, 2003) vol 16(2) at para 964. The scope of issue estoppel is defined by Diplock LJ (as he then was) inThoday v Thoday[1964] 1 All ER 341 at 352 as follows: “[I]ssue estoppel”, is an extension of the same rule of public policy. There are many causes of action which can only be established by proving that two or more different conditions are fulfilled. Such causes of action involve as many separate issues between the parties as there are conditions to be fulfilled by the plaintiff in order to establish his cause of action; and there may be cases where the fulfilment of an identical condition is a requirement common to two or more different causes of action. If in litigation on one such cause of action any of such separate issues whether a particular condition has been fulfilled is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, either on evidence or on admission by a party to the litigation, neither party can, in subsequent litigation between them on any cause of action which depends on the fulfilment of the identical condition, assert that the condition was fulfilled if the court has in the first litigation determined that it was not, or deny that it was fulfilled if the court in the first litigation determined that it was. 50        InOfficial Assignee of the estate of Tang Hsiu Lan, a bankrupt v Pua Ai Seok[2001] 2 SLR 436, this court adopted a similar sense on the principle of issue estoppel, namely, that where a particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action had been decided upon, the same parties were not entitled, in a subsequent proceeding involving a different cause of action to which the same issue was relevant, to re-open the issue. 51        However, for estoppel to arise, the party must sue or defend the later action in the same right. As stated inHalsbury’s Laws of England([49]supra) at para 1002: It is necessary to an estoppel by record that the parties to the litigation or their privies should have claimed or defended in the same right in the former proceedings as they represent in the later ones. 52        Woo J recognised that, on the substantive point, the argument which Mr Tan sought to advance had merits. It is a well-settled principle of law that an easement expressly granted for the benefit of one parcel of land cannot be used for the benefit of an adjacent parcel of land which is not the beneficiary of the easement. This principle was illustrated most succinctly in this example given by Romer LJ inHarris v Flower and Sons(1904) 91 LT 816 (“Harris v Flower”) at 819: The law really is not in dispute. If a right of way be granted for the enjoyment of close A, the grantee, because he owns or acquires close B, cannot use the way in substance for passing over close A to close B. 53        The facts inHarris v Flowerare pertinent to our present case. There, a piece of land (called “pink land” in the judgment) was conveyed to M together with a right of way over another piece of land (called “yellow land”) which was conveyed to J. M also owned another piece of land (called “the blue land”) adjoining the pink land. The blue land, on which was a public house, abutted a highway. M erected assembly rooms partly on the pink land and partly on the blue land. Later, it was proposed that the assembly rooms be severed from the public house and be used as a factory. The question that arose was whether M was entitled to use the right of way which was a right appurtenant to the pink land for the purpose of approaching the buildings which were built partly on the pink land and partly on the blue land. On being challenged by the owner of the yellow land, the English Court of Appeal held that the intended use would be an excessive user of the right of way. The reasoning was plainly put by Vaughan Williams LJ, who gave the leading judgment, as follows at 819: A right of way of this sort restricts the owner of the dominant tenement to the legitimate user of his right, and the court will not allow that which is in its nature a burden on the owner of the servient tenement to be increased without his consent and beyond the terms of the grant … The burden imposed on the servient tenement must not be increased by allowing the owner of the dominant tenement to make a use of the way in excess of the grant. 54        In a sense one can say that MCST 301 in the present action had a weaker case than M inHarris v Flowerbecause there the factory was a single building sitting on both plots of land whereas here all the three residential blocks are sited on what was previously Lot 561, a plot with no right of way over the servient tenement. 55Harris v Flowerdid not make new law. It reiterated the existing law. InWilliams v James(1867) LR 2 CP 577 at 580, Bovill CJ said: It is also clear, according to the authorities, that where a person has a right of way over one piece of land to another piece of land, he can only use such right in order to reach the latter place. He cannot use it for the purpose of going elsewhere. 56        Similarly in the Canadian Supreme Court case ofPurdom v Robinson(1899) 30 SCR 64, Strong CJ said at 72: The case ofLawton v Wardshows that the restriction of an easement to the purposes for which it is originally granted is no new law but is an old and well established rule of the law of property. 57        Another Canadian case cited by Lee Tat and which is extremely germane to our case in hand isRe Gordon and Regan(1989) 66 DLR (4th) 384 where the Ontario Court of Appeal, in a short judgment, impliedly accepted the principle inHarris v Flowerwhen it said at 384: The appellant seeks to extend the benefit of the right of way to lands purchased by the dominant tenement after the right of way was obtained. No authority for that entitlement has been offered and in this case it would be particularly inappropriate because the added lands have an exit which does not require any passage over the right of way. 58        However, if the new land acquired by the owner of a dominant tenement has no access at all, it could perhaps have made some difference in terms of relief. This was a factor which was taken into account by the court inBracewell v Appleby[1975] Ch 408where the defendant bought one of six houses in acul-de-sacwith access over a private road. Later, the defendant bought a plot of land which adjoined the grounds of his house. The defendant decided to build a new house over both pieces of land and hoped to use the same private road for access. Graham J, while accepting theHarris v Flowerprinciple, declined to grant an injunction and instead awarded damages in lieu thereof because the plaintiffs (the neighbouring dominant owners) had delayed in bringing proceedings with the result that the building of the new house was almost completed. The court felt that if an injunction were to be granted at that juncture, it would render the house uninhabitable. 59        The application of the principle inHarris v Flowerdoes not depend on the actual extent of use made by the additional non-dominant land. This is illustrated inPeacock v Custins[2001] 2 All ER 827 where the plaintiffs owned a 15-acre piece of land which enjoyed a right of way over the land owned by the defendant. The plaintiffs also owned another adjoining smaller plot of land. The plaintiffs farmed both pieces of land as one unit and they used the access way for the purposes of both plots of land. The court noted that in a year the right of way was used six times for both plots. Without the farming needs of the smaller plot, the right of way would probably be used four or five times in a year. So with the smaller plot, the right of way would be exercised one or two times more. The English Court of Appeal held that the frequency of use was not the relevant consideration. It was a question of entitlement. The fact of the matter was that the smaller plot had no such right of way. Schiemann LJ reiterated the point (at [25]) that “the burden on the owner of the servient tenement is not to be increased without his consent”. The decision inPeacock v Custinswas followed inDas v Linden Mews Ltd[2003] 2 P & CR 58. 60        Before I move away from this line of authorities I ought to mention the cases ofMassey v Boulden[2003] 2 All ER 87 andMacepark (Whittlebury) Ltd v Sargeant[2003] 1 WLR 2284which seem to suggest that where the use of the right of way by the additional non-dominant land is trivial, it can be treated as ancillary to the use by the dominant tenement and be permissible. InMassey v Bouldenthe house on the dominant tenement was enlarged by the addition of two rooms which extended beyond the dominant land to an adjoining land. One way to look at this case would be to regard the two additional rooms as mere appendages to the dominant land so that the benefit to the non-dominant land was really insignificant orde minimis. 61        On the facts of our case, by no stretch of the imagination can the “ancillary use” concept be invoked. It is clear that the Grange Heights development has sought to extend drastically the right of way beyond the terms of the original grant. The grant was and is to benefit Lot 111-34. Now MCST 301 wants to unilaterally extend the right of way to also benefit Lot 561. This, it is, in my view, not entitled to do. 62        Finally, it is important not to confuse cases such asHarris v Flowerwith a case where the dominant tenement is put to more intensive use.White v Grand Hotel, Eastbourne, Limited[1913] 1 Ch 113was such a case which held that a change in user of the dominant tenement did not affect the right of way granted to the dominant tenement.",
        "Different capacity": "63        For issue estoppel to arise, a party must be suing in the same capacity as in the prior proceedings. Mr Tan submitted that suing in a different capacity did not mean it had to be between a representative capacity and a personal capacity. He said one could be suing in a different capacity even if in both actions one was suing in one’s own right. Mr Tan relied onBainbrigge v Baddeley(1847) 2 Ph 705; 41 ER 1115 where the plaintiff sued in his personal capacity in both proceedings, in the first as the assignee under a contract and in the second as a beneficiary under a will and it was held that estoppel did not arise. However, in that case there was no estoppel because there was no identity of issues. 64        Following from the above, Mr Tan argued that issue estoppel could not apply here because, unlike the two previous actions, Lee Tat was now suing as the owner of the servient tenement and not as the owner of a dominant tenement. On this point, I think one must distinguish between cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel. This argument would be valid if it is a case concerning cause of action estoppel. However, if it is in relation to issue estoppel, it does not matter whether the first and second proceedings relate to the same cause. The question is whether the same issue was raised in the first proceeding and finally decided upon. As stated inHalsbury’s Laws of England([49]supra) at para 980: Even if the objects of the first and second claims or actions are different, the finding on a matter which came directly in issue in the first claim or action, provided it is embodied in a judicial decision that is final, is conclusive in a second claim or action between the same parties and their privies. 65        Another case cited by Counsel for Lee Tat wasLeggott v The Great Northern Railway Company(1876) 1 QBD 599. There, the plaintiff sued, as administratrix of the estate of the deceased for the benefit of herself as the wife of the deceased husband and of his children, against the defendant for damages suffered by them by her husband’s death. Later, the plaintiff, again as administratrix of the estate of her husband, sued for damages caused to the estate as a result of the defendant’s negligence. The court held that there was no estoppel as the plaintiff was suing in two different capacities even though in both suits she was suing as administratrix. Quain J explained at 606: The rule about the estoppel is very correctly, I think, laid down in the note to theDuchess of Kingston’s Case. It is this: “It must be observed that a verdict against a man suing in one capacity will not estop him when he sues in another distinct capacity, and, in fact, is a different person in law.” In other words it is generally put in the books that the plaintiff must not be only the same person, but he must be suing in the same right. I think that in these two actions before us, although the administratrix nominally is the plaintiff, yet the administratrix is not suing in these two actions in the same right, but in very different rights altogether, and, therefore, that the estoppel does not arise. 66        Accordingly, in my opinion, the fact that Lee Tat was involved in the first and second actions as the owner of the two dominant tenements and here as the owner of the servient tenement does not mean that estoppel cannot arise. It depends on the issues raised and the decisions made by the courts in the two previous actions.",
        "Issue not decided upon": "67        I now turn to the more critical matter: What did the courts in the two previous actions decide? Mr Tan argued that in the two previous actions, Lee Tat fought them on the basis that it was merely the owner of two dominant tenements, namely, Lot 111-32 and Lot 111-33. There was no other basis upon which Lee Tat could have pursued or defended those proceedings. Mr Tan submitted that in that capacity, Lee Tat would only be entitled to claim relief if its interest as a dominant tenement had been interfered with. The rights of the owner of a servient tenement were different from those of an owner of a dominant tenement. For example, a dominant owner could not claim for trespass and obtain damages therefor. Accordingly, Mr Tan said that Lee Tat could not have raised the issues which the owner of the servient tenement could. 68        It was quite clear that the courts had approached the claim in the first action purely from the point of view of whether the use of the servient tenement by the contractors of Hong Leong, or the anticipated use by the purchasers of the apartments upon completion of the development, would be such that it would interfere with the enjoyment of the right of way of Lee Tat. The court found no evidence of that. Neither did it think that the anticipated use by the owners of the apartments in Grange Heights would interfere with Lee Tat’s enjoyment of its right of way. 69        Turning to the second action, it is indisputable that Lee Tat did argue, in order to justify its action in putting up the gate and the fence, that Lot 561 was not a dominant tenement and therefore not entitled to exercise a right of way over Lot 111-31. However, when one examines the judgment of Coomaraswamy J, it is clear that it was based entirely on the ground that Lee Tat could only challenge MCST 301’s claim to a right of way, as the owners of Lots 111-34 and 561, if Lee Tat could show that MCST 301’s exercise of the right of way had been excessive and had substantially interfered with Lee Tat’s enjoyment of the same right of way over the servient tenement. Coomaraswamy J, in particular, noted that Lee Tat was not the owner of the servient land and was not complaining that Grange Heights residents’ use of the right of way was excessive. When the second action came on appeal, while Lee Tat did try to argue that the residents of Grange Heights could not use the right of way as all the apartments were erected on what was previously Lot 561, the question is whether this court did, in fact, answer the contention and whether it was a submission which the court needed to answer in relation to the matter in hand. 70        InBlake v O’Kelly(1874) 9 IR 54 it was held that where an issue was raised in an earlier action but was not decided, that did not preclude the plaintiff from instituting a second action raising the same issue. The facts of the case are succinctly set out in the headnote as follows: B.’s executor filed a bill against K., as executorde son tort, for an administration of B.’s personal estate, and raising issues as to the validity of the transfer of a sum in bank from B.’s name to the joint names of B. and K., as also as to B.’s mental capacity at the time. At the hearing, it was objected that relief of such a nature could not be given, and an ordinary decree for administration was pronounced. B.’s executor subsequently filed a bill raising the same issues, and impeaching also a second transfer to K. from the joint names of B. and K., and praying that both transfers should be declared fraudulent and void … 71        The court below came to the conclusion that the issue raised in the present action was raised in the second action and was answered by this court in the passages which I have quoted in [41] above. While it was raised, I do not think it was answered. It may be useful to retrace some steps. As I have said, in the first action, Chua J refused to make a declaration prayed for by Hong Leong, the predecessor of MCST 301, in the absence of the owner of the servient tenement. No appeal was taken against that part of Chua J’s decision. In the second action, Coomaraswamy J held, and I respectfully concur, that the amalgamation of Lot 111-34 with Lot 561 did not extinguish the right of way which Lot 111-34 had over the servient tenement. This principle was reaffirmed on appeal by this court. The court threw out Lee Tat’s defence on the ground that it had not shown that there was excessive user by the residents of Grange Heightswhich interfered with Lee Tat’s enjoyment of the right of way over the servient tenement. The court noted, in particular, that the residents only used the servient tenement as a footway. 72        The case which this court relied upon in that regard, namely,Graham v Philcox[1984] QB 747, was not concerned with the amalgamation of two plots of land, a dominant tenement and a non-dominant tenement, but with two dwellings in a single building which were converted into one. There, the right of way was appurtenant to the first floor of the building. The owner of the first floor flat later acquired the ground floor flat and converted both flats into a single dwelling. The English Court of Appeal held thatthis change could not affect the right of way enjoyed by the first floor flat.I will quote again what May LJ said at 756–757 (see [41]supra): In none of the judgments in any of the cases … is there suggestion thata mere alteration of a dominant tenement to which a right of way may be appurtenant is sufficient to extinguish it, or indeed to affect the entitlement to its useunless as the result of that alteration the extent of the user is thereby increased. In my opinion, therefore, the mere alteration of the coach house into one dwelling cannot have had any effect upon the existence of the right of way. It should be borne in mind that there was no evidence whatever before the judge that the actual or anticipated user by the plaintiffs of the way was in any way excessive, either in quantity or quality. [emphasis added] 73        In my view,Graham v Philcoxonly decided the point that the amalgamation of a dominant tenement and a non-dominant tenement does notipso factoaffect the existing right of way of the dominant tenement. It did not hold that as a result of the conversion of the two dwellings into one, the ground floor flat was thus entitled to the same right of way. I would imagine that in that case, as the same individuals would be occupying the first floor flat as well as the ground floor flat, distinguishing the capacity in which they exercised the right of way over the servient tenement would be difficult, if not impossible. Thus May LJ had to add the caveat, namely, “unless as the result of that alteration the extent of the user is thereby increased”. In the circumstances there, the conversion of the two dwellings into one could notper secause any excessive use of the right of way. Another way to look at the case is this. If sometime in the near future the single dwelling were to be reverted to the previous position of two separate dwellings, the occupants of the ground floor flat could hardly be able to contend that they should be entitled to the same right of way as the first floor flat. 74        Having regard to the foregoing, that part of the judgment of this court in the second action (quoted in [41] above) only decided the first contention. It did not discuss the implications of the fact that all the three residential blocks of Grange Heights stand on what was previously Lot 561. To hold that this court had in the second action decided the issue would be to say that this court had rejectedHarris v Flower, and all other authorities before and after it, by a side wind, whenGraham v Philcoxitself did not rejectHarris v Flowerbut thought that it was inapplicable on the facts of the case. It is unthinkable that such a monumental change to the common law was intended by the court there without even discussingHarris v Flowerand the other related cases and without offering any reasons why a different approach should be adopted in Singapore. Not a word was uttered disapprovingHarris v Flower. I cannot see any compelling reasons why we should deviate fromHarris v Flowerespecially where the implications of such a deviation would be immense. At that juncture, Lee Tat’s rights were purely those of a dominant tenement, its interest being to ensure that its enjoyment of the right of way was not interfered with: see 869, [20] of the decision of this court in the second action ([41]supra). Though it tried to, it could not really raise the issue of trespass. What Lee Tat could raise was that its enjoyment of the right of way had been interfered with but it did not do so, and not having raised that, it had no basis to question MCST 301’s exercise of the right of way, far less to obstruct the right of way which the land (previously Lot 111-34) enjoyed over the servient tenement.",
        "Decision was collateral": "75        Moreover, even if I were wrong and this court did, in fact, hold that Lot 561 was entitled to a right of way over the servient tenement, it does not follow that every prior decision on an issue must necessarily give rise to issue estoppel.Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley on the Doctrine of Res Judicata(Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1996) states at para 201: Even when the court has expressly determined the same issue in the earlier proceeding an issue estoppel will not necessarily result. Only determinations which are necessary to the decision, and fundamental to it, will found an issue estoppel. Other determinations, however positive, cannot. 76        At the next paragraph, para 202,Spencer Bowersets out how one can distinguish the fundamental from the collateral as follows: “The difficulty in the actual application of these conceptions”, continued Dixon J, “is to distinguish the matters fundamental or cardinal to the prior decision or judgment, or necessarily involved in it as its legal justification or foundation, from matters which, even though actually raised and decided as being in the circumstances of the case the determining considerations, yet are not in point of law the essential foundation or groundwork of the judgment”. In order to make this distinction one has to inquire whether the determination was so fundamental to the decision that the latter cannot stand without it. Even where this condition is met, it is suggested by Dixon J that there is another test to pass, viz. whether the determination is the “immediate foundation” of the decision or merely “a proposition collateral or subsidiary only, i.e. no more than part of the reasoning supporting the conclusion”. A mere step in the reasoning is insufficient. What is required is a determination fundamental to the decision. One test which has been suggested is: was it possible to appeal against the determination? This will not decide the question in all cases; but is often a useful test. There are many determinations which cannot effectively be challenged on appeal. If there can be no effective appeal against a particular determination it is not fundamental to the judgment. But this is not the only test; the inquiry must always be – is the determination such that without it the judgment cannot stand? 77        Therefore, even if I should hold that the issue was decided in the decision of this court in the second action, this part of the decision was certainly not needed, nor was it the foundation upon which relief was granted to MCST 301 in that action. Not having there alleged that the exercise of the right of way by the residents of Grange Heights was excessive and had interfered with its enjoyment thereof, Lee Tat must fail in its defence. It had no right to obstruct the right of way which Lot 111-34 (although it has now become a part of the larger Lot 687) was entitled to enjoy as the dominant tenement. The decisions in the second action (both at the High Court and at the Court of Appeal) really reaffirmed the decisions made in the first action that Lee Tat could only ask for relief if its enjoyment of the right of way over the servient tenement had been substantially interfered with. As that was not alleged, its defence in the second action must failin limine.As Woo J, in my respectful view, rightly observed at [41] of his judgment: [A]n owner of some dominant tenements can raise the issue on the scope of the right of way enjoyed by another owner of another dominant tenement if it were alleged that the right of way enjoyed by the other owner affected the first owner’s enjoyment of his own right of way. Not having made such an allegation of interference, it had no right to complain and take the law into its own hands by putting up the gate and the fence. 78        It was suggested by MCST 301 that on the authority ofBracewell v Appleby([58]supra), Lee Tat had the right to seek substantive relief even though as the owner of a dominant tenement its enjoyment of the right of way was not substantially interfered with. However, on close scrutiny of that case it would appear that the plaintiff inBracewell v Applebydid own a part of the private road over which each of the six houses in thecul-de-sachad a right of way: see 411 and 414 of the report.",
        "Ancillary reasons": "79        In passing, I would point out that the judge below also seemed to have thought that issue estoppel was applicable because: (a)        otherwise it would mean that if Lee Tat were to subsequently acquire another dominant tenement (if that were possible) it could start the battle all over again; and (b)        it would render the decision of this court in the second proceedings nugatory. 80        It would be clear from the above that these concerns were, with respect, not well-founded. If Lee Tat were to acquire another dominant tenement, it is clear that it could not by virtue of that fact alone initiate a new action to raise the same issue because acquiring an additional dominant tenement would not have altered Lee Tat’s rights. It would make no difference whether Lee Tat had then owned two dominant tenements or three. Neither would allowing the present action to proceed render the decision of this court in the second action nugatory. As I have said, all that was decided there was that Lee Tat, as the owner of a dominant tenement, was not entitled to put up the gate and fence at both ends of the servient tenement to stop people from getting into or from what was previously Lot 111-34.",
        "Laches/acquiscence": "81        A subsidiary point raised by MCST 301 was that if issue estoppel did not arise, the action by Lee Tat should still be dismissed on the ground of laches or acquiescence. There was no allegation of time bar. It is true that Lee Tat could have instituted the present action soon after it acquired the servient tenement instead of waiting for several years. In the meantime, a number of ancillary proceedings involving Lee Tat and MCST 301 took place after Lee Tat had acquired the servient tenement and where MCST 301 alleged that Lee Tat had failed to comply with the injunction granted by Coomaraswamy J. Yet Lee Tat did not raise the point which it raised in OS 825. Be that as it may, the fact remained that there was no assertion, or evidence tendered to show, that the delay in instituting the action had caused MCST 301 any irreparable prejudice. Costs incurred in those proceedings had been paid. Thus there was clearly no merit in this point. I do not need to belabour it further.",
        "Judgment": "82        In the premises, I would hold that no issue estoppel arose in relation to OS 825 for two reasons. First, although the main issue raised in OS 825 was earlier raised as a defence in the second action, it was not ruled upon by either the High Court or this court. Second, even if the courts in the second action could be treated as having decided the issue (that the land which was previously Lot 561, and the apartment erected thereon, had a right of way over the servient tenement) it was a decision which was not necessary in relation to the main question in the second action as I have discussed above."
