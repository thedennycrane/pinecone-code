        "Civil Appeal No 164 of 2000": "2.    We deal first with the question of the further consequential\n\norders we should make in Civil Appeal No. 164 of 2000.",
        "Transfer of plot 3": "3.    In their written submissions, the solicitors for Madam Ho\n\nask for an order that RHB, as the mortgagee in possession, apply at their own costs and expense to\n\nthe relevant authorities for approval for subdivision of the property into three subdivided lots as\n\ncontemplated in the sale agreement made between Madam Ho and Ms Lim, and upon such approval being\n\ngranted, at their own costs and expense, to transfer the subdivided lot marked as plot 3 to Madam Ho\n\nwithout any payment and free from encumbrances. We are unable to accede to this request. There is no\n\njustification for such an order. While RHB, in taking the mortgage of the property, recognised Madam\n\nHos interest in the property and agreed to be bound by that interest, they did not agree to be\n\nbound by what Ms Lim had agreed to perform under the sale agreement. To direct RHB to take such\n\nsteps would, in effect, require them to perform in part the obligations of Ms Lim under the sale\n\nagreement, to which RHB had never agreed either in the mortgage or in the Regulating Agreement. It\n\nmay be that, at the end of the day, notwithstanding the realization of her interest in the property,\n\nMadam Ho would not be able to recoup the loss she has sustained, but she is not without remedy and\n\nis at liberty to have recourse against the relevant party or parties for recovery of her loss or any\n\npart of it, as she may be advised.",
        "Costs to WLAW": "4.    The solicitors for Madam Ho also make lengthy submissions on\n\nthe costs which the court below ordered Madam Ho to pay to WLAW upon dismissal of her claim against\n\nthem. Although Madam Ho in the notice of appeal joined WLAW as the second respondents in Civil\n\nAppeal No. 164 of 2000, she did not in the Case for the Appellant appeal against the order below\n\ndismissing her claim against WLAW. Notwithstanding that, her solicitors in their written submissions\n\nraise an extraordinary argument that WLAW should now be deprived of the costs below, or in the\n\nalternative a Sanderson order or a Bullock order should now be made in her favour. We\n\nare unable to entertain such an application at this stage. The insurmountable obstacle in the way is\n\nthat Madam Ho did not appeal against the order below dismissing her claim against WLAW with costs,\n\nand that order stands. It is not in any way affected by the judgment we have delivered.5.    We now come to the costs of WLAW in Civil Appeal No. 164 of\n\n2000. Apparently they were not aware that Madam Ho was not pursuing her appeal against the dismissal\n\nof her claim against them until on or about 18 June 2001, when Madam Hos solicitors served on\n\ntheir solicitors the Case for the Appellant. It is now submitted by the solicitors for WLAW that\n\nMadam Ho should bear and pay their costs incurred in the appeal up 18 June 2001. We agree with this\n\nargument. WLAW are entitled to such costs in the appeal, and we so order.",
        "Claim of RHB": "6.    The solicitors for RHB in their written submissions also\n\nadvance an extraordinary argument. They submit that, having regard to what we have decided, RHB now\n\nhave a claim against WLAW for breach of duty and/or negligence on the part of Ms Leong, and that\n\nthey propose to initiate an action against WLAW. By reason of this action or proposed action, RHB\n\nnow seek a stay of the order for costs made against them. This argument is totally unsustainable. If\n\nRHB wish to clutch on what we have decided to found their cause of action against Ms Leong, they are\n\nof course at liberty to do so; no doubt they would take adequate and proper legal advice before so\n\ndeciding. But whatever proceedings they wish to take, or are presently taking, is not a ground for a\n\nstay of the order made against them, whether in respect of costs or otherwise. We can find no reason\n\nfor a stay.7.    Next, RHB request that the costs awarded against them and Ms\n\nLim be apportioned in equal proportions so that each of them will bear only 50% of the costs. We are\n\nunable to accede to this request. The order we made against them in  55 of our judgment is\n\nagainst the two parties jointly and severally. Under that order, either or both of them will have to\n\nbear and pay the costs here and below of Madam Ho and the party who has paid the costs will be\n\nentitled to seek a contribution from the other. In this case, the fact that Ms Lim is a bankrupt and\n\ntherefore is not in a position to make any contribution is not a ground for this Court to vary the\n\norder made. The order made is the usual order against two or more unsuccessful parties to an action\n\nor proceeding, whether as plaintiffs or defendants.",
        "Outgoings of the property": "8.    RHB seek a further consequential order that that Madam Ho\n\nshould bear one third of the outgoings reasonably incurred in maintaining the property as from the\n\ndate they took possession, including the property tax paid in respect thereof. We agree, and a\n\nconsequential order to that effect should be made.",
        "Consequential order": "9.    Further to what we have ordered on 26 September 2000, we now\n\nmake the following consequential orders:(1) that the property be sold at such time, in such manner and at such price as\n\n  RHB and Madam Ho may agree, and in default of agreement as the court may direct; but nothing in\n\n  this direction is deemed to relieve RHB from their obligations as mortgagee in exercising the\n\n  power of sale;(2) that for the purpose of giving effect to the above, RHB and/or Madam Ho be\n\n  at liberty to apply to the High Court for all necessary directions in connection with the sale of\n\n  the property; and(3) that pending the sale of the property, the outgoings of the property\n\n  reasonably incurred by RHB, including the payment of property tax thereon, shall be apportioned in\n\n  the proportions of two-thirds thereof to RHB and one third thereof to Madam Ho, and in this\n\n  connection an account be taken of the outgoings reasonably incurred by RHB.",
        "Civil Appeal No 167 of 2000": "10.    We now turn to the question of costs in Civil Appeal No.\n\n167 of 2000. The solicitors for Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah in their written submissions argue that, in\n\nso far as the proceedings under O 59 r 8 and this appeal are concerned, their clients should be\n\nconsidered as the successful parties, and that WLAW and RHB the unsuccessful parties, and\n\naccordingly costs should follow the event. They further submit that the appellants have not\n\nmisconducted themselves in any way and there are no particular circumstances or reasons which call\n\nfor the court to make any other order as to costs.11.    On the other hand, the solicitors for RHB in their written\n\nsubmissions argue that there are in this case special circumstances which call for a departure from\n\nthe normal rule that costs follow the event. They draw our attention to the conduct of Mr Wong in\n\nhandling the transaction for Madam Ho, which gave rise to the litigation and also the conduct of Mr\n\nPonniah in prosecuting the claim which was certainly not beyond reproach, and that having regard to\n\nsuch conduct no order as to costs both here and below should be made.12.    The general principles are that costs are in the discretion\n\nof the court, and that costs should follow the event, except when it appears to the court that in\n\nthe circumstances of the case some other order should be made:Re Elgindata (No. 2)[1993] 1 All ER 232,Tullio v Maoro[1994] 2 SLR 489. In considering such an issue the court is\n\nentitled to look at all the circumstances of the case including any matters that led to the\n\nlitigation. Thus, inBostock v Ramsey Urban District Council[1900] 2 QB 616, the successful\n\ndefendant was deprived of its costs and in coming to this conclusion the court took into account\n\nconduct of the defendant prior to the litigation, which led the plaintiff reasonably to suppose that\n\nhe had a cause of action against the defendant and thus induced him to commence the action. A L\n\nSmith LJ said at p 622:It seems to me that the Lord Chief Justice was right when on general principles\n\n  he came to the conclusion that \"the judge is not confined to the consideration of the\n\n  defendants conduct in the actual litigation itself, but may also take into consideration\n\n  matters which led up to and were the occasion of that litigation.\" I say on general\n\n  principles, because his attention does not appear to have been called to the case ofHarnett v\n\n  Vise5 Ex D 307, in which it was distinctly held by the Court of Appeal that the judge is not\n\n  confined, in considering the question whether there is good cause for depriving the successful\n\n  party of costs, to the conduct of the parties in the litigation itself, but must consider the\n\n  whole circumstances of the case and everything which led to the action. I think that in this case\n\n  there was evidence of conduct on the part of the defendants such as to lead the plaintiff\n\n  reasonably to think that he had a good cause of action against them, and which the judge was\n\n  entitled to take into consideration as constituting good cause for depriving the defendants of\n\n  costs.13.    InLee Seng Choon Ronnie v Singapore Island Country Club[1993] 2 SLR 456, although the appellant there successfully obtained the declaration sought by him\n\npertaining to the retention of his club membership, the Court of Appeal nevertheless deprived him of\n\nthe costs of the appeal and the hearing below after taking into account the appellants conduct.\n\nThe Court said at p 465:For the reasons we have given in this judgment this appeal succeeds, but the\n\n  appellants conduct has not commended itself to us. His denial of having received the notices\n\n  sent to him by the club and yet being able to produce to the court the third and final reminder\n\n  [effectively the second notice under r 47(e)] claiming it was a file copy obtained for him by an\n\n  unnamed friend, when the club did not keep copies of the second and subsequent reminders, was\n\n  deplorable. The sending of an unsigned cheque might be excused but failure to pay relatively small\n\n  amounts of his clubs bills under the pretext of frequent travelling abroad and the unauthorized\n\n  signing of chits by his son are really inexcusable and show a cavalier attitude and disregard of\n\n  the clubs rules.Although the appellant has succeeded in his appeal and he is entitled to a\n\n  declaration that he was at all material times a member of the club, which we duly grant him, he is\n\n  not entitled to an order for the assessment of damages or to the other two declarations sought. We\n\n  further record our disapprobation of the appellants conduct by denying him the costs of this\n\n  appeal as well as the costs before the learned judicial commissioner.14.    Similarly, inUniversal Westech (S) Pte Ltd v Ng Thiam\n\nKiat & Ors[1997] 2 SLR 139, Kan Ting Chiu J found that although the plaintiff in that case\n\nfailed in its claim against the first defendant, the latters conduct towards the plaintiff was\n\nnot beyond reproach as he had probably used a business plan to compete with his ex-employers\n\nand had led the second defendant into breaching his fiduciary duty as an employee of the plaintiff.\n\nThe learned judge then deprived the first defendant of half of his costs. The learned judges\n\ndecision on costs was subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal: seeNg Thiam Kiat & Ors v\n\nUniversal Westech (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal[1997] 3 SLR 419.15.    We now revert to the facts of this case. First, it is quite\n\napparent to us that the manner in which Mr Wong had handled the transaction for Madam Ho had, to a\n\nconsiderable extent, contributed to the present litigation. Secondly, there was a serious objection\n\nto Mr Ponniah acting for Madam Ho and also the objectionable manner in which he had conducted the\n\nlitigation below. The judge below dealt with the conduct of both Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah in some\n\ndetail and was extremely critical of Mr Wong on the tardy manner in which he sought to protect Madam\n\nHos interest in the property, and the manner in which Mr Ponniah conducted the litigation. While\n\nwe allowed the appeal, we did not disapprove of what the judge said with reference to their conduct,\n\nwhich we find is relevant in deciding the question of costs. Having regard to these matters, we\n\ndecide not to award any costs to Mr Wong and Mr Ponniah here and below. We therefore make no order\n\nas to costs. The deposit in court, with interest, if any, is to be refunded to\n\nthem.SgdSgdSgdYONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
