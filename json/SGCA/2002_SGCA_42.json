        "The facts": "4        The\n\nfacts giving rise to the action were these. Show Theatres were incorporated by Shaw Pte\n\nand Eng Wah Pte in 1993, with the former holding 75% of its shares and the latter, 25%.\n\nShaw Pte was represented on the board of directors by Mr Shaw Vee Chung Harold and Mr Shaw\n\nVee King (the two Shaws) and Eng Wah Pte by Mr Goh Keng Beng. The two Shaws and Goh Keng\n\nBeng were also directors of Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte respectively.5        \n\nSometime in 1997, Show Theatres called on their shareholders to provide funds by way of\n\nloans to the company which were required for their business needs. One of the purposes was\n\nin relation to the purchase of shares in Chinatown Point and, for that, Show Theatres\n\nneeded a sum of $500,000. This sum was furnished by Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte in the\n\nproportion of their shareholdings in Show Theatres, i.e., $375,000 and $125,000\n\nrespectively.6        Some\n\ntwo years later, on 6 August 1999, the two sums were repaid by Show Theatres to the two\n\nrespondents. It was common ground that at the time of the repayments, Show Theatres were\n\ninsolvent. The repayments were made more than six months, but less than two years, before\n\nthe presentation of the winding up petition.7        On 24\n\nOctober 2000, a creditor of Show Theatres presented a petition for the company to be wound\n\nup. The winding-up order was granted on 17 November 2000. The liquidator, after reviewing\n\nthe records and accounts of the company, thought that the two repayments constituted\n\nunfair preference and thus applied to court to have the two sums restored to the company.8        In\n\nthe court below, the respondents raised three arguments to resist the liquidator’s\n\napplication. First, that the two sums were, in fact, moneys held by Show Theatres on a\n\ntrust, of the nature enunciated inQuistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd[1970] AC 567, for both the respondents. Second, that the rules laid down in the Companies\n\n(Applications of Bankruptcy Act Provisions) Regulations [CABAR] were not valid as the\n\nMinister had no such power to make them. Third, as the respondents were not \"persons\n\nconnected\" with Show Theatres and as the repayments were not made to them during the\n\nperiod of six months before the winding up of the company, the presumption of unfair\n\npreference did not arise and the payments were in order.",
        "The issue": "9        \n\nBefore us, there was really only one issue. Were Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte \"persons\n\nconnected with\" Show Theatres when the repayments were made to them? The answer to\n\nthis question in turn depends on the meaning to be given to the term \"associate\"\n\nin the definition of a \"person connected with a company\" laid down in CABAR. The\n\ntwo other issues taken in the court below were, quite rightly, not seriously pursued\n\nbefore us. They were adequately dealt with by the court below.",
        "Relevant provisions": "10        \n\nSection 329(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) provides that –Subject to this Act and such\n\n    modifications as may be prescribed, any transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods,payment,\n\n    execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which,\n\n    had it been made or done by or against an individual, would in his bankruptcy be void or\n\n    voidable under section 98, 99 or 103 of the Bankruptcy Act 1995 (read with sections 100,\n\n    101 and 102 thereof) shall in the event of the company being wound up be void or voidable\n\n    in like manner. (Emphasis added).11        \n\nSection 99(1) and (2) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that where an individual is adjudged\n\na bankrupt and he has, at the \"relevant time\", given an unfair preference to any\n\nperson, the Official Assignee may apply to court for an order to remedy the situation.\n\n\"Relevant time\" is defined in s 100(1)(b) as meaning, in relation to the\n\nsituation where an unfair preference is given to a person who is an \"associate\"\n\nof the individual, a period of two years, ending with the day on which the individual is\n\nadjudged a bankrupt. The desire to prefer is presumed where the payment is made to an\n\nassociate of the bankrupt (s 99(4) & (5) of the Bankruptcy Act).12        \n\nSection 101 defines who is an associate. The following subsections are germane to the\n\nmatter at hand:-(4) A person is an associate of\n\n    an individual whom he employs or by whom he is employed and for this purpose, any director\n\n    or other officer of a company shall be treated as employed by that company.(6) A company is an associate of\n\n    an individual if that individual has control of it or if that individual and persons who\n\n    are his associates together have control of it.(9) For the purposes of this\n\n    section an individual shall be taken to have control of a company, if –(a) the directors of the company\n\n      or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in\n\n      accordance with his directors or instructions; or(b) he is entitled to exercise,\n\n      or control the exercise of, one-third or more of the voting power at any general meeting\n\n      of the company or of another company which has control of it.and where 2 or more persons\n\n    together satisfy paragraph (a) or (b) they shall be taken to have control of the company.13        \n\nHowever, as recognised in s 329(1) of the Companies Act, these provisions of the\n\nBankruptcy Act have to be applied to a company in liquidation, or placed under judicial\n\nmanagement, with the necessary modifications. This is prescribed in CABAR, the regulations\n\nmade by the Minister pursuant to the powers conferred upon him under s 329(1). Regulation\n\n3 provides that ss 98-103 shall be read subject to –\"(a) the modifications set\n\n    out in regulations 4 to 9; and(b) such textual and other\n\n    modifications as may be necessary for their application to a company being placed under\n\n    judicial management or being wound up …\"14        \n\nRegulation 4 provides that any reference to an associate of a person or an individual who\n\nhas been adjudged a bankrupt in, inter alia, ss 99 and 100 (except s 101) of the\n\nBankruptcy Act \"shall be read as a reference to a person connected with a company\n\n… against which a winding-up order has been made.\" It seems to us that s 101 is\n\nexpressly excluded by regulation 4 because regulation 2 already defines an\n\n\"associate\" to mean \"an associate of a person or company as determined in\n\naccordance with s 101 of the Bankruptcy Act, as modified by regulation 5\".15        A\n\n\"person connected with a company\" is defined in regulation 2 to mean a person\n\nwho is –(a) a director or shadow director\n\n    of the company or an associate of such a director or shadow director; or(b) an associate of the company.16        For\n\ncompleteness, we shall now set out regulation 5, although the extended meanings of\n\n\"associate\" prescribed in that regulation are not really germane to the issue\n\nunder consideration.Associate of a company5. In addition to the\n\n    provisions of section 101 of the Bankruptcy Act by which the question whether a person is\n\n    an associate of another person is to be determined, a company shall be regarded as an\n\n    associate of another company if –(a) the same person has control\n\n      of both companies, or a person has control of one company and persons who are his\n\n      associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other company;\n\n      or(b) a group of 2 or more persons\n\n      has control of each company, and such groups either consist of the same persons or could\n\n      be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member\n\n      of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.",
        "Proper construction": "17        The\n\nproblem is one of construction and it seems to us that much of the difficulty arose\n\nbecause provisions meant to be applicable to the bankruptcy of an individual are made to\n\napply to the winding up or judicial management of companies. Although regulation 3 states\n\nthat those provisions of the Bankruptcy Act should be applied to a company under\n\nliquidation subject to regulations 4 to 9 and \"such textual and other\n\nmodifications\" as may be necessary, the difficulty appears to be in determining what\n\nshould be the appropriate \"textual and other modifications\" to be made to s 101\n\nin relation to a company under liquidation.18        \n\nRegulation 4 clearly spells out that as far as ss 99 and 100 of the Bankruptcy Act are\n\nconcerned, references therein to an associate of a bankrupt individual shall be read, in\n\nrelation to a company under liquidation or judicial management, to refer to \"a person\n\nconnected with a company\". Under regulation 2, a \"person connected with a\n\ncompany\" is, inter alia, \"an associate of a director of the company.\" Who\n\nis an \"associate\" is defined in s 101, as modified by regulation 5. By virtue of\n\nsection 101(4), as far as the three directors of Show Theatres were concerned, they would,\n\nas they were directors of Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte, be treated as employed by the latter\n\ntwo companies. Thus, the two Shaws were associates of Shaw Pte and vice versa. The same\n\nwould be the position as between Eng Wah Pte and Goh Keng Beng. Following from that,\n\ntaking the case of Eng Wah Pte, the latter would be an associate of Goh Keng Beng, who was\n\na director of Show Theatre. Accordingly, Eng Wah Pte was a person connected with Show\n\nTheatres. The same was the position between Shaw Pte and Show Theatres. The effect of this\n\nconstruction is that where two companies have a common director or common directors, one\n\ncompany will be treated as connected with the other.19        In\n\nthe court below, the judge could not reach the same conclusion as we did because he\n\nconsidered that the opening phrase of s 101(4), \"A person is an associate of an\n\nindividual\" should be modified to read \"A person is an associate of the company\n\nunder liquidation\". By so construing s 101(4), he held that the two Shaws were\n\nassociates of Show Theatres only. Section 101(4) would not operate to deem the two Shaws\n\nas associates of Shaw Theatre or vice versa. This, in turn, meant that Shaw Pte could not\n\nbe a person connected with Show Theatres. The same position applied as between Eng Wah Pte\n\nand Show Theatres.20        As\n\nwe see it, the expression \"an individual\" in s 101(4) should not be read to\n\nrefer only to the company under liquidation. This would not be consistent with the second\n\nlimb of s 101(4) where it is provided that \"any director … ofacompany\n\nshould be treated as employed bythatcompany\" and \"that company\"\n\nmust be referring to \"acompany\". It is clear that the provisions of s\n\n101(4) are of general application, otherwise they would not have used the articlea.\n\nWe are fortified in this view by the opening words of regulation 5 which read \"in\n\naddition to the provisions of s 101 … by which the question whether apersonis an associate of anotherpersonis to be determined\", repeating the words of\n\ns 101(1) \"any question whether apersonis an associate of anotherperson\".\n\nIt must be borne in mind that under the Interpretation Act a \"person\" is defined\n\nto include \"any company, or association or body of persons …\" In other\n\nwords, s 101(4) should apply to any situation which calls for a determination of the\n\nrelationship between two entities. It should not be confined to apply only to the\n\nsituation of apersonbeing an associate of the company under liquidation. On this\n\nconstruction, Shaw Pte would be an associate of the two Shaws and as the two Shaws were\n\nalso directors of Show Theatres, Shaw Pte would be a person connected with Show Theatres.",
        "Policy considerations": "21        We\n\nwere mindful that this ruling could have some repercussions in view of the corporate\n\npractice in Singapore, where it is a common phenomenon to see a person sitting on the\n\nboards of several companies. We do not, however, see anything seriously objectionable in\n\nthe construction we have given. All it means is that whenever two companies have a common\n\ndirector or common directors, they are to be treated as \"connected with\" each\n\nother. In this regard, it is vitally important to bear in mind the clear objective behind\n\nss 98 to 101. What is prescribed in those sections is a scheme for the protection of\n\ncreditors generally. It underscores the need for transparency. Because of the connection\n\ndue to common directorship, a payment to a \"connected\" company made within the\n\nperiod of two years prior to the liquidation of the company is presumed to be made in\n\nunfair preference and it is for the \"connected\" company to rebut that\n\npresumption. It is right, and not unfair, to assume that a director exercises influence\n\nwithin the company.22        \n\nTherefore, it is wholly justified to require a \"connected\" company to show that\n\nthe payment received was not an instance of unfair preference. If it could be shown that\n\nthe payment was made for proper commercial considerations, the presumption would be\n\nrebutted: seeRe Fairway Magazines Ltd[1993] BCLC 643 at 649 per Mummery J. There\n\nis really no overriding policy or commercial consideration which militates against this\n\nconstruction. Indeed, in the interest of maintaining good business practices and to\n\nprotect all persons who, in good faith, have dealings with the company, there should be\n\ncloser scrutiny and stricter rules governing transactions between related companies.",
        "Additional point": "23        The\n\nsame conclusion could also be reached by applying the definition of a \"person\n\nconnected with a company\" in regulation 2 of CABAR, read together with ss (6) and (9)\n\nof s 101. This argument was, however, not raised by the appellants in the court below and\n\nthe appellants accordingly asked for leave to raise it pursuant to O 57 r 9A(4) of the\n\nRules of Court. As this was a point of law, and no further evidence was needed to make the\n\nsubmission, there was no reason why leave should not be granted : seeCheong Kim Hock v\n\nLin Securities (Pte)[1992] 2 SLR 349.24        As\n\nwill be recalled, another definition of a \"person connected with a company\" is\n\n\"an associate of the company\". Section 101(6) provides that \"a company is\n\nan associate of an individual if that individual has control of it.\" Section\n\n101(9)(b) amplifies the concept of control by providing that an individual shall be taken\n\nto have control of a company if, inter alia, \"he is entitled to exercise, or control\n\nthe exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the\n\ncompany.\" The subsection further provides that \"where two or more persons\n\ntogether satisfy that condition, they shall be taken to have control of the company.\"\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the proviso to s 101[9]).25        The\n\nrespondents argued that the word \"individual\" in s 101(6) should, like the same\n\nword in s 101(4), be read, in the context of the present case, to mean \"the company\n\nin liquidation\". In our opinion, such a reading would be in error and would undermine\n\nthe very objective implicit in ss 98-101 of the Bankruptcy Act as this illustration will\n\nshow:-IllustrationSuppose Company A has control\n\n    over Company B. Knowing that Company B is already insolvent, Company A decides to cause\n\n    Company B to return a loan given by Company A to Company B. On the respondents’\n\n    interpretation, Company A and Company B would only be deemed associates if Company B (the\n\n    insolvent company) has control over Company A and not the other way round.26        In\n\nour opinion, the construction contended for by the respondents would give rise to an\n\nanomalous result, and with respect, an absurd result, as that is precisely the kind of\n\ntransaction which the law should seek to restrain. Like the construction we gave to s\n\n101(4), the words \"an individual\" in s 101(6) should simply be read as\n\n\"another company\".27        \n\nFollowing from this interpretation, Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte were, therefore,\n\n\"associates\" of Show Theatres, as the former collectively exercised complete\n\ncontrol of Show Theatres. It could not be disputed that Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte acted in\n\nconcert in getting Show Theatres to repay them the two sums.28        In\n\nthis connection, the respondents submitted that they were separate legal entities and that\n\nit was necessary for the appellants to prove that each of the respondents individually was\n\nan \"associate\" of Show Theatres. In our opinion, this submission overlooks the\n\nproviso to s 101(9). If two companies, X and Y,both receive repaymentsfrom the\n\ninsolvent company, and between them they exercised 1/3 or more of the voting power of the\n\nlatter company, then by virtue of the proviso they are deemed to be associates of the\n\nlatter. And if X and Y were to hold 100% of the voting power in the insolvent company the\n\nproviso should apply to the situation with even greater force. All the more so where it\n\nwas clear that the two companies (like Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte here) had acted in concert\n\nin getting their loans repaid by the insolvent company. This would be wholly in line with\n\nthe scheme to render void payments made in unfair preference.29        \n\nAccordingly, this would be a further basis to hold that Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte were\n\ncompanies \"connected with\" Show Theatres.",
        "Position in UK": "30        In\n\npassing, we would mention that the conclusion we reached herein is consistent with the\n\nposition prevailing in the United Kingdom, although we should add that the UK legislation\n\n(Insolvency Act 1986) is clearer, as it does not suffer from the drafting complexity\n\narising from importing and adapting rules governing individual bankruptcy into the regime\n\nof corporate insolvency. The UK Insolvency Act 1986 is a piece of consolidating\n\nlegislation, bringing within one umbrella enactments of both company insolvency and\n\nindividual bankruptcy, with separate parts in the Act dealing with each aspect and a\n\ncommon part applying to both company insolvency and individual bankruptcy. The definition\n\nof a \"person connected with a company\" in CABAR is in all material respects the\n\nsame as that provided for in the English 1986 Act. As we see it, the intention implicit in\n\ns 329(1) and the regulations in CABAR was to follow the scheme of things applicable in the\n\nUK.Sgd:Copyright © Government of Singapore."
