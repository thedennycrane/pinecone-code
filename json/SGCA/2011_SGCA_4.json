        "Introduction": "1       This is an appeal against the decision of the\n                    High Court judge (“the Judge”), who upheld the decision of the\n                    assistant registrar (“the AR”) to grant a stay of proceedings in\n                    Suit No 379 of 2009 (“the Singapore Action”), an action\n                    commenced in Singapore by the appellant, Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd\n                    (“the Appellant”), against the respondent, Hwang Jae Woo\n                    (“the Respondent”). The grounds of decision of the Judge may be\n                    found atSun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae\n                        Woo[2010] 3 SLR 684 (“the GD”).",
        "The background": "2       To better appreciate the circumstances giving\n                    rise to the Singapore Action, we will first set out the facts of the case. The\n                    Appellant is a company incorporated in Singapore. Its majority shareholder and\n                    director is one Seung Yong Chung (“Seung”), who is also a\n                    substantial shareholder and director of a Malaysian company known as Sun Jin\n                    Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd (“SJM”). The Respondent is a South Korean\n                    citizen who was the acting project director for projects undertaken by SJM in\n                    the Republic of Maldives (“the Maldives”). The exact legal\n                    relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent is in dispute,[note: 1]although the Judge was tentatively of\n                    the view that the Respondent was in fact employed by the Appellant at the\n                    material time, albeit seconded to work for SJM in the Maldives (see the GD at\n                    [31]; see also[12]below). On the factual\n                    matrix of the present case, we do not see how we can disagree with this\n                    finding. 3       The Respondent worked in the Maldives from\n                    27 August 2006 to 1 February 2008. When the Respondent arrived in the\n                    Maldives on 27 August 2006, he was given a letter of employment dated\n                    15 August 2006 from SJM. The authenticity of this letter is disputed by the\n                    Appellant. During the period while the Respondent was working in the Maldives,\n                    he was the country representative, project director and project manager of SJM.\n                    It is undisputed that the directors of SJM passed a resolution on 3 May\n                    2007 appointing the Respondent as its country representative in the Maldives.\n                    The work permit issued by the Maldivian authorities showed the Respondent as an\n                    employee of SJM. 4       The Appellant brought the Singapore Action\n                    against the Respondent, claiming that the latter had (inter\n                        alia) acted in breach of his duty to the Appellant by effecting\n                    certain unauthorised payments to third parties, thereby causing the Appellant to\n                    suffer loss. In accordance with the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,\n                    2006 Rev Ed), the Respondent should have filed his defence to the Singapore\n                    Action by 27 May 2009. Pursuant to an oral understanding between the\n                    parties’ solicitors, the time for filing the Respondent’s defence\n                    was extended to 5 June 2009. The Respondent filed his defence on that date,\n                    but the document filed was rejected as the wrong suit number was stated in it.\n                    The Respondent subsequently re-filed his defence (this time, successfully) on\n                    8 June 2009. Thereafter, it was only on 31 July 2009 –\n                    approximately one month and three weeks after the extended deadline for filing\n                    the defence – that the Respondent applied (via Summons No 4061 of\n                    2009 (“the Stay Application”)) for a stay of the Singapore Action\n                    in favour of proceedings to be instituted in the Maldives as well as for an\n                    extension of time to file the application. The Respondent also sought, as an\n                    alternative to a stay of the Singapore Action, an order striking out\n                    paras 3–23 of the Appellant’s statement of claim (“the\n                    Statement of Claim”), which constitute substantially the whole of the\n                    Statement of Claim, under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of\n                Court. 5       The main unauthorised payments alluded to at[4]above, which form the bases of the\n                    Singapore Action, are the following: (a)     a payment of US$175,000 as alleged\n                        commission to one Ahmed Shahid (“Shahid”);\n                    and (b)     a payment of\n                        US$101,982.37 to one Son Chang Ju (“Son”), a former employee\n                        of the Appellant. 6       We should add that legal proceedings in\n                    connection with the above two payments were earlier commenced in the Maldives,\n                    and judgments have already been given by the courts there. The judgments in\n                    those proceedings (which are different from the contemplated Maldivian\n                    proceedings mentioned at[4]above)\n                    include: (a)     a judgment obtained by Shahid against\n                        SJM for payment of US$175,000;[note: 2]and (b)     a judgment\n                        obtained by Son against SJM for payment of US$101,982.37.[note: 3] 7       At this juncture, we should further add that the\n                    Respondent has successfully sued SJM in the Maldives (in Case\n                    No 733/MC/2008 (“the Maldivian profit suit”)) for wrongful\n                    termination of employment and compensation.[note: 4]In that action, the\n                    Civil Court of the Maldives found that the Respondent was an employee of\n                        SJM[note: 5](see [30] of the GD,\n                    andcfthe Judge’s tentative view (at [31]\n                    of the GD) that the Respondent was an employee of the Appellant). Although SJM\n                    is a separate legal entity from the Appellant, Seung is a substantial\n                    shareholder and director of both companies (see[2]above). In the circumstances, this begs the question: if the\n                    Respondent had indeed made unauthorised payments to Shahid and Son, why did SJM\n                    not raise that as a counterclaim in the Maldivian profit suit?",
        "Issues before the court below": "8       Before the Judge, broadly, two main issues were\n                    raised: (a)     first, whether the Respondent, given\n                        that he had taken steps in the Singapore Action and, further, had filed the\n                        Stay Application long after the deadline prescribed by O 12 r 7(2)\n                        of the Rules of Court, was precluded from applying for a stay of the\n                        Singapore Action (“the First Issue”); and (b)     second, if the Respondent were not so\n                        precluded, whether a stay of the Singapore Action should be granted on the\n                        ground offorum non conveniens(“the\n                        Second Issue”). The Judge answered the First Issue\n                    in the negative and the Second Issue in the affirmative.",

        "The First Issue": "",
        "The Second Issue": "",
        "The appeal": "14     In the present appeal, the First Issue and the\n                    Second Issue are being revisited, with the Appellant arguing that this court\n                    should overturn the Judge’s decision on both of these\n                issues.",
        "The Respondent’s taking of steps in the proceedings": "15     We will begin by considering the First Issue,\n                    specifically, the significance of the fact that the Respondent filed the Stay\n                    Application only after taking steps in the Singapore Action. InYeoh Poh San and another v Won Siok Wan[2002]\n                    2 SLR(R) 233 at [14], the High Court held that “[t]he very\n                    reason why a defendant [was] required to apply for a stay of proceedings before\n                    taking any step other than filing an appearance [was] because such …\n                    other step [might] be construed as a submission to the court’s\n                    jurisdiction”. The Appellant contends that the Respondent has taken steps\n                    in the Singapore Action by including in the Stay Application (inter alia) a prayer to strike out substantially the whole of\n                    the Statement of Claim as an alternative to a stay of proceedings. In support of\n                    this contention, the Appellant cites the case ofRepublic of\n                        the Philippines v Maler Foundation and others[2008]\n                    2 SLR(R) 857, where the expression “step in the\n                    proceedings” in s 4(3)(b) of the State\n                    Immunity Act (Cap 313, 1985 Rev Ed) was interpreted and\n                        explained.[note: 6]In response,\n                    the Respondent argues that for the purposes of O 12 r 7(2) of the\n                    Rules of Court, the fact that he has taken a step in the proceedings or has\n                    submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts does notper sedisentitle him from applying for a\n                        stay.[note: 7]The Respondent submits that\n                    such conduct would be “fatal only to a challenge to the [c]ourt’s\n                    jurisdiction under Order 12 Rule 7(1)”.[note: 8] 16     In this connection, it must be borne in mind\n                    that an application under O 12 r 7(2) for a stay of proceedings on the\n                    ground offorum non conveniensis not the same as\n                    an application under O 12 r 7(1) disputing the jurisdiction of the\n                    Singapore courts. A stay application under O 12 r 7(2) accepts that\n                    the Singapore courts have jurisdiction over the dispute in question, but asserts\n                    that another jurisdiction is the more appropriate forum to try the dispute. This\n                    difference between O 12 r 7(1) and O 12 r 7(2) was explained\n                    by this court inChanat [22] as follows: The appellant [the plaintiff in the originating suit inChan] relies on several cases to argue that an extension of\n                        time under O 3 r 4, even if permissible, cannot\n                        “cure” the fact that the respondents [the defendants in the\n                        originating suit inChan] had already taken\n                        steps in the proceedings and submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore\n                        courts. With respect, this argument is off the mark because whether a\n                        litigant hassubmittedto the jurisdiction of the court is relevant only to\n                        an application … under O 12 r 7(1), where the litigant is\n                        taking the position that the court hasno jurisdictionto hear the case. In\n                        contrast, where the litigant applies for a stay under O 12 r 7(2)\n                        on the ground offorum non conveniens, he in factaccepts the court’s\n                        jurisdictionand is not to be treated as disputing it … The\n                        respondents have undoubtedly participated in the Singapore proceedings by\n                        filing their [d]efence. Although this would be a step in the proceeding that\n                        might disentitle them from contesting jurisdiction under O 12\n                        r 7(1), this does not mean that they are barred from applying for a\n                        stay on the ground offorum non conveniens. [emphasis in original] 17     In the present case, the Respondent is\n                    applying for a stay of proceedings under O 12 r 7(2); he is not\n                    disputing the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts pursuant to O 12\n                    r 7(1). Indeed, the fact that the Respondent has submitted to the\n                    jurisdiction of the Singapore courts cannot be challenged as he has already\n                    filed his defence to the Singapore Action (and has also since amended his\n                    original defence). As can be seen from the passage from [22] ofChanjust quoted above, the filing of the defence by the\n                    Respondent does not in itself disentitle him from applying for a stay of the\n                    Singapore Action.",
        "The Respondent’s late filing of the Stay Application": "18     In our view, the more pertinent question which\n                    we must addressvis-à-visthe First Issue concerns\n                    the fact that the Respondent filed the Stay Application out of time.\n                    Order 12 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court states that an application for a\n                    stay of proceedings on the ground offorum non\n                        conveniensmust be filed “within the time limited for\n                    serving a defence”. The Respondent should thus have filed the Stay\n                    Application either by 27 May 2009 (the original deadline for filing his\n                    defence) or, at the latest, by 5 June 2009 (the mutually-agreed extended\n                    deadline for filing the defence). This in turn raises the question of what\n                    considerations the court should take into account in deciding whether to\n                    exercise its discretion to extend the time for filing a stay\n                application. 19     Under the Rules of Court, thesubstantiveeffect of a procedural default or\n                    irregularity is provided for in O 2 r 1(2), which reads: ... [T]he Courtmay, on the ground that\n                        there has been such a [procedural default] as is mentioned in [O 2\n                        r 1(1)], and on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just,\n                        set aside either wholly or in part the proceedings in which the [procedural\n                        default] occurred, any step taken in those proceedings or any document,\n                        judgment or order therein or exercise its powers under these Rules to allow\n                        such amendments (if any) to be made and to make such order (if any) dealing\n                        with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit. [emphasis added] Order 2 r 1(2) clearly confers a wide discretion on the\n                    court to deal with procedural defaults as it does not specify the considerations\n                    which the court should take into account in exercising that discretion. That\n                    said, how this discretion should be exercised raises important questions as to\n                    the relationship between procedural justice and substantive justice in our civil\n                    litigation system. 20     Apropos these questions, our courts have in\n                    several cases consistently advocated one principle, namely, the need to strike a\n                    balance between, on the one hand, instilling procedural discipline in civil\n                    litigation and, on the other, permitting parties to present the substantive\n                    merits of their respective cases to the court notwithstanding some procedural\n                    irregularities (see,eg,United\n                        Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd[2005]\n                    2 SLR(R) 425 (“UOB v Ng Huat\n                        Foundations”) at [4]–[9],Lee\n                        Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another\n                        suit[2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 (“Lee Hsien Loong”) at [36] andLee Chee\n                        Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal[2007]\n                    3 SLR(R) 537 at [82]). In a similar vein,Singapore\n                        Court Practice 2009(Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) (LexisNexis,\n                    2009) (“Pinsler 2009”) states at\n                    para 2/1/1: While sanctions are necessary to ensure that the parties do not disregard\n                        [procedural] rules with impunity, the court’s reaction to\n                        non-compliance must be tempered by the equally important principle that the\n                        rules of procedure serve the substantive law, and that a party should not be\n                        automatically deprived of his substantive rights by procedural error. 21     While this principle of striking a balance\n                    between the competing interests of procedural justice and substantive justice is\n                    simple to state, it is by no means easy to apply in practice. InUOB v Ng Huat Foundations, it was held by the High Court\n                    that: 8    The quest for justice … entails a continuous\n                            need to balance the procedural with the substantive. More than that, it\n                            is a continuous attempt to ensure that both areintegrated, as far as that is humanly possible. Bothinteractwith each other. One cannot\n                            survive without the other. There must, therefore, be – as far as\n                            is possible – a fair and just procedure that leads to a fair and\n                            just result. This is not merely abstract theorising. It is thevery basisof what the courts do – and\n                            ought to do. ... 9    It is true, however, that in the sphere of practical\n                            reality, there is often atensionbetween\n                            the need for procedural justice on the one hand and substantive justice\n                            on the other. The task of the court is to attempt, as I have pointed out\n                            in the preceding paragraph, to resolve this tension. There is a further\n                            task: it is to actually attempt, simultaneously, to integrate these two\n                            conceptions of justice in order that justice in its fullest orb may\n                            shine forth. [emphasis in original] 22     A general test which is often employed to\n                    address this tension between ensuring compliance with procedural requirements\n                    and ensuring that substantive justice is done is the test of prejudice. Thus, inThe “Tokai Maru”[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 646 (“The Tokai\n                    Maru”), this court held at [23]: … (b)    The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and\n                            litigants towards the just resolution of the case and should of course\n                            be adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his\n                            opportunity to dispute the plaintiff’s claims and have a\n                            determination of the issues on the merits as a punishment for a breach\n                            of these rulesunless the other party has been made\n                                to suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an\n                                appropriate order as to costs. (c)    Save in special cases or exceptional\n                            circumstances, it can rarely be appropriate then, on an overall\n                            assessment of what justice requires, to deny a defendant an extension of\n                            time where the denial would have the effect of depriving him of his\n                            defence because of a procedural default which, even if unjustified, has\n                            caused the plaintiff no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by\n                            an award of costs. [emphasis added] 23     Similarly, inChanat [25], this court, citing the decision inThe Tokai Maru, held: … [E]xtensions pertaining to matters that touch upon the\n                        substantive merits of a party’s case (and where [the application] does\n                        not relate to the filing of [a] notice of appeal out of time) should\n                        generally be grantedunless the other party would suffer\n                            prejudice that could not be compensated by costs…\n                        [emphasis added] 24     At this juncture, we ought to refer to another\n                    provision in the Rules of Court which is pertinent to the issue of whether the\n                    timeline for filing the Stay Application should be extended. This is O 3\n                    r 4, which reads: Extension, etc., of time\n                            (O. 3, r. 4) 4.—(1) The Court may, on such\n                        terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which\n                        a person is required or authorised by these Rules or by any judgment, order\n                        or direction, to do any act in any proceedings. (2)    The Court may extend any such period as is\n                            referred to in paragraph (1) although the application for extension\n                            is not made until after the expiration of that period. Order 3 r 4 is relevant in this appeal because, as\n                    mentioned at[4]above, in the Stay\n                    Application, the Respondent, apart from seeking a stay of the Singapore Action,\n                    also asked for an extension of time to file that application. We should also add\n                    that under para 7 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature\n                    Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), the High Court is conferred\n                    “[p]ower to enlarge or abridge the time prescribed by any written law for\n                    doing any act or taking any proceeding, whether the application therefor\n                        [sic] is made before or after the expiration\n                    of the time prescribed”. 25     Like O 2 r 1(2) of the Rules of\n                    Court, O 3 rr 4(1) and 4(2) do not spell out how the court’s\n                    discretion to extend or abridge time should be exercised, although O 3\n                    r 4(1) does state that the discretion should be exercised “on such\n                    terms as [the court] thinks just”. As is to be expected, case law also\n                    does not provide definitive guidance as to how this discretionary power ought to\n                    be exercised, although broad considerations can be gleaned from the authorities.\n                    Much would depend on the circumstances of each case. Obviously, a consideration\n                    which is materially significant in one set of circumstances may not necessarily\n                    have the same significant effect in a different set of circumstances. In some\n                    cases, the courts have made judicial pronouncements which appear to be\n                    relatively liberal, such as the statement by Mustill LJ inErskine Communications Ltd and Another v Worthington and\n                        Others[1991] TLR 330 (at 330 itself) that: … [I]t would be absurd to say that every instance of overstepping\n                        the time limit without excuse, however short and however lacking in harmful\n                        consequence to the defendant, should be punished by the loss of the\n                        action. In other cases, the courts appear to have taken a stricter approach.\n                    For instance, inThamboo Ratnam v Thamboo Cumarasamy and\n                        Cumarasamy Ariamany d/o Kumarasa[1965] 1 WLR 8, the\n                    Privy Council stated at 12: The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a\n                        court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to\n                        be taken there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its\n                        discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an\n                        unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of\n                        the rules, which is to provide a time table [sic] for the conduct of litigation. 26     InCostellow v Somerset\n                        County Council[1993] 1 WLR 256, Sir Thomas\n                    Bingham MR laid stress on the importance of the question of prejudice and\n                    held that it was the “overall assessment of what justice\n                    require[d]” (at 264) which really mattered. A similar approach was taken\n                    by the English Court of Appeal inFinnegan v Parkside Health\n                        Authority[1998] 1 WLR 411. In that case, the plaintiff\n                    applied to the English High Court for an extension of time to file an appeal\n                    against an order of the master striking out her action for want of prosecution.\n                    The judge hearing the application (“the English High Court\n                    judge”), who did not think he needed to consider the question of\n                    prejudice, refused to grant the plaintiff the extension sought. On appeal by the\n                    plaintiff, the English Court of Appeal, taking the view that the question of\n                    prejudice was of importance and bearing in mind the overriding principle that\n                    justice had to be done, remitted the case back to the English High Court judge\n                    for further consideration, with a specific direction to look into the question\n                    of prejudice. 27     Another instructive case isMortgage Corporation Ltd v Sandoes and Others[1996] TLR 751 (“Mortgage\n                        Corporation”), where the plaintiff sought, but was denied,\n                    an extension of time for the exchange of witness statements and expert reports.\n                    On appeal, the English Court of Appeal said that the correct approach to take\n                    was that once a party was in default in complying with a prescribed timeline, it\n                    was for that party to satisfy the court that despite its default, the\n                    court’s discretion to extend time should nevertheless be exercised in its\n                    favour; in this connection, the party in default could rely on any relevant\n                    circumstances. Millett LJ, in delivering the judgment of the English Court\n                    of Appeal, said at 752: The court was acutely aware of the growing jurisprudence in relation to\n                        the failure to observe procedural requirements. There was a need for\n                        clarification as to the likely approach of the court in the future to\n                        non-compliance with the requirements as to time contained in the rules or\n                        directions of the court. What [the court] said now went beyond the exchange\n                        of witness statements or expert reports; it was intended to be of general\n                        import. Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls and Sir Richard\n                        Scott, Vice-Chancellor, had approved the following guidance as to the future\n                        approach which litigants could expect the court to adopt to the failure to\n                        adhere to time limits contained in the rules or directions of the\n                        court: 1    Time requirements laid down by the rules and\n                                directions given by the court were not merely targets to be\n                                attempted; they were rules to be observed. 2    At the same time the overriding principle was\n                                that justice must be done. 3    Litigants were entitled to have their cases\n                                resolved with reasonable expedition. The non-compliance with time\n                                limits could cause prejudice to one or more of the parties to the\n                                litigation. 4    In addition the vacation or adjournment of the\n                                date of trial prejudiced other litigants and disrupted the\n                                administration of justice. 5    Extensions of time which involved the vacation\n                                or adjournment of trial dates should therefore be granted only as a\n                                last resort. 6    Where time limits had not been complied with the\n                                parties should cooperate in reaching an agreement as to new time\n                                limits which would not involve the date of trial being\n                                postponed. 7    If they reached such an agreement they could\n                                ordinarily expect the court to give effect to that agreement at the\n                                trial and it was not necessary to make a separate application solely\n                                for that purpose. 8    The court would not look with favour on a party\n                                who sought only to take tactical advantage [of] the failure of\n                                another party to comply with time limits. 9    In the absence of an agreement as to a new\n                                timetable, an application should be made promptly to the court for\n                                directions. 10    In considering whether to grant an extension of\n                                time to a party who was in default, the court would look at all the\n                                circumstances of the case including the considerations identified\n                                above. 28     Our local cases appear to draw a distinction\n                    between an application (made after a trial) for an extension of time to file a\n                    notice of appeal and an application for an extension of time for other purposes,\n                    with the courts taking a stricter viewvis-à-visthe former type of application. This distinction seems to have been recognised\n                    inLee Hsien Loong, where this court said at\n                    [33]: It is clear … thatthe courts will\n                            adopt a far stricter approach towards applications for extension of time\n                            for the filing and/or serving of a notice of appeal relative to other\n                            situations. This is not without good reason. The overriding\n                        concern in the context ofappealsis that\n                        there befinality. Indeed, the one-month\n                        deadline for the filing of a notice of appeal is not an arbitrary one.\n                        Underlying the concern with finality is the fundamental rationale ofjustice and fairness. The decision\n                        concerned has,ex hypothesi, gone against the\n                        losing party (ie, the would-be appellant), and\n                        the onus is therefore on it to file an appeal if it feels that the decision\n                        is wrong. Correspondingly, the other party (the would-be respondent), having\n                        had the decision handed down in its favour, should not be kept waiting\n                        – at least, not indefinitely – on tenterhooks to receive the\n                        fruits of its judgment. For better or for worse, the applicant must decide\n                        whether or not it wishes to appeal. As this court observed inOng Cheng Aik[v Dayco Products\n                            Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation)[2005]\n                        2 SLR(R) 561] at [8]: In respect of such an application for extension of time [to file or\n                            serve a notice of appeal out of time], the court takes a rather strict\n                            view of things and sufficient grounds must be shown before the court\n                            will exercise its discretion. This is because if no appeal is filed and\n                            served within the prescribed time of one month, the successful party is\n                            justly entitled to assume and act as if the judgment is final. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] 29     The factors which our courts have regard to in\n                    determining whether an extension of time to file a notice of appeal should be\n                    granted are fourfold, namely: (a) the length of the delay; (b) the\n                    reasons for the delay; (c) the chances of the defaulting party (ie, the would-be appellant) succeeding on appeal if the\n                    time for appealing were extended; and (d) the degree of prejudice to the\n                    would-be respondent if the extension of time were granted (see,inter alia,Hau Khee Wee and another\n                        v Chua Kian Tong and another[1985–1986] SLR(R) 1075 at [14],Pearson\n                        Judith Rosemary v Chen Chien Wen Edwin[1991]\n                    2 SLR(R) 260 at [15],AD v AE[2004]\n                    2 SLR(R) 505 at [10],Lee Hsien Loongat\n                    [18] andAnwar Siraj and another v Ting Kang Chung\n                        John[2010] 1 SLR 1026 at [29]). It should, however, be\n                    noted that these factors have also been applied in some cases which did not\n                    concern an application for leave to file an appeal out of time (see,eg,The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v\n                        Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd[2008] 3 SLR(R) 121,\n                    which pertained to the late filing of a proof of debt under a scheme of\n                    arrangement for a company). 30     In our view, what the aforesaid authorities\n                    show is that in each case, the court, in deciding whether to extend the\n                    prescribed timeline for an act to be done, has to balance the competing\n                    interests of the parties concerned. As the statement of Millett LJ inMortgage Corporation(quoted above at[27]) shows, the factual matrix of the\n                    particular case at hand will be paramount. In balancing the parties’\n                    competing interests, the court inevitably needs to consider the question of\n                    prejudice. Copious citation of case law will not be necessary (and also will not\n                    be helpful) as previous decisions will be no more than guides. In determining\n                    how the balance of interests should be struck and in applying the four factors\n                    mentioned at[29]above, it is the overall\n                    picture that emerges to the court as to where the justice of the case lies which\n                    will ultimately be decisive.",
        "The Judge’s reservations aboutChan": "31     Before we go on to apply the principles\n                    outlined above to the facts of the present case, we wish to address the\n                    Judge’s reservations about this court’s decision inChan. InChan, the\n                    defendants – like the Respondent – applied late for a stay of\n                    proceedings and did so onlyafterthey had filed\n                    their defence. Because of this factual similarity between the instant case andChan, the Judge felt constrained to apply the\n                    test of prejudice inChanto the\n                    Respondent’s benefit (see the GD at [11]; see also[9]above). 32     However, as alluded to at[9]above, the Judge also expressed reservations\n                    about the decision inChan(see the GD at\n                    [12]–[19]). In particular, the Judge seemed to be of the view that: (a)     the decision inChanwas open to question because this court had referred toThe Tokai Maru, which involved factual\n                        circumstances that were significantly dissimilar to those found inChan(referred to hereafter as “the\n                        Judge’s first reservation aboutChan”) (see the GD at [12]–[13]);\n                    and (b)     the test of\n                        prejudice adopted inChanwas unsatisfactory\n                        because it might lead to unsatisfactory results in the context of stay\n                        applications (referred to hereafter as “the Judge’s second\n                        reservation aboutChan”) (see the GD at\n                        [15] and [19]). 33     On the face of it, it seems to us that the\n                    Judge expressed reservations about the decision inChanbecause there appeared (in his view) to be some\n                    incongruence between where the equities of the present case lay and the legal\n                    result that would follow by applyingChan. It\n                    appears that the Judge would not have exercised his discretion to extend time to\n                    enable the Respondent to make the Stay Application but for the principle\n                    enunciated inChan. 34Vis-à-visthe\n                    Judge’s first reservation aboutChan, the\n                    Judge appeared to have understood the rationale of the test of prejudice as\n                    beingonlyto prevent a defaulting party from\n                    being deprived of the opportunity topresent its\n                        caseto the court on the merits. Accordingly, the Judge found it\n                    appropriate to draw a distinction between the instant case andThe Tokai Maruby stating in the GD that: 12    ... [The]Tokai Maruwas not a case in which a defendant\n                            had filed his stay application late. In that case, the party was filing\n                            an affidavit of evidence-in-chief late and the court was loath to\n                            preclude that party frompresenting its\n                                case. 13    In resisting an application for a stay of\n                            proceedings, a plaintiff is not seeking to preclude a defendant frompresenting his case. On the contrary,\n                            the plaintiff is suggesting that the defendant should do so but that he\n                            should do soin Singapore. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] 35     With respect, we do not think that the test of\n                    prejudice adopted inChanshould be so narrowly\n                    confined,ie, as being applicable only to a\n                    situation where a defaulting party would be prevented from presenting its case\n                    to the court on the merits if an extension of time were not granted. There is no\n                    reason why the test of prejudice cannot apply in other circumstances (eg, where the court is confronted with the question of\n                    whether it should exercise its discretion to extend time to enable an act to be\n                    carried out under the Rules of Court). The need for a party to present its case\n                    to the court on the merits is not thesolesort of\n                    circumstance which the test of prejudice can usefully address. InMortgage Corporation(see[27]above), for instance, the English Court of Appeal held that\n                    the question of prejudice was a relevant consideration in determining whether an\n                    extension of time for the exchange of witness statements and expert reports\n                    should be granted. We should also underscore that in the passage from\n                    Millett LJ’s judgment inMortgage\n                        Corporationat 752 (quoted at[27]above), it was expressly stated that the guidelines set out\n                    therein were intended to be of general application and were not limited to the\n                    specific situation which arose in that case. 36     It is true that inChan, this court stated at [25] that: … [I]t bears noting what this court said inThe Tokai Maru… at [23], [ie,] that extensions [of time] pertaining to matters that\n                        touch upon the substantive merits of a party’s case (and where [the\n                        application] does not relate to the filing of [a] notice of appeal out of\n                        time) should generally be granted unless the other party would suffer\n                        prejudice that could not be compensated by costs: ... The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants\n                            towards the just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered\n                            to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to\n                            dispute the plaintiff’s claims and have a determination of the\n                            issues on the merits as a punishment for a breach of these rules unless\n                            the other party has been made to suffer prejudice which cannot be\n                            compensated for by an appropriate order as to costs. …Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances,\n                                it can rarely be appropriate then, on an overall assessment of what\n                                justice requires, to deny a defendant an extension of\n                                timewhere the denial would have the effect of depriving\n                            him of his defencebecause of a procedural default\n                                which, even if unjustified, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice\n                                for which he cannot be compensated by an award of\n                            costs. [emphasis in original] 37     On a plain reading of the above quotation, it\n                    seems clear that inChan, this court was doing no\n                    more than merely citingThe Tokai Maruasone instancewhere the test of prejudice was\n                    applied, and wasnotintending in any wayto limitthe remit of the application of this\n                    test. From the above quotation, it is also clear that inChan, this court was well aware that the circumstances inThe Tokai Maru(which concerned an application\n                    to file an affidavit of evidence-in-chief – a document that\n                    “touch[es] upon the substantive merits of a party’s case”\n                        (per[25] ofChan) – out of time) were different from those inChan(which concerned a late attempt by the\n                    defendants, via a stay application filed out of time, to contend that Malaysia,\n                    and not Singapore, was the appropriate forum to try the plaintiff’s\n                    defamation action against them). 38     We now turn to the Judge’s second\n                    reservation aboutChan, which centred on the\n                    Judge’s concern that the test of prejudice could lead to unsatisfactory\n                    results in the context of stay applications. In particular, the Judge was of the\n                    view that under the test of prejudice, a defendant could effectively make a\n                    plaintiff endure copious interlocutory applications after the defence was filed\n                    and yet still escape the fate of being precluded from applying for a stay of\n                    proceedings out of time as the test of prejudice “place[d] an unfair\n                    burden on the plaintiff to show good reasons why [the] defendant should not be\n                    allowed to make his application for a stay late” (see the GD at [16]; see\n                    also [15] and [19] of the GD). 39     While we understand these concerns of the\n                    Judge, it is, with respect,notentirely correct\n                    to say that the test of prejudice has the effect of enabling a defendant to make\n                    copious interlocutory applications after filing its defence whilst still\n                    remaining at liberty to make a stay application out of time. The law certainly\n                    would not grant a defendantcarte blancheto make\n                    copious interlocutory applications with impunity (a\n                        fortiori, as we note at[40]below, where such applications are made in bad faith). In this regard, we note\n                    the following observations of Bowen LJ inCropper v\n                        Smith(1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710 (referred to inThe Tokai Maruat [22]): … I think it is a well established principle that the object of\n                        [the] Courts is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them\n                        for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise\n                        than in accordance with their rights. ...I know of no\n                            kind of error or mistake which,if not\n                            fraudulent or intended to overreach, the\n                            Court ought not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the\n                            other party. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline,\n                        but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy … [emphasis added\n                        in italics and bold italics] 40     We do not wish to venture into the realm of\n                    speculation, but, obviously, the more interlocutory applications or steps a\n                    defendant makes or takes before it files a stay application, and/or the longer\n                    it delays in making its stay application, the court would undoubtedly take those\n                    circumstances into account in determining whether or not to grant the defendant\n                    an extension of time to apply for a stay. The court is not without the necessary\n                    procedural armoury (which includes the making of an appropriate costs order) to\n                    prevent any abuse of its process. Further, the court would be entitled to hold\n                    that procedural irregularities motivated by bad faith or by a deliberate\n                    intention to overreach on the part of the defaulting party are\n                    irremediable. 41     As regards the Judge’s point that the\n                    test of prejudice seems to favour the defendant as it apparently places the\n                    burden on the plaintiff to show that it (the plaintiff) has suffered prejudice\n                    which cannot be compensated by costs (in this connection, the Judge even\n                    suggested that the burden of proof under the test of prejudice should be\n                    reversed, with the defendant having to adduce good reasons to show why it should\n                    be allowed to make its stay application out of time (see the GD at [16])), we\n                    think this advantage is more apparent than real. The test of prejudice must\n                    ultimately be applied in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the case\n                    at hand. It goes without saying that an applicant for an extension of time has\n                    the initial burden of showing facts which warrant the court exercising its\n                    discretion in the applicant’s favour. But, the burden of proof on any\n                    particular issue at any particular point in time is not static. In particular,\n                    the evidential burden would shift, depending on how the application for an\n                    extension of time progresses. In our view, unless there are other more weighty\n                    considerations, the determination by the court on the question of prejudice\n                    could very well be decisive as to how it views where the justice of the case\n                    lies and, in turn, how it decides to exercise its discretion to extend\n                    time. 42     In this connection, we ought to clarify that\n                    inChan, the position taken by the plaintiffvis-à-visthe defendants’ application\n                    for a stay of proceedings was that the timeline prescribed in O 12\n                    r 7(2) of the Rules of Court for filing a stay application was absolute and\n                    the court had no discretion whatsoever to extend that timeline. In the absence\n                    of any other ground advanced by the plaintiff, this court quite naturally\n                    considered, in the main, only the question of prejudice in deciding whether to\n                    grant the defendants an extension of time to file their stay application. This\n                    court didnotstate inChanthat prejudice was theonlymatter which the court needed to take into account when considering an\n                    application for an extension of time. The court’s consideration of\n                    prejudice inChanmust be viewed in the context of\n                    the grounds raised by the parties there. In any event, this court inChanclearly also took into account other circumstances,\n                    such as the close link between the plaintiff’s action in Singapore against\n                    the defendants for defamation (“the Singapore defamation action”)\n                    and the plaintiff’s actions in Malaysia against the defendants as trustees\n                    of an estate (“the Malaysian trusteeship actions”) as well as the\n                    desirability of avoiding inconsistent findings in those two sets of proceedings\n                    (seeChanat [26]). Lastly, there is one other\n                    circumstance inChanwhich warrants highlighting.\n                    This relates to the fact that the stay granted inChanwas a limited one,ie, the\n                    Singapore defamation action was stayed only to the limited extent that it was to\n                    be heard inSingaporeafter the conclusion of the\n                    Malaysian trusteeship actions (seeChanat [47]).\n                    The stay order inChanwas not the normalforum non conveniensstay order, which would\n                    have been an order staying the Singapore defamation action so that a fresh\n                    defamation suit could be commenced inMalaysiaand\n                    be heard together with the Malaysian trusteeship actions, which were then\n                    pending.",
        "Our ruling on extension of time for filing the Stay\n                Application": "43     We now turn to consider whether, applying the\n                    principles discussed at [20]–[30] above to the circumstances of this case,\n                    this court should grant the Respondent an extension of time to file the Stay\n                    Application notwithstanding that, besides being late in filing that application,\n                    the Respondent has also filed his defence to the Singapore Action. The Judge\n                    thought that the whole state of affairs was brought about by the mistake of the\n                    Respondent’s solicitors. This was what he stated at [18] of the GD: It appeared to me that the reality was that [the Respondent’s]\n                        solicitors did not realise that that the [S]tay [A]pplication had to be\n                        filed as soon as possible and before filing the defence. Had they realised\n                        this and if there were genuine reasons why they could not do so promptly,\n                        then they should have applied for an extension of time to file the [S]tay\n                        [A]pplication as well as [for an order] to defer the filing of the defence\n                        pending the outcome of the [S]tay [A]pplication. 44     We are inclined to agree with this finding of\n                    the Judge as there is nothing to suggest that the Respondent’s lateness in\n                    filing the Stay Application was brought about by any bad faith or by any\n                    intention on the Respondent’s part to overreach. It seems to us that this\n                    was a case of either oversight or unfamiliarity with the Rules of Court on the\n                    part of the Respondent’s solicitors. While this court does not condone\n                    such mistakes, the question that remains, ultimately, is this: is the\n                    Respondent’s procedural default so egregious that the imposition of a\n                    sanction by way of an appropriate costs order would not suffice to register the\n                    court’s disapproval? We do not think so. The position taken by the\n                    Appellant is that the Respondent, by filing his defence to the Singapore Action,\n                    has accepted the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, and that is fatal to the\n                    Stay Application. We do not think the filing of the Respondent’s defenceper senecessarily leads to this outcome. Work\n                    done by the Appellant’s solicitors following the filing of the\n                    Respondent’s defence can be adequately compensated by costs. It is also\n                    pertinent to note that in a letter written by the Respondent’s solicitors\n                    on 4 June 2009[note: 9](ie, one\n                    day prior to the mutually-agreed extended deadline of 5 June 2009 for the\n                    filing of the Respondent’s defence), the Respondent’s solicitors\n                    asked the Appellant’s solicitors to allow the Respondent to defer filing\n                    his defence, stating that the Respondent would be making a stay application on\n                    the ground offorum non conveniens. Apparently,\n                    for various reasons (eg, the efforts of the\n                    Respondent’s solicitors to get a copy of the Maldivian judgment obtained\n                    by Shahid against SJM (ie, the Maldivian judgment\n                    referred to at sub-para (a) of[6]above) and the wait for a legal opinion from the Maldives as to whether or not\n                    the Appellant’s claims against the Respondent could be pursued\n                        there),[note: 10]the\n                    Respondent did not feel able then to apply for a stay of the Singapore\n                    Action. 45     Without going into the question of whether\n                    these reasons were adequate to justify the Respondent’s decision not to\n                    file the Stay Application within the prescribed timeline, the fact is that the\n                    Stay Application was not an afterthought. Admittedly, the apparent difficulty\n                    encountered by the Respondent in complying with the timeline for applying for a\n                    stay of the Singapore Action could have been easily overcome by his making an\n                    express reservation when filing his defence to that action. This was not done\n                    (due, perhaps, to an insufficient understanding of the Rules of Court on the\n                    part of the Respondent’s solicitors). On 23 June 2009, the\n                    Respondent’s solicitors again wrote to the Appellant’s\n                        solicitors,[note: 11]reiterating (among other things)\n                    the Respondent’s intention to apply for a stay of the Singapore Action and\n                    the fact that they (the Respondent’s solicitors) were waiting for certain\n                    documents (see[44]above). While the delay\n                    here involved a period of approximately one month and three weeks, it bears\n                    emphasis that the Stay Application is an interlocutory matter which does not\n                    involve the filing of a notice of appeal out of time. Moreover, the Stay\n                    Application cannot be regarded as without merit (see the GD at [25]–[52]\n                    and the discussion below at[53]–[64]). In the\n                    circumstances, we do not think that the Judge’s decision to grant the\n                    Respondent an extension of time to file the Stay Application can be regarded as\n                    plainly without any basis and plainly wrong.",
        "Waiver": "46     Before we move on to consider the Second\n                    Issue, we note, in passing, that the question of whether the Respondent could be\n                    taken, by virtue of his lateness in applying for a stay of the Singapore Action,\n                    to have waived his right to make such an application was not dealt with in the\n                    court below, nor was it raised by the parties in their submissions in this\n                    appeal. All that we wish to say in this regard is that in the commentary on\n                    O 12 r 7 of the Rules of Court inPinsler\n                        2009at para 12/7/6, it is stated that “[a] lengthy\n                    delay in making [a stay] application (ie beyond the time limit for serving a\n                    defence) may be treated as a waiver of any objections which might have been\n                    raised”. As no submission was made by the parties as to whether the\n                    principle of waiver was applicable in the present case and, if so, how that\n                    principle should be applied, we will make no further comment on this\n                    issue.",

        "The Judge’s decision on the Second Issue": "48     In the court below, the Judge quite rightly\n                    applied theSpiliadatest in deciding the Second\n                    Issue. Having weighed the various relevant connecting factors, he came to the\n                    conclusion that the Maldives would be the more appropriate forum for the trial\n                    of the Dispute. The connecting factors which he considered are tabulated\n                    below: CONNECTING FACTORS CONSIDERED UNDER THE FIRST STAGE OF\n                                        THESPILIADATESTFactors pointing to Singapore as the\n                                            more appropriate forumFactors pointing to the Maldives as\n                                            the more appropriate forum1.    The Employment\n                                                Contract was allegedly made in Singapore (see the GD\n                                                at\n                                                [35]).2.    According to the Appellant, the Employment Contract\n                                                was governed by Singapore law (see the GD at\n                                                [35]).1.    The Respondent was\n                                                working for SJM in the Maldives at the material time\n                                                (see the GD at\n                                                [34]).2.    The\n                                                Employment Contract was performed by the Respondent\n                                                in the Maldives (see the GD at\n                                                [35]).3.    The\n                                                Respondent’s alleged breaches of the\n                                                Employment Contract were committed in the Maldives\n                                                (see the GD at\n                                                [35]).4.    The\n                                                Respondent’s employment was terminated in the\n                                                Maldives (see the GD at\n                                                [35]).5.    Maldivian\n                                                law was probably the governing law of the Dispute\n                                                (see the GD at\n                                                [35]).6.    There\n                                                were two witnesses in the Maldives (namely, Shahid\n                                                and one Ibrahim Gahir (“Gahir”)), who\n                                                were not willing to come to Singapore to give\n                                                evidence and who were not compellable witnesses in\n                                                Singapore (see the GD at\n                                            [38]–[39]).CONNECTING FACTORS CONSIDERED UNDER THE SECOND STAGE OF\n                                        THESPILIADATESTFactors raised by the\n                                            AppellantThe Judge’s decision on the\n                                            factors raised1.    The Appellant\n                                                would not have any legal recourse in the Maldives\n                                                because, the Employment Contract being unenforceable\n                                                in the Maldivian courts, there was no available\n                                                forum in the Maldives to resolve the\n                                                Appellant’s claims against the Respondent (see\n                                                the GD at\n                                                [44]).2.    There\n                                                was a prior court ruling in the Maldives\n                                                (specifically, the ruling in the Maldivian profit\n                                                suit mentioned at[7]above) which could result in the\n                                                Appellant having no standing to sue the Respondent\n                                                in the Maldives (see the GD at\n                                                [46]).3.    Maldivian\n                                                law was not as developed as Singapore law in that\n                                                causes of action based on tort, trust and agency\n                                                could not be sued on in the Maldives. Hence, the\n                                                Appellant had fewer causes of action there as\n                                                compared to Singapore (see the GD at\n                                            [50]).1.Rejectedon evidential grounds (see\n                                                the GD at\n                                                [45]).2.    Regarded\n                                                as aneutralfactor\n                                                (see the GD at\n                                                [47]–[49]).3.Rejectedfor reasons of\n                                                international comity, namely, it was not for the\n                                                Singapore courts to pass judgment on the competence\n                                                or independence of foreign judiciaries (see the GD\n                                                at [51]).   49     On the basis of the above table, it is easy to\n                    see why the Judge held that the preponderance of the relevant connecting factors\n                    in the instant case favoured the Maldives as the more appropriate forum under\n                    the first stage of theSpiliadatest, and also\n                    went on to hold that the Appellant had failed to show, under the second stage of\n                    theSpiliadatest, why a stay of the Singapore\n                    Action should not be granted despite the Maldives being the more appropriate\n                    forum. We now examine whether the Judge was right to come to this\n                    conclusion.",
        "Evaluation of the Judge’s exercise of discretion under theSpiliadatest": "50     It is settled law that in deciding whether or\n                    not to stay an action on the ground offorum non\n                        conveniens, a judge is exercising his discretion, and this court,\n                    in hearing an appeal against such a decision, should only review that decision\n                    and should not exercise an independent discretion. As this court stated inChanat [28]: ... [A]s the question of whether or not to grant a stay of proceedings\n                        involves an exercise of a judge’s discretion, the appellate court will\n                        only review the [j]udge’s exercise of his discretion. It will not\n                        exercise the discretion afresh and substitute its own discretion in place of\n                        [the discretion of] the court below … 51     Similarly, in the earlier case ofCIMB Bank, this court held at [84]: It is clear that in determining whether or not to grant a stay of\n                        proceedings, the judge will be exercising a discretion. Such an exercise of\n                        discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate courtunless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of\n                            principle, or … had taken into account matters which he ought not\n                            to have taken into account or had failed to take into account matters\n                            which he ought to have taken into account, or [unless] his decision\n                            [was] plainly wrong… [emphasis added] 52     In his submissions, counsel for the Respondent\n                    cited the decision of the House of Lords inShiloh Spinners\n                        Ltd v Harding[1973] AC 691 and the local case ofQBE Insurance Ltd v Sim Lim Finance Ltd[1987] SLR(R) 23 (“QBE\n                    Insurance”). These two cases set out substantially the same\n                    proposition of law as that enunciated at [28] ofChanand [84] ofCIMB Bank, save\n                    thatQBE Insurancelaid down (at [36]) an\n                    additional ground for an appellate court to interfere with a lower court’s\n                    exercise of discretion as follows: The function of an appellate court in hearing an appeal against an\n                        interlocutory order is primarily a reviewing function and the court should\n                        reverse a decision ... [inter alia] in order\n                        to promote consistency in the exercise of … discretion by the judges\n                        as a whole where there appear, in closely comparable circumstances, to be\n                        two conflicting schools of judicial opinion as to the relative weight to be\n                        given to particular considerations … As the Respondent is not saying that there are “in closely\n                    comparable circumstances, … two conflicting schools of judicial opinion\n                    as to the relative weight to be given to particular considerations”\n                        (per[36] ofQBE\n                        Insurance) in the present case, nothing in this appeal turns on\n                    this additional ground for interfering with a lower court’s exercise of\n                    discretion and we need make no further comment on it. The first stage of theSpiliadatest (1)   Availability of allegedly material witnesses in the\n                Maldives 53     In respect of the Judge’s exercise of\n                    discretion under the first stage of theSpiliadatest, the Appellant’s strongest point, in our view, is the argument (based\n                    on the decision inMineral Enterprises Ltd v JIO Minerals FZC\n                        and others[2010] SGHC 109) that in deciding a stay application,\n                    the court “[can]not simply weigh the connecting factors without reference\n                    to the likely issues”.[note: 12]Two connecting factors have been singled out by the Appellant in this regard,\n                    namely, the availability of allegedly material witnesses in the Maldives and the\n                    governing law of the Dispute. 54Vis-à-visthe\n                    first of the aforesaid connecting factors, the Appellant argues that\n                    “[t]he crux of [its] case concerns the authority of the Respondent and\n                    that is a matter between the [Appellant] and the Respondent\n                        alone”.[note: 13]According to the Appellant,\n                    the question of what authority the Respondent actually possessed at the material\n                    time is solely “a matter within the knowledge of the parties [ie, the Appellant and the\n                        Respondent]”[note: 14][emphasis in bold in\n                    original omitted]. Thus, the Appellant claims, the Judge should not have taken\n                    into account the fact that there are witnesses in the Maldives (ie, Shahid and Gahir) who are allegedly material\n                    witnesses. Indeed, the Appellant asserts that these Maldivian witnesses are\n                    wholly unnecessary for the purposes of resolving the Dispute. Accordingly, it\n                    submits that the availability of allegedly material witnesses in the Maldives\n                    should carry little weight. 55     As we see it, this argument is valid only if\n                    it is viewed solely from the viewpoint of the Appellant’s pleaded case.\n                    That, of course, would be too narrow a perspective. The Respondent’s\n                    defence to the Appellant’s claim for US$175,000 (see sub-para (a) of[5]above) is that following a\n                    negotiation between Seung and Shahid, where the Respondent was present, Seung\n                    agreed to pay US$175,000 to Shahid for the latter’s services. As for the\n                    Appellant’s claim for US$101,982.37 (see sub-para (b) of[5]above), the Respondent’s position is that\n                    the payment of this sum to Son was agreed on at a discussion between Seung and\n                    the Respondent, where Shahid and Gahir were present. In the light of this\n                    defence, the evidence of Shahid and Gahir becomes very important. The issue of\n                    the scope of the Respondent’s authority cannot be regarded as just an\n                    internal matter between the Appellant and the Respondent. Shahid can provide\n                    evidence on the services that he rendered to SJM, which evidence might show that\n                    the payment of US$175,000 to him was justified. Shahid can also testify on how\n                    the letter of 27 August 2007 from the Respondent (written on behalf of SJM)\n                    to him confirming payment of US$175,000 for “services …\n                        received”[note: 15]came into being. Further,\n                    Shahid and Gahir can provide evidence on Seung’s alleged agreement with\n                    the Respondent to pay Son the sum of US$101,982.37. We also note that although\n                    Gahir is apparently the brother-in-law of Shahid, the Judge found no reason to\n                    suspect that these two Maldivian witnesses were contrived by the Respondent to\n                    support the Stay Application (see the GD at [38]). 56     The fact that an important witness is only\n                    available and compellable in a particular jurisdiction is a significant\n                    consideration which can tilt the balance in favour of that jurisdiction (seePeters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian[2006] 2 SLR(R) 381). In this regard, the Respondent’s Maldivian\n                    law expert said that witnesses in the Maldives were compellable to testify in a\n                    civil action there, whereas the Appellant’s Maldivian law expert appeared\n                    to take the view that witnesses in the Maldives were not thus compellable. The\n                    Appellant’s Maldivian law expert added, however, that the Maldivian courts\n                    could assist in the taking of evidence (via video link) ofwillingwitnesses in the Maldives for use in foreign proceedings\n                    (see the GD at [39]). It is unclear whether a witness in the Maldives who isunwillingto testify in a foreign action can\n                    be compelled to give evidence by video link for the purposes of the foreign\n                    action. Even assuming that there are no legal provisions in the Maldives to that\n                    effect and also no legal provisions to compel an unwilling witness to testify in\n                    a civil matter instituted in the Maldivian courts, presumably, greater pressure\n                    can be brought to bear on such a witness to testify if his evidence is required\n                    in relation to an action in the Maldives as opposed to a foreign action. To that\n                    extent, the availability of allegedly material witnesses in the Maldives favours\n                    that jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum for the trial of the\n                    Dispute. (2)   Governing law of the Dispute 57     We now turn to the second connecting factor\n                    singled out by the Appellant before this court,viz, the governing law of the Dispute. That the governing law of\n                    a dispute is a relevant factor in determining which jurisdiction the dispute has\n                    the closest connection with was reiterated and explained by this court inCIMB Bankat [63] as follows: The reason why, in the consideration of the question of forum non\n                        conveniens, the issue of applicable law [ie,\n                        governing law] is a relevant factor is because where a dispute is governed\n                        by a foreign law,the forum will be less adept in\n                            applying that law than the courts of the country of that law, and there\n                            could be savings in time and resources in litigating the dispute in the\n                            forum of the applicable law. [emphasis added] 58     The Appellant submits that the governing law\n                    of the Dispute (which basically centres on the issue of the Respondent’s\n                    authority and the issue of whether the Respondent committed the tort of\n                    conspiracy against the Appellant)[note: 16]is a neutral connecting factor because, in so far as these two issues are\n                    concerned, there is no difference between thecontentof Singapore law and that of Maldivian law.\n                    Specifically, the Appellant contends that:[note: 17] … [W]hether or not the Respondent acted in breach of his authority,\n                        the law would remain the same, whether in Singapore or in the Maldives\n                        … … The wrong would remain a wrong, whether in the Maldives or in\n                        Singapore. As such, the Judge’s view subscribing to the applicability\n                        of Maldivian law as the governing law is incorrect. 59     InDicey, Morris and\n                        Collins on The Conflict of Laws(Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet\n                    & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“Dicey”) at vol 1, para 12-029, the following\n                    proposition is stated: If the legal issues are straightforward, orif the\n                            competing fora have domestic laws which are substantially\n                            similar, the identity of the governing law will be a factor\n                        of rather little significance. [emphasis added] This proposition was cited with approval by this court inCIMB Bankat [61]. 60     In the present case, there is no doubt that\n                    the Respondent’s alleged breaches of the Employment Contract occurred in\n                    the Maldives. Also, the alleged tort of conspiracy was committed there. Clearly,\n                    the alleged breaches of contract as well as the alleged tort of conspiracy would\n                    be governed by the law of the Maldives. In our view, the Appellant has failed to\n                    show that Maldivian law on breach of contract and the tort of conspiracy is the\n                    same as the corresponding areas of Singapore law. The Applicant has consequently\n                    failed to show that the circumstances of the present case warrant the\n                    application of the proposition expounded at vol 1, para 12-029 ofDicey. It must be borne in mind that inCIMB Bank, this court held that the governing\n                    law was not a factor of much significance because the court accepted that the\n                    Singapore courts would be able to apply the competing forum’s law (if it\n                    were indeed the relevant governing law) “without the aid of foreign\n                    experts” (at [63]) since that law was English law. In contrast, it is\n                    highly questionable whether the same can be said in the present case, given that\n                    there already seems to be a sharp divergence of opinion between the respective\n                    parties’ expert witnesses on several aspects of Maldivian law and the\n                    Maldivian legal system even at this interlocutory stage (see the GD at [39] and\n                    [44]). Hence, it cannot be said that the Singapore courts would be able (if the\n                    Singapore Action were allowed to proceed here) to apply Maldivian law without\n                    the aid of any experts on that system of law. On this factor, we agree with the\n                    Judge that the governing law of the Dispute also favours the Maldives as the\n                    more appropriate forum. 61     In the result, under the first stage of theSpiliadatest, we affirm the Judge’s\n                    finding that the connecting factors show that the Maldives would be the more\n                    appropriate forum for the trial of the Dispute. The one single link which the\n                    Dispute has with Singapore, as far as we can see, is the fact that the\n                    Respondent was apparently employed by the Appellant – a Singapore company\n                    – and seconded by it to work for SJM in the Maldives. The second stage of theSpiliadatest 62     Turning to the second stage of theSpiliadatest, the Appellant alludes to the fact that in\n                    the Maldivian profit suit mentioned at[7]above, which has already been concluded, the Civil Court of the Maldives, in\n                    holding that the Respondent’s employer was SJM and not the Appellant,\n                    considered documents issued in the Maldives to the exclusion of documents issued\n                    in Singapore (see the GD at [31]). In view of this, the Appellant argues that\n                    substantial justice cannot be done if it is compelled to initiate proceedings\n                    against the Respondent in the Maldives because the Maldivian courts are likely\n                    to adopt the same approach as that taken in the Maldivian profit\n                suit. 63     With respect, the Appellant, in raising this\n                    argument, is traversing old grounds which have already been sufficiently dealt\n                    with by the Judge. Suffice it to restate that the Judge held that there would be\n                    no unfair prejudice to the Appellant if it were to litigate the Dispute in the\n                    Maldives since “[the Appellant] was not yet a party to proceedings in the\n                    Maldives and it would be open to another Maldivian court to take a different\n                    view [on the identity of the Respondent’s employer]” (see the GD at\n                    [48]). Both of the Maldivian law experts called by the Appellant have not\n                    expressed any views to the contrary. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest\n                    that the Appellant cannot tender the documents issued in Singapore in\n                    proceedings before the Maldivian courts. 64     In the circumstances, we hold that the Judge\n                    is correct in concluding,vis-à-visthe second\n                    stage of theSpiliadatest, that the Appellant has\n                    not shown that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that\n                    a stay of the Singapore Action be denied even though the application of the\n                    first stage of theSpiliadatest points to the\n                    Maldives as the more appropriate forum for the trial of the\n                Dispute.",
        "Conclusion": "65     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the\n                    Judge’s decision to order a stay of the Singapore Action on the ground offorum non conveniens. Accordingly, we dismiss\n                    the present appeal with costs and the usual consequential orders.
