        "The Background": "2       The Appellant is a joint venture company\n                    incorporated in Singapore. The Respondent is a statutory board established\n                    pursuant to the Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore Act (Cap\n                    137A, 2000 Rev Ed). 3       By way of Originating Summons No 1099 of 2011/V,\n                    the Appellant filed an application under O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,\n                    Rev Ed 2006) (“ROC”) for leave from the High Court to commence\n                    judicial review of a decision made by the Respondent that both a business trust\n                    by the name of NetLink Trust and its trustee-manager CityNet Infrastructure\n                    Management Pte Ltd had fulfilled the requirements set out in a deed of\n                    undertaking furnished by Singapore Telecommunications Limited to the\n                    Respondent. 4       The Appellant’s application for leave to\n                    commence judicial review was heard on 17 January 2012, 21 February 2012, 2 March\n                    2012 and 19 April 2012. On 7 June 2012, the Appellant’s leave application\n                    was dismissed. On 6 July 2012, the Appellant filed a notice of appeal against\n                    the High Court’s refusal to grant leave to commence judicial\n                    review. 5       On 23 July 2012, the Respondent filed the\n                    present application for an order that the Appellant’s notice of appeal be\n                    struck out on the ground that the Appellant had not obtained leave to appeal as\n                    required under s 34(2)(d), read with the Fifth Schedule, of the\n                SCJA.",
        "Issue": "6       The sole issue which we had to decide was\n                    whether the Appellant was required to apply for leave to appeal from the High\n                    Court in order to file the notice of appeal against the Judge’s refusal to\n                    grant leave to commence judicial review.",
        "The legislative framework": "7       Before examining the arguments made by the\n                    parties, it may be helpful to lay out the legislative framework for appeals on\n                    civil matters. As held by this court inBlenwel Agencies Pte\n                        Ltd v Tan Lee King[2008] 2 SLR(R) 529 (“Blenwel”), “[t]he Court of Appeal is a\n                    creature of statute and, hence, is only seised of the jurisdiction that has been\n                    conferred upon it by the relevant provisions in the legislation creating\n                    it”. Therefore, as a starting point, we refer to s 29A of the SCJA, which\n                    provides that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over appeals from “any\n                    judgment or order of the High Court in any civil cause or matter”,\n                    subject to the provisions of the SCJA or “any other written law\n                    regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be\n                    brought”: Jurisdiction of Court of\n                            Appeal 29A.—(1) The civil jurisdiction\n                        of the Court of Appeal shall consist of appeals from any judgment or order\n                        of the High Court in any civil cause or matter whether made in the exercise\n                        of its original or of its appellate jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to\n                        the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and\n                        conditions upon which such appeals may be brought. ... 8       Section 34(1) of the SCJA sets out the matters\n                    which are non-appealable, while s 34(2) sets out the matters which are\n                    appealable only with leave: Matters that are non-appealable or\n                            appealable only with leave 34.—(1) No appeal shall be brought to the\n                        Court of Appeal in any of the following cases: (a)    where a Judge makes an order specified in the\n                                Fourth Schedule, except in such circumstances as may be specified in\n                                that Schedule; (b)    [Deleted by Act 30/2010 wef\n                            01/01/2011] (c)    [Deleted by Act 30/2010 wef\n                            01/01/2011] (d)    where the judgment or order is made by consent\n                                of the parties; or (e)    where, by any written law for the time being\n                                in force, the judgment or order of the High Court is expressly\n                                declared to be final. (2)    Except with the\n                            leave of a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in\n                            any of the following cases: (a)    where the amount in dispute, or the value of\n                                the subject-matter, at the hearing before the High Court (excluding\n                                interest and costs) does not exceed $250,000 or such other amount as\n                                may be specified by an order made under subsection\n                            (3); (b)    where the only issue in the appeal relates to\n                                costs or fees for hearing dates; (c)    where a Judge in chambers makes a decision in\n                                a summary way on an interpleader summons where the facts are not in\n                                dispute; (d)where a Judge makes an order specified in the Fifth\n                                    Schedule, except in such circumstances as may be specified in\n                                    that Schedule; or (e)    where the High Court makes an order in the\n                                exercise of its appellate jurisdiction with respect to any\n                                proceedings under the Adoption of Children Act (Cap. 4) or under\n                                Part VII, VIII or IX of the Women’s Charter (Cap.\n                            353). [emphasis added] 9       In addition to listing the matters that are only\n                    appealable to the Court of Appeal with leave, s 34(2)(d) of the SCJA further\n                    refers to the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA, which lists the orders made by a Judge\n                    that are only appealable to the Court of Appeal with leave of a Judge: ORDERS MADE BY JUDGE THAT ARE APPEALABLE ONLY WITH\n                        LEAVE Except with the leave of a Judge, no appeal shall\n                        be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following cases: (a)    where a Judge makes an order refusing\n                                leave to amend a pleading, except if — (i)    the application for such leave is made\n                                    after the expiry of any relevant period of limitation current at\n                                    the date of issue of the writ of summons; and (ii)   the amendment is an amendment to correct\n                                    the name of a party or to alter the capacity in which a party\n                                    sues, or the effect of the amendment will be to add or\n                                    substitute a new cause of action; (b)    where a Judge makes an order giving\n                                security for costs; (c)    where a Judge makes an order giving\n                                or refusing discovery or inspection of\n                                    documents; (d)    where a Judge makes an order\n                                refusing a stay of proceedings; (e)where a\n                                    Judge makes an order at the hearing of any interlocutory\n                                    application other than an application for any of the following\n                                    matters: (i)    for summary judgment; (ii)   to set aside a default\n                                judgment; (iii)   to strike out an action or a matter\n                                    commenced by a writ of summons or by any other originating\n                                    process, a pleading or a part of a pleading; (iv)   to dismiss an action or a matter\n                                    commenced by a writ of summons or by any other originating\n                                    process; (v)    for further and better\n                                particulars; (vi)   for leave to amend a\n                                pleading; (vii)  for security for costs; (viii)  for discovery or inspection of\n                                    documents; (ix)   for interrogatories to be varied or\n                                    withdrawn, or for leave to serve interrogatories; (x)    for a stay of proceedings.

        "Our Analysis": "10     The Respondent made three arguments as to why\n                    the Appellant was required to apply for leave to appeal from the High Court in\n                    order to file an appeal against the Judge’s refusal to grant leave to\n                    commence judicial review. We shall examine each of these three arguments,\n                    starting with the second argument. We shall also examine one of the\n                    Appellant’s arguments.",
        "The Respondent’s second argument": "11     The Respondent’s second argument was\n                    that leave to appeal was required because the Appellant’s application for\n                    leave to commence judicial review was an “interlocutory\n                    application” within the meaning of paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of\n                    the SCJA. Paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA is a catch-all\n                    provision which prescribes a blanket requirement of leave to appeal against\n                    orders made in all “interlocutory application[s]” which are not\n                    specifically exempted from the requirement for leave. The Respondent argued that\n                    the Appellant’s application for leave to commence judicial review was an\n                    “interlocutory application” because, being an application for\n                    leave, it was simply a preliminary step to the substantive application for\n                    judicial review. Moreover, an application for leave to commence judicial review\n                    is “interlocutory” because the application must be made by anex parteoriginating summons,ie, where a respondent may not even be heard on the\n                    application. 12     Furthermore, the Respondent argued that the\n                    Appellant itself had proceeded on the basis that its application for leave to\n                    commence judicial review was an interlocutory proceeding because all of its\n                    affidavits in support of the application for leave stated that they contained\n                    statements of information or belief. Order 41 r 5 of the ROC provides that\n                    “[a]n affidavit sworn for the purpose of being used in interlocutory\n                    proceedings may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and\n                    grounds thereof”. Therefore, the Appellant’s reliance on hearsay\n                    evidence is consistent with the Respondent’s contention that the\n                    Appellant’s application was an “interlocutory\n                    application”.",
        "Our decision": "31     While we see the drift of this argument, the\n                    fact remains that the decision of the Judge to refuse leave would bring to an\n                    end the Appellant’s attempt to challenge the decision of the Respondent.\n                    Unless it is shown that the right of a party to appeal against a decision of the\n                    High Court is statutorily curtailed, that party would be entitled to appeal to\n                    the Court of Appeal. 32     As we have stated at [21] above, the\n                    Appellant’s application for leave to commence judicial review under O 53\n                    is not an “interlocutory application” under paragraph (e) of the\n                    Fifth Schedule of the SCJA, and the Appellant did not have to seek leave to\n                    appeal from the High Court Judge before appealing to the Court of Appeal. The\n                    policy reason cited by the Respondent is only relevant in so far as it could\n                    assist in arriving at a purposive interpretation of the relevant provisions. In\n                    view of the clear purpose underlying the relevant provisions in the SCJA, this\n                    policy reason advanced by the respondent carries little weight.",
        "The Respondent’s first argument": "22     The Respondent’s first argument was that\n                    leave to appeal was required pursuant to O 53 r 8 of the ROC (“O 53 r\n                    8”) which reads as follows: Appeal to Court of Appeal (O. 53,\n                            r. 8) An appeal shall lie from an order made by a Judge in Chambers under this\n                        Order as it does in the case of an interlocutory order. 23     According to the Respondent, O 53 r 8 requires\n                    that an appeal against a Judge’s order in an application for leave to\n                    commence judicial review has to be made in the same manner as an appeal against\n                    an interlocutory order of a Judge made in other proceedings. The manner in which\n                    an appeal against an interlocutory order is to be made is specified by s\n                    34(2)(d), read with paragraph (e) of the Fifth Schedule, of the SCJA, which\n                    provide a blanket requirement of leave for all “order[s] at the hearing\n                    of any interlocutory application” which are not specifically exempted\n                    from the requirement for leave. Therefore, the Appellant here was required to\n                    apply for leave from the High Court to appeal against the Judge’s refusal\n                    to grant leave to commence judicial review. 24     Furthermore, the Respondent argued that if\n                    “interlocutory application” under paragraph (e) of the Fifth\n                    Schedule of the SCJA does not include an application for leave to commence\n                    judicial review by way of an OS, O 53 r 8 would be rendered nugatory and otiose.\n                    The fact that O 53 r 8 was retained and renumbered after the amendments to s 34\n                    of the SCJA were enacted shows that the requirement for leave to appeal was\n                    applicable to the orders made under O 53. If this were not the case, there would\n                    have been no reason to retain O 53 r 8.",
        "The Respondent’s third argument": "30     The Respondent’s third argument is that\n                    there are compelling reasons why leave is required in order to appeal against a\n                    refusal by a judge to grant leave to commence judicial review. An application\n                    for leave to commence judicial review is refused because the applicant has\n                    failed to pass the low threshold of showing an “arguable or prima facie\n                    case of reasonable suspicion”, or that there are serious flaws with the\n                    application. If the applicant could not even satisfy such a low threshold, then\n                    such an application should not be allowed to invoke the Court of Appeal’s\n                    jurisdiction as of right. Otherwise, that would defeat the key purpose of the\n                    application for leave to commence judicial review, which is to prevent a\n                    wasteful use of judicial time.",
        "Analysis of the Appellant’s argument": "33     There remains just one of the\n                    Appellant’s arguments which we would like to touch on briefly, even though\n                    it would not affect the decision which we had made in this case. The argument is\n                    that no leave of court is required to appeal against the Judge’s order\n                    refusing leave to commence judicial proceedings because the order in question\n                    falls within the exception in paragraph (e)(iv) of the Fifth Schedule of the\n                    SCJA. According to the Appellant, paragraph (e)(iv) stipulates that leave is not\n                    required where the order made was to dismiss an action or a matter commenced by\n                    writ of summons or by any other originating process. 34     Paragraph e)(iv) of the Fifth Schedule of the\n                    SCJA provides as follows: Except with the leave of a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court\n                        of Appeal in any of the following cases: (e)    where a Judge makes\n                            an order at the hearing of any interlocutory application other than an\n                            application for any of the following matters: (iv)   to dismiss an action or a matter commenced by\n                                a writ of summons or by any other originating process; 35     On the face of it, we can see the sense of the\n                    argument here – that since the Judge dismissed the appellant’s\n                    application for leave to commence judicial review, and the application for leave\n                    to commence judicial review was initiated by an originating summons, the present\n                    case should fall within the exception in paragraph (e)(iv), and no leave of\n                    court is required. 36     However, we agree with the Respondent’s\n                    contention that this argument is flawed. Paragraph (e)(iv) only applies where a\n                    judge makes an order pursuant to anapplication to dismiss an\n                        action or a mattercommenced by writ of summons or by any other\n                    originating process. There are two essential prerequisites. First, there must be\n                    an application by the opposing party. Second, that application must be to ask\n                    the court to dismiss the action or matter claimed in the writ of summons or any\n                    other originating process. The present case satisfied none of these two\n                    prerequisites. Accordingly, we could not accept the argument that paragraph\n                    (e)(iv) applied here.",
        "Conclusion": "37     For the above reasons, we dismissed Summons No\n                    3702 of 2012/Y, and ordered that costs be in the appeal."
