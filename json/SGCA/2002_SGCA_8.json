        "Background": "2.    The facts giving rise to these proceedings may be briefly stated\n\nas follows. The plaintiff-respondents (\"Astra\") are an Indonesian finance\n\ncompany. The defendant-appellants are the owners of a barge \"POE 2410\" and a tug\n\n\"Pioneer Glory\" (\"the barge and/or tug\").3.    The equipment was sold to Astra by another Indonesian company\n\ncalled PT United Tractors (UT). At the time of the sale, UT also entered into two\n\nrepurchase agreements with Astra for the former to repurchase the equipment from the\n\nlatter at agreed prices in accordance with a formula. To finance the purchase from UT,\n\nAstra obtained a loan from a related party. The bona fides of this loan are not in\n\nquestion. Astra then leased out the equipment to a third Indonesian company, PT DML\n\nResources (DML) to work at a mining project in Kalimantan, pursuant to a written agreement\n\ndated 17 March 1995 (\"the lease agreement\"). DML was owned by a fourth\n\nIndonesian company, PT Tanito Harum (Tanito).4.    Upon completion of the project, Astra arranged for the equipment\n\nto be exported out of Indonesia. Astra hoped to find buyers in Singapore who would pay a\n\nbetter price for the equipment than what UT agreed to pay under the repurchase agreements.\n\nEach of the fourteen pieces of equipment was shipped under a separate bill of lading on\n\nboard the barge, which was towed by the tug.5.    The equipment arrived in Singapore on 3 December 1997. But neither\n\nAstra, nor their agents, could obtain delivery of the equipment because the appellants\n\nclaimed to have a lien on the equipment on the ground that the charterers of the barge and\n\ntug (Nakhoda Bestari Sdn Bhd) owed them charter freight of $177,597.6.    On 31 January 1998, as all attempts to seek delivery of the\n\nequipment failed, the present two admiralty actions were instituted by Astra. On 18 March\n\n1998, the High Court made an interim order releasing the equipment to Astra. However, the\n\ndiscussions between the parties to arrange for the discharge took some time before actual\n\ndischarge could take place.7.    The substantive question as to the alleged wrongful detention of\n\nthe equipment came up before Warren Khoo J on 9 April 1998 whereupon he ordered that the\n\ntwo actions be consolidated. After hearing arguments, he also declared that the detention\n\nwas wrongful and the owners of the barge and tug (the owners) were ordered to pay damages\n\nto Astra to be assessed (\"9 April 1998 order\"). Costs of the action were awarded\n\nto Astra. Khoo J was of the view that the equipment should have been discharged on 26\n\nDecember 1997. It was only after the 9 April 1998 order was made that the parties managed\n\nto finalise arrangements for the discharge of the equipment. So actual discharge only\n\ncommenced on 20 April 1998 and it was completed on 22 April 1998.8.    The assessment of damages was carried out before the Assistant\n\nRegistrar, where the following items of claim were made by Astra.(a)cancellation fees (for permit to discharge)S$ 600.00(b)extension of insurance policy for period of detentionUS$4,724.68(c)insurance for dischargeS$ 750.00(d)survey fees (of Insight Marine Services Pte Ltd)S$4,124.00(e)transportation costs (air-fair of Lewerissa)US$ 278.66(f)accommodation costs (of Lewerissa)S$ 212.00(g)damages (fall in value of equipment)US$476,250.00(h)or, fall in repurchase priceUS$617,150.00(i)additional interest paid on loanUS$187,360.38(j)interest on judgment sum(k)costs pursuant to Order of Court dated 9 April 19989.    At the close of the assessment proceedings, only three items\n\nremained in controversy, namely, (g), (h) and (i). Of course, items (g) and (h) were in\n\nthe alternative. The Assistant Registrar awarded only US$158,750 in respect of item (g),\n\nwith pre-judgment interest at 3% from 31 Jan 1998 to the date of assessment. She also\n\nawarded the sum of US$187,360.38 in respect of item (i) and here too she granted interest\n\nat 3% on the sum from 19 February 1999 to the date of assessment.10.    Astra appealed to the High Court against the award of the\n\nAssistant Registrar in two areas: (i) in respect of item (g), Astra contended that the\n\nfull sum claimed should have been given; (ii) in respect of the rate of pre-judgment\n\ninterest awarded, Astra said it should have been 6% instead of 3%.11.    On the other hand, the owners of the barge and tug appealed\n\nagainst the awards given in respect of items (g) and (i).12.    The appeal came before Lai Siu Chiu J who dismissed the\n\nowners’ appeal and allowed Astra’s appeal by enhancing the award for item (g) to\n\nUS$381,000. She also increased the rate for pre-judgment interest to 6% but deferred the\n\ncommencement date for calculating that interest by 4 months.13.    The appellants filed a notice of appeal against the decision of\n\nLai J in respect of items (g) and (i), as well as the rate for pre-judgment interest.\n\nHowever, in the appellants’ Case, they withdrew their appeal on the issue of\n\npre-judgment interest. Therefore, there are only two issues which are now before this\n\nCourt:-(i) whether Astra are entitled to damages for the fall in value of the\n\n  equipment which was assessed to be US$381,000;(ii) whether Astra are entitled to damages for the additional interest\n\n  it incurred on account of the loan by reason of the wrongful detention of the equipment.14.    In the meantime, on 13 May 1998, seeing that the equipment could\n\nnot be successfully sold off to third parties, Astra exercised its option under the\n\nrepurchase agreements requiring UT to repurchase the equipment. Based on the formula set\n\nout in the repurchase agreements, Astra had originally asked that UT pay US$3,317,150. UT,\n\nhowever, relying on the ground, inter alia, that the condition of the equipment had\n\ndeteriorated during the period of detention, demanded that the price be revised downwards\n\nand it was agreed at US$2.9 million. UT made three instalment payments totalling US$1.2\n\nmillion before they made known to Astra that they could not pay further because of their\n\ndebt position. They asked that the price be further revised to US$2.7 million and\n\nindicated that they would pay the balance in one sum. Astra eventually agreed and UT paid\n\nin full on or about 19 February 1999.",
        "Fall in value": "15.    In view of the wrongful detention of the equipment, there can be\n\nno doubt that the appellants are liable to pay for all reasonable losses proven to have\n\nbeen suffered by Astra on account thereof. We shall now examine the two issues in turn.\n\nFirst is the question of the fall in value, which is the main issue.16.    At the outset, it would be useful to note the state of the\n\nequipment at the time of their discharge. This was an aspect of the evidence greatly\n\nemphasised by the owners to contend that the detention did not cause any significant\n\ndamage, which was their main plank of defence. Their valuers, Victor Morris, who inspected\n\nthe equipment on 15 April 1998, stated that the overall physical condition of the\n\nequipment was \"good and satisfactory\", with the exception of a few tyre\n\ndeflations in two dump trucks, which were subsequently rectified by the owners.17.    The owners’ surveyors, Marine Management Surveyors and\n\nServices Pte Ltd had also inspected the equipment, immediately before their discharge from\n\nthe barge on 20-22 April 1998, and found some ‘old marks’ on them which they\n\nconsidered to be ‘pre-shipment damage/defect’. However, with respect to one\n\nexcavator, one bulldozer, and one dump truck, they were damaged during discharge due to\n\n\"the driver’s negligence and inadvertent accident.\"18.    Even Astra’s surveyors, Insight Marine Services Pte Ltd, who\n\ninspected the equipment on 20-22 April 1998, only found the following items were possibly\n\naffected by the long delay in discharging the cargo and/or by their exposure to the\n\nelements during the period of delay:(i) Two batteries on the dump truck s/n 4337 and Bulldozer s/n 10376\n\n  were flat;(ii) some rust on the dumper of the dump trucks due to water collected\n\n  on the dumpers over a period of time;(iii) One dump truck (s/n 4347) rear brakes were faulty and the system\n\n  had to be purged of air;(iv) Windscreen of wheel loader s/n 10107 was cracked (not certain at\n\n  which phase this damage occurred).19.    But that was not the basis of Astra’s claim for their loss\n\ndue to the fall in value of the equipment. There was evidence that, at the time of the\n\ndischarge of the equipment, a potential buyer made an offer of US$3.8 million. But\n\napparently upon sight of the equipment the buyer lost interest. Furthermore, during the\n\nperiod of detention, there were also other potential buyers. They came to view the\n\nequipment but as they could not test-drive them, their interest fizzled out.20.    Therefore, on 13 May 1998, Astra gave notice to UT to repurchase\n\nthe equipment. It was only on 2 July 1998 that UT replied stating that it would not\n\nrepurchase because the lessee in Indonesia, DML, had failed to properly maintain the\n\nequipment and the equipment had deteriorated further due to their exposure to a corrosive\n\nenvironment during the period of detention.21.    We may add here that some ten days later, UT inspected the\n\nequipment and found that only minimal or insignificant damage of avisual naturewas caused to the equipment by the owners’ detention.22.    Some five months after the discharge, Astra engaged Henry Butcher\n\nPlant & Machinery Sdn Bhd (\"Henry Butcher\"), international plant and\n\nmachinery consultants, to produce a valuation report. Henry Butcher inspected the\n\nequipment on 22 October 1998 and their valuation report was available only on 26 February\n\n1999. Henry Butcher was asked to ascertain, on a fair market basis, the value of the\n\nequipment on 9 December 1997, the date around which the equipment would have been\n\ndischarged from the barge had it not been detained, and on 20 April 1998, the date of\n\ncommencement of the discharge of the equipment.23.    Mr John Rounce, a director of Henry Butcher, told the court that\n\nthey were not asked to assess whether the equipment was damaged during the period of\n\ndetention but only to assess \"the fall in value of the equipment over the period of\n\ndetention, based on the time factor alone, as all equipment of this nature depreciates\n\nwith time, even if all other factors remained consistent.\" In his opinion, under\n\nnormal market conditions, such an equipment in question would have fallen by about 15.9%\n\nper annum, and this in turn meant that the fall for the period in question would be about\n\n6%. But he explained that as during the period in question, there was a general\n\nover-supply in the world market of such equipment, caused by the economic downturn in\n\nAsia, the drop in value during the period was sharper. After giving an account of his\n\nmethod of valuation, Mr Rounce valued the equipment to be US$3,175,000 at the commencement\n\nof the detention. Furthermore, based on actual sales figures of similar equipment from the\n\n\"Last Bid\", an American publication which listed auction prices achieved at\n\nmajor auctions held world-wide, he determined that the value of the equipment in question\n\nhad depreciated by approximately 10% to 25% over the period of the detention. In this\n\nregard, he consulted colleagues in US and UK before concluding that the actual fall in\n\nvalue for the equipment in question during the period of detention was probably around\n\n15%. This meant a fall in value of US$476,250 (i.e., 15% of US$3,175,000).24.    The evidence of Mr Rounce formed the foundation for Astra’s\n\nclaim for the fall in value during the period of detention",
        "Defence case": "25.    The owners emphasised the fact that prior to the shipment of the\n\nequipment to Singapore, the equipment had been used for a mining and construction project\n\nin Indonesia for a period of about 2 years. Those were intensive uses. They also pointed\n\nout that during the period, from the arrival of the barge in Singapore until the actual\n\ndischarge of the equipment, they gave Astra and potential buyers access to the equipment.\n\nHere, we must hasten to add that the point is without merit, as the Assistant Registrar\n\nfound on the evidence that no proper access was given to Astra.26.    The owners considerably highlighted the fact that during the\n\nperiod of detention, no significant damage was caused to the equipment.27.    The third point taken by the owners was that Astra should have\n\ninsisted that UT fulfilled their commitment to repurchase at $3,317,150. Instead of doing\n\nthat, Astra eventually agreed to relieve UT of their obligations and lower the price to\n\n$2.7 million and now seeks to foist their loss onto the appellants.28.    Accordingly, the owners submitted that it was not shown that the\n\ndetention in fact caused damage to the equipment, and thus loss to Astra. In the absence\n\nof proof of loss, Astra should only be entitled to nominal damages.",
        "Decision below": "29.    The Assistant Registrar did not accept the submission of the\n\nowners but she nevertheless decided that the fall in value estimated at 15% was too steep.\n\nShe felt it was probably only 5%. She was of the view that a period of five months was not\n\na considerable period and in any case, for that period the equipment had remained idle. It\n\nwas not used daily such as to cause rapid depreciation in value.30.    As mentioned above, Lai J enhanced the percentage of the fall in\n\nvalue to 12% as she felt that the Assistant Registrar had not taken into account the fact\n\nthat the economies of this region were taking a dive at the time.",
        "Arguments before us": "31.    Before us, the owners reiterated the point made below that\n\nwhatever damages sustained by the equipment were sustained when the equipment were being\n\nused by DML for heavy duty work in Indonesia during the period of 2 years of lease.\n\nWhatever additional damage that arose during the period of unlawful detention was quite\n\ninsignificant, like some additional rust and some batteries going flat which were\n\nreplaced. The amount of damages awarded for the tort should really be nominal.32.    The owners also contended that if Astra should be entitled to\n\nclaim damages for any loss, it should direct the claim to UT, who contracted to repurchase\n\nthe equipment at the price of US$3,317.150 but failed to fulfil that commitment. This\n\nprice was higher than the value which Mr Rounce placed on the equipment at the\n\ncommencement of the detention. Instead Astra agreed to let UT have the equipment at a much\n\nlower price of $2.7 million. If Astra had insisted on UT fulfilling their commitment,\n\nAstra would have suffered no loss.",
        "Our decision": "33.    On this issue, it seems to us that the owners have missed the\n\npoint raised by Astra. Astra were not alleging that during the period of unlawful\n\ndetention, substantial physical damage was caused to the equipment. Their claim was based\n\nwholly on the fall in value on account of the lapse of time during the period of the\n\nunlawful detention. The amount claimed represented the depreciation of the market value of\n\nthe equipment during the said period. Such a depreciation had nothing to do with physical\n\ndamage. It was based purely on age, in the light of market demand.34.    To put it simply, Astra’s case was that the owners detained\n\nthe equipment and as a result, Astra were not able to sell them. During that period, there\n\nwas a sharp fall in the value of the equipment due to the economic crisis which was then\n\nsweeping through the region. That was a known fact which the courts were entitled to take\n\njudicial notice of.35.    The basic principle for the measure of damages in tort is that\n\nthere should berestitutio in integram. In the words of Lord Blackburn inLivingstone\n\nv Rawyards Coal Co(1880) 5 App Cas 25 at 39:-\"where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the\n\n  sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should as nearly as possible get at\n\n  that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in\n\n  the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he\n\n  is now getting his compensation or reparation.\"36.    Where a thing is wrongfully detained, the mere return of the\n\nthing would not be sufficient compensation if there is a fall in value between the date on\n\nwhich the unlawful detention takes place and the date of its release and there was an\n\nintention on the part of the plaintiff to sell the thing. In the present case, such an\n\nintention is not in dispute. That the law allows such a claim based on a fall in value can\n\nbe seen from the following passage inMcGregor on Damages (13thEdn)at\n\n1036:-If the market falls between the time that the defendant is in default\n\n  and the time of judgment, then the market value is still given at the date of judgment,\n\n  but the difference between the market value at these two dates can be awarded to the\n\n  plaintiff as part of the damages for detention. The authority for this proposition isWilliams\n\n  v Archer(1847) 4 CB 318, an action of detinue for scrip certificates, the market\n\n  value of which had fallen between the time the plaintiff demanded them from the defendant,\n\n  and the time the defendant handed them over to the plaintiff. The amount by which the\n\n  market had fallen in this period was awarded as damages for detention.37.    As rightly noted by Lai J below,William v Archerwas\n\nconcerned with an action in detinue, a tort which was abolished in England by the Torts\n\n(Interference with Goods) Act 1977. The reason for that abolition was because the tort of\n\nconversion had expanded in scope to cover almost every case of a claim in detinue,\n\nresulting in the latter action becoming largely redundant. However, in Singapore there is\n\nno similar Act to abolish the tort of detinue. Of course, in the present case nothing\n\nturned on the distinction between the two torts.38.    The owners did not adduce any evidence regarding this aspect of\n\nAstra’s claim. The Assistant Registrar and the judge below had before them the\n\nevidence of Mr Rounce and nothing else. There was no rebuttal or contrary evidence.39.    With regard to the owner’s argument that the equipment were\n\nheavily utilised when they were being leased to DML and therefore their value might not be\n\nwhat Mr Rounce estimated, the fact remained that there was no other evidence of what the\n\ncorrect market value of the equipment would be at the commencement of the unlawful\n\ndetention. Two further points may be made here. First, it would appear that the equipment\n\nwere used by DML for the purposes for which they were manufactured. There is no evidence\n\nthat they were used for any unintended purposes or that they were badly damaged at the\n\ntime of their shipment to Singapore. Second, and more importantly, the owners’\n\nvaluers who inspected the equipment before their discharge, stated that their condition\n\nwas good and satisfactory. That being the position, we do not see how the owners can be\n\nheard to argue that the condition of the equipment was so bad that the valuation given to\n\nthe equipment by Rounce would be out of line. The owners cannot be allowed to be selective\n\nin the interpretation of the evidence.40.    Clearly, at the time when the owners decided to detain the\n\nequipment (in early December 1997) Singapore and the countries in the region were at the\n\nthreshold of an economic crisis, which continued well into 1999. No one who was in\n\nbusiness then could have been unaware of that. It is thus not at all surprising that Mr\n\nRounce in his evaluation, after taking into account sales of near comparable equipment,\n\nshould come to the conclusion that during the period of the detention, the value of the\n\nequipment had come down by about 15%. We would reiterate that there was no evidence from\n\nthe owners to counter that view. Merely as illustrations, we would refer to the offer of\n\n$3.8 million which Astra received in April 1998 (though that offer fizzled out) and\n\nanother offer in early September 1998, barely five months later, of only US$1.4 million.\n\nWe note that the potential buyer making the $3.8 million eventually backed out apparently,\n\namong other reasons, because the condition of the equipment was not good. It might well be\n\nthat this reason was just a convenient excuse in a falling market. Even without in any way\n\ntaking these figures as an accurate reflection of the market condition, the difference\n\nbetween the two offers cannot be described otherwise than phenomenal. So a drop of\n\n$476,250 as determined by Rounce, in a period of four and a half months and in a falling\n\nmarket, is certainly not that implausible.41.    On an issue such as this, it is necessary that the court acts\n\nwith the aid of expert witnesses. But it does not follow that the court must accept\n\neverything that an expert witness say. The judge can reject any part of the evidence with\n\nreasons. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the judge below was entitled to\n\nact on the evidence of Mr Rounce. However, instead of accepting the evidence of Mr Rounce\n\nentirely, she decided to be a little more cautious, in case Mr Rounce had erred on the\n\ngenerous side in favour of Astra. Accordingly, she reduced the fall in value of the\n\nequipment to only 12% instead of 15%. We think she was within her rights to do so.42.    It seems to us that, the Assistant Registrar, in reducing the\n\nrate of the fall in value to only 5%, probably did not give sufficient consideration to\n\nthe fact that the region was then going through a crisis and thus the rate of fall was\n\nsharper. It would also appear that she might not have been conscious that the 15%\n\ndepreciation was on the reducing balance basis. This comes out from her comparison of the\n\nfive month period with the average life span of such equipment of 10 years.43.    In this connection we ought to refer to the report of Victor\n\nMorris where they stated that the value of the equipment at mid-April 1998 was US$3.5\n\nmillion to US$4 million. However, Victor Morris did not explain how that valuation was\n\narrived at; nor did they mention what the fall in value was during the period of\n\ndetention.44.    Finally, we come to the point raised by the owners that Astra\n\nshould have held UT to their contractual commitment to repurchase at the agreed price of\n\nUS$3,317,150 and should not have entertained UT’s demands to negotiate the price\n\ndownwards. The following matters must be borne in mind in considering this contention.First, by shipping the equipment to Singapore it was not\n\n  Astra’s intention to exercise their rights under the repurchase agreements to require\n\n  UT to repurchase them. Astra’s object was to sell the equipment in the open market\n\n  for a better price.Second, in view of the unlawful detention, Astra lost the\n\n  opportunity to sell the equipment in the open market and in the light of a falling market,\n\n  Astra had no choice but to exercise their option under the repurchase agreements.Third, the prescribed formula for determining the price at which\n\n  UT should repurchase the equipment was far from clear as it was based on a percentage of\n\n  the original cost, depending on the number of \"lease payments\". Did it mean\n\n  lease payments actually made or lease payments as they fell due. The former would give a\n\n  repurchase price of US$3,317,150 and the latter US$2,995,050. Understandably, in their\n\n  negotiations with UT, Astra took the first interpretation knowing the weakness of that\n\n  position. The second interpretation was more in line with common sense as that meant the\n\n  repurchase price would correspond with the age of the equipment. The first interpretation\n\n  could lead to the absurd result of Astra being liable to pay for a higher price just\n\n  because the lessee defaulted in making payments.Fourth, the detention gave UT a ground to push down the price.\n\n  It was after prolonged negotiations with UT, with market sentiments getting more\n\n  depressed, that an agreement was reached with UT around November 1998 for UT to repurchase\n\n  at US$2.9 million, a figure quite close to the figure of US$2.995.050 million under the\n\n  second interpretation. UT also relied on the ground that the equipment was in a bad state\n\n  due in part to the fact that the equipment was sitting on a vessel at the harbour without\n\n  adequate protection in a corrosive environment and without any maintenance. UT mentioned a\n\n  repair cost of US$832,129 to put things right. The owners’ surveyors, Mr Cheong,\n\n  conceded that in a salt laden environment, rusting would be accelerated. More importantly,\n\n  short of sending the equipment to an appropriate workshop for a good technical inspection,\n\n  non-visual damage would not be known. For example, according to the manufacturer, the\n\n  excavators had to be swiveled at least once a week in order to avoid damage to the ring\n\n  gears. This obviously was not done during the period of detention.Fifth,the sum of US$2.9 million was to be paid in instalments\n\n  and it was after US$1.2 million was paid that UT indicated they could not pay any more\n\n  because of their debt position which was being restructured. UT proposed making one final\n\n  payment of US$1.5 million in full settlement for the equipment. In the circumstances, the\n\n  only practical approach available to Astra was to settle at US$2.7 million, instead of\n\n  holding UT to their commitment at US$2.9 million. Furthermore, as UT’s debt position\n\n  was bad, insisting upon legal rights would probably be unproductive and could amount to\n\n  throwing good money after bad. There was then no offers from any party which was near to\n\n  US$2.7 million. Bearing in mind that it was then a falling market, and UT were then\n\n  encountering financial problem and there were no takers in the open market, one could\n\n  hardly fault Astra for having agreed to a further reduction of US$200,000. Time was not on\n\n  Astra’s side. Any further delay would only mean that the equipment would fetch even\n\n  less.45.    In our judgment, Astra had done everything reasonable in order to\n\nmitigate their losses by disposing of the equipment at the best achievable price. We\n\naccept the following submission of Astra as to why it would not be prudent to take a\n\nwholly legal stand against UT:-\"It would have been ludicrous and commercially unsound for the\n\n  respondents to have gone to extremities to pursue and exert their strict legal rights\n\n  under the Repurchase Agreement in Indonesia as suggested by the Appellants in their\n\n  Appellants’ Case, when the outcome of any such action against UT would be\n\n  unpredictable, more costs would have been incurred and more time would have been wasted in\n\n  such litigation, and there was no guarantee that UT could pay even if the court should\n\n  take the view that UT were bound to pay a higher repurchase price.\"46.    Before we leave the issue, we would like to refer to three cases\n\ncited by the owners to contend that Astra should only be entitled to an award of nominal\n\ndamages:Brandeis Goldschmidt & Co Ltd v Western Transportation Ltd[1981] 1 QB\n\n864,Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v Comtech IT Pte Ltd[1998] 3 SLR 502andWilliams v The Peel River Land & Mineral Co Ltd(1887) LT Vol LV 689.47.    We do not think these cases really assist the owners. There is no\n\nuniversal rule for assessing damages for wrongful detention of goods. In each instance, it\n\nis a question whether proof of damage is adduced and whether the damage claimed is remote.48.    InBrandeis Goldschmidt,copper was detained by the\n\ndefendant-transporters. The plaintiffs obtained an order for delivery. The plaintiffs\n\nclaimed for damages based on the fall in the price of copper during the period of\n\ndetention and the interest on overdraft paid to their bankers. An important factor to note\n\nwas that the plaintiffs there did not acquire the copper for the purpose of selling it on\n\nthe market but for use as a raw material on the production of cathodes. No evidence was\n\ngiven as to what would have happened to the copper if it had not been detained, or when it\n\nwould have been used for manufacture and sold, or the date by which the proceeds of sale\n\nwould have been applied in reduction of their overdrafts at the bank. In view of this, the\n\nCourt of Appeal reversed the finding of the court below and held that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed in their claim for lack of proof.49.    InChartered Electronic Industries, this Court granted\n\nonly nominal damages for the conversion of printer material kits because the kits were\n\nshown to be defective and there was no evidence as to the value of such defective kits.\n\nThe court found the kits were so defective that they would not be of use to the plaintiffs\n\nin any event. The plaintiffs had also failed to show that they suffered any consequential\n\nloss as a result of the conversion.50.    In the third case,The Peel River Land, the plaintiffs\n\nthere instructed their brokers to sell a certain stock but the brokers fraudulently\n\ndeposited the certificate with a bank. The plaintiffs obtained an injunction against the\n\nbank restraining the latter from selling and transferring the stock. Eventually, the bank\n\ngave up their claim to the stock but declined to pay more than nominal damages. The Court\n\nof Appeal held that the plaintiffs were entitled to substantial damages, notwithstanding\n\nthe injunction, on account of the fall in the value of the stock. In explaining the effect\n\nof the injunction order Cotton LJ said (at p. 692):-\".. all that order showed was, that the plaintiffs, as prudent\n\n  people, desired that those who had no title to this stock should not do what they\n\n  threatened and intended to do, sell and transfer it to a person who would have a legal\n\n  title, and put the money into their own pockets\".",
        "Interest incurred": "51.    We now turn to the second issue: the claim for interest incurred\n\nby Astra. The basis for this claim is that, because of the detention, Astra took almost\n\none extra year to sell the equipment and the claim is in respect of the interest it\n\nincurred on the loan due to the delay in effecting the sale: from 1 February 1998 to 19\n\nFebruary 1999. Details of the interest so incurred were furnished by Astra. This claim in\n\ninterest is reckoned from 1 February 1998 because Astra recognised that a reasonable time\n\nis needed to conclude a deal even if there was no detention.52.    The arguments raised by the owners to resist the claims, which\n\nappear a little confusing, are as follows:-(i) In view of UT’s financial difficulty and the damage caused to\n\n  the equipment by DML during the period of the lease, UT would not have repurchased the\n\n  equipment in February 1998.(ii) The delay in the repurchase was the result of protracted\n\n  negotiations between Astra and UT. Why should the owners bear the consequence of this\n\n  delay?(iii) Astra received their first instalment payment of US$1,000,000\n\n  from UT in November 1998.(iv) The owners could not have foreseen UT reneging on the repurchase\n\n  agreement.However, the owners conceded that they should pay the interest incurred\n\nfor the period 1 February to 22 April 1998, the date on which the thirteen items of\n\nequipment were discharged.53.    In our opinion, none of these points are valid. The owners seem\n\nto have overlooked the fact that Astra’s idea of shipping the equipment to Singapore\n\nwas to get a better price for the equipment than that provided in the repurchase\n\nagreements. On this point the evidence is clear. There was also evidence which showed that\n\nthere were interested parties both prior to and during the period of detention. There were\n\ninterested buyers in Indonesia in December 1997. Many potential buyers came to view the\n\nequipment on the barge, but apart from viewing no one could have test-driven the\n\nequipment. Thus, their interest fizzled out.54.    By end 1997 and early 1998 it was clear that this region was at\n\nthe threshold of an economic crisis. By April/May 1998, Indonesia was in turmoil. The\n\nowners claimed that they could not have foreseen the crisis. We do not think anyone in\n\nbusiness then could have failed to appreciate that an economic crisis was looming. This\n\nwas simply a lame excuse. The owners must have known the consequences of detaining the\n\nequipment or, could not care less of the consequences of their action. In the\n\ncircumstances then, one could reasonably anticipate that with each passing day, it would\n\nbe more difficult to dispose of the equipment. The owners must also have realised that the\n\nlonger they held onto the equipment, the more they were creating grounds for UT to try to\n\nbeat down the price.55.    We must point out that the financial difficulties of UT did not\n\ncome to a head until February 1999. As mentioned before, they even made three instalment\n\npayments totalling US$1.2 million under the agreement to repurchase the equipment at\n\nUS$2.9 million. All payments received from UT were credited into the loan account to\n\nreduce the outstanding. It was only in February 1999 that UT could no longer pay up and\n\nasked for a further reduction in the price by way of a global settlement. If there was no\n\ndetention of the equipment by the owners, having regard to the interest shown by other\n\npotential buyers then, the equipment would probably have been sold in early 1998 to a\n\nthird party buyer, or repurchased by UT, at a price at least equal to if not better than\n\nthe valuation given by Mr Rounce of $3,175,000. There was clearly a causal link between\n\nthe interest incurred and the detention of the equipment.",
