        "14. On 2 Apr 2000, Afzal informed me that the courier would be going to\n\n  Singapore on 3 Apr from Lahore, passing through Karachi. The supplier would fax a copy of his\n\n  passport photo so that I could watch him while he goes through the Customs. He then asked me to\n\n  change my flight to Singapore Airlines, the same as the courier. It was only at that time when he\n\n  told me that instead of 2 jackets, there would be 5 and they would be going in suitcases": "",
        "21. Ray then asked Afzal and myself to go to his Room 1711 where he started\n\n  talking about the business. He said that we had agreed on 2 for US$120,000/- and the remaining 3\n\n  to be at US$50,000/- each. I asked how he would pay us and Ray said that after checking the goods,\n\n  he would make the payment through his girlfriend in 2 days time. Ray also asked where we want, in\n\n  Pakistan or Singapore and Afzal replied in Singapore. Ray insisted to open the suitcase in\n\n  Singapore but we did not agree as the arrangement was for him to check in New York. We started an\n\n  argument with Ray stating that he could not pay for something he did not see. Afzal and myself\n\n  disagreed and not decision was made. We then left the room and took a taxi back to the Hotel Grand\n\n  Central.": "",
        "30. I went back to the lobby to meet up with Ray and we both returned to his\n\n  room. Ray asked me to open the suitcases and I opened one of them, only to find it empty. He\n\n  started searching the suitcase and ripped open the inside using a knife but he could not find\n\n  anything. He then asked me to open the other suitcase and it is also empty. Ray started getting\n\n  furious again and said that I am cheating him. He asked me to ask Afzal about how the heroin was\n\n  hidden using his mobile. I called Afzal and he got furious that I called him at the hotel using\n\n  Rays mobile. I told him that there was nothing in the suitcases and he sounded worried. He said\n\n  that he would call the people in Pakistan. Afzal called into Rays mobile about 10 minutes later\n\n  and asked him to look at the de-colouration at the corners of the suitcase. Afzal hung up the\n\n  phone and I passed the message to Ray. Ray then tried breaking through the crust of both\n\n  suitcases. He managed to break the crust only after some hard work and saw some powder inside. Ray\n\n  started testing the powder found at every corner of the suitcases and told me that it is OK but\n\n  that it may not be 5 kilograms": "31. After testing the heroin, Ray asked me to close the suitcases Ray asked\n\n  me to pick up the suitcases and follow him. We then went to the hotel lobby and he told me to wait\n\n  there for his girlfriend whom I an to hand over the suitcases to. She would also hand me the\n\n  money. After that, Ray went off. A few minutes later, I was arrested by 5 or 6 people.At the close of the prosecutions case23 At the close of the prosecutions case, after having considered all the\n\nevidence adduced by the prosecution and having regard to the principles inHaw Tua Tau v PP[1981] 2 MLJ 49, the trial judge found that the prosecution had made out a case against Afzal, which\n\nif unrebutted would warrant his conviction. Afzal was thus called upon to enter his defence.Afzals evidence and defence24 At the trial, Hashims evidence was that he had not intended to sell drugs\n\nto Ray but that he had merely wanted to cheat Ray in a sham transaction, to which Afzal was\n\nalso a party. Afzals evidence contradicted Hashims materially in the sense that he denied any\n\nknowledge nor any involvement on his part in the drug transaction or any sham transaction to\n\ncheat Ray. Although he had taken part in the negotiations with Ray, he had thought that what Hashim\n\nwas selling to Ray was not drugs but leather jackets.25 Afzal was a 50-year-old Pakistani. For the past 10 to 12 years, he had been\n\nsupplying defence equipment to the Pakistani Army and had also been dealing in electronic goods,\n\nphotocopying machines, computer parts, faxes and other goods. He claimed that he had arrived in\n\nSingapore on 6 April 2000 for the primary purpose of making enquiries about some cabin compressor\n\nparts. He had visited Singapore many times previously, mainly to procure electronic goods which were\n\neither unavailable or too expensive in Pakistan.26 Afzal first met Hashim about 10 to 12 years ago in New York. When Hashim\n\nvisited him in June 1999, Hashim said that he was in the leather garment business and was looking\n\nfor an office. As Afzal had a large office, he agreed to accommodate Hashim. In December 1999, Afzal\n\nand Hashim became business partners.27 Afzal averred that Hashim had never mentioned or talked about drugs to him at\n\nany time. With regard to Lou, Hashim had told Afzal that Lou had a leather business in the United\n\nStates and that Lou was Hashims buyer. Afzal had therefore spoken to Lou and greeted him only\n\nonce. Afzal denied any communication with Ray whilst in Pakistan. Neither did he suspect that Hashim\n\nhad anything to do with drugs.28 In March 2000, Hashim told Afzal that he was going to Singapore to meet Lou,\n\nwho was going to make him some advance payments for samples. Afzal was told that the order was for\n\nthe supply of 2,000 leather jackets. Afzal then informed Hashim that he too had been planning to\n\nvisit Singapore to make some enquiries. Hashim said that if Afzal were in Singapore as well, he\n\nwould pay Afzal a substantial sum to clear part of his debt to Afzal. Hashim also asked Afzal to\n\nhelp remit monies from Singapore to Pakistan as Hashim intended to stay in Singapore for a while. By\n\nthe end of March 2000, Afzal was unable to obtain spare parts which he required in Pakistan and he\n\ndecided to visit Singapore.29 When Hashim reached Singapore on 4 April 2000, he called Afzal in Pakistan to\n\ntell him where he was staying. Afzal arrived in Singapore in the early morning on 6 April 2000.\n\nAfter his arrival, he called Hashim and they agreed to meet for lunch. Hashim came by Afzals room\n\nat Hotel Grand Central and they had a general conversation about the defence equipment that Afzal\n\nwas trying to source for. Hashim mentioned that he was meeting his buyer later that day to collect\n\nsome advance payments and asked Afzal to accompany him. Afzal agreed as Hashim said that he wanted\n\nto show his buyer some leather samples and persuade him to make the advance payment. Hashim had\n\nrepresented to Afzal that the order was a substantial one valued at US$300,000. Earlier on in\n\nPakistan, Afzal had heard from Hashim that the order was for the supply of 4,000 to 5,000 jackets.30 Afzal accompanied Hashim to meet the buyer (Ray) at River View Hotel. Hashim\n\nand Afzal were sitting at a table at the ground level caf of the hotel with Ray and a lady\n\n(Elliot) when Ray placed a bag in front of Hashim and opened it briefly before closing it back.\n\nAfzal claimed that he did not see what was in the bag. Due to the accent and speed with which Ray\n\nwas talking, Afzal did not understand what Ray was saying while opening and closing the bag. Soon,\n\nElliot left with the bag and Ray, Hashim and Afzal proceeded to Rays room.31 Afzal admitted that while in Rays room discussing the transaction, Afzal\n\nhimself did most of the talking. However, he was talking in relation to the leather jackets which\n\nHashim was selling and the advance payment that Hashim was to receive. Afzal claimed that did not\n\nunderstand English and during their conversation, he did not understand some of the things that were\n\nsaid. He maintained that throughout the entire conversation, he did not use the word drugs. He\n\nalso denied that when Hashim called him from Rays room later on, he had told Hashim to break the\n\nsuitcases to find the drugs. He testified that he did not know anything about the suitcases, to whom\n\nthey belonged or what was inside them. Further, he denied any knowledge or any part in Hashims\n\nscam to cheat Ray.The decision below32 Having reviewed the evidence in its totality after discounting what Hashim had\n\nsaid about Afzals role, the trial judge found that Afzal was on 6 April 2000 actively engaged in\n\na conspiracy with Hashim and abetted Hashim in the commission of the offence stated in the charge.\n\nThe judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Afzal was\n\nguilty of the charge he faced and therefore convicted Afzal of the offence and sentenced him to the\n\nmandatory punishment prescribed under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the \"MDA\"),\n\nthe death penalty.The appeal33 Afzal was charged for an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 12 of the MDA.\n\nSection 5(1)(a) states that it is an offence to traffic in a controlled drug whereas s 12 provides\n\nthat any person who abets the commission of or who attempts to commit or does any act preparatory\n\nto, or in furtherance of, the commission of any offence under the Act shall be guilty of that\n\noffence and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for that offence.34 In this case, Afzal was charged for abetting the commission of the offence\n\nunder s 5(1)(a) of the MDA by engaging in a conspiracy with Hashim to traffic in the drugs. The\n\nessence of conspiracy is agreement and it has been acknowledged by the Court of Criminal Appeal inPP\n\nv Yeo Choon Poh[1994] 2 SLR 867andLai Kam Loy & Ors v PP[1994] 1 SLR 787that\n\ndirect evidence of such agreement is not necessary as it will rarely be available. InPP v Yeo\n\nChoon Poh(supra)at 873, the Court stated as follows with regard to the offence of\n\nabetment by conspiracy:The charge against the respondent was that of abetment by conspiracy. The\n\n  ingredients that the prosecution had to prove were the existence of a conspiracy to traffic in the\n\n  drugs and that the trafficking was actually carried out. That the second limb had been fulfilled\n\n  was not disputed. The essential question in this appeal was, therefore, whether it could be said\n\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent was a party to that conspiracy. The essence of a\n\n  conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such\n\n  circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. In fact there is no requirement\n\n  in law that the alleged conspirators should remain in each others company throughout or at all",
        "One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions\n\n  of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to\n\n  the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These\n\n  actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of\n\n  the conspiracy.": "35 In this case, in order to secure a conviction against Afzal on the charge, the\n\nprosecution had to prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt, that:(i) Afzal was engaged in a conspiracy with Hashim and as conspirators, both of\n\n  them agreed to traffic in diamorphine, a controlled drug, this being the object of the said\n\n  conspiracy; and(ii) the trafficking was actually carried out.36 The second requirement, i.e. that the trafficking was actually carried out,\n\nwas clearly established by the evidence of Ray and Hashim and this was not disputed by Afzals\n\ncounsel. Afzals defence was essentially a denial of the first requirement, i.e. that there was no\n\nconspiracy and he had not agreed with Hashim to traffic in the drugs as he thought that what they\n\nwere selling to Ray were leather jackets and not drugs.37 Without doubt, the circumstances and evidence adduced by the prosecution\n\nincriminated Afzal. The evidence of Ray and Hashim in respect of the conversation between the three\n\nparties that took place in Rays room as well as the audio-visual recording of that conversation\n\nshowed that the parties were in pursuit of a common object, i.e. to sell the drugs to Ray, and\n\nclearly constituted evidence of a prior arrangement and conspiracy between Afzal and Hashim to\n\ntraffic in those drugs.38 Further, the evidence of both Ray and Hashim that Hashim had called Afzal from\n\nRays room and asked him for instructions in locating the drugs in the walls of the suitcases was\n\nalso particularly incriminating. Following Hashims call, Afzal had made a call to Pakistan and\n\nthen reverted to Hashim with instructions, whereupon Ray and Hashim managed to find the drugs which\n\nwere concealed in the suitcases. This clearly showed that Afzal could not have been an innocent\n\nparty to the transaction and that he had a role in the conspiracy with Hashim to traffic in the\n\ndrugs.39 Afzals counsel conceded that although the trial judge had discounted Hashims\n\nevidence, this Court was not precluded from looking at the entire evidence in its totality on record\n\nand to draw its own inferences regarding the guilt or innocence of Afzal. However, his submission\n\nwas that Hashims statements confession should not be relied upon as Hashim was not a truthful\n\nwitness and had retracted many parts of his statements. Counsel also contended that the trial judge\n\nhad erred by implicitly relying on the evidence of Ray and accepting his evidence without\n\nscrutinising and evaluating his evidence and making any finding as to his credibility and\n\nreliability as a witness. We found such allegations devoid of merit. The evidence of Ray and Hashim\n\nin respect of Afzals role in the negotiation and drug transaction was consistent. Moreover, quite\n\napart from the testimony of Ray and Hashim, the real evidence in the form of the audio-visual\n\nrecording of the conversation between the three parties clearly showed Afzals guilt and this\n\nappeared to be the main basis on which the trial judge had convicted Afzal.40 The other submissions of Afzals counsel on appeal revolved around various\n\npoints in Afzals evidence which allegedly threw a reasonable doubt on the prosecutions case.\n\nIt was submitted by counsel that the trial judge had erred in not giving sufficient consideration\n\nand weight to those points in Afzals evidence.41 In our opinion, however, the audio-visual recording of the conversation\n\nbetween Ray, Afzal and Hashim in Rays room on April 6 2000 provided overwhelmingly incriminating\n\nevidence against Afzal. The trial judge found that the audio-visual recordings clearly showed that\n\nAfzal was deeply involved in the drug conspiracy. Afzal appeared to be the one who did most of the\n\ntalking during the negotiation and some of his words were clearly incriminating, for example, \"\n\nWe do business with topmost quality so much risk right from one place to other place\";\n\n\" we will always give you the topmost quality, crystal, topmost\"; \" we often\n\ncome here, we travel here, its easy. Its very dangerous also\"; \" the things\n\nwhich are packed they are really very highly technically placed and if you open them\" and\n\n\"It was a big Christmas card and it was a sample, very little sample\".42 In view of the negotiations in Rays room, in which Afzal appeared to play a\n\nsignificant role, and the incriminating words uttered by Afzal which surfaced in the audio-visual\n\nrecording, Afzals defence that he had no part in the drug transaction and that he was merely\n\nnegotiating with Ray for the sale of leather jackets was beyond belief. Ray had used the words heroin\n\nand drugs several times during their conversation and Afzal had not shown any surprise at the\n\nuse of those words. Although Afzal claimed that he had difficulty understanding Ray because of his\n\naccent and the speed at which he was talking, this was not evident from the recording of the\n\nconversation. In the light of the evidence, there was no doubt that Afzal knew that they were\n\nnegotiating for the sale of drugs and not leather jackets.43 Although on the facts of the case, our view was that direct evidence of the\n\nconspiracy was not required in order secure a conviction against Afzal, Hashims statements and\n\nconfession to the CNB did contain such direct evidence of the conspiracy between Afzal and Hashim to\n\ntraffic in the drugs by selling the drugs to Ray. According to the evidence contained in Hashims\n\nstatements and confession, Afzal had played an active role in the drug transaction both while in\n\nPakistan prior to and after their arrival in Singapore.44 At this juncture, it is apt to observe that Afzal was charged for abetting an\n\noffence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA and therefore the charge should have read \"abetted the\n\ncommission of the offence of trafficking in the said controlled drug\" instead of \"abetted\n\nthe commission of the offence of offering to traffic in the said controlled drug\", which was an\n\noffence under s 5(1)(b) read with s 12 of the MDA. Nonetheless, the oversight was inconsequential\n\nand did not in any way affect the substance of the charge. Afzal was essentially tried jointly with\n\nHashim in relation to the same offence of trafficking in the drugs under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. That\n\nbeing the case, the fact that Hashim was tried jointly with Afzal in relation to the same offence\n\ndid not prevent the incriminating parts of Hashims evidence from being used against Afzal. This\n\nwas allowed by virtue of s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) which states as follows:30. - When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence,\n\n  and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is\n\n  proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well\n\n  as against the person who makes the confession.Explanation  \"Offence\" as used in this section includes the\n\n  abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.45 However, since the trial judge chose not to take into account Hashims\n\nevidence against Afzal, we did not see the need to depart from his decision in this respect. In any\n\ncase, on the facts and evidence, we had no doubt that the independent and incontrovertible evidence\n\nfrom the audio-visual recording of the conversation between Afzal, Hashim and Ray was sufficiently\n\nincriminating to warrant a conviction against Afzal on the charge he faced. We saw no reason to\n\ndisturb the finding of the trial judge that the prosecution had proven their case against Afzal\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and we therefore dismissed Afzals appeal and upheld his conviction and\n\nsentence.Appeal dismissed.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:Yong Pung HowL P TheanChao Hick TinChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
