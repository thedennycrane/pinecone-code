        "Held": ", allowing the appeal in part:(1) Interpreted as a whole, clause 16.1 is obscure and ambiguous.\n\n  Unlike other clauses in the contract where the draftsman had deemed it fit to refer to\n\n  clause 16.1, clause 14 did not make express reference to it. While clause 16.1 effectively\n\n  restricted the rights of Tan, L&M was not subjected to the same restrictions. This was\n\n  inconsistent with a sale based on NTA. The aim of clause 14 is to ensure that no party\n\n  should obtain a windfall and clause 16.1 is probably intended to apply only to those\n\n  provisions in the S&P agreement where only L&M had assumed obligations to Tan (see\n\n   18-22).(2) Generally, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to construe a\n\n  document unless the facts fall within any of the exceptions specified in s 94 of the\n\n  Evidence Act (see  10-11). In view of the unclear nature of the scope and the precise\n\n  restrictions contained in clause 16.1, the proviso in s 94(f) of the Evidence Act applies\n\n  and extrinsic evidence is therefore admissible. Tan’s claim in the action is to be\n\n  remitted for continued hearing before the judge (see  23 and 35).(3) The correct meaning of the word \"procure\" as it is used\n\n  in clause 15.1 depends not only on its context but also on the context of the entire\n\n  document. It is a canon of construction that the same word used in a document should be\n\n  given the same meaning throughout it; Re Birks [1900] 1 Ch 417 (folld). Judging from the\n\n  manner in which it is used in other clauses in the contract, \"procure\" cannot\n\n  simply mean \"to endeavour\" or to \"persuade or take steps\". It is a\n\n  definite obligation on the party for which the clause is directed (see  28-29).(4) In clause 15.1, Tan undertook to ensure that KWF will repay the\n\n  inter-company loans. When KWF defaulted, Tan breached his obligation of\n\n  \"ensuring\" or \"seeing to it\" that KWF repays the loan. As such, it was\n\n  unnecessary to determine if this was an guarantee obligation of the second category\n\n  mentioned by Lord Reid in Moschi v Lep Air Services Ltd & Ors [1973] AC 331 or is only\n\n  something akin to it. The fact that clause 15.1 had also contemplated that a guarantee be\n\n  given by THK did not detract from the obligation of Tan and in the context, they are\n\n  complementary. For Tan’s breach, L&M is entitled to damages (see  30-32).(5) If Tan had discharged his obligation of ensuring repayment of the\n\n  loans, there would have been no loss and no claim by L&M. Because he has breached his\n\n  obligation, the loss ensued. This, in turn, gave rise to a claim in damages quantified by\n\n  the amount that KWF failed to repay (see  34).",

        "Case(s) referred to": ":Moschi v Lep Air Services Ltd & Ors [1973] AC 331 (folld)Re Birks [1900] 1 Ch 417 (folld)JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1.    This is an appeal which concerns the construction of\n\ncertain clauses in two Sale and Purchase (S&P) Agreements of shares in a company named\n\nKhai Wah-Ferco Pte Ltd (\"KWF\"), where the appellant, Tan Hock Keng\n\n(‘Tan’) was the buyer and L&M Group Investments Ltd (‘L&M’),\n\nthe seller.",
        "The background": "2.    KWF was wholly owned by L&M. On 3 October 1997, Tan entered\n\ninto a S&P Agreement to purchase from L&M 28,350 ordinary shares of KWF. By this\n\npurchase, Tan would become 81% owner of KWF. Some two months later, on 2 December 1997, a\n\nsecond S&P Agreement was entered into between them whereby Tan agreed to purchase the\n\nremaining shares (6,650) which L&M retained in KWF. The second S&P Agreement\n\nessentially incorporated the main terms in the first S&P Agreement. The completion\n\ndate for both Agreements was 2 December 1997. The effect of the two Agreements was that\n\nTan would become the sole owner of KWF.3.    The purchase price paid by Tan for the shares in KWF was based on\n\nnet tangible assets (NTA), which was determined to be S$285,900. This valuation was in\n\nturn founded on KWF’s unaudited accounts ended 30 September 1997. In part because the\n\nvaluation was based on unaudited accounts, the first S&P Agreement in clause 14\n\nprovided that if a debt should, within a period of 12 months after it becomes due, be\n\nconsidered to be irrecoverable, or if credit notes were given by KWF after 30 September\n\n1997 for work done prior to that date, the vendor (L&M) would pay the equivalent\n\namounts to the buyer (Tan). We should add that there were corresponding provisions in\n\nclause 14 favouring L&M for similar events in the reverse situation. The problem that\n\nhas arisen concerns the question whether clause 16.1, which is a limitation provision,\n\napplied to the amount or amounts which Tan is entitled to be paid under clause 14.4.    As the issue is one of construction, it is necessary that we\n\nshould, at this juncture, set out the relevant provisions of clauses 14 and 16.1:-Clause 14(1) In the event that after Balance Sheet Date the Group Company\n\n  recovers any debt that has been written off from the Accounts of the Group Company, the\n\n  Purchaser shall within 14 days from the date of the Company’s receipt of the debt pay\n\n  an amount equivalent to 81% of the recovered debt to the Vendor.(2) In the event that after Balance Sheet Date any debt of the Group\n\n  Company as stated in the Accounts have not been recovered within the 12 months from the\n\n  due date of the debt and in the unanimous opinion of the parties is irrecoverable (such\n\n  decision being made in good faith), the Vendor shall within 14 days from the date of the\n\n  unanimous decision of the parties pay an amount equivalent to 81% of the irrecoverable\n\n  debt to the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall, prior to the\n\n  payment of the irrecoverable debt and at the election of the Vendor, procure the\n\n  appointment of the Vendor as agent of the Group Company for the recovery of the debt on\n\n  the Group Company’s behalf.(3) In the event that after Balance Sheet Date the Group Company issues\n\n  a credit note to its customer or supplier for work done prior to Balance Sheet Date the\n\n  Vendor shall within 14 days from the date of issuance of the credit note pay an amount\n\n  equivalent to 81% of the amount stated on the credit note to the Purchaser.(4) In the event that after Balance Sheet Date the Group Company\n\n  receives a credit note from its customer or supplier for work done prior to Balance Sheet\n\n  Date the Purchaser shall within 14 days from the date of issuance of the credit note pay\n\n  an amount equivalent to 81% of the amount stated in the credit note to the Vendor.(Note: (i) it would be appreciated that the amount payable to the other\n\n  party under these provisions were specified to be 81% because that was the percentage of\n\n  the shares involved under the first S&P Agreement. The second S&P Agreement\n\n  related to the remaining 19% of the shares. Therefore, under both Agreements, the amount\n\n  payable to the other party under these sub-clauses would be 100%.)(ii) \"Balance Sheet Date\" is 30 September 1997.(iii) Sub-clauses (1) and (4) are in favour of the vendor L&M).Clause 16.1The parties hereby agree that the total liability of the Vendor for\n\n  all claims of any kind whether in contract, warranty, indemnity, tort, strict liability or\n\n  otherwise arising out of the performance or breach of the Agreement or any of the terms\n\n  herein shall not exceed the Consideration Sum as determined in accordance with Clause 4.1,\n\n  or shall not terminate prior to the expiry of three (3) years from Completion Date,\n\n  whichever occurs first.5.    Tan’s claim in the action is for the sums of S$109,737.55 and\n\nUS$770,540.75, being the amounts due from L&M to him under clause 14 on account of\n\ntrade debts which had become irrecoverable within 12 months of their due dates and credit\n\nnotes issued after 30 September 1997 by KWF for work done prior to 30 September 1997, less\n\nvarious sums owing by Tan to L&M. In the course of the trial (during the\n\ncross-examination of Tan’s second witness) counsel for L&M, Mr Chia Chor Leong,\n\nat the invitation of the court, indicated that in order to save time and if the court were\n\nto rule that clause 16.1 had the effect of limiting L&M’s liability under clause\n\n14 to only the \"consideration sum\" specified in clause 16.1, which is S$285,000,\n\nthen L&M would be prepared to accept liability up to that sum. With this approach,\n\nthere would be no necessity to go into a tedious examination of the various items of claim\n\nwhich made up the two sums claimed by Tan.6.    The trial judge ruled that, on a proper construction of clauses 14\n\nand 16.1, the limit of $285,000 prescribed in clause 16.1 applied to the claim of Tan\n\nunder clause 14. Following from that, the judge gave judgment to Tan for only the amount\n\nof $285,000.",
        "Counterclaim": "7.    In the action, there was a counterclaim which L&M had made\n\nagainst Tan, totalling $751,504.13. Included in this amount claimed was a sum of $440,000,\n\nbeing two instalments of $220,000 each which were due from KWF to L&M in respect of\n\ninter-company loans of some $5.5 million made by L&M to KWF and in respect of which\n\nloans Tan agreed under the two S&P Agreements (clause 15.1) that he would\n\n\"procure that (KWF) repays the inter-company loans\". The remaining sum of\n\n$311,504.13 claimed by L&M was admitted by Tan.8.    The issue on the counterclaim of $440,000 centred on what exactly\n\nwas the extent of Tan’s obligation under clause 15.1. The clause reads:-The Purchaser shall procure that the Company repays the intercompany\n\n  Loans as free of interest over 12 instalments commencing on 15 April 1999 and on every\n\n  anniversary thereafter (the ‘repayment date’) at a principal sum of thirty\n\n  percent (30%) of the Company’s consolidated net profit after tax or $220,000.00 per\n\n  annum, whichever is the higher, and in any event on the twelfth and final repayment date\n\n  the Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall repay all balance outstanding\n\n  intercompany Loans to the Vendor in one lump sum. In consideration of the Vendor agreeing\n\n  to a repayment of the intercompany Loans over 12 annual instalments, the Purchaser shall\n\n  procure that THK REALTY PTE LTD shall deliver to the Vendor the duly executed and stamped\n\n  Guarantee.9.    The trial judge found that under this clause Tan had assumed an\n\nobligation in effect to guarantee that KWF would repay the inter-company loans owing by\n\nKWF to L&M. The fact that in clause 15.1 the word used was not \"guarantee\"\n\nbut \"procure\" did not make a difference as the word \"procure\" in\n\nessence meant that Tan \"undertook\" or would \"see to it\" that KWF would\n\nrepay the inter-company loans and as KWF did not repay the instalments due in respect of\n\nthe loans, Tan was, therefore, in breach of that undertaking and should be liable in\n\ndamages, which in the circumstances would be the two instalment sums not paid by KWF.",
        "Construction of clauses 14 and 16": "10.    We shall first examine the question of the construction of\n\nclauses 14 and 16.1. These two clauses have been set out in 4 above. It is clear law\n\nthat except where the situation falls within any of the exception specified in s 94 of the\n\nEvidence Act, no extrinsic evidence is admissible to construe a document. One of the\n\nexceptions provided in s 94 is:-(f) any fact may be proved which shows in what matter the language of a\n\n  document is related to existing facts.11.    The trial judge held that this proviso has no application where\n\nthe words or phrases used in a clause are clear, as is the case here. Relying onSarkar\n\non Evidence (14thEdition), he felt that proviso (f) would only come into\n\nplay when there is latent ambiguity in a document. He cited the following passage (at\n\np.1283) from the learned author:-If the language employed is ambiguous and admits of a variety of\n\n  meaning, the 6thproviso (i.e., our proviso [f]) can be invoked. The object of\n\n  admissibility of such evidence is to assist the court to get the real intention of the\n\n  parties and thereby overcome the difficulty caused by the ambiguity.12.    He held that clause 16.1 was very clear in its terms and thus no\n\nextrinsic evidence was admissible to show that it was meant to have effect only as a\n\nreference clause. The judge also dismissed two other arguments of Tan, namely, (i) that\n\nclause 16.1 could have no application to clause 14 because the latter clause did not\n\nexpressly refer to clause 16 and; (ii) that clause 14 was repugnant to clause 16 and that\n\nthe parties could not have intended clause 16.1 to override clause 14.13.    The primary question which we now must address is, is clause 16.1\n\nclear and unambiguous? It will be recalled that the clause has two limbs. The first limb,\n\nwhich the judge found to be clear and unambiguous, reads:-The parties hereby agree that the total liability of the Vendor for all\n\n  claims of any kind whether in contract, warranty, indemnity, tort, strict liability or\n\n  otherwise arising out of the performance or breach of the Agreement or any of the terms\n\n  herein shall not exceed the Consideration Sum as determined in accordance with Clause 4.1,14.    The judge, however, did not go into an examination of the second\n\nlimb which reads:-or shall not terminate prior to the expiry of three (3) years from\n\n  Completion Date, whichever occurs first.15.    Counsel for Tan submits that while the first limb may seem to be\n\nclear, it cannot be said that the clause as a whole is clear. Indeed, counsel submits that\n\nreading both limbs together, the clause is unclear and unintelligible. Putting it at the\n\nlowest, the clause is ambiguous. The two limbs are linked by the word \"or\". The\n\nfirst part seeks to limit Tan’s claim to $285,000. The second limb purports to\n\nintroduce, in a rather strange way, a different nature of limitation based on time. We\n\nwill examine the problems which are inherent in the clause as a whole in a moment.16.    Counsel for Tan submits that the clause is capable of being\n\ninterpreted in three different ways. First, it could mean that L&M’s liability to\n\nTan is limited to the consideration sum simpliciter. Secondly, it could mean that where\n\nTan makes a claim against L&M within 3 years from the completion date, the\n\nrespondent’s liability for such claims is limited to the consideration sum but if the\n\nclaim should arise after three years, L&M is no longer liable to make any payment.\n\nThirdly, where Tan’s claim against L&M arose within 3 years, L&M is liable\n\nfor the full amount of the claim, but if it arose after the three years, L&M’s\n\nliability is limited to the consideration sum.17.    On the other hand, counsel for L&M contends that while the\n\nclause is not a model of good drafting, it is nevertheless reasonably clear, introducing\n\ntwo limitation criteria, one based on quantum and the other on time and when so viewed the\n\nclause means:-(i) If the claim of Tan was made before the expiry of the three year\n\n  period and is less than the consideration sum, no limitation shall apply; but if this\n\n  claim should be more than the consideration sum then Tan would only be able to claim\n\n  $285,000;(ii) If the claim of Tan was made after the expiry of the three year\n\n  period, then the claim will not be entertained, whatever be the amount of the claim.18.    In our opinion, the clause is really quite obscure. It does not\n\nstate \"what\" shall not terminate. Is it \"total liability\" or \"all\n\nclaims\"? What does it mean to say that \"total liability\" \"shall not\n\nterminate prior to the expiry of three years\"? While it makes a little more sense to\n\nsay that all claims \"shall not terminate prior to the expiry of three years\n\n…\" still it is extremely awkward if the intention was that the claims should be\n\nmade within the period of three years. \"Claims\" do not terminate as such. The\n\ncontract could provide that a claim may not be made after the expiry of a specified\n\nperiod; it does not terminate. A simple sentence like \"No claims shall be met after\n\nthe expiry of three years\" without linking this criteria to the first limb would have\n\nachieved what was intended. Furthermore, in relation to the expression \"whichever\n\noccurs first\", the word \"occurs\" can hardly be appropriate to refer to a\n\nlimitation based on quantum. We note that the judge below felt that clause 16.1 is clear.\n\nBut from 1 of his judgment we see that he had only considered the first limb of that\n\nclause instead of the entire clause. The entire clause is certainly obscure.19.    It may well be, as asserted by L&M, that clause 16.1 was\n\nintended to introduce a two-pronged limitation: one was based on quantum, and the other on\n\ntime. But the way the clause is structured does not sufficiently bear out the sense\n\ncontended; the two limbs simply do not sit well with each other. It would probably have\n\nhelped to substitute \"or\" with \"and\" and to delete \"whichever\n\noccurs first\". Even with these amendments, it is not a happily worded clause.20.    We now refer to two other grounds advanced by Tan to contend that\n\nfurther questions exist as to the scope of clause 16.1. The first is in relation to\n\nclauses 6.1, 7.1, 10.1 and 10.2. These clauses impose certain obligations on L&M,\n\nbreaches of which would give rise to liabilities on the part of L&M. These clauses are\n\nsomewhat lengthy and we will only set out clause 6.1 as this should be sufficient to\n\nappreciate the point which Tan seeks to make.Clause 6.1The (Respondent) hereby warrants and undertakes to and with the\n\n  (Appellant) and its successors in title and permitted assigns (with the intent that the\n\n  provisions of this Clause shall subject to Clause 16 continue to have full force and\n\n  effect notwithstanding completion):(a) that it is or will on completion be beneficially entitled to or is\n\n    otherwise able to procure the transfer of the Shares to the [Appellant] and/or its\n\n    nominees; and(b) that the Shares will on completion be free from all and any\n\n    charges, items and other encumbrances whatsoever.The said warranties and undertakings shall be separate and independent\n\n  and save as expressly provided in Clause 16 shall not be limited by anything in this\n\n  Agreement.21.    As the wording of the first limb of clause 16.1 is so wide and\n\nwould have undoubtedly encompassed the liabilities arising under clause 6.1 (and clauses\n\n7.1, 10.1 and 10.2 as well), yet in these latter clauses the draftsman deemed it necessary\n\nto refer expressly to the limitation prescribed in clause 16.1. That being the approach,\n\nif it was intended that the limitation in clause 16.1 should also apply to the payments\n\nwhich are required to be made by the parties under clause 14, then the parties would have\n\nmade express reference to clause 16.1. Yet, they did not do so.22.    This brings us to the second ground. If clause 16.1 were to be\n\nconstrued to be applicable to payments to be made under clause 14, it would have the\n\neffect of putting a limit as to what Tan could ask L&M to pay him. But clause 16.1\n\nonly works one way, restricting the rights of Tan. There is no corresponding restriction\n\nplaced on what L&M could claim from Tan under clause 14. This does seem to be wholly\n\ninequitable, bearing in mind that the sale transaction was based on net tangible asset and\n\nthe provisions for adjustments laid down in clause 14 was basically to achieve that\n\nobjective: no party should obtain a windfall in the events enumerated in clause 14. It is\n\ndifficult to imagine that the parties intended to bring about such a grossly unfair\n\nresult. The one-sided nature of clause 16.1 would certainly support Tan’s contention\n\nthat that clause was probably intended to apply only to those provisions in the Agreement\n\nwhere only L&M had assumed obligations to Tan; thus the need to place some\n\nrestrictions on Tan’s rights.23.    In the light of all the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the\n\nscope and the precise restrictions contained in clause 16.1 are far from clear. This is,\n\ntherefore, an instance where the proviso in s 94(f) applies and extrinsic evidence is\n\nadmissible to assist in the determination of the true construction of clause 16.1.",
        "Liability under guarantee": "24.    We now turn to consider L&M’s counterclaim based on\n\nclause 15.1. The issue here is what is the nature of the obligations assumed by Tan under\n\nthat clause. Did he effectively undertake to fulfil the repayment obligation of KWF in\n\nrespect of the inter-company loans if KWF should fail to do so? Tan criticises the\n\ndetermination of the judge on two fronts. First, it does not follow that just because Tan\n\nagreed to procure that KWF pay the instalments on the loans he has thereby assumed\n\npersonal liability for the failure of KWF to meet its payment obligations. What the clause\n\nimposed on Tan is at best only an obligation to use his best endeavours to persuade or\n\ninduce KWF to pay the loans. Second, even if Tan is in breach of clause 15.1 there is no\n\nevidence that his breach caused L&M’s loss, a question of causation.25.    Tan submits that the judge was wrong to have relied onMoschi\n\nv Lep Air Services Ltd & Ors[1973] AC 331 to come to the conclusion that clause\n\n15.1 imposed an obligation of guarantee on the part of Tan. He emphasised in particular\n\nthe fact that the operative clause inMoschiwas quite different and it reads:-\"In further consideration of the above, Mr Moschi has personally\n\n  guaranteed the performance by Rolloswin Investments Limited of its obligation to make the\n\n  payments at the rate of 6,000 per week together with the final payment of 4,000 as\n\n  hereinbefore set out so however that Mr Moschi’s total obligation under this\n\n  guarantee shall not exceed the total sum of 40,000 of which approximately 3,820 has\n\n  already been paid as aforesaid.\"26.    The House of Lords found Mr Moschi liable for all the outstanding\n\ninstalments owing to the creditors. Some of the Law Lords also went into a discussion of\n\nthe nature of the obligation of a guarantee. Here, the most pertinent were the\n\nobservations of Lord Reid where he distinguished between two types of guarantee\n\nobligations –With regard to making good to the creditor payments of instalments by\n\n  the principal debtor there are at least two possible forms of agreement. A person might\n\n  undertake no more than if the principal debtor fails to make any instalment he will pay\n\n  it. That would be a conditional agreement. There would then on the debtor’s failure\n\n  arise an obligation to pay. If for any reason the debtor ceased to have any obligation to\n\n  pay the instalment on the due date then he could not fail to pay it on that date. The\n\n  condition attached to that undertaking would never be purified and the subsidiary\n\n  obligation would never arise.On the other hand, the guarantor’s obligation might be of a\n\n  different kind. He might undertake that the principal debtor will carry out his contract.\n\n  Then if at any time and if for any reason the principal debtor acts or fails to act as\n\n  required by his contract, he not only breaks his own contract but also puts the guarantor\n\n  in breach of his contract of guarantee. Then the creditor can sue the guarantor, not for\n\n  the unpaid instalment but for damages. His contract being that the principal debtor would\n\n  carry out the principal contract, the damages payable by the guarantor must then be the\n\n  loss suffered by the creditor due to the principal debtor having failed to do what the\n\n  guarantor undertook he would do.27.    The trial judge in our case seemed to equate the obligation\n\nassumed by Tan in clause 15.1 to be of the second category enunciated by Lord Reid. But\n\nTan argues that the crux of the matter is that unlikeMoschi, where the wording of\n\nthe obligation was clear, and where Moschi undertook the obligation of a guarantor, Tan\n\nhas not assumed under clause 15.1 any guarantee obligation, even of the second category\n\nenunciated by Lord Reid. The court below failed to appreciate the difference in wording\n\nbetween clause 15.1 and the clause inMoschi. The meaning and effect of a clause is\n\na matter of construction, depending on the words used. Tan contends that there must be\n\nclear words to support before a clause may be construed to be a guarantee. The word\n\n\"procure\" in clause 15.1 is not sufficient to imply such an obligation. What the\n\nentire clause amounted to is just an obligation \"to persuade or take steps to induce\n\nKWF to meet its instalment payments.\"28.    We note that one of the meanings given to the word\n\n\"procure\" in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rdEdn) Vol II\n\nis \"to induce, persuade\". But the other meanings given are \"to bring\n\nabout\", \"to cause\", \"to obtain\" and \"to acquire\". What\n\nis the correct meaning to give to the word \"procure\" in clause 15.1 must depend\n\nnot only in its context but also the context of the entire document. We are unable to\n\naccept Tan’s contention that in the context of clause 15.1 the word\n\n\"procure\" means only to \"persuade or take steps\". If that was the\n\nintention, then the parties would have easily used the clearer word \"endeavour\",\n\nor the expression \"use his best endeavour\". If the parties had intended that\n\nthere should be some flexibility in relation to the obligation, they would have adopted a\n\nmodified form of words as they had done in clause 2.3 – \"the parties shall use\n\ntheir respectivebest endeavours to procurethe fulfilment …\" In our\n\njudgment, the word \"shall procure\" in clause 15.1 means \"shall cause a\n\nthing to be done\", \"shall ensure\" or \"shall bring about\". It is a\n\ndefinite obligation which is being assumed. While we agree that \"procure\" in\n\nclause 15.1 does not mean that Tan undertakes to pay the loans himself but it does mean\n\nthat Tan undertakes to ensure that KWF would repay and when KWF does not repay, Tan would\n\nhave breached his obligation of \"ensuring\" or \"seeing to it\" that KWF\n\nrepay.29.    There is another canon of construction which has to be borne in\n\nmind and it is this: that the same word in a document should, as a rule, be given the same\n\nmeaning: seeRe Birks[1900] 1 Ch 417 The word \"procure\" appears not only\n\nin clause 15.1 but in several other clauses. For example, clause 5.3 provides that on\n\ncompletion, L&M \"shall procure the passing of board resolutions of the\n\ncompany\" and under clause 5.4 L&M \"shall procure the passing of board\n\nresolutions of each of the subsidiares.\" We do not think it can be argued that in\n\nclauses 5.3 and 5.4 the word \"procure\" means to endeavour. There can be no\n\nflexibility in relation to the obligations assumed by L&M under those two clauses. The\n\nobligations must be fulfilled. The obtaining of the necessary resolutions was fundamental\n\nto the entire transaction. If the resolutions were not obtained, L&M would have been\n\nin breach giving cause to Tan to rescind the contract. We do not see anything in the\n\ncontext of clause 15.1 which demands that a meaning different from that given in relation\n\nto clauses 5.3 and 5.4 should be given to the word \"procure\" here.30.    There is another aspect of clause 15.1 which is pertinent. There\n\nis a second part to that clause which requires Tan to \"procure that THK Realty Pte\n\nLtd shall deliver to (L&M) the duly executed and stamped guarantee\". This\n\nobligation imposed on Tan is significant as it reinforces the point that Tan must ensure\n\nrepayment of the loans so much so that he is required to obtain a formal guarantee for\n\nrepayment from an associated company. This obligation is wholly inconsistent with the\n\nstand taken by Tan that what he was required to do was only to endeavour. If Tan failed to\n\nobtain the guarantee of THK, he would also be in breach of that term. The guarantee by THK\n\nwas in fact furnished. As Tan has failed to fulfil his contractual obligation to ensure\n\nthat KWF pay up the loans, he is in breach, giving rise to a claim in damages. Here, the\n\nmeasure of damages which L&M suffers would have to be the sums which KWF failed to\n\nrepay.31.    We recognise that unlike the clause inMoschi, clause 15.1\n\ndoes not state that Tan would \"guarantee\" the repayment. But what was stated by\n\nLord Reid as to the two types of guarantee obligations was not dependent on the use of the\n\nword \"guarantee\" in the relevant clause before a guarantee obligation could\n\narise. Lord Reid himself said (at p.345) that \"there is no magic in the word\n\nguarantee\". Lord Diplock said in the same case (at p. 349):-Whether any particular contractual promise is to be classified as a\n\n  guarantee so as to attract all or any of the legal consequences to which I have referred\n\n  depends upon the words in which the parties have expressed the promise. Even the use of\n\n  the word \"guarantee\" is not in itself conclusive …32.    It is not essential that the word \"guarantee\" must be\n\nin the clause before there can be a guarantee obligation. There is no magic formula. It is\n\nthe true nature of the obligation which is being assumed by the party or parties which is\n\ncritical. In clause 15.1, Tan has undertaken to procure that KWF would repay the loans. He\n\nis obliged to see to it that KWF repay the loans. He has, in effect, undertaken that KWF\n\nwould repay. Whether this is a guarantee obligation of the second category mentioned by\n\nLord Reid or is only something akin to that, we do not think there is any need for us to\n\ndecide the point. Suffice it to say that Tan has breached his obligation to ensure that\n\nKWF repay the loans and for that breach he shall pay damages to L&M. The fact that\n\nclasue 15.1 had also contemplated that a guarantee be given by THK does not detract from\n\nthe obligation of Tan. In the context, they are complementary.33.    In this regard, Tan argues that as the consideration for the\n\ntransfer of all the shares of KWF to him was only for $285,000, it is wholly unjust and\n\nabsurd that he should bear the burden of ensuring that KWF repay the $5.5 million\n\ninter-company loans. On first blush, this may seem a fair point. But it is not so. The\n\nshares in KWF were sold to Tan on an NTA basis. That means the loans owing by KWF to\n\nL&M would have been taken into account in determining the final NTA price. The loans\n\nwould have been subtracted to arrive at the NTA price. So there would have been assets in\n\nKWF to repay the loans. As Tan has become the sole owner of KWF, and KWF has come under\n\nhis sole control, it can hardly be said to be unjust to thrust upon him the burden of\n\nensuring that the loans are repaid and to require him to also obtain a formal guarantee\n\nfrom another company of his, THK. Indeed it is wholly consistent with the way the\n\ntransaction was arranged that he should assume that burden.34.    The final argument raised by Tan is that of causation, namely,\n\nthat his breach was not the cause of L&M’s loss and he should not be made liable\n\nfor the loss. The short answer is this: if he had discharged his obligation of ensuring\n\nrepayment of the loans, there would have been no loss and no claim by L&M. Because he\n\nhas breached his obligation, the loss ensued. We do not see how it can be said that his\n\nbreach did not cause the loss.",
        "Judgment": "35.    In the premises, the appeal is allowed in part. Tan’s claim\n\nin the action is remitted for continued hearing before Rajendran J.36.    The judgment awarded on the counterclaim of L&M shall stand.\n\nHowever, there shall be a stay of execution, pending the conclusion of the trial on\n\nTan’s claim.37.    On the question of the costs of this appeal, as the appellant has\n\nsucceeded on one main point and failed on the other, we think a fair order in these\n\ncircumstances would be that each party shall bear his own costs. The security for costs\n\nfurnished for this appeal, together with any accrued interest, shall be refunded to the\n\nappellant. As for the costs below, L&M shall have the costs relating to the\n\ncounterclaim. The costs of Tan’s (plaintiff’s) action shall be in the trial\n\nwhich we now direct should continue.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHIEF JUSTICESgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDGE OF APPEALSgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
