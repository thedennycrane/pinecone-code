        "Introduction": "1       This is an appeal by the appellant, Asia Pacific\n                    Publishing Pte Ltd (“the Appellant”), against the decision of a\n                    High Court Judge (“the Judge”), allowing the claim by the\n                    respondent, Pioneers & Leaders (Publishers) Pte Ltd (“the\n                    Respondent”) for copyright infringement and passing off. The Judge had\n                    also ordered an injunction to restrain the Appellant from infringing the\n                    Respondent’s copyright. 2       A novel issue raised in this appeal is whether\n                    an incorporated body can be considered an “author” for the\n                    purposes of copyright law. The Judge found that a company could indeed be an\n                    author of an original work that attracted copyright protection. Her detailed\n                    reasons can be found inPioneers & Leaders (Publishers)\n                        Pte Ltd v Asia Pacific Publishing Pte Ltd[2010] 4 SLR 744\n                    (“the Judgment”). Before we analyse the legal issues that have\n                    arisen in this appeal the facts ought to be set out to give those issues\n                    context.",
        "The facts": "3       The Appellant was incorporated in Singapore in\n                    2006, while the Respondent was incorporated in Singapore in 1983. Both the\n                    Appellant and the Respondent have been, at all material times, in the business\n                    of books and magazines publication. 4       The Respondent has been publishing a\n                    horse-racing magazine known as “Punters’\n                        Way” in both English and Chinese since its incorporation\n                    in December 1983. Prior to 1983,Punters’\n                        Wayhad been published and sold since March 1977 by Pioneers\n                    & Leaders Co, a partnership registered in Singapore that is related to the\n                    Respondent.Punters’ Waycaters to\n                    horseracing punters, and contains all types of horse-racing information,\n                    including race cards, the names and description of the horses participating in\n                    each race, the pedigree of each horse and the particulars of trainers and\n                    jockeys and their performance history. 5       The Appellant, which was incorporated in\n                    November 2006, has, on its part, been publishing a horse-racing magazine known\n                    as “Racing Guide” only from January\n                    2007.Racing Guidewas first published in 1986,\n                    and was thereafter published by several different companies. The Appellant\n                    acquired the right to publishRacing Guidefrom\n                    Racing Guide Publications Pte Ltd soon after it was incorporated. The contents\n                    ofRacing Guideare essentially similar to that ofPunters’ Wayand it is also published in\n                    both English and Chinese. It is pertinent to note that both magazines obtain all\n                    their race information from the same source, that is to say, the Singapore Turf\n                    Club (“the Turf Club”).",
        "The dispute between the parties": "6       From 30 June 2007 to 5 June 2008, both\n                    the Appellant’s and Respondent’s horse-racing magazines,Racing GuideandPunters’\n                        Wayrespectively, contained horse-racing information in a set of\n                    four tables (“the Tables”) that was arranged in the same sequence.\n                    The Tables adopted the following sequence: (i)     Table 1 Race Card; (ii)     Table 2 Results Panel; (iii)     Table 3 Track Work; and (iv)     Table 4 Records of Past Performances. 7       The Race Card consists of the line-up of the\n                    horses competing in each race, and readers are able to read about the horses\n                    that are participating in the race, their recent physical status, their\n                    performance and how they are to be equipped; the jockeys and their recent\n                    performances; and trainers’ strike rates. The Results Panel consists of\n                    the choice selection of potential winning horses picked by the\n                    Respondent’s tipsters. It also has blank spaces to allow readers to fill\n                    in the actual result of the race. 8       The Track Work table shows the preparation that\n                    each horse has been put through by its trainer. It includes particulars of the\n                    horses’ performance before the race day for up to 21 days and is specially\n                    designed to give readers additional information on the recent physical state or\n                    condition of the horse. Finally, the Records of Past Performances table has a\n                    detailed history of each horse, including its pedigree, owner and stable; the\n                    stake money it has won; and the horses’ past performances for the last six\n                    runs. 9       The Respondent alleged that asRacing Guidecontained the Tables in the same sequence\n                    from 30 June 2007 to 5 June 2008, the Appellant had infringed the\n                    Respondent’s copyright by way of the copying and reproduction of the\n                    compilation of the Tables as they were materially similar to those inPunters’ Way. 10     Additionally, the Respondent claimed that\n                    since 1993,Punters’ Wayemployed a\n                    different colour on the front cover to identify the various editions for each\n                    race day in Malaysia and Singapore. The Respondent also contended that the\n                    colour coding scheme has become a unique feature of the Respondent’s\n                    publication and is in fact a badge of origin, which the Respondent uses to\n                    distinguish its products from the other products in the market. On or about\n                    4 January 2008, the Appellant began to adopt similar colour coding for both\n                    its English and Chinese editions ofRacing Guide.\n                    A comparison of the colour coding for both magazines is as follows:- Race DayPunters’\n                                        WayRacing GuideSingapore FridayMaroonMaroonSingapore SaturdayPurpleDark PurpleSingapore SundayOrange-redOrange-redMalaysia SaturdayPurpleLight PurpleMalaysia SundayGoldGold   11     The Appellant also changed the pictures of the\n                    horses on the front cover page ofRacing Guide,\n                    such that the horses were forward-facing, instead of the horses’ side\n                    profile being shown, as was the case previously. In addition, the Appellant also\n                    placed an advertisement panel on the bottom of the front page from January 2008,\n                    which was similar toPunters’ Way. Prior to\n                    January 2008, the Appellant used to place its advertisement panels in the middle\n                    left hand side of the front page. 12     Because of all these similarities, the\n                    Respondent claimed that the Appellant had misrepresented to members of the\n                    public thatRacing Guidewas connected to or\n                    associated withPunters’ Way, causing\n                    confusion, and had attempted to pass offRacing\n                        GuideforPunters’ Way. On\n                    25 April 2008, a demand letter was issued by the Respondent to the\n                    Appellant. In the letter, the Respondent alleged that the Appellant had\n                    infringed the Respondent’s copyright in the Tables, and had also passed\n                    offRacing GuideasPunters’ Way. The Respondent claimed for a sum in lieu of\n                    damages as well as for the Appellant to cease and desist from the alleged\n                    infringement of copyright and passing off. The Appellant responded to the demand\n                    letter, rejecting the Respondent’s assertions and claims. It bears mention\n                    that not long after the demand letter was sent the Appellant modified the Tables\n                    in its publication. The Respondent accepts that infringement ceased on\n                    5 June 2008. Legal proceedings against the Appellant commenced on\n                    12 November 2008 and the trial was heard in February and March\n                2010.",
        "The decision of the High Court": "13     The Judge found that copyright subsisted in\n                    the Tables inPunters’ Wayand that a\n                    company could indeed be the author of a copyright protected work as there was\n                    nothing in principle that would prevent an incorporated company from authoring a\n                    work. In the Judge’s view, who an “author” was ultimately\n                    depended on the facts of each case – more specifically, the rights that\n                    were sought to be protected, and the factual context from which the relevant\n                    work arose. In the present case, the Respondent was presumed to be the author of\n                    the Tables under s 131 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the Act”). The Judge further found that there was no difficulty\n                    with determining the duration of the copyright owned by an incorporated entity\n                    as time will start to run from the moment the copyrighted works are published,\n                    consistent with ss 28–29 of the Act, and the relevant period would be\n                    70 years from the expiration of the calendar year in which the work was first\n                    published. 14     In addition, the Judge found that there was\n                    originality in the compilation of the Tables found inPunters’ Wayas there was skill and creativity expended in\n                    the selection of information to be presented in the Tables, which had been\n                    arranged in a way the Respondent believed was most useful to its readers. The\n                    Judge also held that the evidence showed that the presentation of horse-racing\n                    information inRacing Guidewas substantially\n                    similar to that inPunters’ Wayand that a\n                    substantial part of the Tables had been copied. The court granted an injunction\n                    to prevent the Appellant from infringing the Respondent’s copyright inPunters’ Way. 15     In relation to the claim in passing off, the\n                    Judge found that without relying on any expert evidence, there was more than\n                    sufficient objective evidence to establish a compelling case that the Appellant\n                    had deliberately made changes to the cover page ofRacing\n                        Guideto pass it off asPunters’\n                        Way. The Judge concluded that the similarities between the\n                    Chinese editions were also undeniably apparent. The expert evidence based on\n                    surveys conducted on readers of horse racing magazines further served to\n                    reinforce the court’s findings. The court therefore found that the\n                    Respondent was entitled to damages resulting from the Appellant’s passing\n                    off and/or infringement of copyright.",
        "The issues": "16     Three main issues arise for consideration\n                    before us in the present appeal, namely: (a)     Is the Respondent entitled to assert\n                        copyright protection as the author of its publication? (“the First\n                        Issue”); (b)     If the Respondent is entitled to copyright protection, has the Appellant\n                        infringed its rights? (“the Second Issue”);\n                    and (c)     Has the\n                        Respondent established the constituent elements to ground a passing off\n                        action? (“the Third Issue”).",
        "Copyright protection in Singapore": "17     Before we examine the issues it would be apt\n                    to outline the current copyright legislative scheme in Singapore. As this was\n                    grandfathered in the United Kingdom (“the UK”), it will be useful\n                    to briefly narrate the historical evolution of copyright there. Interestingly,\n                    though the concept of copyright was born in the late 15th century, following the\n                    invention of printing, which made it possible to produce multiple copies of\n                    books quickly and cheaply, the very first Copyright Act was only passed in 1709\n                    in the UK – the Statute of Anne 1709 (8 Anne c 19) (UK)\n                    (“the Statute of Anne”): see Kevin Garnettet\n                        al,Copinger and Skone James on\n                        Copyrightvol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 16th Ed, 2011)\n                        (“Copinger”) at\n                    para 2-08. 18     The Statute of Anne was the first copyright\n                    statute in the world and it is the basal foundation on which the modern concept\n                    of copyright has been built. As pointed out inCopingerat para 2-16, two of the principles established by\n                    the Statute of Anne were revolutionary at the time: recognition of the author as\n                    the fountainhead of protection; and adoption of the principle of a limited term\n                    of protection for published works. 19     The Statute of Anne gave authors copyright\n                    protection for all existing printed books for a period of 21 years, and a\n                    maximum of 28 years for new works. It envisaged rights to be accorded to natural\n                    persons who created a work, balanced with the public interest of maintaining a\n                    robust public domain in which original literary, musical and artistic works are\n                    produced. The object of copyright protection was to encourage human progress\n                    through the sharing of learning and writings while safeguarding the potential\n                    economic benefits through the grant of monopoly rights of a limited duration.\n                    The social contract created protected original creativity without reference to\n                    literary merit. 20     The UK Copyright Act 1911 (c 46) (UK)\n                    (“the UK Copyright Act 1911”) subsequently codified the modern law\n                    on copyright. Additionally, it abolished common law copyright in unpublished\n                    works and conferred copyright protection on a number of works previously\n                    unprotected. Here, for the first time, the common law requirement that a\n                    literary work had to be “original” to secure copyright protection\n                    was acknowledged. To qualify as an original work, the work had to originate from\n                    an author without copying. 21     In Singapore, the Statute of Anne applied\n                    pursuant to the Second Charter of Justice of 1826 (c 85) (UK). This was\n                    then replaced by the UK Copyright Act 1911. However, in response to vastly\n                    changed circumstances, the UK Copyright Act 1911 was eventually repealed and\n                    replaced by the Singapore Copyright Act 1987 (Act 2 of 1987) (“the\n                    1987 Act”). The 1987 Act was modelled on the Australian Copyright Act\n                    1968 (Act No 63 of 1968) (Cth) (“the Australian Copyright Act\n                    1968”), as amended by the Copyright Amendment Acts 1980 (Act No 154\n                    of 1980) (Cth) and 1984 (Act No 43 of 1984) (Cth). The 1987 Act was later\n                    revised in 1988, by way of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Rev Ed), and\n                    1999 by way of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the\n                    1999 Act”), before becoming the Act as it exists today. 22     The Act governs the law of copyright in\n                    Singapore and copyright prevails only when permitted by the Act. As we will show\n                    below, the concepts of authoring and authorship take centre stage in the Act.\n                    The general framework of copyright law in Singapore encompasses the\n                    following: (a)the subject matter of protection;(b)the scope of protection granted;(c)the term of protection; and(d)formalities.The subject matter of protection23     The subject matter accorded protection falls\n                    into two principal categories. The first, protected under Part III and more\n                    specifically found in s 27 of the Act, includes traditional types of\n                    subject matter such as literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works which are\n                    original. The second category, protected under ss 97–101 in\n                    Part IV of the Act, relates to “subject-matter other than works” and includes sound\n                    recordings, television broadcasts and cinematograph films amongst\n                others.24     Section 27 of the Act isin pari materiawith s 32 of the Australian\n                    Copyright Act 1968, which has its origins in the UK Copyright Act 1911. Thus,\n                    both English and Australian cases are useful reference points on the issue of\n                    originality. However, while the cases are helpful in illuminating the\n                    application of the legal principles, it has to be remembered that ultimately the\n                    originality of each particular work is everything in determining if copyright\n                    exists.The scope of protection granted25     The scope of protection accorded differs\n                    according to the type of subject matter concerned. Copyright protection is\n                    concerned with the unauthorised reproduction or dissemination by third parties\n                    of the form in which a person has chosen to express himself or herself, whether\n                    by way of a book, painting, or something else. Nevertheless this protection may\n                    be broader in some cases than in others, due to the nature of the subject matter\n                    in question. For example, for literary, dramatic and musical works, a person may\n                    prevent a wide range of unauthorised reproductions such as,inter alia, adaptations, public performances and other public\n                    communications of the work. However, for artistic works and subject matter other\n                    than works, the protection accorded is more limited and more narrowly\n                    interpreted.The term of protection26     In general, the term of protection for works\n                    is the author’s life plus 70 years as stated in s 28 of the Act;\n                    while the term of protection for other subject matter, as well as certain\n                    limited categories of works such as those published anonymously or\n                    pseudonymously is 70 years from the date of first publication, as seen in\n                    s 29 and ss 92–96 of the Act respectively.27     The length that ought to be accorded to\n                    copyright protection has always been robustly debated. This stems from the\n                    difficulty of striking an appropriate balance between the competing tensions of\n                    public and private interests. On one hand, there is the interest of the public\n                    in securing both new and established works freely and as early as possible, and,\n                    on the other, the need to ensure that authors receive a just return for their\n                    creative efforts and are thereby encouraged to keep on creating. The perennial\n                    problem has been to find the right period of protection which strikes the\n                    appropriate balance between these competing tensions.28     As mentioned earlier in[19], the statutory protection provided by the\n                    Statute of Anne was a maximum period of 28 years. As an aside, it bears noting\n                    that the average human life span then was much shorter. The initial statutory\n                    period was enlarged in 1814 to the term of the author’s life, if the\n                    author was still living at the end of 28 years. In 1842, it was changed to the\n                    life of the author plus seven years or 42 years, whichever was the longer. The\n                    rationale for this new term was based on the argument that the earlier\n                    legislation tended to penalise the author who published his work shortly before\n                    his death. This, coupled with the desire to secure rights which would benefit\n                    the heirs of the author, resulted in the new extended copyright period.\n                    Subsequently, the UK Copyright Act 1911 provided that the term for copyright\n                    would be the author’s life plus 50 years. This was the position adopted in\n                    the 1987 Act when it was first enacted.29     In May 2003, the United States - Singapore\n                    Free Trade Agreement was signed, obliging Singapore to add 20 years to the\n                    then-existing term for authors’ works, performances and phonograms. The\n                    result was that in July 2004, the 1999 Act was amended to reflect the current\n                    copyright term for works as the author’s life plus 70 years. The history\n                    and rationale of the term of copyright will be explicated further below at[57]–[60].Formalities30     There is no requirement of registration before\n                    copyright protection attaches under the Act. However, in order for copyright to\n                    subsist, s 27 of the Act requires that one of the following connecting\n                    factors must exist in relation to the work or subject matter in question, that\n                    is:(a)     that the author or maker be a\n                        “qualified person”;(b)     that the work or subject matter be first published in\n                        Singapore; or(c)     in the case of sound recordings, films and broadcasts, that they be made in\n                        Singapore.This will be elaborated upon further below at[46]–[56].31     As mentioned above, the sections in the Act\n                    are largely modelled on the Australian Copyright Act 1968, which was found to be\n                    the most compatible with Singapore’s requirements bearing in mind\n                    “our legal system [and] our need to be up-to-date and\n                    comprehensive”: seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates,\n                        Official Report(5 May 1986) vol 48 at col 12\n                    (Prof S Jayakumar, Second Minister for Law). However as we have\n                    earlier stated, English cases still have significance since both Singapore and\n                    Australia copyright law have deep English roots.Copyright protection in compilations32     It is necessary that the Tables fall under one\n                    of the categories of subject matter accorded protection. Section 7A of the\n                    Act reads as follows:-Literary works include compilation\n                            and computer program7A. —(1) For the purposes of this Act,\n                        “literary work” includes —(a)    a compilation in\n                                any form; and(b)    a computer\n                                program.(2)    Any copyright\n                            subsisting in a compilation by virtue of Part III\n                        —(a)    is limited to the selection or arrangement of\n                                its contents which constitutes an intellectual creation;\n                            and...(3)    For the purposes of this section\n                        —“compilation” means —...(c)    a compilation, or table, of data other than\n                                relevant materials or parts of relevant materials,which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of its contents,\n                        constitutes an intellectual creation;Typically, provided a subject matter can reasonably be called a table,\n                    compilation or database, it will almost always fall within the statutory\n                    description: seeCopingerat para 3-27. The\n                    information in the Tables inPunters’ Waywould clearly constitute a table of data other than relevant materials, capable\n                    of being termed a “compilation”, and by extension, the Tables\n                    would be a “literary work”. It has therefore been common ground\n                    that the Tables inPunters’ Wayare indeed\n                    compilations. But, in order for any copyright to subsist in the compilation, the\n                    selection or arrangement of its contents must be the product of intellectual\n                    creation.33     It has been rightly pointed out, inGeorge Wei,The Law of Copyright in\n                        Singapore(SNP Editions, 2nd Ed, 2000) (“George Wei”) at p 1331, that the notion of\n                        “intellectual creation” ties in\n                    with the basic copyright principle that only “original”\n                    compilations are protected by copyright. The test for compilations remains the\n                    same as the general test for a literary work, namely that of originality –\n                    whether there is sufficient amount of skill, labour and judgment involved in the\n                    creative process.34     This threshold is heavily fact-centric and it\n                    is often a problematic matter of “which side of the line the case\n                    falls”: seeChilton v Progress Printing\n                        Company[1895] 2 Ch 29. Similarly,George\n                        Weipoints out at p 54 that:[while the] basic notion of originality is easy enough to understand and\n                        to apply at a broad level of abstraction; it is much more tricky at its\n                        margins, especially in the case of fact based works...In the same vein, it has also been observed inCopingerat para 3-130 that there is no guiding principle\n                    as to the precise quantum of labour, skill or judgment required, but rather it\n                    is a question of fact and degree and thus has to be determined on the facts of\n                    the particular case.35     As an aside, it can be said that the\n                    Anglo-Australian requirement of originality, while taking account of the\n                    intellectual effort of the author, has traditionally placed greater emphasis on\n                    the time, labour and effort involved. However, we note that several of the cases\n                    where copyright was granted in respect of seemingly mundane compilations (such\n                    as a timetable index, street directories, football fixture lists and a racing\n                    information service) were decided predominantly in the early 19th century to the\n                    early 20th century, before computer usage became part of everyday life. With the\n                    proliferation of computers and the ready availability of software, the law on\n                    copyright ought also to evolve to take into account the ease and convenience\n                    that computers bring to the process of compiling in the 21st century. Tediously\n                    painstaking works when done manually, such as the tabulation of timetables, or\n                    broadcasting programmes, are now effortlessly completed with the touch of a\n                    computer key or two, without much exertion or skill being called for. Older\n                    decisions that had focussed on the gathering of information as the touchstone\n                    rather than the productive effort involved in expression may therefore require\n                    reconsideration one day.36     For now, it can be said that where someone has\n                    expended effort in creating something that has some literary value, it is worthy\n                    of protection, irrespective of the precise quantum of intellectual input\n                    involved in producing it or the literary merits or novelty of the work product.\n                    Having stated this general proposition, we should caution that “[w]hen\n                    the particular form of expression contains facts and information, it is not\n                    helpful to refer to the “rough and practical test [inUniversity of London Press, Limited v University Tutorial Press,\n                        Limited[1916] 2 Ch 601 (“University Tutorial Press”) at 610] that what is worth\n                    copying is prima facie worth protecting””: seeIceTV Pty Limited v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd[2009] HCA 14\n                    at [31].37     This is because the law of copyright does not\n                    protect ideas, facts or information. It is only the particular form in which the\n                    ideas, facts or information is presented after creativity has been added to the\n                    mix that may be protected. Similarly, it is not the preparatory efforts or\n                    process of gathering facts that is protected. Rather it is the thought effort\n                    involved in creating the particular form of expression that is embraced by\n                    copyright. Not infrequently, the expression of data, say, through an\n                    alphabetical listing, will involve little ingenuity or skill beyond mechanical\n                    labour or routine programming. In such matters, it may be difficult to argue\n                    that copyright protection is called for.38     In assessing copyright for compilations, in\n                    particular, we think it is always profitable to bear in mind the four key\n                    principles discerningly summarised inFeist Publications Inc\n                        v Rural Telephone Service Company Inc. 499 US 340 (1991).\n                    First, facts are not copyrightable. Second, compilations of facts, however, are\n                    generally copyrightable. Third, thesine qua nonof copyright is originality. Fourth, originality simply means that the work was\n                    independently created by the author and that it possesses some minimal degree of\n                    creativity, the level of creativity required being extremely low: seeGeorge Weiat pp 84–85.39     In this matter, the Second Issue of whether\n                    copyright subsists in the Tables inPunters’\n                        Wayand if so whether the Appellant has infringed that copyright,\n                    rests primarily on the fourth principle – the existence of a minimum\n                    degree of creativity independently exercised by the author. However, before\n                    addressing the Second Issue, we turn now to the prior First Issue, which deals\n                    with whether the Tables were independently created by the Respondent as an\n                    author.The First Issue: Is the Respondent entitled to assert copyright\n                protection as the author of its publication?40     A leading treatise on intellectual property,\n                    Staniforth Ricketson and Christopher Creswell,The Law of\n                        Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs & Confidential\n                        Information(Lawbook Co, 2nd Ed (Revised),\n                    2010 release) (“Ricketson”) at\n                    para 7.45 states that originality refers to “the contribution which\n                    is made by the author to the form in which the work is expressed”. This\n                    approach was underscored in the storied decision of Isaacs J inSands & McDougall Pty Ltd v Robinson(1917)\n                    23 CLR 49, where it was noted (at 55–56):in copyright law the two expressions “author” and\n                        “original work” have always been correlative;the one connotes the other. [emphasis added]41     It seems plain to us after our brief overview\n                    of the copyright scheme above that ever since the enactment of the Statute of\n                    Anne, the objective of copyright law has been to encourage the creativity of\n                    natural authors.The identification of the author is\n                        therefore a key function of copyright law as that is the person who is\n                        entitled to the benefits conferred by law.42     Returning to the facts, it is crucial to note\n                    that the Respondent unequivocally pleaded in its Statement of Claim (Amendment\n                    No. 1) that italonewas the original author\n                    of the Tables inPunters’ Way; and that the\n                    Tables were the intellectual creation of the Respondent. No human individuals\n                    were identified.Further, no copyright claim was made in\n                        respect of the software that was responsible for generating the relevant\n                        tables. For ease of reference we reproduce the relevant portion\n                    of the pleading:8.    In particular, most of the information that was\n                            compiled in “Punters’\n                            Way” is specially tabulated according to its nature\n                            and contents.Among other information, there is a set\n                                of four tables which is specially compiled by the\n                                [Respondent]. This set of tables is compiled in a\n                            sequence after very careful consideration and trial runs. It gives\n                            [readers] quick reference and useful guides.The\n                                [Respondent] creates this compilation and is its author. It is the\n                                [Respondent’s] original literary work and there are no similar\n                                horse-racing publications either within Singapore or outside\n                                Singapore that has compiled the four tables in such a\n                                manner. [emphasis added]43     It should be noted that the Respondent had not\n                    pleadedownershipof the Tables.Authorship and ownership are not synonymous terms. The\n                    former refers to the concept of creating and the latter to one of possessing\n                    proprietary rights. An author need not be an owner and the converse is equally\n                    true. Further, the authorship of the Tables was not pleaded as one of\n                    joint-authorship by the Respondent’s employees. The crucial issue which\n                    therefore arises is whether the Respondent, as a body corporate can indeed\n                    legally be considered an author of a copyrighted work assuming that this was\n                    factually what happened. We shall now consider this issue.Who is an author?44     First, the Act, and similarly the Australian\n                    Copyright Act 1968, is silent as to the definition of “author”,\n                    except to say in s 7 that an author, in relation to a photograph, means the\n                    person who took the photograph. As a result, the answer to who an author is can\n                    only be deduced from other sources.45     A useful starting point is s 9 of the UK\n                    Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988 (c 48) (UK) (“the 1988 UK\n                    Act”). Section 9(1) of the 1988 UK Act provides that an\n                    “author”, in relation to a work, means the person who creates it.\n                    This definition is reiterated in David Hay gen ed,Words\n                        and Phrases Legally Definedvol I (LexisNexis,\n                    4th Edition, 2007) at p 212.46     Second, a closer examination of s 27 of\n                    the Act seems obligatory (in the light of the Appellant’s arguments) in\n                    order to ascertain the legislative intent of who an “author” might\n                    be. Section 27 provides the following:Original works in which copyright\n                            subsists27. —(1) ...…(2)    Subject to the\n                            provisions of this Act,where an original\n                                literary, dramatic, musical or artisticwork has been published—(a)    copyright shall\n                                subsist in the work; or(b)    if copyright in\n                                the work subsisted immediately before its first publication,\n                                copyright shall continue to subsist in the work,if, but only if —(c)    the first\n                                publication of the work took place in Singapore;(d)    the author of\n                                the work was a qualified person at the time when the work was first\n                                published; or(e)    the author died\n                                before that time but was a qualified person immediately before his\n                                death....(4)    In this section, “qualified person” means a citizen of Singapore or a person\n                                resident in Singapore.[emphasis added]47     The Appellant argued that s 27 of the Act\n                    requires an author to be a “qualified person”, and as\n                    “qualified person” has been defined to mean “a citizen of\n                    Singapore or a person resident in Singapore”[note: 1]in\n                    s 27(4) of the Act, the Respondent as a body corporate cannot claim to be\n                    an author under the Act. We have difficulties with this\n                contention.48     The Judge, in our view, was correct in holding\n                    that sub-ss 27(2)(c), (d) and (e) of the Act are\n                    disjunctive, and not conjunctive. This is also the settled Australian position:\n                    see below at[49]. Australia, as a signatory\n                    to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\n                    (“the Berne Convention”) had to give effect to Art 3(1) of\n                    the Berne Convention, which sets out alternative connecting factors based on an\n                    author’s personal status and the place of first publication of the work.\n                    Protection will be accorded where one of the connecting factors is established.\n                    Having acceded to the Berne Convention in December 1998, Singapore has also\n                    unambiguously agreed to comply with the minimum terms set out by the Berne\n                    Convention. In any event, as s 27 of the Act was modelled on s 32 of\n                    the Australian Copyright Act 1968, we do not think it can be seriously argued\n                    that the position in Singapore differs from the Australian one on\n                this.49Ricketsonat\n                    para 5.10 confirms that only one of the “connecting factors”\n                    is required by s 32 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 to be present, at\n                    the time the type of work or subject matter in question is created or made, for\n                    copyright to subsist. These connecting factors refer either to the personal\n                    status of the author or maker of the work or other subject matter at the time of\n                    making (“the personal criterion”) or to the place of first\n                    publication of the subject matter (“the territorial criterion”).\n                    It is therefore abundantly clear that the personal criterion and the territorial\n                    criterion are meant to be alternatives, and fulfilling either criterion would\n                    suffice.50     We note thatGeorge\n                        Weiat p 288, fn 118, also takes the same view\n                    that:s 27(2) essentially sets out twoalternativeconnecting factors for published works, namely,\n                        first publication in Singapore (s 27(2)(c)) and the personal status of\n                        the author as a qualified person (s 27(2)(d) & (e)). It is\n                        submitted that it is not necessary under s 27(2) for published works to\n                        be both first published in Singapore and made by a qualified person at the\n                        relevant time. Either factor will do ...It is submitted\n                            that limbs (c), (d) and (e) of s 27(2) do not set out cumulative\n                            requirements. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis\n                        added in bold italics]Satisfying either the personal criterion or the territorial criterion\n                    is sufficient for the work to acquire copyright in Singapore. The Judge,\n                    therefore, quite correctly rejected the Appellant’s submissions at trial\n                    that the author must be a qualified person, as this would make\n                        s 27(2)(d) mandatory, contrary to the\n                    intent of the statute.51     The Judge was also correct when she held that\n                    the purpose of s 27(2) was only to ensure that a claim for copyright had\n                    sufficient connection with Singapore in order to warrant protection under the\n                    Act, rather than to provide a definition of who could be an author of a\n                    subsisting copyright under the Act: see [26] of the Judgment.52     However, the Judge erred in declaring\n                    subsequently (at [25] of the Judgment)\n                    that “although the author of the work must be a qualified personfor the purposesof meeting the criteria of\n                        s 29(2)(d), there is no statutory\n                    provision that exhaustively states that the only “author” relevant\n                    for all purposes of the Copyright Actmustbe a\n                    qualified person” [emphasis in original]. The Judge relied on s 2 of\n                    the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the\n                    Interpretation Act”) (which defines “person” to include any\n                    company or association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated) to\n                    substantiate her point, and added, for good measure, that there are also no\n                    statutory provisions in the Act which state that an author must necessarily be a\n                    living person: see [25] of the\n                    Judgment.53     While it is true that s 2 of the\n                    Interpretation Act defines “person” as including a company, it\n                    must be remembered that the words and expressions defined in the Interpretation\n                    Act only have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the absence of\n                    anything in the subject or context of the relevant statute that is inconsistent\n                    with such meanings. As a matter of principle, in interpreting statutes, the\n                    general ordinarily gives way to the special or particular.54     It is also interesting to briefly digress and\n                    note that an altogether different position has been statutorily adopted in\n                    Malaysia. In the Malaysian Copyright Act 1987 (Act 332) (Malaysia), the\n                    term “qualified person” has been expanded to include:(a)    in relation to an individual, ... a person who is\n                            a citizen of, or a permanent resident in, Malaysia; and (b) in\n                            relation to a body corporate, ... a body corporate established in\n                            Malaysia and constituted or vested with legal personality under the laws\n                            of Malaysia …The Malaysian definition of “qualified person” is\n                    thus fundamentally different from the definition in the Act and the Australian\n                    Copyright Act 1968, both of which do not explicitly provide for a body\n                    corporate. It therefore does not come as a surprise that the Malaysian courts\n                    have had no difficulty in interpreting the word “author” as\n                    referring not only to natural persons, but also to companies: seeCreative Purpose Sdn Bhd & Anor v Integrated Trans Corp Sdn Bhd\n                        & Ors[1997] 2 MLJ 429. However, since the Act is silent\n                    on this point, can it similarly be inferred that non-living\n                    “persons” could be authors for the purposes of\n                copyright?55     Returning to the legal position here, it is\n                    also noteworthy that leading treatises in Australia and England take the view\n                    that only natural persons can be qualified persons.Ricketsonat para 5.20 unequivocally points out\n                    that:In the context of s 32 of theCopyright Act\n                            1968(Cth) [(equivalent to s 27 of the Act)] (which is\n                        concerned with works), it is clear that “qualified person”\n                        applies only to natural persons. [emphasis in original]56     Likewise, Kevin Lindgren QCet al,Copyright and Designsvol 1 (LexisNexis, 2004) at para 12,040, states:It is important to note that a body corporate cannot be a\n                        “qualified person” in relation to original works. The reason\n                        for this is that the “qualified person” and first owner of\n                        copyright in an original work is the “author”, and although a\n                        body corporate may be the copyright owner by virtue of the operation of a\n                        contract of employment, an assignment, or in any of the other ways expressly\n                        provided for in [the Australian Copyright Act 1968],it\n                            cannot be an author. [emphasis added]We also note thatCopingerat\n                    para 4-10 has taken the view that:[w]ith very limited exceptions [such as computer-generated works and old\n                        photographs],the “author” of these\n                            categories of work must be a natural person. The fact that\n                        one person is acting as employee of another cannot affect the question of\n                        authorship, nor can the fact that one person is an agent for another...\n                        [emphasis added]With these views in mind we will now excavate further the historical\n                    and legislative policy considerations undergirding this issue.A non-living author?57     The 19th century saw the emergence of the\n                    European doctrine ofdroit moralunder which\n                    authors’ intellectual and creative rights in their works were recognised\n                    in addition to their purely economic rights. Continental jurisdictions therefore\n                    regarded an author’s work as an emanation or extension of his or her\n                    personality, inseparably linked with his or her honour and reputation and thus\n                    deserving of a long period of protection: seeRicketsonat para 6.55. This concept naturally leads to the\n                    conclusion that an author must be a human being.58     Hugh Laddieet\n                        al,The Modern Law of Copyright and\n                        Designsvol 1 (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 2000)\n                        (“Laddie”) points out at para\n                    10.8 that the Berne Convention is concerned with the rights of human authors to\n                    their original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. As a consequence,\n                    Laddie further observes, thatthe Continental legal tradition has always been to\n                    regard the author’s right to his property as the starting point, and to\n                    look upon limitations to its term as a regrettable necessity. It is because of\n                    this that Art 7 of the Berlin Revision of the Berne Convention in 1908\n                    provided that the term of protection should include the life of the author plus\n                    50 years after his death. The extension of the term of copyright was\n                    inextricably linked to increased life expectancies at that time.59     The UK’s approach to the duration of\n                    copyright has been slightly different from that of the Continental jurisdictions\n                    in that “those who seek legislation in favour of exclusive privileges\n                    which restrain trade and freedom of communication ought to show that they are\n                    justified in the public interest”: seeLaddieat para 10.8. This approach equally takes into\n                    account the fact that the starting point of copyright is a human author. Both\n                    the UK Copyright Act 1911 and the 1988 UK Act have provided for the term of\n                    protection as the author’s life plus 50 years. This was supposed to\n                    reflect two generations of heirs of the author. However, with increased life\n                    expectancy in developed countries, especially in regional groupings where the\n                    majority of member countries are developed with relatively high standards of\n                    living such as the European Union, it was unsurprising that the European\n                    Commission issued a directive in 1993 which increased thepost mortem auctorisperiod to 70 years, and this has been\n                    implemented in the UK since 1995.60     Since the duration of copyright protection has\n                    always been based on the author’s life expectancy and the rationale for\n                    thepost mortem auctoristerm was so as to benefit\n                    two generations of the author’s heirs, it is patently clear that\n                    incorporated bodies were never contemplated to have been “authors”\n                    for the purposes of copyright. It would be absurd to suggest that a company\n                    could have a lifespan, let alone generations of heirs. Thus, it must follow that\n                    authors have to be living persons.61     However, the Judge found that there was no\n                    difficulty in accepting that an incorporated body could be the author of an\n                    original work: see[31]of the Judgment. The\n                    Judge considered that it would be (at [32] of the Judgment):consistent with the statutory regime found in [the Act] if the copyright\n                        in the work is found to expire 70 years after the expiration of the calendar\n                        year in which the work was first published.This is provided for in ss 28(3) and 29 of the Act in situations\n                    where a work is unpublished before the death of the author, or where it is an\n                    anonymous and pseudonymous work.62     In our view, the Judge plainly erred on this\n                    point. Neither of these scenarios is present in this case. There was no\n                    posthumous publication because if the Respondent qualifies as the\n                    “author” of the Tables,Punters’\n                        Waywould have been published during the “lifetime”\n                    of the Respondent. Similarly, if the Respondent was the author of the Tables,\n                    then the Tables cannot possibly be an anonymous or pseudonymous work and\n                    s 29 does not apply. The prerequisites for the operation of either section\n                    have not been satisfied by the Respondent.63     Sections 28 and 29 of the Act are in pari\n                    materia with ss 33 and 34 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968. It has been\n                    established that the rationale of these provisions is to encourage the ultimate\n                    disclosure and dissemination of protected works and the information and\n                    knowledge that they contain. This objective would not be achieved if such works\n                    remain protected indefinitely and are withheld from the public domain.\n                    Superimposing ss 28(3) and 29 onto the factual matrix at hand would be\n                    wrong as these provisions plainly do not contemplate scenarios where an\n                    incorporated body is an author. Since it is not possible to rely on the date of\n                    publication as the litmus test for the expiry of the copyright, it appears that\n                    if a company qualifies as an author it would possess an indefinite and\n                    extraordinary perpetual copyright to its work. Pertinently, we should add, sub-\n                    ss 28(3) and 28(5) of the Act expressly refer to the “death of an\n                    author” as the reference event for copyright protection in certain\n                    instances. Why would this be the case if non living authors were intended to be\n                    embraced by the Act?64     The rationale underpinning copyright\n                    protection is not about the utility of the work, but rather the protection of\n                    the originality of the expression employed to communicate ideas. It is therefore\n                    unhelpful to say that the contents in a compilation will become obsolete,\n                    irrelevant or useless after some time, and therefore not worth copying or\n                    protecting, for as long as there is evidence of originality in the work,\n                    protection is conferred. Even if the work becomes obsolete after time, the\n                    copyright owner would still be able to bring an action against anyone who\n                    utilises the work for an infringement of copyright, regardless of the relevancy\n                    of the work at that time. Should companies and like entities qualify as authors,\n                    they would be entitled to claim a perpetual monopoly over their works to\n                    maximise the economic returns of copyright protection. This would be contrary to\n                    the underlying policy of the Act which is to accord copyright protection for a\n                    limited duration that best strikes a balance between the competing public and\n                    private interests: see above at[26]–[29].65     It also seems obvious that authorship by a\n                    company could never have been contemplated by the Statute of Anne as companies\n                    operating as distinct legal entities were not a typical feature of commerce when\n                    it was enacted. In the UK, prior to the mid-19th century, incorporation was only\n                    done by way of royal charter or by private Act of Parliament. However, the Crown\n                    and Parliament were usually suspicious of lending their dignity and the benefits\n                    of separate personality to commercial organisations. As a result, most\n                    joint-stock companies did not have separate legal personality. Parliament\n                    finally permitted the incorporation of companies by registration when it passed\n                    the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 (7 & 8 Vict c 110) (UK).66     It was only in the late 19th century that\n                    there was a proliferation of incorporated entities in the UK and whereupon a\n                    registered company could acquire separate personality upon registration. This\n                    principle of separate legal corporate personality was affirmed in the celebrated\n                    case ofAron Salomon v A. Salomon and Company,\n                        Limited[1897] AC 22.67     From the foregoing, it is clear that the\n                    historical origins of the Act envisaged rights to be accorded to natural persons\n                    and not corporate bodies, and that legal rights flowed only from human\n                    authorship. In addition, it is telling that the duration of copyright in subject\n                    matter other than works is merely stated as continuing to subsist until the\n                    expiration of 70 (or 50) years after the expiration of the calendar year in\n                    which the recording/film/broadcast was first published/made. Our views are\n                    further fortified by the recent decision of the Australian Federal Court of\n                    Appeal inTelstra Corporation Limited v Phone Directories\n                        Company Pty Ltd[2010] FCAFC 149 (“the Telstra\n                    Appeal”), where two members of the quorum stated unequivocally (at\n                        [100] and [134]) that under Australian law an author\n                    had to be a human author.68     We note that the Judge also relied on the case\n                    ofAlteco Chemical Pte Ltd v Chong Yean Wah (trading as\n                        Yamayo Stationery Manufactuer)[1999] 2 SLR(R) 915\n                        (“Alteco”), to support the\n                    proposition that an incorporated body could be the author of a copyright\n                    protected work. In that decision, it appears that a “modern”\n                    interpretation of authorship was created, suggesting that the author had become\n                    the person who made the necessary arrangements and paid for the creation of the\n                    work. A company could therefore be the author of the work if its employees\n                    created the work product.69     However, the High Court inAltecodid not expressly declare that a company could be an\n                    author of a work, a point acknowledged by the Judge. Further, the decision inAltecoseemed to have blurred the distinctions\n                    between the concepts of authorship and ownership. In Tan Tee Jim, SC and Ng-Loy\n                    Wee Loon, “Intellectual Property Law” (2000) 1 SAL Ann Rev\n                    230 at 235–237, 251 (“Tan and\n                    Ng”), the authors observe that theAltecocase failed to make the distinction between authorship\n                    and copyright ownership in s 30 of the Act. AsTan and\n                        Ngrightly point out, in essence what the Court did was to imply\n                    a constructive trust against the author of the work, thereby allowing the parent\n                    company to own the work, and there was no necessity for a “modern”\n                    interpretation of the word “author”.70     This view has been similarly reiterated inGeorge Weiat pp 1391–1393. He\n                    points out that the Act adequately governs the law on ownership, even for\n                    foreign works which enjoy copyright in Singapore. Additionally, it is observed\n                    that the person who made arrangements for the production of a work, or who paid\n                    for the work – as in the case ofAlteco– would not be entitled to claim to be the author of the work as this did\n                    not generally relate to authorship skills. We agree.Alteco’s innovative tailoring of the term\n                    “author” ought not to be followed.71     It must be emphasised that a work created by\n                    an employee author has a limited duration dependent on the life of the employee\n                    even if first ownership vests in the employer. Thus while the law accepts that a\n                    person other than the author may be a first owner, the question of who the\n                    author is remains a distinct and an important one.72     We therefore reject the Respondent’s\n                    argument that an “author” for the purposes of copyright law can\n                    and should extend to corporate entities. It would clearly be against public\n                    policy to allow copyright protection in perpetuity. This would be the scenario\n                    should a company be deemed capable of being an author for the purpose of\n                    copyright. Section 2 of the Interpretation Act ought not to be incorporated\n                    into the rubric of copyright law, and an “author” must be a\n                    natural person in copyright law.Can a natural author be identified?73     The identification of an author is still\n                    pertinent as s 27 of the Act provides that in order for copyright to\n                    subsist in a work, the work must be original. As mentioned in[40]above, originality is closely related to the\n                    author. This principle was recently affirmed inTelstra\n                        Corporation Limited and Another v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd and\n                        Others[2010] FCA 44 (“Telstra”). Gordon J masterfully condensed the\n                    position thus at [20]:... “originality” under [the Australian Copyright Act 1968]\n                        “means that the creation … of the work required some\n                        independent intellectual effort” and/or the exercise of\n                        “sufficient effort of a literary nature”. … [E]ach\n                        phrase confirms that for a work to be sufficiently original for the\n                        subsistence of copyright, “substantial labour” and/or\n                        “substantial expense” is not alone sufficient. More is\n                        required. What that more is will, of course, vary from case to case butmust involve “originality” by an\n                            identified author in an identified work. [emphasis\n                        added]74     In theTelstra\n                        Appealat [32],\n                    Keane CJ heartily affirmed Gordon J’sdicta:Authorship and originality are correlatives. The question of whether\n                        copyright subsists is concerned with the particular form of expression of\n                        the work. You must identify authors, and those authors must direct their\n                        contribution (assessed as either an “independent intellectual\n                        effort” of a “sufficient effort of a literary nature”)\n                        to the particular form of expression of the work.Start\n                            with the work. Find its authors. They must have done\n                        something, howsoever defined, that can be considered original. [emphasis\n                        added]75     We agree with this approach. An author must\n                    first be identified before the work in question can be deemed to be original. In\n                    fact, the Respondent’s counsel acknowledge in the Respondent’s\n                    skeletal submissions, that all that is required for the test for originality is\n                    that “the work originates with an author or joint authors from some\n                    independent intellectual effort”. Since the Respondent is unable to\n                    assert that it is the author of the work as a body corporate, the remaining\n                    question at this juncture is whether the Respondent is even able to identify\n                    specific human authors of the Tables. To avoid doubt, we should add that it is\n                    not necessary to name each and every author to make out a claim for copyright\n                    protection but it has to be shown that the work product in question has been\n                    generated from human author(s) working alone or collaboratively,ie, the existence of such persons must be clearly\n                    established.76     The Respondent’s witness Phan Tjun Sern\n                    (“Phan”) had stated in his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief\n                        (“AEIC”)[note: 2]thatPunters’ Waywas a continuing project,\n                    developed from ideas and valuable contributions by racing professionals and\n                    readers. However, ideas and contributions put forward by the readers and horse\n                    racing experts would not be protected by the scope of copyright, as copyright\n                    protects the material form of a work, and not the ideas in the work. Even if the\n                    suggestions could be protected, the readers and horse racing experts were not\n                    employees of the Respondent, and correspondingly, the Respondent would not be\n                    able to claim copyright ownership of the Tables, if any.77     Further, relying on a passage inLaddieat para 3.94, the Respondent submits that the\n                    definition of a literary work includes a compilation, and the author of such a\n                    work is the person who gathers or organises the collection of material and who\n                    selects, orders and arranges it. The Respondent then contends that as its\n                    employees were the people who gathered, organised, selected, ordered and\n                    arranged the information and data, they were the authors of the Tables, which\n                    was an original work capable of being protected by copyright.78     However, we hesitate to accept this definition\n                    of authors in this situation. Although the contributions of these individuals\n                    may have led to the compilation of the work, they were not part of the actual\n                    process of compilation. In this context, theTelstra\n                        Appealat [92] is\n                    instructive. It affirmed that where the work of individuals was not\n                    collaborative, but was instead merely organised to facilitate the production of\n                    the work, this would not be collaboration of the kind contemplated by the\n                    definition of joint authorship.79     Here, the collection of the horse-racing data,\n                    such as the horses’ and jockeys’ names, as well as their track work\n                    records, and the organisation and selection of such data were either\n                    computerised, or done by separate people. However, each individual’s\n                    responsibility and contribution (which has not been particularised) was, based\n                    on the evidence before us, insufficient to render the individual an author, or\n                    joint author of the Tables.80     It certainly cannot be said that a reader who\n                    writes in with suggestions for the improvement of the publication can be\n                    considered an “author”. Neither can the IT employee who entered\n                    the names of the horses in a race be considered an “author” of the\n                    compilation. Although it is undeniable that both contributed to the end product,\n                    data aggregation or input is not creativity.81     Not infrequently, in cases involving a high\n                    degree of automation, there will be no original work produced for the simple\n                    reason that there are no identifiable human authors. This may well be the reason\n                    why the Respondent was unable to identify any particular individual or\n                    individuals or a specific group of people as being the human authors of the\n                    Tables. However, whatever the case may be, it is clear that copyright cannot\n                    subsist without a human author, and the Respondent is unable to even begin to\n                    satisfactorily identify any author, let alone, authors. It remains unclear who\n                    was responsible for the compilations. Even assumingarguendothat the Respondent’s employees had some\n                    authorship role in the compilations, the evidence did not satisfactorily\n                    establish when copyright protection attached.82     In the circumstances, without the\n                    identification of a human author from whom the work originates, there can be no\n                    “original work” capable of copyright protection. We therefore find\n                    that the Respondent’s claim that copyright subsists in the Tables that\n                    were “authored” by it fails.The statutory presumptions83     Additionally, the Act contains statutory\n                    presumptions designed to assist a claimant in a copyright action for\n                    infringement of copyright. We now examine these presumptions to determine if\n                    they can assist the Respondent’s claim.84     The Judge found (at [35] of the Judgment) that the presumption\n                    under s 131 of the Act applies – where a name purporting to be that\n                    of the author of a literary work appeared on copies of the work as published,\n                    then it shall be presumed unless the contrary is established that the person is\n                    the author of the work. The Judge therefore accepted that the Respondent was the\n                    author of the Tables as its name appeared onPunters’\n                        Wayand the onus was on the Appellant to disprove the\n                    Respondent’s authorship.85     It is pertinent, however, that the Respondent\n                    itself acknowledges that s 131 of the Act is not applicable in the present\n                    circumstances, as the Respondent’s name appears only as\n                    “Publisher” inPunters’ Way,\n                    and not as the author.86     The statutory presumption which the Respondent\n                    might be entitled to rely on would be s 132 of the Act, which\n                    provides:Presumptions in relation to\n                            publisher of work132.    Where, in an action\n                            brought by virtue of this Part in relation to a literary, dramatic,\n                            musical or artistic work, section 131 does not apply, but it\n                            is established —(a)    that the work\n                                was first published in Singapore and was so published during\n                                the period of 70 years that ended immediately before the\n                                commencement of the calendar year in which the action was brought;\n                                and(b)    that a name\n                                purporting to be that of the publisher appeared on copies of the\n                                work as first published,then, unless the contrary is established, copyright shall be presumed to\n                        subsist in the work and the person whose name so appeared shall be presumed\n                        to have been the owner of that copyright at the time of the\n                        publication.As the Respondent is identified as the publisher inPunters’ Way, the Respondent contends that copyright\n                    subsists in the Tables, and the Respondent would be presumed to be the\n                    owner.87     Section 128 of the Australian Copyright\n                    Act 1968 isin pari materiawith s 132 of the\n                    Act, and this issue was comprehensively dealt with inTelstra. We agree fully with Gordon J’s analysis on\n                    s 128 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (equivalent to s 132 of the\n                    Act) at [37]:In my view, the Applicants’ reliance upon\n                            ss 128 and 129 is misplaced. Each section reinforces the importance\n                            of identifying the author or authors of the work in suit. In\n                        understanding the operation of the presumptions it is important to note the\n                        distinction between identifyinganauthor or\n                        authors of the original work andthe identity of\n                            theauthor or authors of the original work. Lest it be\n                        overstated, the [Australian Copyright Act 1968] fixes on the author or\n                        authors ... .If an author or authors (within the\n                            meaning of the [Australian Copyright Act 1968]) cannot be\n                            identifiedat all, in\n                            contradistinction to a situation where the author’s or\n                            authors’ exact identity cannot be identified, copyright cannot\n                            subsist. On a reading of ss 128 and 129, it is the latter situation\n                            to which the [Australian Copyright Act 1968] is directed.\n                        [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]88     The Respondent also relies on the case ofWaterlow Publishers Ltd v Rose[1995] FSR 207\n                        (“Waterlow”), which referred to\n                    the presumption in s 20(4) of the UK Copyright Act 1956 (4 & 5 Eliz\n                    2 Ch 74), which is similar to s 132 of the Act. In Waterlow, the fact\n                    that the publisher’s name appeared on the copies of the work was enough to\n                    justify a finding that the presumption applied, in accordance with the intention\n                    of s 20(4). Even though there were no identifiable authors, copyright was\n                    held to nonetheless subsist in the relevant work, with the publisher being the\n                    owner of the copyright.89     However, cases which have relied on the\n                    equivalent of the s 132 presumption, such asWaterlowandMicrosoft Corporation v DHD\n                        Distribution Pty Ltd (t/as Austin Computers)(1999) 45 IPR\n                    459, did not deal with the scenario where the very fact of authorship took\n                    centre stage. Further, the presumption was also not decisive in the dispute and\n                    it was not argued in those cases that an author could not be identified at all.\n                    These cases are therefore of limited assistance here. We also note thatWaterlowappears to be anex temporedecision. This is another reason why undue deference\n                    should not be accorded to it.90Laddieat\n                    para 3.94 states that where no name purporting to be that of the author\n                    appears on the work as first published, but that of the publisher appears, there\n                    is potentially available under s 104(4) of the 1988 UK Act a presumption\n                    that the named person was the owner of the copyright at the time of publication.\n                    However, Gordon J inTelstra(at [39]) thought that at its highest, this\n                    passage merely suggests that it may be necessary in particular instances to rely\n                    upon the statutory presumptions. Further, these presumptions have little or no\n                    role to play where the question of subsistence of copyright in each of the works\n                    is the central issue between the parties.91     Pertinently, it has also been observed inLaddieat para 39.85:All that the presumption does is to compel the court to reach the\n                        appropriate conclusion in the absence of evidence to the contrary. If the\n                        opponent does offer evidence in rebuttal (sufficient to satisfy the legal\n                        requirement ofsomeevidence) the presumption\n                        disappears, and the case is in the court’s hands free from any rule.\n                        [emphasis in original]As authorship is in dispute in the present case and the Appellant has\n                    adduced evidence that copyright does not subsist in the Tables since there is no\n                    author, the s 132 statutory presumption has been displaced.92     We round up our analysis of this issue by\n                    emphasising that it is settled practice that the necessary elements of\n                    authorship, ownership, validity and subsistence must be adequately pleaded for\n                    cases involving copyright infringement: seeBullen &\n                        Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadingsvol 2\n                    (Lord Brennan and William Blair gen eds) (Sweet & Maxwell,\n                    14th Ed, 2001) at para 66-Q1. The Respondent has found itself in a quandary\n                    having pleaded that the company is the author of the Tables and having\n                    maintained this stance throughout the High Court proceedings. Had the Respondent\n                    merely pleaded to be the owner of the copyright, as the presumed owner of the\n                    copyright assigned to it by its employees, the Respondent would still have had\n                    thelocus standito maintain a claim of\n                    infringement against the Appellant. The Respondent tried to salvage its case by\n                    initially submitting to this Court that the Respondent is both the authorandowner of the Tables. However, in the\n                    course of the hearing of this appeal, the Respondent abruptly changed tack and\n                    submitted that it was primarily arguing its case on the basis of ownership; andalternatively, authorship.93     Regrettably, such a course was no longer open\n                    to the Respondent on the basis of its pleaded case and the conduct of the\n                    proceedings below. It had unequivocally nailed its colours to the mast and the\n                    Appellant had contested the case on that basis. The Respondent cannot now rely\n                    on an alternative claim of ownership which was neither pleaded nor advanced in\n                    the proceedings below.Summary of the First Issue94     In summary, the concept of authorship is\n                    integral to copyright, and no such protection can be accorded without an author\n                    from which an original work emanates, and from which the legal rights flow. We\n                    can do no better than to reiterate the views of Gordon J inTelstraat [35]:[A]uthorship is central to the determination of whether copyright\n                        subsists. To suggest that copyright does not require the identification of\n                        authors where a work is sufficiently original ... puts the cart before the\n                        horse. It ignores the fact that it is the original work of an author or\n                        authors who contribute to the particular form of expression of the work and\n                        reduce the work to a material form that is the act giving rise to the\n                        statutory protection of copyright.95     As the Respondent could not identify a human\n                    author or authors and we find that an incorporated body cannot be an author of a\n                    copyrighted work; we reject the Respondent’s assertion that it was\n                    entitled to copyright protectionquaauthor.\n                    Accordingly, we do not find that copyright subsists in the Tables.The Second Issue: If the Respondent is entitled to copyright\n                protection, has the Appellant infringed its rights?96     As we disagreed with the Judge that the\n                    Respondent is entitled to copyright protection, it is, strictly speaking,\n                    unnecessary for us to delve into the issue of copyright infringement at all.\n                    However, out of deference to counsel, who have made extensive submissions on\n                    this issue, we shall briefly give our views on this as well.97     To start with, it is common ground that the\n                    information in the Tables is freely available in the public domain. The\n                    Respondent acknowledges that the information is “mostly, if not all,\n                    provided in raw form by the related Turf Club. Publishers usually obtain these\n                    data from the Turf Club”[note: 3].98     The Judge found that the Respondent had\n                    organised the information that was to be included inPunters’ Way; set up tables of the information and decided\n                    how best the tables should be presented in a reader-friendly manner; studied,\n                    experimented and compiled the information to be placed inPunters’ Way; and constructed the tables found inPunters’ Way. The Judge noted (at\n                        [40] of the Judgment) that the\n                    threshold for originality was not set at an exceedingly high level. She also\n                    found that there was sufficient skill and labour applied to the Tables, and\n                    agreed with the Respondent that there was originality in terms of the selection,\n                    arrangement and presentation of the information in the Tables: see [41]–[43] of the Judgment.99     More specifically, the Judge eventually (at\n                        [41] of the Judgment) held that the\n                    transformation of such “intangible and unexpressed ideas given by\n                    different personnel ... into the manifested forms as shown in the publications\n                    naturally gave rise to an inference that some effort and labour had been\n                    involved”.100    We agree with the Judge in so far as she\n                    held that the Respondent’s copyright claim cannot be in the information or\n                    data itself, as this is freely available in the public domain. Copyright, if\n                    any, would only exist in the selection, arrangement and presentation of the\n                    information. It is trite that there cannot be a monopoly in facts or\n                    information, but only in the way of presenting or expressing them and it is\n                    always a question of fact whether the skill and labour involved in the\n                    presentation or expression justifies the incidence of copyright: see[33]–[37]above.101    We also agree with the Judge that the\n                    threshold for originality is traditionally low: see[36]and[38]above. InUniversity Tutorial Pressat 608–609,\n                    Peterson J summarised the meaning of originality in the following classical\n                    passage:The word “original” does not in this connection mean that\n                        the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright\n                        Acts are not concerned with the originality of ideas, but with the\n                        expression of thought, and, in the case of “literary work”,\n                        with the expression of thought in print or writing. The originality which is\n                        required relates to the expression of the thought. But the Act does not\n                        require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that\n                        the work must not be copied from another work—that it should originate\n                        from the author.102    The threshold of originality in compilations\n                    has also been helpfully summed up inRicketsonat\n                    para 7.60:[S]omething more is required by way of original authorial contribution\n                        than simply the act of giving material expression to something. ... [This\n                        poses problems] where the work is of a factual or informational kind, and\n                        the author’s contribution consists of an ordering, arrangement or\n                        summarising of that information. ... In such a case, ... the requirement of\n                        “originality” assumes a heightened importance … . It is\n                        only the author’s presentation of the data that is protected, and this\n                        must display or reflect the application of some identifiable element of\n                        skill and labour on the part of the author. The final work therefore must be\n                        more than a bare recital of facts or figures.103    In the present situation, while the Tables\n                    published inPunters’ Waycontain\n                    information extracted from the Turf Club, the Respondent had not merely\n                    reprinted the horse-racing data wholesale or in alphabetical order, but had\n                    selected information it thought relevant and arranged it in a manner that was\n                    thought to be most conducive for readers.104    We find in this context the approach adopted\n                    inInterfirm Comparison (Australia) Pty Ltd v Law Society\n                        (NSW)[1977] RPC 137 instructive. In that case, Bowen CJ\n                    held that despite the fact that the work exhibited little material that could be\n                    regarded as having much novelty or originality in the ordinary sense of that\n                    term, it was specifically drawn for a particular profession and for a particular\n                    purpose and, although it used much old and publicly-known material, it presented\n                    it in a new form as the work of the author. Similarly, despite the fact that the\n                    material used in the Tables was easily accessible to all, the information waspresentedin a distinct form which would\n                    attract copyright protection.105    We therefore accept that the Tables inPunters’ Wayhad a “quality of\n                    character not possessed by the raw material”: seeFortuity Pty Ltd v Barcza(1995) 32 IPR 517. This is\n                    evident as the raw information provided by the Turf Club is distinct from what\n                    was eventually published inPunters’ Waywhich was more comprehensible.Was there a causal connection?106    The Judge found (at [45] of the Judgment) that as the\n                    Appellant’s managing director and sole witness, Levar Steven Michael\n                    (“Levar”), was employed by the Respondent, he had access to the\n                    Tables. However we pause to note that the Judge incorrectly found Levar to have\n                    been previously employed by the Respondent. In actual fact, Levar had set up his\n                    own consultancy services to race clubs and to those who transact in the sale and\n                    purchase of horses. He had done this consultancy work for the Respondent in June\n                    2006. Additionally, although he was also the horse-racing expert on the\n                    Respondent’s website, <http://www.winner21.com>, for around six\n                    months, he was never an employee of the Respondent.107    Nevertheless this distinction is merely\n                    technical, as Levar’s connection with the Respondent was immaterial sincePunters’ Way, as well as the raw data\n                    were freely available in the public domain and Levar could easily have access toPunters’ Way. As long as there is\n                    substantial similarity between the Appellant’s and Respondent’s\n                    work, and it can be shown that the Appellant had access to the\n                    Respondent’s work, this will give rise to aprima\n                        facieinference of copying by the Respondent. But it must be\n                    remembered that this is not just a quantitative assessment, it is essentially a\n                    qualitative test.108    It is established that so long as a causal\n                    connection can be established between the two works, it is not consequential if\n                    the copying is direct or indirect. It is clear in this situation that Levar, or\n                    any of the Appellant’s employees could easily purchase a copy ofPunters’ Wayand adopt its presentation in\n                    subsequent publications ofRacing\n                Guide.109    It is also apparent that over time,Racing Guidepublications morphed and began to\n                    appear somewhat similar toPunters’ Way.\n                    While there used to be an additional “Selections” feature between\n                    Table 1 (Race Card) and Table 2 (Results Panel) ofRacing Guide, this was subsequently altered such that this\n                    feature was incorporated into Table 2, resulting in identical sequential\n                    arrangements of the Tables in both publications. Additionally, the Appellant had\n                    included a “J-1-2-3” feature in Table 1 (Race Card) ofRacing Guide, which mimicked the\n                    “R-1-2-3” feature inPunters’\n                        Way. These were only added after Levar had joined the Appellant\n                    as managing director in 2007. Further, the column for the total runs of the\n                    horses was not featured inRacing Guideprior to\n                    Levar’s taking over the helm of the Appellant.110    From the above, it is apparent that the\n                    Tables inRacing Guidewere derived from the\n                    Tables inPunters’ Way.Was a substantial part of the work copied?111    We agree with the Judge that the Tables inRacing Guidewere arranged in a sequence that\n                    was exactly the same as that found inPunters’\n                        Way. However, although the Judge had found that there was copying\n                    and infringement of the Tables inPunters’\n                        WaybyRacing Guidefrom June\n                    2007–June 2008, no copies of thePunters’\n                        Wayeditions from June 2007–December 2007 were exhibited.\n                    In fact, the earliest copy we have for comparison would be the January 2008\n                    issue. Thus, no finding of copying ought to have been made for the months of\n                    June 2007–December 2007.112    On a comparison of the January 2008 issues\n                    of both publications, we agree with the Judge that the eight columns of\n                    Table 1 (Race Card) found inRacing Guidewere arranged in substantially the same sequence as that inPunters’ Way. There was only a slight difference in that\n                    the last two columns of Table 1 were interchanged. In addition,\n                    Table 2 (Results Panel) was substantially similar in that both publications\n                    included the exact sequence of the top four horses, followed by the\n                    “time” column, with a dollar sign found in each column. Further,\n                    both Tables 3 (Track Work) and 4 (Results of Past Performances) were\n                    sequentially identical.113    We also agree with the Judge that the\n                    existence of dissimilarities did not necessarily mean that there was no copying.\n                    The dissimilarities betweenRacing GuideandPunters’ Waywere eitherde minimisor merely cosmetic. In essence, looking at\n                    the manner of presentation and compilation of the horse-racing information as a\n                    whole, the Tables inRacing Guideincorporated a\n                    substantial part of the Tables found inPunters’\n                        Wayeven with the minor additions inRacing\n                        Guide: see the Judgment at [58]. We do not find it necessary to depart from the\n                    Judge’s finding that,prima facie, a\n                    substantial part of the Tables had been copied and that this had not been\n                    rebutted by the Appellant.114    Nonetheless this finding of copying by the\n                    Appellant is now moot as we have pointed out above that no copyright subsisted\n                    in the work. It follows, therefore, that there was no infringement of the\n                    Respondent’s copyright by the Appellant.The Third Issue: Has the Respondent established the constituent\n                elements for a passing off action?115    Apart from pursuing a claim for copyright\n                    infringement, the Respondent also claimed that the Appellant had committed the\n                    tort of passing off by copying the get-up ofPunters’\n                        Way, which includes the colour code of the front covers, the\n                    picture of forward-facing racehorses and the advertisement panel across the\n                    bottom of the cover. The Respondent claimed that goodwill existed in the get-up\n                    ofPunters’ Wayas it had been selling\n                    copies since 1977, and the colour code had been in place since 1993.\n                    Consequently, the Respondent alleged misrepresentation by the Appellant in\n                    adopting a remarkably similar colour coding and using a similar picture\n                    featuring forward-facing racehorses on the cover ofRacing\n                        Guide. The Respondent also alleged that it had suffered damage as\n                    a result of the passing off.116Novelty Pte Ltd v\n                        Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009] 3 SLR(R) 216\n                        (“Amanresorts”) affirmed (at\n                        [37]) that the “classical\n                    trinity” of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage must be established by\n                    the party seeking to claim passing off before an action can succeed. We now\n                    proceed to examine whether each of these elements have been satisfied by the\n                    Respondent in the present case.Goodwill117    The Respondent is required to establish that\n                    it had acquired goodwill at the relevant date, which is the date on which the\n                    conduct of the Appellant that the Respondent complained of started. The classic\n                    definition of goodwill may be derived fromThe Commissioners\n                        of Inland Revenue v Muller & Co.’s Margarine, Limited[1901] AC 217 at 223–224, which held that goodwill “is the benefit\n                    and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a\n                    business”.118    In the present circumstances, the Respondent\n                    claimed goodwill in: (a) the colour code for the different race days over a\n                    weekend; (b) the picture of forward-facing racehorses; and (c) the\n                    advertisement panel across the bottom of the cover. According to the Respondent,\n                    the colour code has been in use byPunters’\n                        Waysince 1993 in order to allow punters and readers to easily\n                    identify the particular race day they were interested in by the colour of the\n                    book. In addition, the Respondent alleges that since 1977,Punters’ Wayhas been selling an average of 31,000 copies\n                    weekly.119    Whether a get-up has acquired the necessary\n                    distinctiveness is a question of fact. Here, the Respondent has been publishingPunters’ Wayfor around 30 years, since\n                    1977. It has also been shown in a market survey done by Nielsen Company in March\n                        2007[note: 4], that overall the Respondent\n                    enjoyed 80% of the market share in the horse-racing industry in\n                        Singapore[note: 5]. In\n                    addition, Levar acknowledged “thatPunters’\n                        Waywas the market leader in Singapore at various stages in its\n                        history”[note: 6]. With the Appellant’s own\n                    witness acknowledging the dominant presence of the Respondent’s products\n                    in the horse-racing market, it ought to be accepted that there is indeed a\n                    business within the jurisdiction of Singapore in which goodwill can\n                    attach.120    We agree with the Judge that the Respondent\n                    had built up considerable goodwill in the business and overall get-up ofPunters’ WayasPunters’ Wayhad adopted the unique colour-coding since\n                    1993, had been sold in a substantial number of stores and newsstands in\n                    Singapore, and had been advertised with considerable effort: at [73] of the Judgment. We therefore find that\n                    goodwill is attached to the particular get-up ofPunters’ Way.Misrepresentation121    The Respondent is also required to show\n                    that:(a)     the Appellant has made a\n                        misrepresentation to the relevant sector of the public;\n                    and(b)     such\n                        misrepresentation has resulted in or is likely to result in damage to the\n                        Respondent’s goodwill.122    As noted by this court inAmanresortsat [69], the\n                    elements of misrepresentation and damage are very closely linked, and it is\n                    crucial to appreciate that both the misrepresentation and the damage must relate\n                    to the Respondent’s goodwill. A misrepresentation is actionable as a tort\n                    of passing off only if it causes (or is likely to cause) damage to the\n                    Respondent’s goodwill.123    The essential question is whether the\n                    Appellant has made a false representation that led to deception or confusion\n                    amongst the relevant sector of the public. The relevant sector of the public\n                    would, in this situation, clearly be punters, and people with a keen interest in\n                    the horse races. In the case of a claim of adoption of get-up, the real question\n                    is whether the get-up adopted by the offending party is sufficiently similar to\n                    that of the plaintiff as to give rise to confusion. In proving\n                    misrepresentation, it has been previously established inTong\n                        Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd[1991] 1 SLR(R) 903 (“Tong\n                    Guan”) at [24] that\n                    the court is not concerned with the “moron in a hurry” being\n                    confused. Rather, the test that is to be applied is whether ordinary sensible\n                    members of the public would be confused. It is sufficient that a substantial\n                    proportion of persons who are probably purchasers of the goods of the kind in\n                    question would in fact be confused.124    The Judge found that on a perusal of the\n                    cover pages ofRacing GuideandPunters’ Way, there was a compelling case that the\n                    Appellant had consciously and deliberately made changes to the cover ofRacing Guideto misrepresentRacing GuideasPunters’\n                        Way: at [76] of the\n                    Judgment. This was especially so since the same colours for the covers were used\n                    for the same specific function as those devised by the Respondent. Further, the\n                    Judge found that the Appellant had changed the position of its advertisement\n                    panel such that it was similar to the Respondent’s publication and that\n                    there was also striking similarity between the Chinese titles for both\n                    publications. The Judge made her observations on the similarities between the\n                    two publications without regard to the market survey done by the\n                    Respondent’s expert witness Greg Coops (“Coops”) but\n                    nevertheless found that Coops’ evidence only served to reinforce her\n                    findings: at [77]–[79] of the Judgment.125    However, we find that little reliance ought\n                    to be placed on the market survey due to the lack of objectivity in the way the\n                    survey was conducted. The survey included the comparison of issues ofPunters’ WayandRacing\n                        Guidewhich were published on different days –\n                    19 October 2008 forPunters’ Wayand\n                    27 April 2008 forRacing Guide. The two\n                    issues appear to have been deliberately chosen as they were most similar in\n                    their get-up – including the colour of the cover page, and the pictures of\n                    the horses. The survey was therefore conducted by approximating the two issues\n                    which were most similar. However, the stubborn fact remains that these two\n                    issues were not published on the same day. Such a comparison would not be a fair\n                    test.126    Additionally, the survey was conducted with\n                    the masthead removed. The masthead accounts for one-third of the magazine and\n                    would be a key distinguishing feature for punters seeking to purchase a\n                    particular magazine. The target survey audience were also questioned as to\n                    whether they could identify the magazines without the name and title of the\n                    magazines. This would not be a fair comparison.127    Further, one of the questions asked in the\n                    survey was “how likely would it be for you to confuse these two magazines\n                    if you were in a hurry and you were selecting one of them?”[note: 7]. This question would lead to an\n                    inaccurate finding of misrepresentation to the public as it approximates the\n                    “moron in a hurry” test. Therefore, we disagree with the Judge\n                    that the survey conducted by Coops was appropriate and representative of the\n                    public’s view.128    With respect, we also find that the scenario\n                    described by the Judge, that race-goers who were “less educated or who\n                    were late and/or were in a hurry to get into the grounds of the race\n                    track” (at[87]of the Judgment)\n                    would be confused and would buy a racing guide thinking it wasPunters’ Waywhen it was actuallyRacing Guide, was flawed, as this similarly approximated\n                    the “moron in a hurry” test.129    The correct test that should be applied is\n                    that of the imperfect recollection test – not to compare both publications\n                    side by side, but to take into account the fact that the “confusion which\n                    may occur will take place when the customer has in his mind his recollection of\n                    the plaintiff’s mark, which may well be only an idea of the whole or\n                    actual mark”: seeTong Guanat [26].130    It appears unlikely to us, in the absence of\n                    cogent evidence, that the punting audience to which both publications are\n                    targeted are undiscerning. They would know precisely which publication they\n                    wanted to purchase and would ask for eitherPunters’\n                        WayorRacing Guide, two very\n                    dissimilar names, when purchasing the magazine. The assumption that customers\n                    purchase the magazines on the basis of colour has not been proved by the\n                    Respondent, and may in fact not be true. The colour-coding may have been\n                    irrelevant to the customers and, if so, there would be no misrepresentation. It\n                    was also unpersuasive that the picture of forward-facing racehorses on the front\n                    cover was misleading as every horse-racing guide would logically feature horses\n                    on its cover page. The Respondent cannot be said to have a monopoly over\n                    pictures of commonplace horses or even forward-facing racehorses. Additionally,\n                    the titles of the publications are prominently displayed on the magazines. We\n                    are of the opinion that the large mastheads are significant distinguishing\n                    factors and as such, there would be no confusion caused to the\n                public.131    In the case ofTong\n                        Guan, illiteracy was seen as “an evaporating\n                    consideration” (at [30]) in\n                    Singapore by 1991, and the court took the view that a purchaser would use\n                    ordinary care to read (whether in English or Chinese) the brand names of the\n                    products in order to distinguish between two different brands. In the present\n                    circumstances, it can be said that the problem of illiteracy is even more\n                    removed than it was in 1991. Furthermore, punters and race-goers are likely to\n                    be a circumspect and discerning audience. As inTong\n                        Guan, where the court held that the brands “Tong\n                    Guan” and “Deer Brand” were sufficiently distinguishable,\n                    it can also be similarly argued that “Punters’\n                        Way” and “Racing Guide” are phonetically and\n                    visually different and thus a customer using ordinary care would not be\n                    confused.132    We therefore disagree with the Judge and\n                    find that no misrepresentation leading to confusion of the public has been\n                    proven by the Respondent on the present facts. The cover pages of the two\n                    magazines are sufficiently distinct and are not likely to be confused by the\n                    relevant sector of the public.Damage133    Even if the Appellant could be shown to have\n                    misrepresentedRacing GuideasPunters’ Way, thereby causing confusion between the\n                    Respondent’s racing guide and that of the Appellant, such\n                    misrepresentation is not in itself actionable unless it has caused, or is likely\n                    to cause, damage to the Respondent’s goodwill.134    The Respondent claimed the net loss of\n                    profits that it suffered from 30 June 2007 to 5 June 2008, as well as\n                    continuing damages and loss from 5 June 2008 to the date of filing of the\n                    Statement of Claim for the Respondent’s continued infringement. The\n                    Respondent also sought the costs incurred in conducting market surveys to verify\n                    the extent of the damage caused, as well as an injunction to restrain the\n                    Appellant from infringing the Respondent’s copyright. However, the\n                    Respondent only invited the court to infer damage or the likelihood of damage\n                    that had been suffered by the Respondent as a result of the misrepresentation by\n                    the Appellant. The Respondent did not lead any evidence on a loss of sales, or a\n                    decline in the growth of sales ofPunters’\n                        Way.135    The Judge found (at [82] of the Judgment) that where parties are\n                    in direct competition with one another, the court will readily infer the\n                    likelihood of damage to the Respondent’s goodwill, not merely through the\n                    loss of sales, but also through the loss of the exclusive use of his\n                    get-up.136    We do not agree that the test for damages\n                    has been correctly applied by the Judge on the established facts. While it is\n                    accepted that the common test applied in proving damage is “actual damage\n                    or a real likelihood of damage”, it must be noted that the period of\n                    infringement alleged by the Respondent was a limited one – from\n                    30 June 2007 to 5 June 2008. This was not a situation where the\n                    infringement by the Appellant was ongoing or impending and therefore\n                    unquantifiable. In actual fact, the infringement period had long since ended.\n                    The Respondent ought therefore to have been able to prove a decline in sales ofPunters’ Way, or a reduced growth in\n                    sales ofPunters’ Way, if this had indeed\n                    taken place. In such a situation, the right test that should be applied would be\n                    that of “actual damage” and not “likelihood of\n                    damage”.137Prima facieproof of damage is essential in the present situation in establishing the\n                    Appellant’s liability. However, the Respondent had failed to lead any\n                    evidence on the damage that it had suffered to its goodwill from the\n                    Appellant’s alleged misrepresentation ofPunters’\n                        Way. The Respondent had merely relied on a\n                    “logical” inference that as the Appellant and the\n                    Respondent’s publications were in a common field of activity, it would\n                    therefore not be far-fetched to conclude that the Respondent had suffered\n                    losses.138    The Respondent had submitted at the hearing\n                    of the appeal, that because the trial had been bifurcated, no evidence of\n                    damages was led at trial. The application for bifurcation had in fact been taken\n                    out by the Appellant and it was heard on 9 November 2009 before an\n                    assistant registrar. During the bifurcation hearing, the Appellant’s\n                    counsel had argued that the trial should be bifurcated as all that the\n                    Respondent was required to prove was a likelihood of damage and not the quantum\n                    of the damage. The assistant registrar subsequently allowed a bifurcation of the\n                    trial.139    In these circumstances, since the\n                    Appellant’s counsel himself was of the opinion that a likelihood of damage\n                    was all that was required to prove the tort of passing off, we do not find it\n                    just to penalise the Respondent for not leading evidence of actual damages at\n                    the trial. However we reiterate that, ideally, the test for damages in\n                    situations where the period of infringement had passed should be proof of actual\n                    damage and nothing short of that.Our conclusion on the passing off claim140    We therefore respectfully disagree with the\n                    Judge, and conclude that the element of misrepresentation in the tort of passing\n                    off has not been successfully proven by the Respondent and therefore the claim\n                    of passing off cannot succeed.Consequential relief141    The Appellant, in the court below,\n                    counterclaimed against the Respondent under s 200(1) of the Act for making\n                    groundless threats of legal proceedings. Section 200(1) of the Act provides\n                    that where a person threatens another person with a copyright infringement\n                    action, the latter may bring an action against the former for,inter alia, a declaration that the threat is\n                    unjustifiable, unless the former satisfies the court that the alleged infringing\n                    acts “constituted, or if done, would constitute, an infringement of\n                    copyright”. The full text of s 200(1) reads as follows:Groundless threats of legal\n                            proceedings200. —(1) Where a person, by means of circulars,\n                        advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with an action or proceeding\n                        in respect of an infringement of copyright, then, whether the person making\n                        the threats is or is not the owner of the copyright or an exclusive\n                        licensee, a person aggrieved may bring an action against the first-mentioned\n                        person and may —(a)    obtain a\n                                declaration to the effect that the threats are\n                            unjustifiable;(b)    obtain an\n                                injunction against the continuance of the threats; and(c)    recover such\n                                damages, if any, as he has sustained,unless the first-mentioned person satisfies the court that the acts in\n                        respect of which the action or proceeding was threatened constituted, or, if\n                        done, would constitute, an infringement of copyright.142    Having regard to our findings that copyright\n                    did not subsist in the Tables inPunters’\n                        Way, and that the Appellant therefore could not have infringed\n                    any copyright of the Respondent’s, it must follow that the Respondent has\n                    made groundless threats against the Appellant for the purposes of s 200(1)\n                    of the Act.Conclusion143    In the result, we find that the\n                    Respondent’s threats to bring an action for copyright infringement against\n                    the Appellant are unjustifiable. The Respondent’s claim for the tort of\n                    passing off is similarly untenable. Accordingly, the present appeal against the\n                    Judge’s decision is allowed. The injunction granted by the Judge to\n                    restrain the Appellant from infringing the Respondent’s copyright in its\n                    publications ofPunters’ Wayis discharged.\n                    The Appellant is entitled to damages against the Respondent for groundlessly\n                    threatening the Appellant with copyright infringement under s 200(1) of the Act\n                    (which shall be assessed by an assistant registrar), and an injunction\n                    restraining the Respondent from making further threats against the Appellant in\n                    respect of the subject matter of these proceedings. Because the Appellant has\n                    not succeeded in several of its arguments (here and below) we invite the parties\n                    to make written submissions on the appropriate costs order we should make for\n                    the entire proceedings. The parties have seven days from the date of this\n                    judgment to make these submissions.[note: 1]Appellant’s Case, para 23.[note: 2]AEIC of Phan Tjun Sern, Record Of\n                                Appeal, Vol III Part C, p 997.[note: 3]AEIC of\n                                Subramani Krishnamoothy, Record of Appeal Vol III Part D,\n                                p 1228, para 33.[note: 4]Record of Appeal Vol III Part C,\n                            p 1085.[note: 5]Ibid, 1004.[note: 6]Core Bundle Vol II Part A,\n                                p 94.[note: 7]Core Bundle Vol II Part A,\n                        p 416.",
        "The subject matter of protection": "23     The subject matter accorded protection falls\n                    into two principal categories. The first, protected under Part III and more\n                    specifically found in s 27 of the Act, includes traditional types of\n                    subject matter such as literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works which are\n                    original. The second category, protected under ss 97–101 in\n                    Part IV of the Act, relates to “subject-matter other than works” and includes sound\n                    recordings, television broadcasts and cinematograph films amongst\n                others. 24     Section 27 of the Act isin pari materiawith s 32 of the Australian\n                    Copyright Act 1968, which has its origins in the UK Copyright Act 1911. Thus,\n                    both English and Australian cases are useful reference points on the issue of\n                    originality. However, while the cases are helpful in illuminating the\n                    application of the legal principles, it has to be remembered that ultimately the\n                    originality of each particular work is everything in determining if copyright\n                    exists.",
        "The scope of protection granted": "25     The scope of protection accorded differs\n                    according to the type of subject matter concerned. Copyright protection is\n                    concerned with the unauthorised reproduction or dissemination by third parties\n                    of the form in which a person has chosen to express himself or herself, whether\n                    by way of a book, painting, or something else. Nevertheless this protection may\n                    be broader in some cases than in others, due to the nature of the subject matter\n                    in question. For example, for literary, dramatic and musical works, a person may\n                    prevent a wide range of unauthorised reproductions such as,inter alia, adaptations, public performances and other public\n                    communications of the work. However, for artistic works and subject matter other\n                    than works, the protection accorded is more limited and more narrowly\n                    interpreted.",
        "The term of protection": "26     In general, the term of protection for works\n                    is the author’s life plus 70 years as stated in s 28 of the Act;\n                    while the term of protection for other subject matter, as well as certain\n                    limited categories of works such as those published anonymously or\n                    pseudonymously is 70 years from the date of first publication, as seen in\n                    s 29 and ss 92–96 of the Act respectively. 27     The length that ought to be accorded to\n                    copyright protection has always been robustly debated. This stems from the\n                    difficulty of striking an appropriate balance between the competing tensions of\n                    public and private interests. On one hand, there is the interest of the public\n                    in securing both new and established works freely and as early as possible, and,\n                    on the other, the need to ensure that authors receive a just return for their\n                    creative efforts and are thereby encouraged to keep on creating. The perennial\n                    problem has been to find the right period of protection which strikes the\n                    appropriate balance between these competing tensions. 28     As mentioned earlier in[19], the statutory protection provided by the\n                    Statute of Anne was a maximum period of 28 years. As an aside, it bears noting\n                    that the average human life span then was much shorter. The initial statutory\n                    period was enlarged in 1814 to the term of the author’s life, if the\n                    author was still living at the end of 28 years. In 1842, it was changed to the\n                    life of the author plus seven years or 42 years, whichever was the longer. The\n                    rationale for this new term was based on the argument that the earlier\n                    legislation tended to penalise the author who published his work shortly before\n                    his death. This, coupled with the desire to secure rights which would benefit\n                    the heirs of the author, resulted in the new extended copyright period.\n                    Subsequently, the UK Copyright Act 1911 provided that the term for copyright\n                    would be the author’s life plus 50 years. This was the position adopted in\n                    the 1987 Act when it was first enacted. 29     In May 2003, the United States - Singapore\n                    Free Trade Agreement was signed, obliging Singapore to add 20 years to the\n                    then-existing term for authors’ works, performances and phonograms. The\n                    result was that in July 2004, the 1999 Act was amended to reflect the current\n                    copyright term for works as the author’s life plus 70 years. The history\n                    and rationale of the term of copyright will be explicated further below at[57]–[60].",
        "Formalities": "30     There is no requirement of registration before\n                    copyright protection attaches under the Act. However, in order for copyright to\n                    subsist, s 27 of the Act requires that one of the following connecting\n                    factors must exist in relation to the work or subject matter in question, that\n                    is: (a)     that the author or maker be a\n                        “qualified person”; (b)     that the work or subject matter be first published in\n                        Singapore; or (c)     in the case of sound recordings, films and broadcasts, that they be made in\n                        Singapore. This will be elaborated upon further below at[46]–[56]. 31     As mentioned above, the sections in the Act\n                    are largely modelled on the Australian Copyright Act 1968, which was found to be\n                    the most compatible with Singapore’s requirements bearing in mind\n                    “our legal system [and] our need to be up-to-date and\n                    comprehensive”: seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates,\n                        Official Report(5 May 1986) vol 48 at col 12\n                    (Prof S Jayakumar, Second Minister for Law). However as we have\n                    earlier stated, English cases still have significance since both Singapore and\n                    Australia copyright law have deep English roots.",
        "Copyright protection in compilations": "32     It is necessary that the Tables fall under one\n                    of the categories of subject matter accorded protection. Section 7A of the\n                    Act reads as follows:- Literary works include compilation\n                            and computer program 7A. —(1) For the purposes of this Act,\n                        “literary work” includes — (a)    a compilation in\n                                any form; and (b)    a computer\n                                program. (2)    Any copyright\n                            subsisting in a compilation by virtue of Part III\n                        — (a)    is limited to the selection or arrangement of\n                                its contents which constitutes an intellectual creation;\n                            and ... (3)    For the purposes of this section\n                        — “compilation” means — ... (c)    a compilation, or table, of data other than\n                                relevant materials or parts of relevant materials, which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of its contents,\n                        constitutes an intellectual creation; Typically, provided a subject matter can reasonably be called a table,\n                    compilation or database, it will almost always fall within the statutory\n                    description: seeCopingerat para 3-27. The\n                    information in the Tables inPunters’ Waywould clearly constitute a table of data other than relevant materials, capable\n                    of being termed a “compilation”, and by extension, the Tables\n                    would be a “literary work”. It has therefore been common ground\n                    that the Tables inPunters’ Wayare indeed\n                    compilations. But, in order for any copyright to subsist in the compilation, the\n                    selection or arrangement of its contents must be the product of intellectual\n                    creation. 33     It has been rightly pointed out, inGeorge Wei,The Law of Copyright in\n                        Singapore(SNP Editions, 2nd Ed, 2000) (“George Wei”) at p 1331, that the notion of\n                        “intellectual creation” ties in\n                    with the basic copyright principle that only “original”\n                    compilations are protected by copyright. The test for compilations remains the\n                    same as the general test for a literary work, namely that of originality –\n                    whether there is sufficient amount of skill, labour and judgment involved in the\n                    creative process. 34     This threshold is heavily fact-centric and it\n                    is often a problematic matter of “which side of the line the case\n                    falls”: seeChilton v Progress Printing\n                        Company[1895] 2 Ch 29. Similarly,George\n                        Weipoints out at p 54 that: [while the] basic notion of originality is easy enough to understand and\n                        to apply at a broad level of abstraction; it is much more tricky at its\n                        margins, especially in the case of fact based works... In the same vein, it has also been observed inCopingerat para 3-130 that there is no guiding principle\n                    as to the precise quantum of labour, skill or judgment required, but rather it\n                    is a question of fact and degree and thus has to be determined on the facts of\n                    the particular case. 35     As an aside, it can be said that the\n                    Anglo-Australian requirement of originality, while taking account of the\n                    intellectual effort of the author, has traditionally placed greater emphasis on\n                    the time, labour and effort involved. However, we note that several of the cases\n                    where copyright was granted in respect of seemingly mundane compilations (such\n                    as a timetable index, street directories, football fixture lists and a racing\n                    information service) were decided predominantly in the early 19th century to the\n                    early 20th century, before computer usage became part of everyday life. With the\n                    proliferation of computers and the ready availability of software, the law on\n                    copyright ought also to evolve to take into account the ease and convenience\n                    that computers bring to the process of compiling in the 21st century. Tediously\n                    painstaking works when done manually, such as the tabulation of timetables, or\n                    broadcasting programmes, are now effortlessly completed with the touch of a\n                    computer key or two, without much exertion or skill being called for. Older\n                    decisions that had focussed on the gathering of information as the touchstone\n                    rather than the productive effort involved in expression may therefore require\n                    reconsideration one day. 36     For now, it can be said that where someone has\n                    expended effort in creating something that has some literary value, it is worthy\n                    of protection, irrespective of the precise quantum of intellectual input\n                    involved in producing it or the literary merits or novelty of the work product.\n                    Having stated this general proposition, we should caution that “[w]hen\n                    the particular form of expression contains facts and information, it is not\n                    helpful to refer to the “rough and practical test [inUniversity of London Press, Limited v University Tutorial Press,\n                        Limited[1916] 2 Ch 601 (“University Tutorial Press”) at 610] that what is worth\n                    copying is prima facie worth protecting””: seeIceTV Pty Limited v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd[2009] HCA 14\n                    at [31]. 37     This is because the law of copyright does not\n                    protect ideas, facts or information. It is only the particular form in which the\n                    ideas, facts or information is presented after creativity has been added to the\n                    mix that may be protected. Similarly, it is not the preparatory efforts or\n                    process of gathering facts that is protected. Rather it is the thought effort\n                    involved in creating the particular form of expression that is embraced by\n                    copyright. Not infrequently, the expression of data, say, through an\n                    alphabetical listing, will involve little ingenuity or skill beyond mechanical\n                    labour or routine programming. In such matters, it may be difficult to argue\n                    that copyright protection is called for. 38     In assessing copyright for compilations, in\n                    particular, we think it is always profitable to bear in mind the four key\n                    principles discerningly summarised inFeist Publications Inc\n                        v Rural Telephone Service Company Inc. 499 US 340 (1991).\n                    First, facts are not copyrightable. Second, compilations of facts, however, are\n                    generally copyrightable. Third, thesine qua nonof copyright is originality. Fourth, originality simply means that the work was\n                    independently created by the author and that it possesses some minimal degree of\n                    creativity, the level of creativity required being extremely low: seeGeorge Weiat pp 84–85. 39     In this matter, the Second Issue of whether\n                    copyright subsists in the Tables inPunters’\n                        Wayand if so whether the Appellant has infringed that copyright,\n                    rests primarily on the fourth principle – the existence of a minimum\n                    degree of creativity independently exercised by the author. However, before\n                    addressing the Second Issue, we turn now to the prior First Issue, which deals\n                    with whether the Tables were independently created by the Respondent as an\n                    author.",
        "The First Issue: Is the Respondent entitled to assert copyright\n                protection as the author of its publication?": "40     A leading treatise on intellectual property,\n                    Staniforth Ricketson and Christopher Creswell,The Law of\n                        Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs & Confidential\n                        Information(Lawbook Co, 2nd Ed (Revised),\n                    2010 release) (“Ricketson”) at\n                    para 7.45 states that originality refers to “the contribution which\n                    is made by the author to the form in which the work is expressed”. This\n                    approach was underscored in the storied decision of Isaacs J inSands & McDougall Pty Ltd v Robinson(1917)\n                    23 CLR 49, where it was noted (at 55–56): in copyright law the two expressions “author” and\n                        “original work” have always been correlative;the one connotes the other. [emphasis added] 41     It seems plain to us after our brief overview\n                    of the copyright scheme above that ever since the enactment of the Statute of\n                    Anne, the objective of copyright law has been to encourage the creativity of\n                    natural authors.The identification of the author is\n                        therefore a key function of copyright law as that is the person who is\n                        entitled to the benefits conferred by law. 42     Returning to the facts, it is crucial to note\n                    that the Respondent unequivocally pleaded in its Statement of Claim (Amendment\n                    No. 1) that italonewas the original author\n                    of the Tables inPunters’ Way; and that the\n                    Tables were the intellectual creation of the Respondent. No human individuals\n                    were identified.Further, no copyright claim was made in\n                        respect of the software that was responsible for generating the relevant\n                        tables. For ease of reference we reproduce the relevant portion\n                    of the pleading: 8.    In particular, most of the information that was\n                            compiled in “Punters’\n                            Way” is specially tabulated according to its nature\n                            and contents.Among other information, there is a set\n                                of four tables which is specially compiled by the\n                                [Respondent]. This set of tables is compiled in a\n                            sequence after very careful consideration and trial runs. It gives\n                            [readers] quick reference and useful guides.The\n                                [Respondent] creates this compilation and is its author. It is the\n                                [Respondent’s] original literary work and there are no similar\n                                horse-racing publications either within Singapore or outside\n                                Singapore that has compiled the four tables in such a\n                                manner. [emphasis added] 43     It should be noted that the Respondent had not\n                    pleadedownershipof the Tables.Authorship and ownership are not synonymous terms. The\n                    former refers to the concept of creating and the latter to one of possessing\n                    proprietary rights. An author need not be an owner and the converse is equally\n                    true. Further, the authorship of the Tables was not pleaded as one of\n                    joint-authorship by the Respondent’s employees. The crucial issue which\n                    therefore arises is whether the Respondent, as a body corporate can indeed\n                    legally be considered an author of a copyrighted work assuming that this was\n                    factually what happened. We shall now consider this issue.",
        "Who is an author?": "44     First, the Act, and similarly the Australian\n                    Copyright Act 1968, is silent as to the definition of “author”,\n                    except to say in s 7 that an author, in relation to a photograph, means the\n                    person who took the photograph. As a result, the answer to who an author is can\n                    only be deduced from other sources. 45     A useful starting point is s 9 of the UK\n                    Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988 (c 48) (UK) (“the 1988 UK\n                    Act”). Section 9(1) of the 1988 UK Act provides that an\n                    “author”, in relation to a work, means the person who creates it.\n                    This definition is reiterated in David Hay gen ed,Words\n                        and Phrases Legally Definedvol I (LexisNexis,\n                    4th Edition, 2007) at p 212. 46     Second, a closer examination of s 27 of\n                    the Act seems obligatory (in the light of the Appellant’s arguments) in\n                    order to ascertain the legislative intent of who an “author” might\n                    be. Section 27 provides the following: Original works in which copyright\n                            subsists 27. —(1) ... … (2)    Subject to the\n                            provisions of this Act,where an original\n                                literary, dramatic, musical or artisticwork has been published— (a)    copyright shall\n                                subsist in the work; or (b)    if copyright in\n                                the work subsisted immediately before its first publication,\n                                copyright shall continue to subsist in the work, if, but only if — (c)    the first\n                                publication of the work took place in Singapore; (d)    the author of\n                                the work was a qualified person at the time when the work was first\n                                published; or (e)    the author died\n                                before that time but was a qualified person immediately before his\n                                death. ... (4)    In this section, “qualified person” means a citizen of Singapore or a person\n                                resident in Singapore. [emphasis added] 47     The Appellant argued that s 27 of the Act\n                    requires an author to be a “qualified person”, and as\n                    “qualified person” has been defined to mean “a citizen of\n                    Singapore or a person resident in Singapore”[note: 1]in\n                    s 27(4) of the Act, the Respondent as a body corporate cannot claim to be\n                    an author under the Act. We have difficulties with this\n                contention. 48     The Judge, in our view, was correct in holding\n                    that sub-ss 27(2)(c), (d) and (e) of the Act are\n                    disjunctive, and not conjunctive. This is also the settled Australian position:\n                    see below at[49]. Australia, as a signatory\n                    to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\n                    (“the Berne Convention”) had to give effect to Art 3(1) of\n                    the Berne Convention, which sets out alternative connecting factors based on an\n                    author’s personal status and the place of first publication of the work.\n                    Protection will be accorded where one of the connecting factors is established.\n                    Having acceded to the Berne Convention in December 1998, Singapore has also\n                    unambiguously agreed to comply with the minimum terms set out by the Berne\n                    Convention. In any event, as s 27 of the Act was modelled on s 32 of\n                    the Australian Copyright Act 1968, we do not think it can be seriously argued\n                    that the position in Singapore differs from the Australian one on\n                this. 49Ricketsonat\n                    para 5.10 confirms that only one of the “connecting factors”\n                    is required by s 32 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 to be present, at\n                    the time the type of work or subject matter in question is created or made, for\n                    copyright to subsist. These connecting factors refer either to the personal\n                    status of the author or maker of the work or other subject matter at the time of\n                    making (“the personal criterion”) or to the place of first\n                    publication of the subject matter (“the territorial criterion”).\n                    It is therefore abundantly clear that the personal criterion and the territorial\n                    criterion are meant to be alternatives, and fulfilling either criterion would\n                    suffice. 50     We note thatGeorge\n                        Weiat p 288, fn 118, also takes the same view\n                    that: s 27(2) essentially sets out twoalternativeconnecting factors for published works, namely,\n                        first publication in Singapore (s 27(2)(c)) and the personal status of\n                        the author as a qualified person (s 27(2)(d) & (e)). It is\n                        submitted that it is not necessary under s 27(2) for published works to\n                        be both first published in Singapore and made by a qualified person at the\n                        relevant time. Either factor will do ...It is submitted\n                            that limbs (c), (d) and (e) of s 27(2) do not set out cumulative\n                            requirements. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis\n                        added in bold italics] Satisfying either the personal criterion or the territorial criterion\n                    is sufficient for the work to acquire copyright in Singapore. The Judge,\n                    therefore, quite correctly rejected the Appellant’s submissions at trial\n                    that the author must be a qualified person, as this would make\n                        s 27(2)(d) mandatory, contrary to the\n                    intent of the statute. 51     The Judge was also correct when she held that\n                    the purpose of s 27(2) was only to ensure that a claim for copyright had\n                    sufficient connection with Singapore in order to warrant protection under the\n                    Act, rather than to provide a definition of who could be an author of a\n                    subsisting copyright under the Act: see [26] of the Judgment. 52     However, the Judge erred in declaring\n                    subsequently (at [25] of the Judgment)\n                    that “although the author of the work must be a qualified personfor the purposesof meeting the criteria of\n                        s 29(2)(d), there is no statutory\n                    provision that exhaustively states that the only “author” relevant\n                    for all purposes of the Copyright Actmustbe a\n                    qualified person” [emphasis in original]. The Judge relied on s 2 of\n                    the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the\n                    Interpretation Act”) (which defines “person” to include any\n                    company or association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated) to\n                    substantiate her point, and added, for good measure, that there are also no\n                    statutory provisions in the Act which state that an author must necessarily be a\n                    living person: see [25] of the\n                    Judgment. 53     While it is true that s 2 of the\n                    Interpretation Act defines “person” as including a company, it\n                    must be remembered that the words and expressions defined in the Interpretation\n                    Act only have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the absence of\n                    anything in the subject or context of the relevant statute that is inconsistent\n                    with such meanings. As a matter of principle, in interpreting statutes, the\n                    general ordinarily gives way to the special or particular. 54     It is also interesting to briefly digress and\n                    note that an altogether different position has been statutorily adopted in\n                    Malaysia. In the Malaysian Copyright Act 1987 (Act 332) (Malaysia), the\n                    term “qualified person” has been expanded to include: (a)    in relation to an individual, ... a person who is\n                            a citizen of, or a permanent resident in, Malaysia; and (b) in\n                            relation to a body corporate, ... a body corporate established in\n                            Malaysia and constituted or vested with legal personality under the laws\n                            of Malaysia … The Malaysian definition of “qualified person” is\n                    thus fundamentally different from the definition in the Act and the Australian\n                    Copyright Act 1968, both of which do not explicitly provide for a body\n                    corporate. It therefore does not come as a surprise that the Malaysian courts\n                    have had no difficulty in interpreting the word “author” as\n                    referring not only to natural persons, but also to companies: seeCreative Purpose Sdn Bhd & Anor v Integrated Trans Corp Sdn Bhd\n                        & Ors[1997] 2 MLJ 429. However, since the Act is silent\n                    on this point, can it similarly be inferred that non-living\n                    “persons” could be authors for the purposes of\n                copyright? 55     Returning to the legal position here, it is\n                    also noteworthy that leading treatises in Australia and England take the view\n                    that only natural persons can be qualified persons.Ricketsonat para 5.20 unequivocally points out\n                    that: In the context of s 32 of theCopyright Act\n                            1968(Cth) [(equivalent to s 27 of the Act)] (which is\n                        concerned with works), it is clear that “qualified person”\n                        applies only to natural persons. [emphasis in original] 56     Likewise, Kevin Lindgren QCet al,Copyright and Designsvol 1 (LexisNexis, 2004) at para 12,040, states: It is important to note that a body corporate cannot be a\n                        “qualified person” in relation to original works. The reason\n                        for this is that the “qualified person” and first owner of\n                        copyright in an original work is the “author”, and although a\n                        body corporate may be the copyright owner by virtue of the operation of a\n                        contract of employment, an assignment, or in any of the other ways expressly\n                        provided for in [the Australian Copyright Act 1968],it\n                            cannot be an author. [emphasis added] We also note thatCopingerat\n                    para 4-10 has taken the view that: [w]ith very limited exceptions [such as computer-generated works and old\n                        photographs],the “author” of these\n                            categories of work must be a natural person. The fact that\n                        one person is acting as employee of another cannot affect the question of\n                        authorship, nor can the fact that one person is an agent for another...\n                        [emphasis added] With these views in mind we will now excavate further the historical\n                    and legislative policy considerations undergirding this issue.",
        "A non-living author?": "57     The 19th century saw the emergence of the\n                    European doctrine ofdroit moralunder which\n                    authors’ intellectual and creative rights in their works were recognised\n                    in addition to their purely economic rights. Continental jurisdictions therefore\n                    regarded an author’s work as an emanation or extension of his or her\n                    personality, inseparably linked with his or her honour and reputation and thus\n                    deserving of a long period of protection: seeRicketsonat para 6.55. This concept naturally leads to the\n                    conclusion that an author must be a human being. 58     Hugh Laddieet\n                        al,The Modern Law of Copyright and\n                        Designsvol 1 (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 2000)\n                        (“Laddie”) points out at para\n                    10.8 that the Berne Convention is concerned with the rights of human authors to\n                    their original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. As a consequence,\n                    Laddie further observes, thatthe Continental legal tradition has always been to\n                    regard the author’s right to his property as the starting point, and to\n                    look upon limitations to its term as a regrettable necessity. It is because of\n                    this that Art 7 of the Berlin Revision of the Berne Convention in 1908\n                    provided that the term of protection should include the life of the author plus\n                    50 years after his death. The extension of the term of copyright was\n                    inextricably linked to increased life expectancies at that time. 59     The UK’s approach to the duration of\n                    copyright has been slightly different from that of the Continental jurisdictions\n                    in that “those who seek legislation in favour of exclusive privileges\n                    which restrain trade and freedom of communication ought to show that they are\n                    justified in the public interest”: seeLaddieat para 10.8. This approach equally takes into\n                    account the fact that the starting point of copyright is a human author. Both\n                    the UK Copyright Act 1911 and the 1988 UK Act have provided for the term of\n                    protection as the author’s life plus 50 years. This was supposed to\n                    reflect two generations of heirs of the author. However, with increased life\n                    expectancy in developed countries, especially in regional groupings where the\n                    majority of member countries are developed with relatively high standards of\n                    living such as the European Union, it was unsurprising that the European\n                    Commission issued a directive in 1993 which increased thepost mortem auctorisperiod to 70 years, and this has been\n                    implemented in the UK since 1995. 60     Since the duration of copyright protection has\n                    always been based on the author’s life expectancy and the rationale for\n                    thepost mortem auctoristerm was so as to benefit\n                    two generations of the author’s heirs, it is patently clear that\n                    incorporated bodies were never contemplated to have been “authors”\n                    for the purposes of copyright. It would be absurd to suggest that a company\n                    could have a lifespan, let alone generations of heirs. Thus, it must follow that\n                    authors have to be living persons. 61     However, the Judge found that there was no\n                    difficulty in accepting that an incorporated body could be the author of an\n                    original work: see[31]of the Judgment. The\n                    Judge considered that it would be (at [32] of the Judgment): consistent with the statutory regime found in [the Act] if the copyright\n                        in the work is found to expire 70 years after the expiration of the calendar\n                        year in which the work was first published. This is provided for in ss 28(3) and 29 of the Act in situations\n                    where a work is unpublished before the death of the author, or where it is an\n                    anonymous and pseudonymous work. 62     In our view, the Judge plainly erred on this\n                    point. Neither of these scenarios is present in this case. There was no\n                    posthumous publication because if the Respondent qualifies as the\n                    “author” of the Tables,Punters’\n                        Waywould have been published during the “lifetime”\n                    of the Respondent. Similarly, if the Respondent was the author of the Tables,\n                    then the Tables cannot possibly be an anonymous or pseudonymous work and\n                    s 29 does not apply. The prerequisites for the operation of either section\n                    have not been satisfied by the Respondent. 63     Sections 28 and 29 of the Act are in pari\n                    materia with ss 33 and 34 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968. It has been\n                    established that the rationale of these provisions is to encourage the ultimate\n                    disclosure and dissemination of protected works and the information and\n                    knowledge that they contain. This objective would not be achieved if such works\n                    remain protected indefinitely and are withheld from the public domain.\n                    Superimposing ss 28(3) and 29 onto the factual matrix at hand would be\n                    wrong as these provisions plainly do not contemplate scenarios where an\n                    incorporated body is an author. Since it is not possible to rely on the date of\n                    publication as the litmus test for the expiry of the copyright, it appears that\n                    if a company qualifies as an author it would possess an indefinite and\n                    extraordinary perpetual copyright to its work. Pertinently, we should add, sub-\n                    ss 28(3) and 28(5) of the Act expressly refer to the “death of an\n                    author” as the reference event for copyright protection in certain\n                    instances. Why would this be the case if non living authors were intended to be\n                    embraced by the Act? 64     The rationale underpinning copyright\n                    protection is not about the utility of the work, but rather the protection of\n                    the originality of the expression employed to communicate ideas. It is therefore\n                    unhelpful to say that the contents in a compilation will become obsolete,\n                    irrelevant or useless after some time, and therefore not worth copying or\n                    protecting, for as long as there is evidence of originality in the work,\n                    protection is conferred. Even if the work becomes obsolete after time, the\n                    copyright owner would still be able to bring an action against anyone who\n                    utilises the work for an infringement of copyright, regardless of the relevancy\n                    of the work at that time. Should companies and like entities qualify as authors,\n                    they would be entitled to claim a perpetual monopoly over their works to\n                    maximise the economic returns of copyright protection. This would be contrary to\n                    the underlying policy of the Act which is to accord copyright protection for a\n                    limited duration that best strikes a balance between the competing public and\n                    private interests: see above at[26]–[29]. 65     It also seems obvious that authorship by a\n                    company could never have been contemplated by the Statute of Anne as companies\n                    operating as distinct legal entities were not a typical feature of commerce when\n                    it was enacted. In the UK, prior to the mid-19th century, incorporation was only\n                    done by way of royal charter or by private Act of Parliament. However, the Crown\n                    and Parliament were usually suspicious of lending their dignity and the benefits\n                    of separate personality to commercial organisations. As a result, most\n                    joint-stock companies did not have separate legal personality. Parliament\n                    finally permitted the incorporation of companies by registration when it passed\n                    the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 (7 & 8 Vict c 110) (UK). 66     It was only in the late 19th century that\n                    there was a proliferation of incorporated entities in the UK and whereupon a\n                    registered company could acquire separate personality upon registration. This\n                    principle of separate legal corporate personality was affirmed in the celebrated\n                    case ofAron Salomon v A. Salomon and Company,\n                        Limited[1897] AC 22. 67     From the foregoing, it is clear that the\n                    historical origins of the Act envisaged rights to be accorded to natural persons\n                    and not corporate bodies, and that legal rights flowed only from human\n                    authorship. In addition, it is telling that the duration of copyright in subject\n                    matter other than works is merely stated as continuing to subsist until the\n                    expiration of 70 (or 50) years after the expiration of the calendar year in\n                    which the recording/film/broadcast was first published/made. Our views are\n                    further fortified by the recent decision of the Australian Federal Court of\n                    Appeal inTelstra Corporation Limited v Phone Directories\n                        Company Pty Ltd[2010] FCAFC 149 (“the Telstra\n                    Appeal”), where two members of the quorum stated unequivocally (at\n                        [100] and [134]) that under Australian law an author\n                    had to be a human author. 68     We note that the Judge also relied on the case\n                    ofAlteco Chemical Pte Ltd v Chong Yean Wah (trading as\n                        Yamayo Stationery Manufactuer)[1999] 2 SLR(R) 915\n                        (“Alteco”), to support the\n                    proposition that an incorporated body could be the author of a copyright\n                    protected work. In that decision, it appears that a “modern”\n                    interpretation of authorship was created, suggesting that the author had become\n                    the person who made the necessary arrangements and paid for the creation of the\n                    work. A company could therefore be the author of the work if its employees\n                    created the work product. 69     However, the High Court inAltecodid not expressly declare that a company could be an\n                    author of a work, a point acknowledged by the Judge. Further, the decision inAltecoseemed to have blurred the distinctions\n                    between the concepts of authorship and ownership. In Tan Tee Jim, SC and Ng-Loy\n                    Wee Loon, “Intellectual Property Law” (2000) 1 SAL Ann Rev\n                    230 at 235–237, 251 (“Tan and\n                    Ng”), the authors observe that theAltecocase failed to make the distinction between authorship\n                    and copyright ownership in s 30 of the Act. AsTan and\n                        Ngrightly point out, in essence what the Court did was to imply\n                    a constructive trust against the author of the work, thereby allowing the parent\n                    company to own the work, and there was no necessity for a “modern”\n                    interpretation of the word “author”. 70     This view has been similarly reiterated inGeorge Weiat pp 1391–1393. He\n                    points out that the Act adequately governs the law on ownership, even for\n                    foreign works which enjoy copyright in Singapore. Additionally, it is observed\n                    that the person who made arrangements for the production of a work, or who paid\n                    for the work – as in the case ofAlteco– would not be entitled to claim to be the author of the work as this did\n                    not generally relate to authorship skills. We agree.Alteco’s innovative tailoring of the term\n                    “author” ought not to be followed. 71     It must be emphasised that a work created by\n                    an employee author has a limited duration dependent on the life of the employee\n                    even if first ownership vests in the employer. Thus while the law accepts that a\n                    person other than the author may be a first owner, the question of who the\n                    author is remains a distinct and an important one. 72     We therefore reject the Respondent’s\n                    argument that an “author” for the purposes of copyright law can\n                    and should extend to corporate entities. It would clearly be against public\n                    policy to allow copyright protection in perpetuity. This would be the scenario\n                    should a company be deemed capable of being an author for the purpose of\n                    copyright. Section 2 of the Interpretation Act ought not to be incorporated\n                    into the rubric of copyright law, and an “author” must be a\n                    natural person in copyright law.",
        "Can a natural author be identified?": "73     The identification of an author is still\n                    pertinent as s 27 of the Act provides that in order for copyright to\n                    subsist in a work, the work must be original. As mentioned in[40]above, originality is closely related to the\n                    author. This principle was recently affirmed inTelstra\n                        Corporation Limited and Another v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd and\n                        Others[2010] FCA 44 (“Telstra”). Gordon J masterfully condensed the\n                    position thus at [20]: ... “originality” under [the Australian Copyright Act 1968]\n                        “means that the creation … of the work required some\n                        independent intellectual effort” and/or the exercise of\n                        “sufficient effort of a literary nature”. … [E]ach\n                        phrase confirms that for a work to be sufficiently original for the\n                        subsistence of copyright, “substantial labour” and/or\n                        “substantial expense” is not alone sufficient. More is\n                        required. What that more is will, of course, vary from case to case butmust involve “originality” by an\n                            identified author in an identified work. [emphasis\n                        added] 74     In theTelstra\n                        Appealat [32],\n                    Keane CJ heartily affirmed Gordon J’sdicta: Authorship and originality are correlatives. The question of whether\n                        copyright subsists is concerned with the particular form of expression of\n                        the work. You must identify authors, and those authors must direct their\n                        contribution (assessed as either an “independent intellectual\n                        effort” of a “sufficient effort of a literary nature”)\n                        to the particular form of expression of the work.Start\n                            with the work. Find its authors. They must have done\n                        something, howsoever defined, that can be considered original. [emphasis\n                        added] 75     We agree with this approach. An author must\n                    first be identified before the work in question can be deemed to be original. In\n                    fact, the Respondent’s counsel acknowledge in the Respondent’s\n                    skeletal submissions, that all that is required for the test for originality is\n                    that “the work originates with an author or joint authors from some\n                    independent intellectual effort”. Since the Respondent is unable to\n                    assert that it is the author of the work as a body corporate, the remaining\n                    question at this juncture is whether the Respondent is even able to identify\n                    specific human authors of the Tables. To avoid doubt, we should add that it is\n                    not necessary to name each and every author to make out a claim for copyright\n                    protection but it has to be shown that the work product in question has been\n                    generated from human author(s) working alone or collaboratively,ie, the existence of such persons must be clearly\n                    established. 76     The Respondent’s witness Phan Tjun Sern\n                    (“Phan”) had stated in his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief\n                        (“AEIC”)[note: 2]thatPunters’ Waywas a continuing project,\n                    developed from ideas and valuable contributions by racing professionals and\n                    readers. However, ideas and contributions put forward by the readers and horse\n                    racing experts would not be protected by the scope of copyright, as copyright\n                    protects the material form of a work, and not the ideas in the work. Even if the\n                    suggestions could be protected, the readers and horse racing experts were not\n                    employees of the Respondent, and correspondingly, the Respondent would not be\n                    able to claim copyright ownership of the Tables, if any. 77     Further, relying on a passage inLaddieat para 3.94, the Respondent submits that the\n                    definition of a literary work includes a compilation, and the author of such a\n                    work is the person who gathers or organises the collection of material and who\n                    selects, orders and arranges it. The Respondent then contends that as its\n                    employees were the people who gathered, organised, selected, ordered and\n                    arranged the information and data, they were the authors of the Tables, which\n                    was an original work capable of being protected by copyright. 78     However, we hesitate to accept this definition\n                    of authors in this situation. Although the contributions of these individuals\n                    may have led to the compilation of the work, they were not part of the actual\n                    process of compilation. In this context, theTelstra\n                        Appealat [92] is\n                    instructive. It affirmed that where the work of individuals was not\n                    collaborative, but was instead merely organised to facilitate the production of\n                    the work, this would not be collaboration of the kind contemplated by the\n                    definition of joint authorship. 79     Here, the collection of the horse-racing data,\n                    such as the horses’ and jockeys’ names, as well as their track work\n                    records, and the organisation and selection of such data were either\n                    computerised, or done by separate people. However, each individual’s\n                    responsibility and contribution (which has not been particularised) was, based\n                    on the evidence before us, insufficient to render the individual an author, or\n                    joint author of the Tables. 80     It certainly cannot be said that a reader who\n                    writes in with suggestions for the improvement of the publication can be\n                    considered an “author”. Neither can the IT employee who entered\n                    the names of the horses in a race be considered an “author” of the\n                    compilation. Although it is undeniable that both contributed to the end product,\n                    data aggregation or input is not creativity. 81     Not infrequently, in cases involving a high\n                    degree of automation, there will be no original work produced for the simple\n                    reason that there are no identifiable human authors. This may well be the reason\n                    why the Respondent was unable to identify any particular individual or\n                    individuals or a specific group of people as being the human authors of the\n                    Tables. However, whatever the case may be, it is clear that copyright cannot\n                    subsist without a human author, and the Respondent is unable to even begin to\n                    satisfactorily identify any author, let alone, authors. It remains unclear who\n                    was responsible for the compilations. Even assumingarguendothat the Respondent’s employees had some\n                    authorship role in the compilations, the evidence did not satisfactorily\n                    establish when copyright protection attached. 82     In the circumstances, without the\n                    identification of a human author from whom the work originates, there can be no\n                    “original work” capable of copyright protection. We therefore find\n                    that the Respondent’s claim that copyright subsists in the Tables that\n                    were “authored” by it fails.",
        "The statutory presumptions": "83     Additionally, the Act contains statutory\n                    presumptions designed to assist a claimant in a copyright action for\n                    infringement of copyright. We now examine these presumptions to determine if\n                    they can assist the Respondent’s claim. 84     The Judge found (at [35] of the Judgment) that the presumption\n                    under s 131 of the Act applies – where a name purporting to be that\n                    of the author of a literary work appeared on copies of the work as published,\n                    then it shall be presumed unless the contrary is established that the person is\n                    the author of the work. The Judge therefore accepted that the Respondent was the\n                    author of the Tables as its name appeared onPunters’\n                        Wayand the onus was on the Appellant to disprove the\n                    Respondent’s authorship. 85     It is pertinent, however, that the Respondent\n                    itself acknowledges that s 131 of the Act is not applicable in the present\n                    circumstances, as the Respondent’s name appears only as\n                    “Publisher” inPunters’ Way,\n                    and not as the author. 86     The statutory presumption which the Respondent\n                    might be entitled to rely on would be s 132 of the Act, which\n                    provides: Presumptions in relation to\n                            publisher of work 132.    Where, in an action\n                            brought by virtue of this Part in relation to a literary, dramatic,\n                            musical or artistic work, section 131 does not apply, but it\n                            is established — (a)    that the work\n                                was first published in Singapore and was so published during\n                                the period of 70 years that ended immediately before the\n                                commencement of the calendar year in which the action was brought;\n                                and (b)    that a name\n                                purporting to be that of the publisher appeared on copies of the\n                                work as first published, then, unless the contrary is established, copyright shall be presumed to\n                        subsist in the work and the person whose name so appeared shall be presumed\n                        to have been the owner of that copyright at the time of the\n                        publication. As the Respondent is identified as the publisher inPunters’ Way, the Respondent contends that copyright\n                    subsists in the Tables, and the Respondent would be presumed to be the\n                    owner. 87     Section 128 of the Australian Copyright\n                    Act 1968 isin pari materiawith s 132 of the\n                    Act, and this issue was comprehensively dealt with inTelstra. We agree fully with Gordon J’s analysis on\n                    s 128 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (equivalent to s 132 of the\n                    Act) at [37]: In my view, the Applicants’ reliance upon\n                            ss 128 and 129 is misplaced. Each section reinforces the importance\n                            of identifying the author or authors of the work in suit. In\n                        understanding the operation of the presumptions it is important to note the\n                        distinction between identifyinganauthor or\n                        authors of the original work andthe identity of\n                            theauthor or authors of the original work. Lest it be\n                        overstated, the [Australian Copyright Act 1968] fixes on the author or\n                        authors ... .If an author or authors (within the\n                            meaning of the [Australian Copyright Act 1968]) cannot be\n                            identifiedat all, in\n                            contradistinction to a situation where the author’s or\n                            authors’ exact identity cannot be identified, copyright cannot\n                            subsist. On a reading of ss 128 and 129, it is the latter situation\n                            to which the [Australian Copyright Act 1968] is directed.\n                        [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] 88     The Respondent also relies on the case ofWaterlow Publishers Ltd v Rose[1995] FSR 207\n                        (“Waterlow”), which referred to\n                    the presumption in s 20(4) of the UK Copyright Act 1956 (4 & 5 Eliz\n                    2 Ch 74), which is similar to s 132 of the Act. In Waterlow, the fact\n                    that the publisher’s name appeared on the copies of the work was enough to\n                    justify a finding that the presumption applied, in accordance with the intention\n                    of s 20(4). Even though there were no identifiable authors, copyright was\n                    held to nonetheless subsist in the relevant work, with the publisher being the\n                    owner of the copyright. 89     However, cases which have relied on the\n                    equivalent of the s 132 presumption, such asWaterlowandMicrosoft Corporation v DHD\n                        Distribution Pty Ltd (t/as Austin Computers)(1999) 45 IPR\n                    459, did not deal with the scenario where the very fact of authorship took\n                    centre stage. Further, the presumption was also not decisive in the dispute and\n                    it was not argued in those cases that an author could not be identified at all.\n                    These cases are therefore of limited assistance here. We also note thatWaterlowappears to be anex temporedecision. This is another reason why undue deference\n                    should not be accorded to it. 90Laddieat\n                    para 3.94 states that where no name purporting to be that of the author\n                    appears on the work as first published, but that of the publisher appears, there\n                    is potentially available under s 104(4) of the 1988 UK Act a presumption\n                    that the named person was the owner of the copyright at the time of publication.\n                    However, Gordon J inTelstra(at [39]) thought that at its highest, this\n                    passage merely suggests that it may be necessary in particular instances to rely\n                    upon the statutory presumptions. Further, these presumptions have little or no\n                    role to play where the question of subsistence of copyright in each of the works\n                    is the central issue between the parties. 91     Pertinently, it has also been observed inLaddieat para 39.85: All that the presumption does is to compel the court to reach the\n                        appropriate conclusion in the absence of evidence to the contrary. If the\n                        opponent does offer evidence in rebuttal (sufficient to satisfy the legal\n                        requirement ofsomeevidence) the presumption\n                        disappears, and the case is in the court’s hands free from any rule.\n                        [emphasis in original] As authorship is in dispute in the present case and the Appellant has\n                    adduced evidence that copyright does not subsist in the Tables since there is no\n                    author, the s 132 statutory presumption has been displaced. 92     We round up our analysis of this issue by\n                    emphasising that it is settled practice that the necessary elements of\n                    authorship, ownership, validity and subsistence must be adequately pleaded for\n                    cases involving copyright infringement: seeBullen &\n                        Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadingsvol 2\n                    (Lord Brennan and William Blair gen eds) (Sweet & Maxwell,\n                    14th Ed, 2001) at para 66-Q1. The Respondent has found itself in a quandary\n                    having pleaded that the company is the author of the Tables and having\n                    maintained this stance throughout the High Court proceedings. Had the Respondent\n                    merely pleaded to be the owner of the copyright, as the presumed owner of the\n                    copyright assigned to it by its employees, the Respondent would still have had\n                    thelocus standito maintain a claim of\n                    infringement against the Appellant. The Respondent tried to salvage its case by\n                    initially submitting to this Court that the Respondent is both the authorandowner of the Tables. However, in the\n                    course of the hearing of this appeal, the Respondent abruptly changed tack and\n                    submitted that it was primarily arguing its case on the basis of ownership; andalternatively, authorship. 93     Regrettably, such a course was no longer open\n                    to the Respondent on the basis of its pleaded case and the conduct of the\n                    proceedings below. It had unequivocally nailed its colours to the mast and the\n                    Appellant had contested the case on that basis. The Respondent cannot now rely\n                    on an alternative claim of ownership which was neither pleaded nor advanced in\n                    the proceedings below.",
        "Summary of the First Issue": "94     In summary, the concept of authorship is\n                    integral to copyright, and no such protection can be accorded without an author\n                    from which an original work emanates, and from which the legal rights flow. We\n                    can do no better than to reiterate the views of Gordon J inTelstraat [35]: [A]uthorship is central to the determination of whether copyright\n                        subsists. To suggest that copyright does not require the identification of\n                        authors where a work is sufficiently original ... puts the cart before the\n                        horse. It ignores the fact that it is the original work of an author or\n                        authors who contribute to the particular form of expression of the work and\n                        reduce the work to a material form that is the act giving rise to the\n                        statutory protection of copyright. 95     As the Respondent could not identify a human\n                    author or authors and we find that an incorporated body cannot be an author of a\n                    copyrighted work; we reject the Respondent’s assertion that it was\n                    entitled to copyright protectionquaauthor.\n                    Accordingly, we do not find that copyright subsists in the Tables.",
        "The Second Issue: If the Respondent is entitled to copyright\n                protection, has the Appellant infringed its rights?": "96     As we disagreed with the Judge that the\n                    Respondent is entitled to copyright protection, it is, strictly speaking,\n                    unnecessary for us to delve into the issue of copyright infringement at all.\n                    However, out of deference to counsel, who have made extensive submissions on\n                    this issue, we shall briefly give our views on this as well. 97     To start with, it is common ground that the\n                    information in the Tables is freely available in the public domain. The\n                    Respondent acknowledges that the information is “mostly, if not all,\n                    provided in raw form by the related Turf Club. Publishers usually obtain these\n                    data from the Turf Club”[note: 3]. 98     The Judge found that the Respondent had\n                    organised the information that was to be included inPunters’ Way; set up tables of the information and decided\n                    how best the tables should be presented in a reader-friendly manner; studied,\n                    experimented and compiled the information to be placed inPunters’ Way; and constructed the tables found inPunters’ Way. The Judge noted (at\n                        [40] of the Judgment) that the\n                    threshold for originality was not set at an exceedingly high level. She also\n                    found that there was sufficient skill and labour applied to the Tables, and\n                    agreed with the Respondent that there was originality in terms of the selection,\n                    arrangement and presentation of the information in the Tables: see [41]–[43] of the Judgment. 99     More specifically, the Judge eventually (at\n                        [41] of the Judgment) held that the\n                    transformation of such “intangible and unexpressed ideas given by\n                    different personnel ... into the manifested forms as shown in the publications\n                    naturally gave rise to an inference that some effort and labour had been\n                    involved”. 100    We agree with the Judge in so far as she\n                    held that the Respondent’s copyright claim cannot be in the information or\n                    data itself, as this is freely available in the public domain. Copyright, if\n                    any, would only exist in the selection, arrangement and presentation of the\n                    information. It is trite that there cannot be a monopoly in facts or\n                    information, but only in the way of presenting or expressing them and it is\n                    always a question of fact whether the skill and labour involved in the\n                    presentation or expression justifies the incidence of copyright: see[33]–[37]above. 101    We also agree with the Judge that the\n                    threshold for originality is traditionally low: see[36]and[38]above. InUniversity Tutorial Pressat 608–609,\n                    Peterson J summarised the meaning of originality in the following classical\n                    passage: The word “original” does not in this connection mean that\n                        the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought. Copyright\n                        Acts are not concerned with the originality of ideas, but with the\n                        expression of thought, and, in the case of “literary work”,\n                        with the expression of thought in print or writing. The originality which is\n                        required relates to the expression of the thought. But the Act does not\n                        require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that\n                        the work must not be copied from another work—that it should originate\n                        from the author. 102    The threshold of originality in compilations\n                    has also been helpfully summed up inRicketsonat\n                    para 7.60: [S]omething more is required by way of original authorial contribution\n                        than simply the act of giving material expression to something. ... [This\n                        poses problems] where the work is of a factual or informational kind, and\n                        the author’s contribution consists of an ordering, arrangement or\n                        summarising of that information. ... In such a case, ... the requirement of\n                        “originality” assumes a heightened importance … . It is\n                        only the author’s presentation of the data that is protected, and this\n                        must display or reflect the application of some identifiable element of\n                        skill and labour on the part of the author. The final work therefore must be\n                        more than a bare recital of facts or figures. 103    In the present situation, while the Tables\n                    published inPunters’ Waycontain\n                    information extracted from the Turf Club, the Respondent had not merely\n                    reprinted the horse-racing data wholesale or in alphabetical order, but had\n                    selected information it thought relevant and arranged it in a manner that was\n                    thought to be most conducive for readers. 104    We find in this context the approach adopted\n                    inInterfirm Comparison (Australia) Pty Ltd v Law Society\n                        (NSW)[1977] RPC 137 instructive. In that case, Bowen CJ\n                    held that despite the fact that the work exhibited little material that could be\n                    regarded as having much novelty or originality in the ordinary sense of that\n                    term, it was specifically drawn for a particular profession and for a particular\n                    purpose and, although it used much old and publicly-known material, it presented\n                    it in a new form as the work of the author. Similarly, despite the fact that the\n                    material used in the Tables was easily accessible to all, the information waspresentedin a distinct form which would\n                    attract copyright protection. 105    We therefore accept that the Tables inPunters’ Wayhad a “quality of\n                    character not possessed by the raw material”: seeFortuity Pty Ltd v Barcza(1995) 32 IPR 517. This is\n                    evident as the raw information provided by the Turf Club is distinct from what\n                    was eventually published inPunters’ Waywhich was more comprehensible.",
        "Was there a causal connection?": "106    The Judge found (at [45] of the Judgment) that as the\n                    Appellant’s managing director and sole witness, Levar Steven Michael\n                    (“Levar”), was employed by the Respondent, he had access to the\n                    Tables. However we pause to note that the Judge incorrectly found Levar to have\n                    been previously employed by the Respondent. In actual fact, Levar had set up his\n                    own consultancy services to race clubs and to those who transact in the sale and\n                    purchase of horses. He had done this consultancy work for the Respondent in June\n                    2006. Additionally, although he was also the horse-racing expert on the\n                    Respondent’s website, <http://www.winner21.com>, for around six\n                    months, he was never an employee of the Respondent. 107    Nevertheless this distinction is merely\n                    technical, as Levar’s connection with the Respondent was immaterial sincePunters’ Way, as well as the raw data\n                    were freely available in the public domain and Levar could easily have access toPunters’ Way. As long as there is\n                    substantial similarity between the Appellant’s and Respondent’s\n                    work, and it can be shown that the Appellant had access to the\n                    Respondent’s work, this will give rise to aprima\n                        facieinference of copying by the Respondent. But it must be\n                    remembered that this is not just a quantitative assessment, it is essentially a\n                    qualitative test. 108    It is established that so long as a causal\n                    connection can be established between the two works, it is not consequential if\n                    the copying is direct or indirect. It is clear in this situation that Levar, or\n                    any of the Appellant’s employees could easily purchase a copy ofPunters’ Wayand adopt its presentation in\n                    subsequent publications ofRacing\n                Guide. 109    It is also apparent that over time,Racing Guidepublications morphed and began to\n                    appear somewhat similar toPunters’ Way.\n                    While there used to be an additional “Selections” feature between\n                    Table 1 (Race Card) and Table 2 (Results Panel) ofRacing Guide, this was subsequently altered such that this\n                    feature was incorporated into Table 2, resulting in identical sequential\n                    arrangements of the Tables in both publications. Additionally, the Appellant had\n                    included a “J-1-2-3” feature in Table 1 (Race Card) ofRacing Guide, which mimicked the\n                    “R-1-2-3” feature inPunters’\n                        Way. These were only added after Levar had joined the Appellant\n                    as managing director in 2007. Further, the column for the total runs of the\n                    horses was not featured inRacing Guideprior to\n                    Levar’s taking over the helm of the Appellant. 110    From the above, it is apparent that the\n                    Tables inRacing Guidewere derived from the\n                    Tables inPunters’ Way.",
        "Was a substantial part of the work copied?": "111    We agree with the Judge that the Tables inRacing Guidewere arranged in a sequence that\n                    was exactly the same as that found inPunters’\n                        Way. However, although the Judge had found that there was copying\n                    and infringement of the Tables inPunters’\n                        WaybyRacing Guidefrom June\n                    2007–June 2008, no copies of thePunters’\n                        Wayeditions from June 2007–December 2007 were exhibited.\n                    In fact, the earliest copy we have for comparison would be the January 2008\n                    issue. Thus, no finding of copying ought to have been made for the months of\n                    June 2007–December 2007. 112    On a comparison of the January 2008 issues\n                    of both publications, we agree with the Judge that the eight columns of\n                    Table 1 (Race Card) found inRacing Guidewere arranged in substantially the same sequence as that inPunters’ Way. There was only a slight difference in that\n                    the last two columns of Table 1 were interchanged. In addition,\n                    Table 2 (Results Panel) was substantially similar in that both publications\n                    included the exact sequence of the top four horses, followed by the\n                    “time” column, with a dollar sign found in each column. Further,\n                    both Tables 3 (Track Work) and 4 (Results of Past Performances) were\n                    sequentially identical. 113    We also agree with the Judge that the\n                    existence of dissimilarities did not necessarily mean that there was no copying.\n                    The dissimilarities betweenRacing GuideandPunters’ Waywere eitherde minimisor merely cosmetic. In essence, looking at\n                    the manner of presentation and compilation of the horse-racing information as a\n                    whole, the Tables inRacing Guideincorporated a\n                    substantial part of the Tables found inPunters’\n                        Wayeven with the minor additions inRacing\n                        Guide: see the Judgment at [58]. We do not find it necessary to depart from the\n                    Judge’s finding that,prima facie, a\n                    substantial part of the Tables had been copied and that this had not been\n                    rebutted by the Appellant. 114    Nonetheless this finding of copying by the\n                    Appellant is now moot as we have pointed out above that no copyright subsisted\n                    in the work. It follows, therefore, that there was no infringement of the\n                    Respondent’s copyright by the Appellant.",
        "The Third Issue: Has the Respondent established the constituent\n                elements for a passing off action?": "115    Apart from pursuing a claim for copyright\n                    infringement, the Respondent also claimed that the Appellant had committed the\n                    tort of passing off by copying the get-up ofPunters’\n                        Way, which includes the colour code of the front covers, the\n                    picture of forward-facing racehorses and the advertisement panel across the\n                    bottom of the cover. The Respondent claimed that goodwill existed in the get-up\n                    ofPunters’ Wayas it had been selling\n                    copies since 1977, and the colour code had been in place since 1993.\n                    Consequently, the Respondent alleged misrepresentation by the Appellant in\n                    adopting a remarkably similar colour coding and using a similar picture\n                    featuring forward-facing racehorses on the cover ofRacing\n                        Guide. The Respondent also alleged that it had suffered damage as\n                    a result of the passing off. 116Novelty Pte Ltd v\n                        Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009] 3 SLR(R) 216\n                        (“Amanresorts”) affirmed (at\n                        [37]) that the “classical\n                    trinity” of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage must be established by\n                    the party seeking to claim passing off before an action can succeed. We now\n                    proceed to examine whether each of these elements have been satisfied by the\n                    Respondent in the present case.",
        "Goodwill": "117    The Respondent is required to establish that\n                    it had acquired goodwill at the relevant date, which is the date on which the\n                    conduct of the Appellant that the Respondent complained of started. The classic\n                    definition of goodwill may be derived fromThe Commissioners\n                        of Inland Revenue v Muller & Co.’s Margarine, Limited[1901] AC 217 at 223–224, which held that goodwill “is the benefit\n                    and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a\n                    business”. 118    In the present circumstances, the Respondent\n                    claimed goodwill in: (a) the colour code for the different race days over a\n                    weekend; (b) the picture of forward-facing racehorses; and (c) the\n                    advertisement panel across the bottom of the cover. According to the Respondent,\n                    the colour code has been in use byPunters’\n                        Waysince 1993 in order to allow punters and readers to easily\n                    identify the particular race day they were interested in by the colour of the\n                    book. In addition, the Respondent alleges that since 1977,Punters’ Wayhas been selling an average of 31,000 copies\n                    weekly. 119    Whether a get-up has acquired the necessary\n                    distinctiveness is a question of fact. Here, the Respondent has been publishingPunters’ Wayfor around 30 years, since\n                    1977. It has also been shown in a market survey done by Nielsen Company in March\n                        2007[note: 4], that overall the Respondent\n                    enjoyed 80% of the market share in the horse-racing industry in\n                        Singapore[note: 5]. In\n                    addition, Levar acknowledged “thatPunters’\n                        Waywas the market leader in Singapore at various stages in its\n                        history”[note: 6]. With the Appellant’s own\n                    witness acknowledging the dominant presence of the Respondent’s products\n                    in the horse-racing market, it ought to be accepted that there is indeed a\n                    business within the jurisdiction of Singapore in which goodwill can\n                    attach. 120    We agree with the Judge that the Respondent\n                    had built up considerable goodwill in the business and overall get-up ofPunters’ WayasPunters’ Wayhad adopted the unique colour-coding since\n                    1993, had been sold in a substantial number of stores and newsstands in\n                    Singapore, and had been advertised with considerable effort: at [73] of the Judgment. We therefore find that\n                    goodwill is attached to the particular get-up ofPunters’ Way.",
        "Misrepresentation": "121    The Respondent is also required to show\n                    that: (a)     the Appellant has made a\n                        misrepresentation to the relevant sector of the public;\n                    and (b)     such\n                        misrepresentation has resulted in or is likely to result in damage to the\n                        Respondent’s goodwill. 122    As noted by this court inAmanresortsat [69], the\n                    elements of misrepresentation and damage are very closely linked, and it is\n                    crucial to appreciate that both the misrepresentation and the damage must relate\n                    to the Respondent’s goodwill. A misrepresentation is actionable as a tort\n                    of passing off only if it causes (or is likely to cause) damage to the\n                    Respondent’s goodwill. 123    The essential question is whether the\n                    Appellant has made a false representation that led to deception or confusion\n                    amongst the relevant sector of the public. The relevant sector of the public\n                    would, in this situation, clearly be punters, and people with a keen interest in\n                    the horse races. In the case of a claim of adoption of get-up, the real question\n                    is whether the get-up adopted by the offending party is sufficiently similar to\n                    that of the plaintiff as to give rise to confusion. In proving\n                    misrepresentation, it has been previously established inTong\n                        Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd[1991] 1 SLR(R) 903 (“Tong\n                    Guan”) at [24] that\n                    the court is not concerned with the “moron in a hurry” being\n                    confused. Rather, the test that is to be applied is whether ordinary sensible\n                    members of the public would be confused. It is sufficient that a substantial\n                    proportion of persons who are probably purchasers of the goods of the kind in\n                    question would in fact be confused. 124    The Judge found that on a perusal of the\n                    cover pages ofRacing GuideandPunters’ Way, there was a compelling case that the\n                    Appellant had consciously and deliberately made changes to the cover ofRacing Guideto misrepresentRacing GuideasPunters’\n                        Way: at [76] of the\n                    Judgment. This was especially so since the same colours for the covers were used\n                    for the same specific function as those devised by the Respondent. Further, the\n                    Judge found that the Appellant had changed the position of its advertisement\n                    panel such that it was similar to the Respondent’s publication and that\n                    there was also striking similarity between the Chinese titles for both\n                    publications. The Judge made her observations on the similarities between the\n                    two publications without regard to the market survey done by the\n                    Respondent’s expert witness Greg Coops (“Coops”) but\n                    nevertheless found that Coops’ evidence only served to reinforce her\n                    findings: at [77]–[79] of the Judgment. 125    However, we find that little reliance ought\n                    to be placed on the market survey due to the lack of objectivity in the way the\n                    survey was conducted. The survey included the comparison of issues ofPunters’ WayandRacing\n                        Guidewhich were published on different days –\n                    19 October 2008 forPunters’ Wayand\n                    27 April 2008 forRacing Guide. The two\n                    issues appear to have been deliberately chosen as they were most similar in\n                    their get-up – including the colour of the cover page, and the pictures of\n                    the horses. The survey was therefore conducted by approximating the two issues\n                    which were most similar. However, the stubborn fact remains that these two\n                    issues were not published on the same day. Such a comparison would not be a fair\n                    test. 126    Additionally, the survey was conducted with\n                    the masthead removed. The masthead accounts for one-third of the magazine and\n                    would be a key distinguishing feature for punters seeking to purchase a\n                    particular magazine. The target survey audience were also questioned as to\n                    whether they could identify the magazines without the name and title of the\n                    magazines. This would not be a fair comparison. 127    Further, one of the questions asked in the\n                    survey was “how likely would it be for you to confuse these two magazines\n                    if you were in a hurry and you were selecting one of them?”[note: 7]. This question would lead to an\n                    inaccurate finding of misrepresentation to the public as it approximates the\n                    “moron in a hurry” test. Therefore, we disagree with the Judge\n                    that the survey conducted by Coops was appropriate and representative of the\n                    public’s view. 128    With respect, we also find that the scenario\n                    described by the Judge, that race-goers who were “less educated or who\n                    were late and/or were in a hurry to get into the grounds of the race\n                    track” (at[87]of the Judgment)\n                    would be confused and would buy a racing guide thinking it wasPunters’ Waywhen it was actuallyRacing Guide, was flawed, as this similarly approximated\n                    the “moron in a hurry” test. 129    The correct test that should be applied is\n                    that of the imperfect recollection test – not to compare both publications\n                    side by side, but to take into account the fact that the “confusion which\n                    may occur will take place when the customer has in his mind his recollection of\n                    the plaintiff’s mark, which may well be only an idea of the whole or\n                    actual mark”: seeTong Guanat [26]. 130    It appears unlikely to us, in the absence of\n                    cogent evidence, that the punting audience to which both publications are\n                    targeted are undiscerning. They would know precisely which publication they\n                    wanted to purchase and would ask for eitherPunters’\n                        WayorRacing Guide, two very\n                    dissimilar names, when purchasing the magazine. The assumption that customers\n                    purchase the magazines on the basis of colour has not been proved by the\n                    Respondent, and may in fact not be true. The colour-coding may have been\n                    irrelevant to the customers and, if so, there would be no misrepresentation. It\n                    was also unpersuasive that the picture of forward-facing racehorses on the front\n                    cover was misleading as every horse-racing guide would logically feature horses\n                    on its cover page. The Respondent cannot be said to have a monopoly over\n                    pictures of commonplace horses or even forward-facing racehorses. Additionally,\n                    the titles of the publications are prominently displayed on the magazines. We\n                    are of the opinion that the large mastheads are significant distinguishing\n                    factors and as such, there would be no confusion caused to the\n                public. 131    In the case ofTong\n                        Guan, illiteracy was seen as “an evaporating\n                    consideration” (at [30]) in\n                    Singapore by 1991, and the court took the view that a purchaser would use\n                    ordinary care to read (whether in English or Chinese) the brand names of the\n                    products in order to distinguish between two different brands. In the present\n                    circumstances, it can be said that the problem of illiteracy is even more\n                    removed than it was in 1991. Furthermore, punters and race-goers are likely to\n                    be a circumspect and discerning audience. As inTong\n                        Guan, where the court held that the brands “Tong\n                    Guan” and “Deer Brand” were sufficiently distinguishable,\n                    it can also be similarly argued that “Punters’\n                        Way” and “Racing Guide” are phonetically and\n                    visually different and thus a customer using ordinary care would not be\n                    confused. 132    We therefore disagree with the Judge and\n                    find that no misrepresentation leading to confusion of the public has been\n                    proven by the Respondent on the present facts. The cover pages of the two\n                    magazines are sufficiently distinct and are not likely to be confused by the\n                    relevant sector of the public.",
        "Damage": "133    Even if the Appellant could be shown to have\n                    misrepresentedRacing GuideasPunters’ Way, thereby causing confusion between the\n                    Respondent’s racing guide and that of the Appellant, such\n                    misrepresentation is not in itself actionable unless it has caused, or is likely\n                    to cause, damage to the Respondent’s goodwill. 134    The Respondent claimed the net loss of\n                    profits that it suffered from 30 June 2007 to 5 June 2008, as well as\n                    continuing damages and loss from 5 June 2008 to the date of filing of the\n                    Statement of Claim for the Respondent’s continued infringement. The\n                    Respondent also sought the costs incurred in conducting market surveys to verify\n                    the extent of the damage caused, as well as an injunction to restrain the\n                    Appellant from infringing the Respondent’s copyright. However, the\n                    Respondent only invited the court to infer damage or the likelihood of damage\n                    that had been suffered by the Respondent as a result of the misrepresentation by\n                    the Appellant. The Respondent did not lead any evidence on a loss of sales, or a\n                    decline in the growth of sales ofPunters’\n                        Way. 135    The Judge found (at [82] of the Judgment) that where parties are\n                    in direct competition with one another, the court will readily infer the\n                    likelihood of damage to the Respondent’s goodwill, not merely through the\n                    loss of sales, but also through the loss of the exclusive use of his\n                    get-up. 136    We do not agree that the test for damages\n                    has been correctly applied by the Judge on the established facts. While it is\n                    accepted that the common test applied in proving damage is “actual damage\n                    or a real likelihood of damage”, it must be noted that the period of\n                    infringement alleged by the Respondent was a limited one – from\n                    30 June 2007 to 5 June 2008. This was not a situation where the\n                    infringement by the Appellant was ongoing or impending and therefore\n                    unquantifiable. In actual fact, the infringement period had long since ended.\n                    The Respondent ought therefore to have been able to prove a decline in sales ofPunters’ Way, or a reduced growth in\n                    sales ofPunters’ Way, if this had indeed\n                    taken place. In such a situation, the right test that should be applied would be\n                    that of “actual damage” and not “likelihood of\n                    damage”. 137Prima facieproof of damage is essential in the present situation in establishing the\n                    Appellant’s liability. However, the Respondent had failed to lead any\n                    evidence on the damage that it had suffered to its goodwill from the\n                    Appellant’s alleged misrepresentation ofPunters’\n                        Way. The Respondent had merely relied on a\n                    “logical” inference that as the Appellant and the\n                    Respondent’s publications were in a common field of activity, it would\n                    therefore not be far-fetched to conclude that the Respondent had suffered\n                    losses. 138    The Respondent had submitted at the hearing\n                    of the appeal, that because the trial had been bifurcated, no evidence of\n                    damages was led at trial. The application for bifurcation had in fact been taken\n                    out by the Appellant and it was heard on 9 November 2009 before an\n                    assistant registrar. During the bifurcation hearing, the Appellant’s\n                    counsel had argued that the trial should be bifurcated as all that the\n                    Respondent was required to prove was a likelihood of damage and not the quantum\n                    of the damage. The assistant registrar subsequently allowed a bifurcation of the\n                    trial. 139    In these circumstances, since the\n                    Appellant’s counsel himself was of the opinion that a likelihood of damage\n                    was all that was required to prove the tort of passing off, we do not find it\n                    just to penalise the Respondent for not leading evidence of actual damages at\n                    the trial. However we reiterate that, ideally, the test for damages in\n                    situations where the period of infringement had passed should be proof of actual\n                    damage and nothing short of that.",
        "Our conclusion on the passing off claim": "140    We therefore respectfully disagree with the\n                    Judge, and conclude that the element of misrepresentation in the tort of passing\n                    off has not been successfully proven by the Respondent and therefore the claim\n                    of passing off cannot succeed.",
        "Consequential relief": "141    The Appellant, in the court below,\n                    counterclaimed against the Respondent under s 200(1) of the Act for making\n                    groundless threats of legal proceedings. Section 200(1) of the Act provides\n                    that where a person threatens another person with a copyright infringement\n                    action, the latter may bring an action against the former for,inter alia, a declaration that the threat is\n                    unjustifiable, unless the former satisfies the court that the alleged infringing\n                    acts “constituted, or if done, would constitute, an infringement of\n                    copyright”. The full text of s 200(1) reads as follows: Groundless threats of legal\n                            proceedings 200. —(1) Where a person, by means of circulars,\n                        advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with an action or proceeding\n                        in respect of an infringement of copyright, then, whether the person making\n                        the threats is or is not the owner of the copyright or an exclusive\n                        licensee, a person aggrieved may bring an action against the first-mentioned\n                        person and may — (a)    obtain a\n                                declaration to the effect that the threats are\n                            unjustifiable; (b)    obtain an\n                                injunction against the continuance of the threats; and (c)    recover such\n                                damages, if any, as he has sustained, unless the first-mentioned person satisfies the court that the acts in\n                        respect of which the action or proceeding was threatened constituted, or, if\n                        done, would constitute, an infringement of copyright. 142    Having regard to our findings that copyright\n                    did not subsist in the Tables inPunters’\n                        Way, and that the Appellant therefore could not have infringed\n                    any copyright of the Respondent’s, it must follow that the Respondent has\n                    made groundless threats against the Appellant for the purposes of s 200(1)\n                    of the Act.",
        "Conclusion": "143    In the result, we find that the\n                    Respondent’s threats to bring an action for copyright infringement against\n                    the Appellant are unjustifiable. The Respondent’s claim for the tort of\n                    passing off is similarly untenable. Accordingly, the present appeal against the\n                    Judge’s decision is allowed. The injunction granted by the Judge to\n                    restrain the Appellant from infringing the Respondent’s copyright in its\n                    publications ofPunters’ Wayis discharged.\n                    The Appellant is entitled to damages against the Respondent for groundlessly\n                    threatening the Appellant with copyright infringement under s 200(1) of the Act\n                    (which shall be assessed by an assistant registrar), and an injunction\n                    restraining the Respondent from making further threats against the Appellant in\n                    respect of the subject matter of these proceedings. Because the Appellant has\n                    not succeeded in several of its arguments (here and below) we invite the parties\n                    to make written submissions on the appropriate costs order we should make for\n                    the entire proceedings. The parties have seven days from the date of this\n                    judgment to make these submissions.  [note: 1]Appellant’s Case, para 23.
