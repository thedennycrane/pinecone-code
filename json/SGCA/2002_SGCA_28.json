        "Held": ", allowing both appeals in part:(1) Sally was not guilty of dishonest\n\n  assistance or of knowing receipt vis--vis the sum remitted from TTSC to Caltong. As\n\n  such, she should not be held to be personally liable for this sum. To be liable for\n\n  knowing receipt, three elements must be proved. First, the plaintiff must show a disposal\n\n  of his assets in breach of fiduciary duty. Secondly, there must have been the beneficial\n\n  receipt by the defendant of assets traceable to the assets of the plaintiff. Finally, it\n\n  must be shown that the defendant had knowledge that the assets are traceable to a breach\n\n  of fiduciary duty;El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings[1994] BCLC 464 followed. In the\n\n  present case, Sally did not receive the money and there was no evidence to indicate that\n\n  she knew that the money received by Caltong from Tong was improperly siphoned off from\n\n  TTSC (see  30 – 31).(2) The elements which must be proved to\n\n  establish dishonest assistance are (a) that there has been a disposal of assets in breach\n\n  of trust or fiduciary duty; (b) in which the defendant has assisted or which she/he has\n\n  procured; (c) the defendant acted dishonestly; and (d) resulting loss to the claimant;Royal\n\n  Brunei Airlines v Tan[1995] 2 AC 378 followed. There was no evidence that Sally had\n\n  dishonestly assisted Tong, Koo or Angela in siphoning off the funds of TTSC to Caltong.\n\n  That she was a nominee director of Caltong did not per se mean that she would also know of\n\n  the Tongs’ wrongdoings. (see  33 - 35).(3) When a trustee mixes trust funds with\n\n  his own funds, the whole is subject to the trust, except so far as he is able to\n\n  distinguish what is his own;Firth v Cartland(1865) 71 ER 525 andRe\n\n  Tilley’s Will Trust[1967] 1 Ch 1179 followed. In this case, Sally used proceeds\n\n  from the Barker Road property to buy the Woodward property and knew that the proceeds were\n\n  tainted. Having knowingly mixed trust monies with her own when purchasing the property,\n\n  the burden was on her to show which portion of the purchase price came from her own\n\n  resources. However, having regard to the nature of the pleadings, and the manner in which\n\n  the trial had proceeded, it was fairer to afford Sally the opportunity of showing the\n\n  extent to which she and/or her husband had contributed towards that portion of the\n\n  purchase price of the Woodward property in excess of the amount obtained from the sale of\n\n  the Barker Road property.(4) Once leave is obtained to commence an\n\n  action against a bankrupt under s 76(1)(c)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act, that leave should\n\n  hold good until the final determination of the proceeding, including any appeal. There is\n\n  really no good reason why leave should be obtained at every stage;Overseas Union Bank\n\n  v Lew Keh Lam[1999] 3 SLR 393distinguished (see  51 – 52).(5) Tracing is a process rather than a\n\n  remedy. It enables a plaintiff to trace what has happened to his property, identify the\n\n  persons who have handled or received it and justify his claim that the assets/property\n\n  which they handled or received can properly be regarded as representing his property.;Foskett\n\n  v Mckeown[2000] 3 All ER 97 followed (see  53). For a tracing order to operate, the\n\n  assets from which a tracing exercise is to begin must be identified. However, it is not\n\n  necessary to identify the traceable proceeds, as one of the objects of a tracing exercise\n\n  is to establish this (see  57).(6) The court is entitled to take all the\n\n  circumstances of a case into account in determining whether a tracing order should be\n\n  granted. While TTSC’s prayer for a tracing order was inadequately formulated, this\n\n  did not preclude a court from granting an appropriate tracing order if the case warranted\n\n  it (see  58).(7) No tracing order based on the $53.3\n\n  million, which Tong, Koo and Angela were held to be accountable, would be granted. This\n\n  was because there would be great difficulties in identifying the specific sums from which\n\n  tracing was to be initiated, bearing in mind the numerous transactions which would have\n\n  taken place (see  59).(8) The same could not be said of the\n\n  $984,899.60 received by Caltong from Tong/TTSC as this was a starting point from which\n\n  tracing could begin. While proceedings would be extended by such a tracing exercise, this\n\n  was inevitable. Furthermore, a tracing order was not redundant as it could compel third\n\n  parties to assist in the exercise. This could be useful as Caltong was not very\n\n  cooperative in disclosing its records (see  60 – 61).",
        "Per Curiam": "A party may be liable to another for\n\ndamages on account of a tort the former had committed, but that does not render that party\n\na constructive trustee of the same. It remains a personal debt (see  27).",

        "Legislation referred to": "Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Ed) s\n\n76(1)(c)(ii)Curia Advisari Vult[Delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA]JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1.    These two related appeals arise from a decision of the High\n\nCourt in an action instituted by the liquidator of a company, Tong Tien See Construction\n\nPte Ltd ((TTSC), against primarily its former directors and shareholders for conspiracy,\n\nfraud, and breach of fiduciary duties, and for the necessary reliefs. At the conclusion of\n\nthe trial, judgment and various reliefs were granted in favour of TTSC. However, the High\n\nCourt refused to grant a tracing order to TTSC and this formed the subject matter of the\n\nappeal by TTSC in CA 600130/2001.2.    Some of the orders made in favour of TTSC were against Caltong\n\n(Australia) Pty Ltd (Caltong) and Wei Fong Rasiah, Sally (Sally), the 8thand\n\n12thdefendants respectively in the action below. Both Caltong and Sally have\n\nappealed against the orders on the ground that their scope is too wide.The facts3.    TTSC was in the building construction business. It was a major\n\nplayer in the industry, having attained the highest grade (G8) under the HDB ranking\n\nsystem for building contractors. It was a family owned company, started by the patriach\n\nTong Tien See (Tong), the first defendant. It was initially a sole-proprietorship and was\n\nconverted into a private limited company in 1985. Tong controlled TTSC with the help of\n\nhis wife, Koo Yoke Fong (Koo), the second defendant, and a daughter, Tong Hui Chee, Angela\n\n(Angela), the third defendant.4.    On 26 May 2000, TTSC was wound up on the ground of insolvency, it\n\nbeing unable to pay its debts amounting to some $53.3 million. In fact, earlier, on 2\n\nMarch 2000, TTSC was placed under interim judicial management.5.    The liquidator, having examined the affairs of the company, came\n\nto the conclusion that breaches of fiduciary duties had occurred on the part of the\n\ndirectors, among others, which included the improper disposal of the assets of the\n\ncompany. He also discovered that TTSC was, in fact, insolvent from the financial year\n\n1995/96. What happened was that in order to maintain the \"G8\" status of TTSC, a\n\nhallmark of credit worthiness which required TTSC to have a net worth of $5 million, a\n\nscheme was hatched by Tong and others. This involved transferring losses of TTSC to an\n\naffiliated company, Tong Joo Aik Construction Pte Ltd (Tong Joo), the sixth defendant, by\n\nthe raising of sham bills over a period of some years, amounting in total to about $25\n\nmillion.6.    As part of the scheme to siphon money from TTSC, bills were also\n\nraised by Tong Joo to TTSC to enable large sums of money to be transferred from TTSC to\n\nTong Joo. It should be noted that Tong Joo did not carry out any business of its own other\n\nthan being so made used of. The moneys of TTSC received by Tong Joo were used by Tong and\n\nKoo to purchase residential properties under their personal names.7.    Tong and Koo also transferred in total a sum of some $194 million\n\nfrom TTSC and placed them on interest bearing accounts, with Tong and Koo keeping the\n\ninterest earned and returning only the capital sums to TTSC. Even after the winding up\n\norder was made, Tong withdrew a total of $482,000 from TTSC for his own personal use.8.    One of the properties which Tong bought with monies from TTSC was\n\na plot of land at No. 4 Kew Drive. It was subsequently subdivided into four plots where\n\nfour new houses were constructed and they were later known as Nos 4 and 4A Kew Drive and\n\nNos 755 and 757 Upper East Coast Road. These four properties were registered in the names\n\nof Koo and Angela. The building costs were funded from a loan from OCBC Bank but the\n\ninterest due was paid by Tong Joo, using funds from TTSC.9.    Between 1996 and 2000, TTSC’s funds of up to $3.7 million\n\nwere utilized by Tong, Koo and Angela (‘the Tongs’ where appropriate) for their\n\npersonal benefit. The Tongs also bought holiday homes in Perth and Sydney.10.    Thirteen persons were identified by the liquidator as having\n\ndealt with or received moneys from TTSC and were made defendants to the action. They\n\nwere:-First defendant– Tong Tien See (Tong)Second defendant– Koo Yoke Fong (Koo), the wife of\n\n      Tong. While she was never formally appointed a director of TTSC, she was effectively the\n\n      number two person in the company, next to Tong. She was ade factodirector.Third defendant– Tong Hui Chee, Angela\n\n      (Angela), the second daughter of Tong and Koo. She is an accountant by profession and was\n\n      very much involved in the affairs of TTSC.Fourth defendant– Koo Say Hee, Raymond (Raymond), a\n\n      younger brother of Koo. He was the Deputy Managing Director of TTSC and took care of\n\n      things at work sites.Fifth defendant- Chia Siew Keng (Chia), a director of\n\n      TTSC. She started work with Tong in 1975 when TTSC was a sole proprietorship. She resigned\n\n      from TTSC in March 2000.Sixth defendant– Tong Joo Aik Construction Pte Ltd\n\n      (Tong Joo), an affiliated company of TSSC. It has also become insolvent.Seventh defendant– Tong Development Pte Ltd (TDPL),\n\n      another affiliated company of TTSC, being wholly owned by Tong Joo.Eighth defendant- Caltong (Australia) Pty Ltd (Caltong),\n\n      another affiliated company incorporated in Australia. It was an investment company set up\n\n      by Tong, Koo and Angela.Ninth defendant– Tong Hui Li Linda (Linda), the\n\n      eldest daughter of Tong and Koo. She was a director and shareholder of Tong Joo and a\n\n      director of TDPL.Tenth defendant– Tong Hui Chuen, Carol (Carol), the\n\n      third daughter of Tong and Koo. She was a director of Tong Joo.Eleventh defendant– Tong Hui Fung, Cindy (Cindy), thefourth daughter of Tong and Koo. She became a director of TTSC only in February 2000.Twelveth defendant– Wei Fong Rasiah, Sally (Sally), the\n\n      younger sister of Koo. She is an Australian citizen. She and her husband operated two\n\n      McDonald’s restaurants in Sydney.Thirteen defendant– Lee Han Chye Alvin (Alvin), the\n\n      husband of Angela, the third defendant.11.    Before the commencement of the trial below,\n\nTong was, on 23 February 2001, adjudicated a bankrupt. Earlier, in the beginning of 2000,\n\nafter having sold their properties here, Tong, his wife and daughters, Angela and Carol,\n\nmoved south to settle in Australia.12.    The evidence showed that by 1998, because of the way Tong and Koo\n\nhad been fiddling with the accounts and moneys of TTSC (treating its moneys very much as\n\ntheir own), TTSC was no longer able to meet its commitments to its sub-contractors. As a\n\nresult, supplies and services needed for TTSC projects were disrupted because payments due\n\nto the sub-contractors were not made. On account of the manipulations, TTSC was able to\n\nmaintain its G8 status and continue to receive big construction contracts. As a result,\n\nsub-contractors were deluded into contractual arrangements with TTSC.13.    TDPL was a housing developer, and had borrowed various sums of\n\nmoney from TTSC for its business. Repayments of the loans were made from time to time but\n\nas at the date of liquidation of TTSC, TDPL was owing the former some $1.5 million.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2000, Tong Joo had also transferred about $8.66 million to TDPL.14.    From November 1994 to April 1997, TTSC transferred a total of\n\n$984,899.60 to Caltong. By a directors’ resolution of TTSC, the debt was switched\n\nfrom Caltong to Tong. With the funds, Caltong purchased two properties in Australia –\n\n39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney and The Stamford, 5256 Goderich Street, Perth. A third\n\nproperty, 70 Barker Road, Sydney, was also bought by Caltong but sold in 1999 for\n\nA$800,000. Until November 1998, the first three defendants, Tong, Koo and Angela, held 1/3\n\nshare each in Caltong. Thereafter, Sally became the sole shareholder and in November 1999,\n\nthe sole director.15.    Sally and her husband owned several properties in Australia. One\n\nproperty which was of concern to the present action was No. 17 Woodward Avenue (Woodward\n\nproperty), which was a rather large house, purchased by Sally in March 2000 in her sole\n\nname at a price of A$1.47 million. She claimed that to purchase that property she borrowed\n\nA$670,000 from Tong and the remainder came from the resources of herself and her husband.\n\nHowever, some months after the purchase, the property was mortgaged for A$800,000. The\n\nevidence pointed to the fact that Sally bought this rather large house because Tong and\n\nKoo and their family were coming over to live in Australia. That was the finding of the\n\njudge below although Sally claimed that the house had nothing to do with TTSC or its\n\nfunds. She said she rented it out to the Tongs but there was no fixed rental.16.    As for Alvin, he worked full time as a fuel oil broker earning a\n\nsubstantial salary of $12,000. He and Angela lived with her parents at 2 Kew Drive until\n\n755 East Coast Road (No. 755) was completed. He bought over No. 755 from Koo and Angela\n\nfor $1.7 million, using $170,000 from his CPF and $340,000 in cash and the rest, $1.19\n\nmillion, came from a bank loan. Of the $340,000 in cash, $230,000 was a three-year\n\ninterest free loan which he obtained from one Peggy Koo, the youngest sister of Koo (the\n\nsecond defendant). The records indicated that the 10% due on the exercise of the option to\n\npurchase No. 755 was never paid, though eventually the full purchase price was paid.Findings of trial judge17.    For several years prior to the winding up of TTSC, no formal\n\nAnnual General Meetings or Directors’ Meetings were held. Raymond and Chia would sign\n\nwhatever documents were placed under their noses by the first three defendants. The trial\n\njudge did not make Raymond and Chia accountable for the wrongdoings in relation to the\n\ndisposal of the assets of TTSC because he felt that they were under considerable duress.\n\nThe judge also did not make any order against Linda, Carol and Cindy, the three daughters\n\nof Tong because they were not really involved in the day-to-day running of TTSC, Tong Joo\n\nor TDPL.18.    The judge held that the real culprits of the entire scheme were\n\nTong, Koo and Angela. They had, knowingly, carried on the business of TTSC with intent to\n\ndefraud its creditors. He held them to be personally liable pursuant to s 340 of the\n\nCompanies Act without any limitation of liability for all the debts of TTSC.19.    We have earlier mentioned four houses being erected on No 4 Kew\n\nDrive. One of the four houses, No. 757 Upper East Coast Road, was sold by Koo and Angela\n\nin July 1996, reaping a profit of $501,000. In January 2000, the remaining 3 houses were\n\npurportedly sold to Tong Joo at 10% above valuation, with a view to reducing Tong and\n\nKoo’s indebtedness to Tong Joo. Although this transaction was recorded in the books\n\nof Tong Joo, Koo and Angela remained the owners of the three properties. Indeed, the\n\nproperty at No. 755 was sold to Alvin.20.    Interestingly, to support the application for judicial\n\nmanagement, the three properties, Nos 4 and 4A Kew Drive and No. 755, together with No 2\n\nKew Drive (the residence of Tong and Koo), an Ocean Park apartment (bought by Tong in\n\n1990), and the balance of sale proceeds of the Eastwood Lodge developed by TDPL, were\n\ntreated as assets of TTSC in the computation of dividends payable to unsecured creditors.\n\nIt was anticipated that the balance of the sale proceeds of the Eastwood Lodge development\n\nwould be some $1.024 million. There was no record as to what happened to this sum.21.    As TTSC’s funds were used to develop the four houses on No.\n\n4 Kew Drive and the Eastwood Lodge, the court held that TTSC would have an interest in\n\nthem or their proceeds of sale.22.    As for the Woodward property, the judge found it was bought by\n\nSally as Tong and Koo were then about to migrate to Australia and needed a large house.\n\nThe funds for the purchase came from the proceeds of sale of 70 Barker Road (see 14\n\nabove). The judge did not believe that Sally bought the Woodward property for her own\n\npurposes because,inter alia-If (Koo) did not have enough funds to purchase a larger house, it was\n\n  indeed strange that her husband (Tong) could then give (Sally) a loan of A$670,000 for the\n\n  purchase of 17 Woodward Ave. Further, this was the only property in her sole name, unlike\n\n  others which she had purchased earlier with her husband. Being so highly geared\n\n  financially already, what was her purpose in purchasing such a large house at S$1.47\n\n  million?23.    In reaching this conclusion, the judge also drew an adverse\n\ninference against Sally on account of her reluctance to produce the records of Caltong. He\n\nviewed the alleged burglary and vandalisation of her accountant’s office in Australia\n\n(see 41 below) as mere excuses to avoid having to produce Caltong’s records.24.    However, as regards the sale of No. 755 to Alvin, the judge found\n\nthat the disposal was not made with an \"intention to defraud creditors\".\n\nMoreover, the sale was at a price approved by the mortgagee, OCBC Bank. In any case, it\n\nwould be unjust, in all the circumstances, to invalidate the transaction, as Alvin had\n\nborrowed from the bank and taken money from his CPF account to pay for the property.25.    In the light of the above, the judge made,inter alia, the\n\nfollowing orders:-(i) that Tong, Koo and Angela repay the sum of $53.3 million as damages\n\n  on the ground that (a) they were guilty of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means and (b)\n\n  that they were in breach of their fiduciary duties to TTSC.(ii) that on account thereof they were constructive trustees in respect\n\n  of the said sum.(iii) that Tong, Koo and Angela held the four properties developed on\n\n  No. 4 Kew Drive in trust for TTSC and they were to account for the use of these assets.(iv) Caltong and Sally were constructive trustees in respect of the sum\n\n  $984,899.60 received from TTSC and were to account for the same and were also constructive\n\n  trustees in respect of the following properties.(a) No. 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;(b) Stamford Apartment, Goderich Street, Perth;(c) No. 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney.Appeal of Caltong and Sally26.    We will first consider the appeal of Caltong and Sally. In order\n\nto determine whether the orders made against them are or are not too wide, it is necessary\n\nthat we set out their precise terms:-\"The Eighth and Twelfth Defendants are –(i) To hold the sum of S$984,899.60 paid by the Plaintiff as\n\n  constructive trustees for the Plaintiff;(2) To account to the Plaintiff for the sum of S$984,899.60, including:(a) the use of such monies (which includes details of to whom such\n\n    monies were paid, when such monies were paid, the quantum of payment and reasons for\n\n    payment);(b) all properties and/or benefits and/or assets obtained from the use\n\n    of such monies;(3) To pay to the Plaintiff monies, and all profits and/or benefits\n\n  and/or assets, including simple interest;(4) To hold the following properties as constructive trustees for the\n\n  Plaintiff:(a) 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;(b) Stamford Apartment, Perth; and(c) 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney.…(3) The Twelfth Defendant do pay to the Plaintiff 25% of the\n\nPlaintiff’s costs in these proceedings …\"27.    At this juncture, we would like to make this observation. The\n\njudge seemed to think that on account of the damages which Tong, Koo and Angela were\n\nrequired to pay TTSC because of their conspiracy, Tong, Koo and Angela were thereby\n\nrendered constructive trustees of the same. A party may be liable to another for damages\n\non account of a tort the former had committed, but that does not render that party a\n\nconstructive trustee of the same. It remains a personal debt.28.    We would comment that while the appeal is taken by both Caltong\n\nand Sally, it is really an appeal by Sally. It was never disputed that Caltong received\n\nthe sum of S$984,899.60 from TTSC. Sally’s contention is that as she was in control\n\nof Caltong only after November 1999, when she became the sole director, she should not be\n\nmade to account for events before that. The sum never passed through her hands. There was\n\nno reason to make her personally liable. Furthermore, the Woodward property had nothing to\n\ndo with Caltong. She also contends that the order on costs requiring her to bear 25% of\n\nthe action is excessive and unreasonable.29.    What Sally is basically arguing is that until she became the sole\n\ndirector, she was really only a nominee director of Caltong. She did not know what was\n\nhappening there, which was effectively being managed by Tong and Angela, particularly the\n\nlatter. She did not touch the sum of S$984,899.60 which came into the account of Caltong.\n\nThis aspect of the matter did not appear to have been specifically addressed by the judge\n\nbelow. He did not find that when the money was received by Caltong, Sally knew that the\n\nmoney was remitted by Tong in breach of trust. Neither did he find her guilty of dishonest\n\nassistance.30.    While the knowledge of Tong and Angela may be imputed to Caltong\n\n(seeHL Bolton (Engineering) Co Ltd v T.T Graham & Sons Ltd[1957] 1 QB 159),\n\nthey being the controlling mind of Caltong, there is no evidence to indicate that Sally\n\nknew that the money received by Caltong from Tong was improperly siphoned off from TTSC.\n\nThere is also nothing to suggest that Sally dishonestly assisted the Tongs in siphoning\n\nmoney from TTSC.31.    To be liable for knowing receipt which would render the recepient\n\na constructive trustee, three elements must be proved, and in the words of Lord Hoffman inEl Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings[1994] BCLC 464:-\"the plaintiff must show, first a disposal of his assets in breach\n\n  of fiduciary duty; secondly, the beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are\n\n  traceable as representing the assets of the plaintiff; and, thirdly, knowledge on the part\n\n  of the defendant that the assets he received are traceable to a breach of fiduciary\n\n  duty.\"What were missing in relation to Sally are the second and third\n\nelements. She did not receive the money. Neither was it shown that she knew the money\n\nreceived by Caltong was tainted. Thus, she could not be liable under the principle of\n\nknowing receipt, even though Caltong, by virtue of the knowledge of Tong and Angela, would\n\nbe liable to account for knowing receipt.32.    The fact that she agreed to be a nominee director in Caltong did\n\nnot mean that she had assisted the Tongs in committing a breach of fiduciary duty towards\n\nTTSC. Sally’s duty as a director (though nominee), was to Caltong, not to TTSC. The\n\ncaseSelangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Craddock (No. 3)[1968] 2 All ER 1073\n\nmerely established the principle that just because a person was a nominee director, it did\n\nnot mean that he did not owe a duty of care to the company of which he was a director.33.    The elements which must be proved to establish dishonest\n\nassistance are (seeRoyal Brunei Airlines v Tan[1995] 2 AC 378):-(a) that there has been a disposal of his assets in breach of trust or\n\n  fiduciary duty;(b) in which the defendant has assisted or which she/he has procured;(c) the defendant has acted dishonestly;(d) resulting loss to the claimant.34.    There is no evidence that Sally had dishonestly assisted Tong,\n\nKoo or Angela in siphoning off the funds of TTSC to Caltong. In fact, she played no role\n\nin remitting TTSC’s moneys to Caltong. She was merely a nominee director of Caltong.35.    This associationper secould not mean that she would also\n\nknow what was done by the Tongs as far as siphoning of TTSC’s moneys to Caltong was\n\nconcerned. In short, there was nothing to implicate Sally to the wrongdoings of the Tongs.36.    Accordingly, Sally could not be guilty of dishonest assistance or\n\nof knowing receipt that the sum was remitted from TTSC to Caltong in breach of trust. She\n\nshould not be held to be personally liable. To this extent, the order made by the court\n\nbelow would have to be modified.Woodward property37.    We now turn to the Woodward property, which Sally says the court\n\nwas wrong to have declared that she held it on trust for TTSC. She argues that TTSC had\n\nnot pleaded anything with regard to this property. The pleadings only touched on the\n\nS$984,899.60 received by Caltong from TTSC. Therefore, she did not allude to this\n\nproperty, or on how she acquired it, in her affidavit. While this may be so, there is\n\nconsiderable weight in the counter-argument of TTSC that it did not so plead because it\n\nonly became apparent in the cross-examination of Sally that the Woodward property had been\n\npurchased with moneys which originated from TTSC. This also explains why, when Tong and\n\nKoo were giving evidence, they were not cross-examined by TTSC on this aspect. In any\n\ncase, during the cross-examination of Sally, TTSC gave notice that it was claiming the\n\nproperty as trust property. She was cross-examined on it.38.    Moreover, TTSC had also pleaded that it would claim against any\n\nassets which were purchased with the S$984,899.60 or their proceeds. That should suffice\n\nto notify Sally that a tracing was being asked for. It would have been easy for Sally to\n\nshow, from the bank records of Caltong, that none of the moneys of Caltong were used to\n\npurchase the Woodward property. It would also have been a matter within her knowledge as\n\nto the sources of funds which she had utilized to effect the purchase.39.    The judge below came to the conclusion that the sale proceeds of\n\n70 Barker Road, which was one of the properties purchased by Caltong from the $984.899.60\n\nremitted by TTSC/Tong, were probably used to purchase the Woodward property. Among the\n\nfactors which the judge took into account in deciding this question were - (i) the Barker\n\nRoad property was sold in September 1999 for about A$800,000; (ii) the Woodward property\n\nwas bought at a time when the Tong family was moving to live in Australia and required a\n\nlarge home; (iii) it was the only property bought in Sally’s sole name whereas her\n\nother properties were in the joint names of herself and her husband; (iv) after the\n\npurchase, the Tongs were living there allegedly as tenants; (v) it was strange that Tong\n\nwas able and would lend to Sally a sum of A$670,000 to purchase the property when Tong did\n\nnot have enough money to buy his own house; (vi) there was no reason why Sally should buy\n\nthis large house with borrowed money when she was already owing substantial loans in\n\nrespect of her other properties.40.    While an explanation was offered by Sally in respect of each of\n\nthese points, they were not sufficiently persuasive to the judge. This being a finding of\n\nfact, there is hardly any sufficient basis for us to overturn this finding. Indeed, we\n\nagree with it. We would add that in making this finding the judge also took into account\n\nSally’s conduct at the trial.41.    As stated above, the Barker Road property was sold for some\n\nA$800,000. It would have been a straightforward matter to show where the proceeds had\n\ngone. Yet, there was considerable reluctance to disclose the bank records of Caltong. They\n\nwere eventually not produced because of an \"alleged\" burglary at Caltong’s\n\naccountant’s office and the records were reportedly lost as a result. The judge felt\n\nit was too much of a coincidence. On 2 May 2001 he made the order requiring Sally to\n\ndisclose the records by 8 May 2001. It was on 8 May 2001 that Caltong’s counsel\n\ninformed the court of the \"burglary\" which occurred on 4 May 2001. Counsel could\n\nnot give further details. Interestingly, Tong’s evidence was that the proceeds of the\n\nBarker Road property were spent on \"living expenses\" during the period of some\n\nsix months from September 1999 to March 2000. Bearing in mind their financial\n\ncircumstances then, it certainly seemed like a very tall story, squandering such a large\n\nsum in such a short time.42.    In cross-examination, Sally said that matters relating to the\n\nfinancing of the purchase of the Woodward property were handled by her husband, Thava. In\n\nthe circumstances, she asserted that TTSC should have called Thava to clarify those\n\nmatters. Yet it did not do so. Accordingly, Sally submits that TTSC is precluded from\n\ncontending otherwise now. But it is important to note that Thava did not say anything on\n\nthis in his affidavit at all. What he did state was not disputed by TTSC. If indeed Thava\n\ndid possess the relevant information as Sally had asserted, then the information should\n\nhave been set out in a supplemental affidavit of Thava. This is a matter exclusively\n\nwithin her knowledge. She must go further and get that person to depose to those facts.\n\nThis issue has nothing to do with the principle inBrowne v Dunn[1893] 6 R 67,\n\nwhich precludes a party from asserting otherwise if he fails to cross-examine a witness as\n\nto what the latter stated in his affidavit or in his evidence-in-chief.43.    There is another aspect which cast doubts on the credibility of\n\nSally. Caltong’s counsel tendered to court its tax returns and balance sheets\n\nrelating to the years 1995-1999. On these documents, Caltong’s name appeared on the\n\ntax assessments in respect of those years. But Caltong only took this name on 24 January\n\n2000. Previously, it was known as \"Tong Tien See (Australia) Pty Ltd\". Similarly\n\nthe documents also bore the new address of Caltong’s accountants but the accountants\n\nonly moved to their new offices in 2000 or 2001. Sally was not able to explain these\n\ndiscrepancies. Thus, there was the suggestion that perhaps Sally fabricated these\n\ndocuments.44.    Ordinarily, when a trustee mixes trust funds with his own funds,\n\nthe law assumes that the whole is subject to the trust. InFrith v Cartland(1865)\n\n71 ER 525 at 526, Page Wood VC observed: \"… if a man mixes trust funds with his\n\nown, the whole will be treated as the trust property, except so far as he may be able to\n\ndistinguish what is his own.\" See alsoRe Tilley’s Will Trust[1967] Ch\n\n1179 at 1182.45.    However, in the present case, while there is no direct evidence\n\nto show that, in using the proceeds of the Barker Road property to buy the Woodward\n\nproperty, Sally knew that the proceeds were tainted, we nevertheless find, on balance,\n\nthat she did have the knowledge. First, she denied having used the proceeds of the Barker\n\nRoad property to purchase the Woodward property. Second, unlike all her other properties,\n\nshe purchased the Woodward property in her sole name. Thirdly, she submits tax documents\n\nto court which appeared to be fake and she was unable to explain the clear discrepancies\n\n(see 43 above). Fourthly, her reluctance to produce the records of Caltong. All these\n\nindicate a guilty mind. Thus, it appears to us that she had knowingly mixed trust money\n\nwith her own when purchasing the Woodward property. The burden was on her to show which\n\nportion of the purchase price came from her own sources and was not tainted by the breach\n\nof trust committed by Tong and Angela. However, having regard to the nature of the\n\npleadings, and the manner in which the trial had proceeded in the court below, it would\n\nprobably be fairer if an opportunity be afforded to Sally to show the extent to which she\n\nand/or her husband had contributed (from their own funds) to the purchase of the Woodward\n\nproperty.46.    The final point raised by Sally relates to the order on costs.\n\nShe says that even if she were to fail in this appeal, the 25% costs awarded against her\n\nfor the trial is plainly excessive as the points she raised would probably have taken only\n\ntwo days to hear. She submits that her role in the whole matter was minor, whereas the\n\ntrial took a total of 39 days.47.    From the grounds of judgment, it is clear that in arriving at its\n\ndecision on costs, the court below did give careful consideration to Sally’s\n\ncontention that costs awarded against her should be limited. The question of costs is a\n\nmatter of discretion. It has not been shown that the judge had erred. The court is\n\nentitled to take all the circumstances into account, in determining the appropriate\n\napportionment as to costs. But whether this order on costs should be varied, in the light\n\nthat this appeal would, for the reasons indicated above, be allowed in part, will be dealt\n\nwith later.TTSC’s appeal on tracing48.    Although the appeal by TTSC would affect Tong, Koo, Angela, Tong\n\nJoo, TDPL and Caltong, only Caltong is defending it as the other parties are either\n\nbankrupt or are being wound up.49.    A preliminary point was raised by Caltong that TTSC cannot\n\nproceed with this appeal against Tong and Angela without the leave of court as required\n\nunder s 76(1)(c)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act as they are both bankrupt:-\"no action or proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced\n\n  against the bankrupt, except by leave of the court and in accordance with such terms as\n\n  the court may impose.\"50.    Quite apart from the question whether Caltong has thelocus\n\nstandito raise this point on behalf of Tong and Angela, there is really nothing in\n\nthe point as leave of court to commence the action against Tong and Angela had already\n\nbeen obtained prior to the trial. Caltong seems to be arguing that leave of court is\n\nrequired at every stage, the trial stage as well as the appeal stage, and that an appeal\n\nis no doubt a \"proceeding\" within s 76(1)(c)(ii).51.    This court had inOverseas Union Bank v Lew Keh Lam[1999] 3 SLR 393stated that the purpose of s 76(1)(c)(ii) was to prevent the liquidators or\n\nadministrator’s task from being made more difficult due to a scramble among creditors\n\nin taking action or obtaining decrees against the debtor or his assets. The requirement to\n\nobtain leave is to ensure that the court could guard against any inequity on account of\n\nsuch a scramble. It must follow that once leave is obtained to commence an action against\n\na bankrupt debtor, that leave should hold good until the final determination of the\n\nproceeding, including any appeal. There is really no good reason why leave should be\n\nobtained at every stage.52.    With respect, we think counsel for Caltong has misconstruedLew\n\nKeh Lam. In that case there was an application to strike out the creditor’s\n\nappeal on the ground that the creditor had failed to obtain the requisite leave. This\n\nCourt ruled that leave was required but granted retrospective leave. But that case is no\n\nauthority for the proposition that you need leave for the action at the trial and you need\n\nleave again for any appeal therefrom. The significant aspect of that case which must be\n\nborne in mind is that there the bankrupt was so adjudicated only after the trial. An\n\nappeal was pending. Obviously, an appeal is a \"proceeding\" and leave must be\n\nobtained if bankruptcy intervenes.53.    Turning next to the substantive issue, it should be noted at the\n\noutset that \"tracing\", as pointed out by Lord Millett inFoskett v McKeown[2000] 3 All ER 97, is really a process rather than a remedy. It enables a plaintiff to\n\ntrace what has happened to his property, identify the persons who have handled or received\n\nit and justify his claim that the assets/property which they handled or received can\n\nproperly be regarded as representing the plaintiff’s property. It also seeks to\n\nidentify which new asset is the substitute for the old or the traceable proceeds of the\n\nplaintiff’s property and enables the plaintiff to substitute the traceable proceeds\n\nfor the original asset as the subject matter of his claim. Thus, normally tracing is the\n\nprecursor to a claim.54.    It is true that perhaps TTSC should have first only asked for a\n\ndeclaration of a breach of trust and a tracing order against Caltong and the other\n\ndefendants before proceeding to ask the court for a declaration of constructive trust in\n\nrelation to specific properties. In this case, while the court below accepted that there\n\nwere breaches of trust and made declarations of constructive trusts against some of the\n\ndefendants, it nevertheless refused to grant any tracing orders. It gave three reasons.\n\nFirst, there would be great difficulties involved in identifying the sources of funds and\n\nthe way they were used or rolled over. Second, the proceedings would be unnecessarily\n\nprolonged. Third, tracing orders would be unnecessary in the light of the orders to\n\naccount which the court had made.55.    The main ground advanced by TTSC in asking for a tracing order is\n\nto identify and establish potential proprietary claims that may exist. When a constructive\n\ntrust is imposed due to a breach of fiduciary duties, the beneficiary is entitled to elect\n\nbetween anin personamaction against the errant fiduciaries and/or a proprietary\n\naction to claim the property or its traceable proceeds. Again, in the words of Lord\n\nMillett inFoskett v McKeown(supra) at 119 \"A beneficiary of a trust is\n\nentitled to a continuing beneficial interest not merely in the trust property but in its\n\ntraceable proceeds also, and his interest binds every one who takes the property or its\n\ntraceable proceeds, except abona fidepurchaser for value without notice.\"56.    Bearing in mind that the key individuals and the companies\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy in the present case are either bankrupt or wound up, anin\n\npersonamaction would not be of much assistance. If a proprietary claim could be\n\nestablished, then TTSC would be able to claim the assets from an indefinite class of\n\npersons, rather than just the trustees who, in the present case, would not be able to\n\ncompensate TTSC for its losses.57.    As far as Caltong is concerned, it contends that a tracing order\n\nwould not be appropriate as neither the moneys to be traced nor the traceable proceeds\n\nhave been identified. It is clear that for a tracing order to operate, the assets (either\n\nof physical property or moneys) for a tracing process to begin must be identified. It is\n\nplain logic that one can only trace from a specific thing, be it a specific property or a\n\nsum of money, otherwise it would be impossible to begin. It is not at all necessary to\n\nidentify traceable proceeds, as that is the very object of a tracing exercise, to\n\nestablish into what form the original assets have been converted. It is, in our judgment,\n\nincorrect to suggest, as Caltong does, that the traceable proceeds must first be\n\nidentified before a tracing order may be made. If that were so, it would turn logic on its\n\nhead as that is the very object of a tracing order. Of course, a tracing order would not\n\nnecessarily lead to a proprietary claim. For example, if a particular asset has gone into\n\nthe hands of abona fidepurchaser for value without notice of the breach, then in\n\nso far as that asset is concerned, the tracing must end, and no claim may be made by the\n\nbeneficiary against thatbona fidepurchaser: per Megarry V-C inRe\n\nMontagu’s Settlement Trusts[1987] Ch 264 at 27658.    The court is entitled to take all the circumstances of a case\n\ninto account in determining whether a tracing order should be granted. It is true that in\n\none of the prayers, TTSC asked for an -\"order that the plaintiff is entitled to trace the monies (which\n\n  are held in trust for it by the various respondents) into the hands of the (respondents)\n\n  or elsewhere.\"It did not ask the court to compel a party to do or refrain from doing\n\nsomething. While this prayer may be inadequately formulated, this should not preclude a\n\ncourt from granting an appropriate tracing order if the case warrants it. As mentioned\n\nbefore, the court below refused to grant a tracing order not because the pleadings were\n\ninadequate (54).59.    The first ground indicated by the judge in refusing to grant a\n\ntracing order is certainly pertinent in relation to the breaches committed by the Tongs.\n\nThere would be great difficulties in identifying the specific sums from which tracing is\n\nto be initiated. The sum of $53.3 million for which Tong, Koo and Angela were held to be\n\naccountable represented the total amount of the creditors’ claims against TTSC. This\n\nis the total of the debts owing by TTSC to its creditors. It may not represent the net\n\ntotal sum which the Tongs had siphoned off from TTSC. What was siphoned off could have\n\nbeen more or it could have been less. Bearing in mind the numerous transactions which\n\nwould have taken place between TTSC and these three defendants and Tong Joo and TDPL, a\n\ntracing exercise would be an extremely daunting, if not an impossible, one. It would not\n\nbe in order to make a tracing order based on the $53.3 million which is owing to\n\ncreditors.60.    However, the same is not so with regard to the sum $984,899.60\n\nwhich was admittedly received by Caltong from Tong/TTSC. While we recognise that this sum\n\nwas not received in one remittance, it is the starting point from which tracing may be\n\nmade. Obviously when tracing is carried out, proceedings will be extended. That is\n\ninevitable.61.    Then, there is the third reason given by the judge. He felt that\n\na tracing order is unnecessary in view of the order made requiring Caltong to account. In\n\na sense an order to account is similar to that of a tracing order: seeKhan v Khan[1982] 2 All ER 60. But an order to account is personal in nature, binding on the party\n\nnamed. An appropriate tracing order, on the other hand, could compel third parties, such\n\nas a bank, to assist. In relation to Caltong, a tracing order might well serve a purpose\n\nas Caltong has not been very cooperative in disclosing its records.62.    It is also true that a tracing order would also mean the\n\nincurring of further costs. But this is unavoidable. Who, ultimately, would have to bear\n\nthe additional costs would depend on the outcome of the exercise. If the tracing leads to\n\na dead end then TTSC would have to bear the costs. But if the exercise should lead to a\n\nthird party or lead back to Caltong (because it withheld information) then the additional\n\ncosts would have to be borne by the latter.Judgment63.    Accordingly, the appeal in CA 600130/2001 is allowed to the\n\nextent that Sally is not to be held personally liable to return the $984,899.60.64.    The appeal in CA 600124/2001 is also allowed to the extent that a\n\ntracing order shall be made in respect of the sum $984,899.60 received by Caltong.65.    Paragraph 4 of the order made by the court below on 17 September\n\n2001 shall be amended to read as follows:-\"The eighth defendant and the twelfth defendant, in her capacity\n\n  as the director of the eighth defendant, are –(1) To hold the sum of S$984,899.60 paid by the Plaintiff as\n\n  constructive trustees for the Plaintiff;(2) To account to the Plaintiff for the sum of S$984,899.60, including:(a) the use of such monies (which includes details of to whom such\n\n    monies were paid, when such monies were paid, the quantum of payment and reasons for\n\n    payment);(b) all properties and/or benefits and/or assets obtained from the use\n\n    of such monies;(3) To pay to the Plaintiff monies, and all profits and/or benefits\n\n  and/or assets, including simple interest;(4) To hold the following properties as constructive trustees for the\n\n  Plaintiff:(a) 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;(b) Stamford Apartment, Perth; and(c) 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney, except in relation to the part\n\n    represented by the portion of the purchase price which was paid from sources of the\n\n    twelfth defendant and/or her husband as may be established by her.There shall be an inquiry to trace the assets or proceeds into which\n\n  the sum $984,899.60 received by Caltong had been converted, with liberty to apply to the\n\n  court below.\"66.    As regards the question of costs of the two appeals, they ought\n\nto be approached separately. In respect of CA 600130/2001, Sally, the twelfth defendant,\n\nhas succeeded in part in the sense that she is not to be personally liable for the\n\n$984,899.60. She, however, failed as regards her contention that the Woodward property is\n\nentirely her personal property and has nothing to do with Caltong or the sum of\n\n$984,899.60 received by Caltong from TTSC/Tong. She shall, therefore, be entitled to only\n\nhalf the costs of this appeal. The security for costs, with any accrued interest, shall be\n\nrefunded to the twelfth defendant or her solicitors.67.    Turning to CA 600124/2001, TTSC succeeded against Caltong to the\n\nextent that a tracing order is granted herein in respect of the sum $984,899.60 received\n\nby Caltong. TTSC shall have the costs of the appeal against Caltong. Sally is, in no way,\n\ninvolved in that, other than as a director of Caltong. The security for costs, together\n\nwith any accrued interest, shall be refunded to TTSC or its solicitors.68.    As regards the order for costs at the trial, the question is\n\nwhether it ought to be modified in the light of the decisions in these appeals. It is true\n\nthat by virtue of our decision in CA 600130/2001, Sally is no longer personally liable in\n\nrespect of the sum $984,899.60 received by Caltong. The receipt by Caltong of that sum was\n\nnever in dispute. But she should nevertheless bear the costs in relation to the issue\n\nconcerning the Woodward property. Taking a broad view of things, we would reduce the\n\nproportion of the costs to be borne by the twelfth defendant personally to 15%.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHIEF JUSTICESgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDGE OF APPEALSgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
