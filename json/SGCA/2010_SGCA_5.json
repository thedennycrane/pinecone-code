        "Introduction": "1       Hwa Lai Heng Ricky (“the\n                    Appellant”) took out two related appeals against the decision of the High\n                    Court inDBS Bank Ltd v Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd and\n                        Another[2008] SGHC 181 (“DBS Bank\n                        Ltd”). Civil Appeal No 109 of 2008\n                    (“CA 109”) pertained to the refusal of the High Court judge\n                    (“the Judge”) to allow the Appellant to amend his defence. Civil\n                    Appeal No 108 of 2008 (“CA 108”) pertained to the\n                    Judge’s decision to uphold summary judgment which was given in favour of\n                    DBS Bank Ltd (“the Respondent”) on the basis that the\n                    Appellant’s case had not disclosed any viable defences. Both appeals were\n                    heard together with Summons No 416 of 2009 (“SUM 416”),\n                    which was taken out by the Respondent for: (i) an extension of time to file\n                    its case; and (ii) leave to admit further evidence in the form of a Scheme\n                    Funding Line Agreement (“the SFL Agreement”) between the Economic\n                    Development Board (“the EDB”) and itself, and evidence to the\n                    effect that it had not received funds to finance a loan extended by it to an\n                    entity known as Sin Yuh Industries (Pte) Ltd (“SY Industries”).\n                    All three matters arise out of the same factual matrix.",
        "The factual background": "2       SY Industries wished to purchase certain machine\n                    units from a company known as Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd\n                    (“Yamazaki”). The Respondent was willing to finance part of that\n                    purchase through a loan amounting to $1.94 million (“the\n                    Loan”), provided that,inter alia, SY\n                    Industries furnished satisfactory evidence that 40 per cent of the purchase\n                    price for those machine units had, in fact, been paid to the seller,\n                    Yamazaki. 3       On 16 December 2002, at the request of SY\n                    Industries, the Appellant, who was then an assistant sales manager of Yamazaki,\n                    wrote a letter to the Respondent. In that letter, he falsely represented that\n                    Yamazaki had received certain payments from SY Industries which amounted to\n                    40 per cent or more of the purchase price. In reality, all that Yamazaki\n                    had received were post-dated cheques that had not yet been cleared. However, on\n                    10 March 2003, the Respondent, who had been deceived by the\n                    Appellant’s letter, disbursed the full Loan quantum of $1.94 million\n                    to SY Industries. SY Industries proved to be financially unsound. Most of the\n                    post-dated cheques SY Industries issued to Yamazaki could not be cleared.\n                    Further, SY Industries never paid any of the instalments that were due to the\n                    Respondent, and, by 26 March 2004, a winding up order had been made against\n                    the former in the High Court. 4       The Appellant was prosecuted for cheating. On\n                    23 June 2005, he was convicted by the District Court. That decision was\n                    upheld on appeal (seeHwa Lai Heng Ricky v PP[2005] SGHC 195). Subsequently, the Respondent also brought a civil claim\n                    for damages against both Yamazaki and the Appellant based on the tort of\n                    fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit.",
        "The decision below": "5       The Respondent succeeded in obtaining summary\n                    judgment against the Appellant on 18 March 2008. The learned Assistant\n                    Registrar (“the AR”) granted the application because: (i) the\n                    findings of the criminal court coincided with all the essential ingredients in\n                    the Respondent’s cause of action; and (ii) the Appellant had not\n                    managed to raise any viable defences. In coming to his decision, the AR refused\n                    to take into account certain defences the Appellant had raised, namely\n                    that: (a)     the Respondent could not recover in\n                        excess of 30 per cent of the Loan amount, which was allegedly the\n                        proper measure of its loss, as there was an arrangement between the\n                        Respondent and EDB, pursuant to which loss arising from the Loan would be\n                        shared between them in a ratio of 30:70 respectively (“the 30:70 Loss\n                        Sharing Arrangement”); and (b)     the relationship between the Respondent and EDBvis-à-visthe giving of the Loan was that of agent\n                        and principal, respectively, such that EDB (and not the Respondent) was the\n                        proper party to bring the action against the Appellant (“the Agency\n                        Argument”). The AR refused to take these points\n                    into account on the basis that they had not been pleaded in the\n                    Appellant’s Defence, and in any event, they did not raise any triable\n                    issues. 6       Following the AR’s decision, the Appellant\n                    applied to amend his Defence to include the points above which the AR had not\n                    taken into account. The application was heard by the learned Senior Assistant\n                    Registrar (“the SAR”), who dismissed the application. The basis of\n                    the SAR’s decision was that: (i) the amendments had been prayed for\n                    only post-summary judgment; and (ii) the proposed defences, in any event,\n                    were not viable and would not have changed the outcome of the decision to award\n                    the Respondent summary judgment. 7       Dissatisfied with the outcome, the Appellant\n                    appealed against the decisions of the AR and SAR in the High Court. Both appeals\n                    were dismissed, also essentially on the basis that none of the points raised by\n                    the Appellant had any merit. However, as 26 of the 31 machine units had been\n                    recovered by the Respondents and sold, the Judge rightly reduced the judgment\n                    sum of $1.94 million entered by the AR by the net sales proceeds of the 26\n                    machines (ie, the sale proceeds less only the\n                    necessary expenses incurred by the plaintiff to effect the sale) (seeDBS Bank Ltdat [33]). 8       Consequently, the Appellant brought before us\n                    CA 108 (against the decision of the High Court with respect to the summary\n                    judgment) and CA 109 (with respect to the decision of the High Court in\n                    respect of the application to amend his Defence). The Respondent subsequently\n                    took out SUM 416 (for an extension of time to file its case and to adduce\n                    further evidence). These have already been briefly mentioned above (at[1]). At the hearing before this court on\n                    9 September 2009 (in respect of SUM 416), we granted the Respondent an\n                    extension of time to file its case. We also directed that the remaining prayers\n                    in SUM 416 and the two appeals be consolidated into a single hearing. When\n                    the parties next appeared before us, we dealt, first, with the appeal in\n                    CA 109 (together with the related application in SUM 416 in so far as\n                    the Respondent’s application for leave to adduce further evidence was\n                    concerned) before proceeding to consider the appeal in\n                CA 108.",
        "CA 109 and SUM 416": "9       As already mentioned, we heard both CA 109\n                    and SUM 416 together, not least because they were, of course, closely\n                    related. 10     In so far as the appeal in CA 109 is\n                    concerned, the general approach which ought to be taken towards amendments of\n                    pleadings in thepost-judgmentcontext is clear,\n                    and is embodied within the following observations by Yong Pung How J in the\n                    High Court decision ofInvar Realty Pte Ltd v Kenzo Tange\n                        Urtec Inc and another[1990] 2 SLR(R) 66 (“Invar Realty”) at [21]: While a court may have a wide power of amendment even after a final\n                        judgment, the appropriate cases in which such a power should be exercised\n                        must necessarily be very limited. Whether or not a court should do so will\n                        be in the discretion of the court, and will depend on the facts of each\n                        case, including in particular the nature and implications of the amendment\n                        sought. In all cases, a court will have to bear in mind the fundamental\n                        principle of all courts that there must be a finality to litigation. 11     Whilst finality is important, there is, as\n                    V K Rajah JC very pertinently pointed out in the High Court\n                    decision ofChwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte\n                        Ltd[2004] 2 SLR(R) 594 at [85] (affirmed inChwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR(R) 502), “a constant tension in our legal system to\n                    accommodate the Janus-like considerations of fairness and finality”. This\n                    tension is elaborated upon by the learned judge, who observed thus (idat [84]–[85]): 84    It is axiomatic that\n                            a court will generally be cautious if not reluctant to effect any\n                            amendments once the hearing has commenced; even more so once the\n                            evidential phase of the proceedings has been completed. Lord Griffiths\n                            inKetteman v Hansel Properties Ltd[1987]\n                            AC 189 at 220 stated: [T]o allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from\n                            allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful\n                            defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different\n                            defence. 85    Having stated the general rule, it is imperative\n                            that the rationale underlying this approach be understood. Rules of\n                            court which are meant to facilitate the conduct of proceedings\n                            invariably encapsulate concepts of procedural fairplay. They are not\n                            mechanical rules to be applied in a vacuum, devoid of a contextual\n                            setting. Nor should parties regard pleadings as assuming an amoeba-like\n                            nature, susceptible to constant reshaping. Rules and case law pertaining\n                            to amendments are premised upon achieving even-handedness in the context\n                            of an adversarial system … In short, where does the justice\n                            reside? 12     And, in the recent decision of this court inReview Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong\n                        and another appeal[2010] 1 SLR 52, Chan Sek Keong CJ,\n                    delivering the judgment of the court, set out a comprehensive overview of this\n                    area of the law, as follows (at [110]–[114]): 110    …O 20\n                            r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev\n                            Ed) gives the court a wide discretion to allow pleadings to be amended\n                            at any stage of the proceedings on such terms as may be just.\n                            Order 20 r 5(1) reads: Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8, and this Rule,\n                            the Court mayat any stage of the\n                                proceedingsallow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any\n                            party to amend his pleading,on such terms as to\n                                costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it\n                                may direct. [emphasis added] 111    InChwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR(R) 502 (“Chwee Kin\n                                Keong”), this court said at [101]: Under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,\n                            R 5, 2004 Rev Ed), the court may grant leave to amend a\n                            pleading atanystage of the proceedings.This can be before or during the trial, or after\n                                judgment or on appeal. [emphasis added] 112    Indeed, local case\n                            law shows that our courts have allowed amendments to be made to\n                            pleadings even: (a)    at the final stages of a trial after the\n                                parties have made their closing submissions (seeChwee Kin Keongat [101]–[103] andLee Siew Chun v Sourgrapes Packaging Products Trading\n                                    Pte Ltd[1992] 3 SLR(R) 855 at\n                                [91]–[96]); (b)    after summary or interlocutory judgment has\n                                been obtained (seeInvar Realty Pte Ltd v Kenzo\n                                    Tange Urtec Inc[1990] 2 SLR(R) 66 at\n                                [21]–[22]); and (c)    pending an appeal or in the course of an\n                                appeal itself (seeSoon Peng Yam v Maimon bte\n                                    Ahmad[1995] 1 SLR(R) 279 at [25]–[30],Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai\n                                    Sin[2004] 2 SLR(R) 173 (“Asia Business Forum”) at [17] andSusilawati v American Express Bank\n                                    Ltd[2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 (“Susilawati”) at [56]; see also\n                                O 57 r 13(1) of the Rules of Court, which states that\n                                “the Court of Appeal shall have all the powers and duties as\n                                to amendment and otherwise of the High Court”).\n                                … 113    The guiding\n                            principle is that amendments to pleadings ought to be allowed if they\n                            would enable the real question and/or issue in controversy between the\n                            parties to be determined… However, an important caveat to\n                            granting leave for the amendment of pleadings is that it must be just to\n                            grant such leave, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\n                            Thus, this court held inAsia Business\n                                Forumthat the court, in determining whether to grant a\n                            party leave to amend his pleadings, must have regard to “the\n                            justice of the case” (at [12]) and must bear in mind (at least)\n                            two key factors, namely, whether the amendments would cause any\n                            prejudice to the other party which cannot be compensated in costs and\n                            whether the party applying for leave to amend is “effectively\n                            asking for a second bite at the cherry” (at [18]). These two key\n                            factors were endorsed recently again by this court inSusilawatiat\n                            [58]. 114    It cannot be\n                            over-emphasised that all the relevant circumstances of the case at hand\n                            should be considered by the court in deciding whether or not to allow an\n                            amendment to pleadings, and that delay in bringing the application for\n                            leave to amendper sedoes not constitute\n                            prejudice to the other party. As this court stated inWright Normanat [23]: In our opinion, at the end of the day, the most important question\n                            which the court must ask itself is, are the ends of justice served by\n                            allowing the proposed amendment. Pleadings should not be used as a means\n                            to punish a party for his errors or the errors of his solicitors. All\n                            relevant issues should be investigated, provided the other party will\n                            not be prejudiced in a way which cannot be compensated by costs. All\n                            relevant circumstances should be considered by the court before it\n                            exercises its discretion [as to] whether it would allow an amendment.While the time at which an amendment is made is a\n                                relevant consideration it is not necessarily decisive. Delay per se\n                                does not equal prejudice or injustice. We do not think\n                            any rigid rule should or can be laid down on this. [emphasis\n                            added] 13     Applying the above principles to the present\n                    proceedings (and bearing in mind the fact that the power to permit amendment of\n                    pleadings should, in the post-judgment context, be exercised sparingly), we were\n                    of the view that it was appropriate to allow the amendment sought by the\n                    Appellant as it related to an important issue (turning on the construction of\n                    the SFL Agreement) which had not hitherto been canvassed. To recapitulate, such\n                    an issue, which focuses,inter alia, on the\n                    30:70 Loss Sharing Arrangement between the Respondent and the EDB, could\n                    furnish the Appellant with a possible argument to the effect that he was only\n                    liable to the Respondent to the extent of only 30 per cent of the total claim\n                    mounted against him. It is also important to emphasise that the judgment given\n                    in favour of the Respondent was asummaryjudgment. The question then arose as to whether the Appellant should be barred\n                    – at thethresholdpoint relating to the\n                    pleadings – from pursuing a legal course of action which, if successful at\n                    trial, would enable it to reduce (by a substantial amount) its liability to the\n                    Respondent. At this juncture, it is important to note that the facts ofInvar Realtyare quite different because, in\n                    that particular case, summary judgment was, in fact, ordered by the court in\n                    favour of the plaintiff based ona clear and unambiguous\n                        admissionon the part of the defendant. This was clearlynotthe case here. The question, however,\n                    remains as to whether or not, by granting the application by the Appellant to\n                    amend its pleadings,prejudicewould be caused to\n                    the Respondent (which is an important facet of the overall justice of the case,\n                    and which is what the court is ultimately concerned with). We are of the view\n                    that this wouldnotbe the case. Indeed, we note\n                    that SUM 416 was filed by the Respondentprecisely\n                        becauseof this application by the Appellant to amend its\n                    defence. If, therefore, the appeal in CA 109 was allowed (with the\n                    consequence that the Appellant could amend its defence in order to plead,inter alia, the 30:70 Loss Sharing\n                    Arrangement), it followed that the application in SUM 416 ought also to be\n                    allowed in order to avoid any prejudice resulting to the Respondent by allowing\n                    it (the Respondent) to adduce further evidence to help counter the amended\n                    defence raised by the Appellant. Indeed, the further evidence sought to be\n                    adduced by the Respondent by way of SUM 416 consisted of a copy of the SFL\n                    Agreement as well as evidence to the effect that the Respondent had not received\n                    any funds pursuant to the SFL Agreement to finance the loan extended by it (the\n                    Respondent) to SY Industries. In addition, the Respondent would also be entitled\n                    to lead further evidence at the trial itself to counter any evidence raised by\n                    the Appellant with regard to this particular issue (cfalso the High Court decision ofMidlink\n                        Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd[2004]\n                    4 SLR(R) 258 at [65]). This confirms, further, in our view, the fact that\n                    permitting the Appellant to amend his defence would not only raise squarely for\n                    decision an important issue between the parties but would also not prejudice the\n                    Respondent. This is unlike, for example, the situation in the decision of this\n                    court inAsia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin and\n                        another[2004] 2 SLR(R) 173, inasmuch as allowing the\n                    amendment sought by the Appellant would not (as was in the case just cited)\n                    change the basic premises or case theory that had already been canvassed before\n                    the courts below. On the contrary, the Appellant in the present proceedings\n                    sought to raise an issue that had not even seen the light of day in the courts\n                    below. It is also not surprising, in the circumstances, that counsel for the\n                    Appellant, Mr Goh Kok Leong, stated that he had no objections whatsoever\n                    with the application in SUM 416 being allowed if this court allowed his\n                    client’s appeal in CA 108. We were also of the view that the delay\n                    (which, as pointed out above, whilst a relevant factor, is not, in and of\n                    itself, decisive in precluding an amendment of the pleadings) by the Appellant\n                    in filing its application to amend its defence was not, having regard to all the\n                    circumstances of the case, an irremediable flaw. 14     Hence, for the reasons set out briefly in the\n                    preceding paragraph, we allowed the appeal in CA 109 as well as granted the\n                    application in SUM 416 to adduce further evidence.",
        "CA 108": "15     Turning to what was, in effect, the\n                    substantive appeal (in CA 108), counsel for the Appellant, Mr Goh,concededthat the Appellant was, in fact,\n                    liable to the Respondent on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit.\n                    However, he argued (citing Harvey McGregor,McGregor on\n                        Damages(Sweet & Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2003) at\n                    para 41-004) that the present action by the Respondent against the\n                    Appellant was intortfor fraudulent\n                    misrepresentation or deceit and that the purpose in awarding damages intortwas to put the plaintiff in the position\n                    that it would have been if the wrong (here, the deceit) had not been committed\n                    in the first place, whereas the purposes in awarding damages incontractwas to put the plaintiff in the position that\n                    it would have been had the contract been performed. That this is indeed the case\n                    is, in fact, confirmed by the decision of this court inWishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town Corp[2008] 2 SLR(R) 909\n                        (“Wishing Star”), as follows (at\n                    [28]): The point … relates to the different objectives of\n                        awarding damages in contract and in tort, respectively. Indeed, it is yet\n                        another specific distinction underlying the more general difference between\n                        contract on the one hand and tort on the other. And it is effectively put in\n                        a leading textbook, as follows (see Edwin Peel,Treitel\n                            on The Law of Contract(Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed,\n                        2007) at para 20-018): The object of damages forbreach of\n                                contractis to put the victim “so far as money can\n                            do it … in the same situation … as if the contract had\n                            been performed” [citing the leading decision ofRobinson v Harman(1848) 1 Ex 850 at 855;\n                            154 ER 363 at 365].In other words, the victim\n                                is entitled to be compensated for the loss of his bargain, so that\n                                his expectations arising out of or created by the contract are\n                                protected. This protection of the victim’s expectations must\n                                be contrasted with the principle on which damages are awarded in\n                                tort: the purpose of such damages is simply to put the victim into\n                                the position in which he would have been, if the tort had not been\n                                committed. Of course, in many tort actions the victim can\n                            recover damages for loss of expectations: e.g. for loss of expected\n                            earnings suffered as a result of personal injury, or for loss of\n                            expected profits suffered as a result of damage to a profit-earning\n                            thing. But these expectations existquite\n                                independently ofthe tortious conduct which impairs them:\n                            it is the nature of most torts to destroy or impair expectations of this\n                            kind, rather than to create new ones.Tortious\n                                misrepresentation does, indeed, create new expectations, but the\n                                purpose of damages even for that tort is to put the victim into the\n                                position in which he would have been, if the misrepresentation had\n                                not been made, and not to protect his expectations by putting him\n                                into the position in which he would have been, if the representation\n                                had been true. Such damages may be awarded in respect of\n                            losses which the victim could have avoided if he had been told the\n                            truth, and here again there is a sense in which the victim will recover\n                            damages for “loss of a chance”, but it is the chance of\n                            avoiding loss rather than that of making a profit for which he will be\n                            compensated. He may even be compensated for loss of profit if the tort\n                            impairs expectations which exist independently of it…. In a\n                            contractual action, on the other hand, damages are recoverable as a\n                            matter of course for loss of the expectations created by the very\n                            contract for breach of which the action is brought. That is why damages\n                            of this kind are the distinctive feature of a contractual action. [emphasis added in bold italics] 16     However, that having been said, we didnotsee how that propositionaloneaided the Appellant. Indeed, the damages awardable\n                    for the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit are, potentially,very wide. InWishing\n                        Star, it was observed thus (at [21], [23] and\n                    [25]–[26]): 21    [Another] consequence [in relation to the tort of\n                            fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit] concernsthe\n                                scope or extent of damages that can be awarded in the context of\n                                fraudulent misrepresentation, assuming that both the\n                                misrepresentation(s) of this nature and the damage alleged can be\n                                proved.Embedded in this question are\n                                two closely related matters. The first is embodied in the last part\n                                of the question. It relates to a requirement that is by no means\n                                peculiar only to claims based on fraudulent misrepresentation.\n                                Indeed, it is ageneralrequirement that must be satisfied each time damages\n                                are sought by a plaintiff. And it is thatthe plaintiff must prove its loss. As\n                            mentioned in a recent decision of this court, this requirement is so\n                            obvious that it is rarely mentioned expressly (seeRobertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte\n                                Ltd[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 at [27]). The second matter\n                            is embodied in the first part of the question – for which the\n                            leading authority is the House of Lords decision ofSmith New Court Securities Ltd v Citibank NA[1997]\n                            AC 254 (“Smith New\n                            Court”). This particular decision reaffirmed the\n                            general principle that damages for fraudulent misrepresentation would\n                            include all loss that flowed directly as a result of the entry by the\n                            plaintiff (in reliance upon the fraudulent misrepresentation) into the\n                            transaction in question,regardless of whether or not\n                                such loss was foreseeable, and would include all consequential loss\n                                as well. ... 23    The decision inSmith New\n                                Courtwas concerned, in fact, with thenatureof fraudulent misrepresentation (in terms of the\n                            element of deceit which such misrepresentation necessarily involves). It\n                            will be immediately seen that the potential amount of damages awardable\n                            for a fraudulent misrepresentation exceeds even that awardable for a\n                            negligent misrepresentation (pursuant to the seminal House of Lords\n                            decision ofHedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller &\n                                Partners Ltd[1964] AC 465). In particular, damages\n                            awarded with respect to a negligent misrepresentation are constrained by\n                            the doctrine of remoteness of damage (as manifested in the concept of\n                            reasonable foreseeability, as to which, see the leading Privy Council\n                            decision ofOverseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock\n                                & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)[1961]\n                            AC 388). However, … damages awarded with respect to a\n                            fraudulent misrepresentation are not subject to such a constraint, and\n                            are recoverable even if they are not reasonably foreseeable. The reasons\n                            for this were elaborated upon in some detail inSmith\n                                New Courtitself. … 25Doyle([21]supra) has, in fact, been adopted in several\n                            local decisions … 26    More importantly, perhaps,Smith\n                                New Court([21] supra) has also been cited with approval\n                            in a number of Singapore decisions with regard to the issue of recovery\n                            of all direct (including consequential) loss flowing from the\n                            transaction that was entered into as a result of a fraudulent\n                            misrepresentation, even if such loss was not reasonably foreseeable\n                            … [emphasis added in bold and bold italics; remaining emphasis in\n                        original] 17     However, notwithstanding (as just noted) the\n                    potentially large amount of damages that might be awarded to a plaintiff in the\n                    context of a fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit by the defendant, the\n                    Appellant’s central argument in the present proceedings was based, in our\n                    view, on thefirstelement that the plaintiff must\n                    establish its loss (viz, the language in bold and\n                    bold italics in the quotation fromWishing Star,\n                    as set out in the preceding paragraph). 18     The Respondent and the EDB had, in fact,\n                    entered into the SFL Agreement on 13 November 1995. Pursuant to cl 2.1\n                    of that agreement, the EDB would furnish the Respondent with a Scheme Funding\n                    Line that the Respondent could draw down on for the purposes of financing loans\n                    to business enterprises under a number of schemes, including the Regionalisation\n                    Finance Scheme (“the RFS”). In this regard, it was common ground\n                    between the parties that the Loan extended by the Respondent to SY Industries\n                    was pursuant to the RFS and with the approval of the EDB. It was also common\n                    ground between the parties that the 30:70 Loss Sharing Arrangement existed.\n                    However, whatwas disputedbetween the parties was\n                    whether the Respondent had in fact been reimbursed by the EDB for the Loan\n                    amount as well as what legal effect the SFL Agreement had on the 30:70 Loss\n                    Sharing Arrangement. The former argument is, of course, a purely factual one,\n                    and was not in fact the one focused upon by the Appellant – at least\n                    during its oral submissions before this court. 19     Turning to the latter argument, which was\n                    referred to in the preceding paragraph and whichwasthe focus of the Appellant during its oral submissions,\n                    Mr Goh argued, on behalf of the Appellant, that pursuant to the\n                    30:70 Loss Sharing Arrangement, the Appellant was only liable to the\n                    Respondent for 30 per cent of the Loan amount. In this regard, Mr Goh\n                    cited the definition of “loss” in the SFL Agreement, which reads\n                    as follows: 1.    Definitions In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires:- … “Loss”In respect of any Facilities\n                                            under the LEF scheme or the LEF(O) scheme, means such\n                                            amount as EDB and PFI may agree to be the sum of:\n                                                (a)the principal\n                                                outstanding in respect of such Facilities after\n                                                taking into account all sums recovered from the\n                                                Borrower after the Date of First Default(including sums realised from the enforcement of any\n                                            security or guarantees relating to such Facilities);\n                                                (b)solicitors and court\n                                                fees paid by PFI in respect of legal actions taken\n                                                between the Loss Determination Date and the Write\n                                                off Date to recover such Facilities or to enforce\n                                                such security or guarantees less any part thereof as\n                                                are recovered from the Borrower and not otherwise\n                                                treated as a recovery under (a) above;\n                                            (c) interest paid by PFI to EDB on such Facilities\n                                            between the Loss Determination Date and the Write-off\n                                            Date; and (d) such other sums or costs as may be\n                                            agreed to by EDB. In the absence of agreement between\n                                            EDB and PFI on the sum of “Loss” to be\n                                            calculated on the above basis, the term\n                                            “Loss” shall mean such sum as EDB may in\n                                            its absolute discretion determine and notify in writing\n                                            to PFI with respect to any particular\n                                        Facilities   [emphasis added] Mr Goh proceeded to argue that, in the light of the clause\n                    reproduced above, the loss that the Respondent and the EDB agreed to share ought\n                    to be computed by way of the following formula: Loss = Moneys that\n                    the borrower does not pay + interest that the Respondent has to pay to EDB for\n                    funding the loan + the Respondent’s legal costs for pursuing the claim\n                    against the borrower. 20     Mr Goh highlighted that the above formula\n                    only factored in moneys recovered from the borrower and not from third parties.\n                    In the circumstances, the EDB’s liability to the Respondent was for up to70 per cent of the moneys unpaid by SY\n                        Industries, and not70 per cent of the\n                        net sum of the moneys unpaid by SY Industries less judgment sums recovered\n                        from third parties such as the Appellant. He argued that,\n                    consequently, the Appellant’s liability towards the Respondent was only\n                    30 per cent of the Loan amount and that it was up to the EDB to recover in\n                    its own name the balance 70 per cent of that amount if it so desired. The\n                    EDB was not a party to these proceedings and there was no pending application to\n                    include them. 21     In contrast, the Respondent’s case was\n                    simply that, as between EDB and the Respondent, the 30:70 Loss Sharing\n                    Arrangement was such that the Respondent would have to take steps to recover the\n                    loss from the borrower and third partiesfirst.\n                    Any apportionment of loss would take placeafterlegal proceedings against the borrower and third parties have ended and after\n                    deducting the judgment sums that have been recovered from the calculation of\n                    loss. Counsel for the Respondent, Mr Terence Tan, emphasised that the\n                    measure of damages for the tort of deceit was a liberal one and included loss\n                    amounting to the full Loan amount disbursed to SY Industries. 22     In our view, if, indeed, the Appellant was\n                    correct in its argument, then the Respondent ought to be restricted to the\n                    quantum of recovery argued for by the Appellant lest there be double-recovery by\n                    the Respondent. Further, and more importantly, as a matter of general principle,\n                    the Appellant is only liable to the Respondent for damages in fraudulent\n                    misrepresentation or deceit only to the extent that that lossflowed directlyfrom the misrepresentation concerned. If,\n                    indeed, the Appellant can successfully establish that the 30:70 Loss Sharing\n                    Arrangement operated between the Respondent and the EDBin\n                        the manner argued for by it, then only 30 per cent of the\n                    loss suffered by the Respondent as a result of the Appellant’s\n                    misrepresentation would flow from that particular misrepresentation and, hence,\n                    the Respondent can only recover that quantum — and no more. However,\n                    whether or not this argument is correct is not one that could be determined by\n                    way of an application for summary judgment. More evidence would, presumably,\n                    need to be adduced by the parties. Further, the court would also have to hear\n                    arguments from both parties as to the proper construction of the SFL Agreement\n                    in the context of its legal effect on the 30:70 Loss Sharing Arrangement.\n                    For example, whilst the SFL Agreement appears to be an umbrella agreement under\n                    which the Respondent received financing from the EDB in the form of a Scheme\n                    Funding Line it could draw down on if certain conditions were met, neither party\n                    was able to furnish details as to how the Scheme Funding Line worked in\n                    practice. In particular, the Respondent could not state, with certainty, that it\n                    had no recourse to the EDB without first bringing legal proceedings against\n                    relevant third parties such as the Appellant. In the circumstances, we were of\n                    the view that the issue as to whether or not the Respondent was entitled to\n                    damages in excess of 30 per cent of the Loan amount was an issue that ought\n                    to be tried. 23     However, to the extent that the Appellant\n                    conceded, first, that there had been a fraudulent misrepresentation by himself\n                    and, secondly, that he was liable for 30 per cent of the loss suffered by\n                    the Respondent as a result of the said misrepresentation, we ordered that\n                    CA 108 be allowed to the extent that judgment be given for the Respondent\n                    to the extent of 30 per cent of its claim and that the Appellant be granted\n                    leave to defend the remaining 70 per cent of the same.",
        "Conclusion": "24     For the reasons given above, we allowed the\n                    appeal in CA 109 and also granted the application in SUM 416. We also\n                    allowed the appeal in CA 108 in part to the extent that judgment be given\n                    for the Respondent to the extent of 30 per cent of its claim against the\n                    Appellant, and that the Appellant be granted leave to defend the remaining\n                    70 per cent of the same. In the circumstances, we were of the view that a\n                    fair order in so far as costs were concerned was that the costs of the\n                    proceedings both here and below ought to be in the cause and we so ordered\n                    accordingly."
