        "The prosecution’s case": "3.    On the afternoon of 1 March 2001, a surveillance was conducted by\n\na Central Narcotics Bureau (\"CNB\") officer, SSSgt B Chandrasegaran (\"SSSgt\n\nChandra\"), in the vicinity of Block 347 Jurong East Avenue 1, a food centre in the\n\nJurong East housing estate (the ‘food centre’). SSSgt Chandra was instructed to\n\nlook out for two male Indians. At around 4.25pm, he saw Raja on a motorcycle. Raja parked\n\nthe motorcycle, alighted and waited for someone. Panneer was seen walking towards Raja\n\nwith a yellow plastic bag. After reaching Raja’s motorcycle, Panneer opened a carrier\n\nbox at the rear of the motorcycle, placed the yellow plastic bag in it and shut the\n\ncarrier box. Both men spoke for a short while, after which Raja left on his motorcycle and\n\nPanneer returned to the food centre.4.    SSSgt Chandra attempted to trail Raja’s motorcycle but lost\n\nsight of it at a traffic light junction. He reported this to Insp Sivaraman (\"Insp\n\nSiva\"), who instructed another surveillance team, comprising Sgt Affendi Ideris\n\n(\"Sgt Ideris\") and Cpl D Sivarajaa (\"Cpl Siva\"), to look out for\n\nRaja’s motorcycle. At around 4.50pm, Sgt Ideris and Cpl Siva saw Raja’s\n\nmotorcycle parked at the carpark of Block 554, Jurong West St 42. Raja’s flat is in\n\nthis Block. At around 5.10pm, they saw Raja and his wife approaching the motorcycle. Raja\n\nrode his motorcycle out of the carpark while his wife walked back to their flat. When\n\ninformed of this, Insp Siva and his team pursued Raja.5.    Raja stopped his motorcycle by the roadside and appeared to be\n\nwaiting for someone. At that juncture, he was arrested by Insp Siva and his team. Raja was\n\ntold to stand beside the carrier box at the rear of the motorcycle. Insp Siva took the\n\nkeys of the motorcycle and, before opening the carrier box, asked Raja in Tamil if there\n\nwas anything in the box. Raja replied in Tamil that there was \"jamma\" inside.\n\n\"Jamma\" refers to \"things\" generally but is also a street name for\n\ncannabis.6.    The carrier box was then opened. Among the things inside were a\n\nblue plastic bag containing 61 one-dollar coins and a yellow plastic bag with two blocks\n\nof vegetable matter containing cannabis, which were wrapped with transparent plastic. Insp\n\nSiva then asked Raja a series of questions in Tamil. Sgt Raj Kumar was the witness. The\n\nquestions and answers, which were recorded in Insp Siva’s field book, are as follows:Q: What is your name?A: Rajagopalan s/o Tamilarasan.Q: What is inside your bike Carrier?A: Drugs.Q: What kind of drugs is this?A: Ganjah (Cannabis) \"Jamma\".Q: Who does this Ganjah belong to?A: It is mine.Q: What is this Ganjah for?A: It is for sale.Q: When did you take this Ganjah?A: About 10 – 20 minutes ago.Q: Who did you take it from?A: I took it from Paul.Q: Where did you meet Paul?A: At the Hawker’s Centre.Q: What block?A: At the Hawker Centre near Esso Petrol Station.Q: How did you contact Paul to collect the Ganjah?A: I called him at handphone no: 96101229.7.    Insp Siva read the questions and answers in English and Tamil to\n\nRaja. He asked Raja in Tamil whether he understood the contents and invited him to make\n\nany changes he desired. Raja signed the field book after he replied in Tamil that he\n\nunderstood the contents and that they were true.8.    At around 6pm, Insp Siva instructed SSSgt Chandra to lead a team\n\nof officers to arrest Panneer. When the team arrived at the food centre, Panneer was\n\nhaving drinks beside a coffee stall with another Indian man, Subramaniam. Both men were\n\narrested. Behind Panneer’s seat was a steel cabinet, on which two black bags were\n\nplaced. When questioned by SSSgt Chandra as to who owned the two bags, Panneer claimed\n\nthat the bag with the letters \"SCTS\" belonged to him. He denied that the other\n\nbag, with the word \"Brutini\" on it, was his. The \"SCTS\" bag did not\n\ncontain anything incriminating but the \"Brutini\" bag contained nine bundles of\n\nvegetable matter wrapped in aluminium foil, a Nokia handphone battery charger, an\n\naluminium wrapper and ten sachets of vegetable matter. Panneer denied that these items\n\nbelonged to him.9.    A mini sachet of vegetable matter was found in the left pocket of\n\nPanneer’s trousers. He admitted that it was cannabis and said that it for his own\n\nconsumption. SSSgt Chandra and his team proceeded to Panneer’s flat but did not find\n\nanything incriminating there. Another team of officers which had proceeded to Raja’s\n\nflat also did not find any controlled drugs in the flat.10.    At around 6.52pm, in his office and in the presence of two other\n\nofficers, SSSgt Chandra asked Panneer three questions in English. Panneer answered these\n\nquestions in English. The questions and answers were recorded on a piece of paper as\n\nfollows:Q: Does the 2 black bags which were recovered from the premises of the\n\n  hawker centre where you were arrested belong to you?A: Both bags belong to me. One black bag (Singa China Travel Service\n\n  Logo) and (Berutini) brand belongs to me.Q: Do you know what is in the black bag (Berutini) which was seized\n\n  from you?A: I know that there is Marijuana in the bag but I do not know the\n\n  exact amount. I only know that is about 350 to 400 grams of Marijuana.Q: The other black bag (SCTS) logo, did it contain any drugs before we\n\n  seized it?A: The bag contained 2 kilogram of Marijuana which I handed to my\n\n  friend Raja only a few minutes before my arrest.11.    The questions and answers were read to Panneer, who confirmed\n\nthat they were true by signing on the piece of paper.12.    Later that night, the seized items were handed over to the\n\nInvestigating Officer, ASP Soh Thiam Loon (\"ASP Soh\"), at the Major\n\nInvestigation Branch. Tests confirmed that the two blocks of vegetable matter found in the\n\nyellow plastic bag contained 824g and 824.8g of cannabis respectively. These blocks formed\n\nthe subject matter of the charges against Raja and Panneer.13.    Raja’s wife, Shiyamala d/o Kesavan (\"Shiyamala\"),\n\nwho was called as a prosecution witness, testified that her husband had been unemployed\n\nafter a motorcycle accident in 1996 and that he did odd jobs from time to time. On 1 March\n\n2001, she took the afternoon off from work. She said that while having lunch at home, Raja\n\nreceived a call from his friend, Paul, a name by which Panneer is also known. Raja said\n\nthat he had requested a loan of $100 from Paul a few days ago to buy her a birthday gift\n\nand Paul had called to ask him to collect the $100. Shiyamala claimed that she had never\n\nseen nor spoken to Paul before.14.    At around 4.30pm, Raja’s handphone rang. After answering the\n\ncall, Raja told his wife that Paul had asked him to meet him in Jurong to collect the\n\n$100. After saying that he would be back home in ten minutes, he left the flat. Around ten\n\nminutes later, he called her and asked her to proceed to the ground level of their block\n\nof flats.15.    When Shiyamala met Raja downstairs, he was with his motorcycle in\n\nthe carpark. He told her that he wanted to take her to buy things and added that he had\n\nbeen asked by Paul to deliver a bag to Paul’s friend. When Shiyamala asked why Paul\n\ncould not do it himself, Raja replied that Paul had to go somewhere. When questioned by\n\nShiyamala as to what was inside the bag and to whom it was to be delivered, Raja replied\n\nthat he did not know. Then another call came through on Raja’s handphone. Raja, who\n\nsaid that Paul’s friend had called to say that he had arrived, told Shiyamala that he\n\nwould deliver the bag and return in about ten minutes. He asked her to go back to the flat\n\nand change her clothes as she was in her home clothes. He then left on his motorcycle.\n\nShiyamala returned to the flat and waited for Raja. She learnt that her husband had been\n\narrested when CNB officers arrived subsequently at her flat.16.    Ms Irene Ong, an executive with StarHub Pte Ltd, testified that\n\nthe handphone was registered in Raja’s uncle’s name but the bills were sent to\n\nRaja’s address in Jurong West. Records showed that on 1 March 2001, between 1.53 pm\n\nand 5.20 pm, six calls were made from Raja’s handphone to Panneer’s handphone.17.    On 2 March 2001, the Investigating Officer, ASP Soh Thiam Loon,\n\nrecorded statements from both Raja and Panneer pursuant to section 122(6) of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code (Cap 65). After amendments were made, both signed their respective\n\nstatements. Raja’s statement was as follows:One person by the name of Paul. Paul told me whether I could help him\n\n  to bring something. I agreed. Since I am looking after a child, I told him I would be able\n\n  to help him. At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, my wife came back. Then I\n\n  telephoned Paul that I could go and help him to bring whatever thing he gave me. He also\n\n  said he would pay me S$100/- if I could bring the item which he give me and hand over to\n\n  his friend.Since my wife had already come home, I came out of my house after\n\n  handing over the child to her. Before which I telephoned Paul where to go and deliver the\n\n  goods. He asked me where can I go and deliver the goods. I told him near the bus-stop near\n\n  my house. He told me that I supposed to go and collect the item from him and wait at the\n\n  bus-stop near my house, and to deliver to a person who would come to see me at the\n\n  bus-stop. Then I went to see Paul. Paul came, carrying a plastic bag, yellow colour. I\n\n  told him I am unemployed and I am taking this S$100. I told him don’t get angry\n\n  because I know him. I asked for the S$100 which he promised. He said go and deliver first\n\n  and he would pay me tonight. He put the plastic bag into a box which was behind my\n\n  motorcycle. I drove the motorcycle to Blk 554 Jurong West St 42, my house, under my block.Then I went to speak to my wife. I told her I would come back shortly,\n\n  as I had to go and deliver some goods near the bus-stop.I drove my motorcycle to the bus-stop. I was waiting at the bus-stop.\n\n  Officers moved in and I was arrested. After they took out from the box the plastic bag.\n\n  Officers showed me the content of the bag was controlled drug.I told the officer a friend of mine by the name of Paul told me to\n\n  deliver, without knowing the contents. I am not accustomed to this type of work. I\n\n  don’t involved myself in drugs. That’s all. Paul is the one who was arrested and\n\n  sitting outside now.18.    As for Panneer, his statement was as follows:Around 3-something afternoon, I went for a beer with my workers. After\n\n  that, a guy from Malaysia came down and see me. He came down and he bring two bags. So he\n\n  put down there, sit down with me for a while, on the beer cabinet. I know Raja two or\n\n  three months only. He said: Paul, I am going out for a while. I’ll come back in\n\n  half-an-hour time. Before that, he said his friend, Raja, will call me. He said pass this\n\n  yellow plastic bag to him. I never said what is inside. The other bag was on the same beer\n\n  cabinet.After I met Raja, Raja called me first. I went to see him, he came in a\n\n  motorbike. Then he opened the box at the back of his motorcycle. Then I just said your\n\n  friends asked me to pass to you. He also never checked what is inside.He took just the yellow plastic bag and left in his motorbike. Then I\n\n  came back to the same location, the hawker centre. I was drinking again with my worker and\n\n  brother. They also left already. Suddenly a lot of people came into where I was sitting.\n\n  They said they are CNB. They said \"you just now put the yellow plastic bag inside the\n\n  box.\" They asked whose bag was on the beer cabinet? One officer said: don’t\n\n  bullshit, this is yours. Because in the other bag, the black bag, you got this one belong\n\n  to who? So I said nobody. Then the officer took another bag and asked what is this? So I\n\n  said this is my friend’s bag (the Malaysian friend, same guy).Then they said they wanted to spot-check the house. So they came to my\n\n  house. Nothing was down there. So they bring to narcotic that side to investigate. To tell\n\n  the truth, I am an asthmatic patient. Casually, once in a blue moon, I would take\n\n  marijuana for my asthma. I buy rations of $0.20 for my own consumption. That was in my\n\n  pocket. But the Malaysian guy never come back. So I told the CNB this is what happened.",
        "The first appellant’s case": "19.    Raja’s evidence was similar to what he had said in his\n\nsection 122(6) CPC statement and to his wife’s account of what had happened on the\n\nday in question. He said that he got to know Panneer or Paul about two or three months\n\nbefore 1 March 2001 through a friend. On 28 February 2001, the day before their arrest, he\n\nhad asked Panneer for a loan of $100 to buy his wife a birthday gift. Panneer said that he\n\nwould call Raja when he had the money.20.    Raja said that on 1 March 2001, Panneer called him on his\n\nhandphone and asked if he was free. After the initial phone call from Panneer, he made\n\nseveral calls from his handphone to the latter on the afternoon of 1 March 2001. At\n\n1.53pm, he called Panneer, who said that he was renovating his mother’s flat in\n\nJurong East. Paneer asked him whether he could deliver some things to a friend. At 1.57pm,\n\nRaja called Panneer to inform the latter that his wife would be returning early from work\n\nand that he would be able to deliver the things. After his wife returned home, Raja called\n\nPanneer at around 3.44pm to ask where he was to go to deliver the things. When he was\n\nleaving his flat, at around 4.26pm, he called Panneer again and was told to proceed to the\n\nfood centre in Jurong East. He called Panneer again at 4.58pm when he did not see the\n\nlatter after he arrived at the food centre in Jurong East.21.    Raja said that he did not see what was inside the yellow plastic\n\nbag which Panneer placed into the carrier box at the rear of his motorcycle. He said that\n\nhe was not suspicious about the delivery because he was not paid for his services. He\n\ninsisted that the $100 that Panneer was to hand over to him that night was a loan and not\n\nthe payment for delivering the bag.22.    Raja’s account of what transpired upon his arrest was as\n\nfollows. He was intercepted by a CNB car while he was waiting by the side of the road for\n\nthe intended recipients of the yellow plastic bag. Three or four men alighted from the car\n\nand someone said that they were from CNB. He was then handcuffed. Insp Siva asked him\n\nwhether there was anything inside the carrier box and he replied in Tamil, \"There is\n\nthing.\" Someone opened the carrier box and he heard the words \"confirmed,\n\nganja\" and \"cannabis\".23.    Raja said that his handphone and wallet were seized and he was\n\ntold to sit on the kerb. Insp Siva asked him whether the things in the yellow plastic bag\n\nwere his. As he could not see what Insp Siva was pointing at, he was told to stand up. It\n\nwas only then that he noticed the contents of the plastic bag. He denied having answered\n\n\"drugs\" or \"ganja\".24.    Raja claimed that Insp Siva did not ask him the third, fourth and\n\nfifth questions recorded in the field book. He added that the sixth question was\n\n\"When did you take the yellow bag?\" and not \"When did you take this\n\nGanja?\", as was recorded. Furthermore, the word \"ganja\" in the tenth\n\nquestion should be replaced with the word \"bag\". He asserted that Insp Siva did\n\nnot use the word \"ganja\" at any time. He also pointed out that when Insp Siva\n\nasked, \"Do these things belong to you?\", he replied that the bag and the spray\n\nin the box were his but the yellow plastic bag had been handed over to him by Panneer.\n\nFinally, he denied that the questions and answers recorded in Insp Siva’s field book\n\nwere read back to him and claimed that he signed the book when told to do so, without\n\nknowing what he was signing.",
        "The second appellant’s case": "25.    Panneer’s case is as follows. On the morning of 1 March\n\n2001, he was doing some rewiring work in his parents’ flat in Jurong East, together\n\nwith his elder brother, Rajinthran, and a friend, Segar. They then proceeded to the food\n\ncentre for lunch. Another friend, Subramaniam, joined them for lunch. Thereafter, Panneer\n\nasked Rajinthran and Segar to buy cement, wire and paint from a shop nearby. He also asked\n\nRajinthran to collect his winnings in the 4D lottery for him.26.    While alone with Subramaniam, Panneer received a call from\n\nMalaysia from a friend called Ravi, who wanted something to be sent to Jurong and was\n\nwilling to pay $100 for that to be done. Ravi said that he would meet Panneer at about\n\n4pm.27.    Panneer said that he called Raja to ask whether the latter was\n\nfree to run the errand. He said that he called Raja because the latter had asked for a\n\nloan of $100 on the previous day. Raja said that he would call Panneer when his wife\n\nreturned from work. Subsequently, Raja called and said that he would be available after\n\n3pm.28.    Rajinthran and Segar returned to the flat to continue with the\n\nrewiring works while Panneer and Subramaniam remained at the food centre. Later on,\n\nSubramaniam also left to collect his own winnings in the 4D lottery and returned to the\n\nfood centre at about 5pm.29.    Panneer said that at around 4pm, Ravi arrived at the food centre\n\nwith two bags. After placing the bags on the cabinet, Ravi joined him for a drink. Ravi,\n\nwho pointed to the bags and said that there was something inside to be delivered to\n\nsomeone, added that he could not do it himself as he was busy and was unfamiliar with the\n\nJurong area. His two friends (the intended recipients) were also busy.30.    Raja then called Panneer to say that he had arrived at the\n\ncarpark of the food centre. Panneer said that he told Ravi that he could not run the\n\nerrand and that he had asked a friend, who was waiting at the carpark, to do it. Ravi\n\nopened one of the bags on the cabinet, took out a yellow plastic bag and passed it to him.\n\nPanneer claimed that he could not look inside the plastic bag as it was knotted at the\n\ntop.31.    Panneer took the yellow plastic bag to Raja and told the latter\n\nthat the plastic bag was to be delivered to Jurong West, as indicated by Ravi. Raja\n\nsuggested a bus-stop along Jurong West St 42 as that was near his flat and that would be\n\nconvenient for him. Ravi would call his friends to meet Raja at the designated bus-stop to\n\ncollect the yellow plastic bag.32.    Panneer said that when Raja asked him for the $100 loan, he told\n\nRaja to meet him in the evening to collect the money. He then returned to the food centre\n\nand asked Ravi about the $100 promised by him. Ravi, who said that he would go and get the\n\nmoney, left the two bags at the food centre with Panneer. At around 5pm, Subramaniam\n\nreturned to the food centre and sat down to have drinks with Panneer.33.    Panneer said that a short while later, the CNB officers arrived.\n\nSSSgt Chandra asked him if he had placed anything in Raja’s motorcycle and he\n\nreplied, \"Yes, is there any problem?\" The CNB officer then asked him, \"Do\n\nyou know that there are two kilos of ganja inside?\". He replied, \"I don’t\n\nknow.\" The officers then searched his body and found a small amount of cannabis in\n\nhis pocket.34.    Panneer claimed that when he put the yellow plastic bag into the\n\ncarrier box on Raja’s motorcycle, he had no idea that the bag contained drugs. When\n\ncross-examined, he said that Raja did not look inside the yellow plastic bag and that he\n\ndid not tell Raja what the contents were as he had no knowledge of the contents.35.    During cross-examination, Panneer said that he came to know Ravi,\n\nthrough another friend, Govind, about two years ago, and had met him four or five times.\n\nHe added that Ravi gave small amounts of cannabis to Govind, who shared the drugs with\n\nhim. After Govind migrated to Australia, Ravi called Panneer and asked if he wanted\n\ncannabis. Panneer told Ravi to bring small amounts. Panneer also borrowed money from Ravi.\n\nAs such, he claimed that when Ravi asked for a favour in delivering the yellow plastic\n\nbag, he agreed to help him without asking what its contents were.",
        "The appeal": "36.    Both Raja’s and Panneer’s grounds of appeal against\n\ntheir conviction and sentence centred around the judge’s assessment of the evidence.\n\nThe key issue in this appeal was whether or not the appellants had, at the relevant time,\n\nthe requisite knowledge that the yellow plastic bag contained cannabis. Counsel for both\n\nappellants contended that the trial judge failed to give sufficient weight to the\n\nappellants’ evidence in court and erred when he relied on their statements to the\n\nCNB.37.    The trial judge accepted the prosecution’s evidence that\n\nRaja answered the questions posed to him by Insp Siva in the presence of Sgt Raj Kumar and\n\nthat all the questions and answers had been dutifully recorded. That Raja was in physical\n\ncontrol of the drugs was not in dispute. His voluntary answers were incriminating and\n\nshowed that he knew that he was delivering drugs.38.    An attempt was made to cast doubt on Insp Siva’s credibility\n\nby pointing out a number of inconsistencies in his testimony. The trial judge, who had the\n\nbenefit of assessing the witnesses, did not think that the inconsistencies were material.\n\nHe did not believe Raja’s evidence in court regarding his statements. There was no\n\nreason for this court to overturn the finding of the trial judge in this respect.39.    The available evidence showed that Raja had the drugs for the\n\npurpose of trafficking. There was thus no need for the prosecution to rely on the\n\npresumption in section 17(d) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). Raja’s claim that\n\nhe had agreed to deliver the yellow bag without knowing what it contained is not\n\nbelievable. Despite having had several phone conversations with Panneer and after having\n\nmet the latter to collect the plastic bag, he made no attempt to find out the contents of\n\nthe bag. The overall circumstances of the case were suspicious and gave rise to the\n\nreasonable inference that this was a well-organised plot. Raja must have known beforehand\n\nthat he was delivering drugs.40.    As for Panneer, his counsel asserted that the trial judge erred\n\nin failing to consider whether or not the yellow plastic bag placed into the carrier box\n\nof Raja’s motorcycle and its contents were the same plastic bag and contents that\n\nwere subsequently recovered by Insp Siva and his team after Raja’s arrest. It was\n\ncontended that this doubt arose as SSSgt Chandra lost sight of Raja’s motorcycle for\n\na while. This contention is without merit. This issue was considered carefully by the\n\ntrial judge. We agreed with his finding and with his reasons, which were stated in para\n\n136 of his judgment as follows:I accepted the First Accused’s (Raja’s) evidence that the\n\n  carrier box of his motorcycle was shut but not locked even after the yellow plastic bag\n\n  was placed in it by the Second Accused (Panneer). It was evident that a third person would\n\n  not know it was not locked unless he tried to open the cover of the carrier box. The First\n\n  Accused rode his motorcycle from Blk 347 back to Jurong West St 42. The CNB officers lost\n\n  sight of him and his motorcycle for only about 18 minutes between 4.32 pm and 4.50 pm. The\n\n  First Accused did not say that anyone had gone near his motorcycle. When the motorcycle\n\n  was parked at the motorcycle lots between Blks 552 and 554, it was obvious that a careful\n\n  man like the First Accused would have made sure that he could still keep an eye on his\n\n  motorcycle. After all, even if he knew nothing about the contents of the yellow plastic\n\n  bag (which was clearly not the case), he had money kept in the carrier box and $61 could\n\n  not be a small amount for someone who had to importune the Second Accused for a $100 loan.\n\n  I had no doubt that the yellow plastic bag and its contents found by Insp Sivaraman at the\n\n  point of arrest were the same ones placed by the Second Accused at Blk 347.41.    The answers given by Panneer to the questions posed by SSSgt\n\nChandra at the police station after his arrest clearly showed that he was aware of the\n\ncontents of the yellow plastic bag and the two black bags which was recovered from him\n\nupon his arrest at the food centre. The recording of the questions and answers was\n\nwitnessed by Sgt Raj Kumar and SSgt Azman. No inducement, threat or promise was alleged by\n\nPanneer.42.    In response to SSSgt Chandra’s first question, Panneer said\n\nthat both the SCTS bag and the Brutini bag belonged to him. Subsequently, he claimed to\n\nhave given that answer because Sgt Raj Kumar had insisted earlier on that they belonged to\n\nhim. This claim was validly rejected by the trial judge because at the scene of his arrest\n\nat the food centre, Panneer had said that the SCTS bag was his while the Brutini bag was\n\nnot. The clear and logical inference was that Panneer knew at the time of his arrest that\n\nthe SCTS bag had been emptied of the yellow plastic bag and that its contents were already\n\nwith Raja, and that the Brutini bag contained incriminating evidence. There was no\n\nallegation that any of the CNB officers had threatened him in any way.43.    Evidently, the trial judge could not be faulted for deciding that\n\nthe prosecution had succeeded in showing that Panneer had conspired with Raja to traffic\n\nin the drugs and that he had abetted the offence committed by Raja. Although there was no\n\ndirect evidence of the conspiracy, the words and actions of the two men showed that they\n\npursued a common objective and gave rise to the inference that their actions must have\n\nbeen co-ordinated. Their plan was evident from their constant communication on the\n\nafternoon of 1 March 2001 before they were arrested. Both of them played their part in\n\ndelivering the drugs from one place to another.",
        "Conclusion": "44.    As it was not established that the trial judge had erred in\n\nconvicting Raja and Panneer of their respective offences, both their appeals were\n\ndismissed.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeSgd:CHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealSgd:TAN LEE MENGJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
