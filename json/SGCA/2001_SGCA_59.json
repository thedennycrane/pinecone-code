        "The background": "2 Sogo was, until recently, operating a department store at Raffles City. Hinckley was\n\na company which dealt with the import and sales of Polo Ralph Lauren products (RL goods)\n\nconsisting mainly of clothing and assessories.3 Business relationship between Hinckley and Sogo commenced in 1990 when Sogo agreed,\n\nby way of a written agreement dated 1 June 1990, and with effect from the same day, to\n\ngrant Hinckley a concession to carry out retail sales of the RL goods in an area of about\n\n72 m2 in the department store. The initial validity period of the concessionaire agreement\n\nwas for 36 months. By mutual consent, the agreement continued until it was terminated on\n\n31 July 2000.4 Under the concessionaire agreement, payments by purchasers of the RL goods were to be\n\nmade to Sogo's cashiers located all over the store. Sogo was entitled to 20% of the sale\n\nproceeds as its commission which it was authorised to deduct direct from the proceeds of\n\nsale in its hands. As the question to be answered depends very much on what is provided in\n\nthe agreement, we shall set out the pertinent provisions below:-\"5(b) The Concessionaire (Hinckley) shall pay to the Company the sum equivalent to\n\n  20% of the total nett monthly sales. This payment is made through deduction from the\n\n  monies collected for the respective month by the Company, the balance to be payable to the\n\n  Concessionaire within fifteen (15) days of each calendar month.\"\"5(d) The Concessionaire shall receive from the company at the end of each\n\n  calendar month a statement of the total sales for that month which statement shall be\n\n  deemed conclusive.\"\"6 The Concessionaire hereby agrees with the Company as follows:- . . (c) All\n\n  payments made by customers in respect of the goods sold by the Concessionaire shall be\n\n  made direct to the Company's cashiers stationed in the Company's premises.\"5 On 19 July 2000, interim judicial managers were appointed for Sogo. On 18 August\n\n2000, by order of the High Court, Sogo was placed under judicial management.6 In respect of the sales of the RL goods effected during the period May to July 2000,\n\na net sum of $212,212.99 is due to Hinckley, after deducting the commission which Sogo was\n\nentitled to. Notwithstanding a demand made by the solicitors for Hinckley that the sum of\n\n$212,212.99 was and is held by Sogo as its agent and on trust for Hinckley, the judicial\n\nmanagers rejected the assertion of the existence of a trust. The solicitors for the\n\njudicial managers stated that the sum due to Hinckley, being 80% of the sale proceeds, was\n\ntruly a debt owed by Sogo to Hinckley. They asked Hinckley to submit its claim in the\n\nusual manner as an unsecured creditor.7 As Sogo is under judicial management, and unless the judicial managers consented,\n\nleave of court is necessary for Hinckley to commence any proceeding against Sogo: see s\n\n227D(4)(c) of the Companies Act (the Act). Thus, this application for leave. We should\n\nmention that under the Act, even before the making of a judicial management order, but\n\nafter the presentation of a petition for such an order, no proceeding may be taken against\n\na company without leave of court (s 227C[c]).",
        "Principles governing the grant of leave": "8 The English equivalent to s 227C(c) and 227D(4)(c) of our Companies Act are to be\n\nfound in ss 10(1)(c) and 11(3)(d) of the English Insolvency Act 1986. A leading English\n\nauthority on the subject is Re Atlantic Computer Systems plc (No. 1) [1991] BCLC 606,\n\nwhere among the many issues dealt with therein was the question of the object of granting\n\nan \"administration\" order (which in our Act is termed \"judicial\n\nmanagement\" order). The Court there differentiated between the objects of a\n\nwinding-up and an administration order. In the former case, where an insolvent company is\n\nconcerned, the object is to achieve an equal distribution of the company's assets among\n\nthe unsecured creditors. So in respect of a secured creditor, who wishes to enforce his\n\nsecurity, leave would normally be granted. In contrast, an administration is intended only\n\nto be an interim and temporary regime. It is really to provide some breathing space to the\n\ncompany, which is or will be unable to pay its debts and, under the new temporary\n\nmanagement of the administrator, to seek to achieve one or more of the following purposes\n\n(of which our s 227B(1) is in pari materia):-(i) the survival of the company, or the whole or part of its undertaking as a going\n\n  concern;(ii) the approval of a compromise or arrangement between the company and its\n\n  creditors/members;(iii) a more advantageous realisation of the company's assets would be effected than on\n\n  a winding-up.9 Therefore, the effect of the making of an administration order, or in our case a\n\njudicial management order, is that there is a moratorium on the enforcement of debts and\n\nrights, proprietary or otherwise, against the company, so as to give the\n\nadministrators/judicial managers time to formulate proposals and lay them before the\n\ncreditors, and then implement any proposals approved by the creditors. This is why the law\n\nimposes a restraint on the taking of proceedings or levying of execution against a company\n\nwhich is under judicial management. The moratorium is, however, not absolute and is, as\n\nindicated above, subject to the grant of leave by either the judicial managers (after\n\ntheir appointment), or the court.10 In Re Atlantic Computer Systems, Nicholls LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court\n\nof Appeal also made detailed observations on how the discretion of granting leave should\n\nbe exercised. We will only set out hereunder those parts which we think are more germane\n\nto the matter in hand (at 632-634) and, in order to fully appreciate those observations,\n\nit would be necessary that we first set out the provisions of s 227D(4)(c) and (d) [the\n\nEnglish equivalent are in s 11(3)(c) and (d)]:-During the period for which a judicial management order is in force -. . (c) no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process shall be commenced\n\n  or continued and no distress may be levied against the company or its property except with\n\n  the consent of the judicial manager or with leave of the Court and (where the Court gives\n\n  leave) subject to such terms as the Court may impose; and(d) no steps shall be taken to enforce security over the company's property or to\n\n  repossess any goods under any hire-purchase agreement, chattels leasing agreement or\n\n  retention of title agreement except with the consent of the judicial manager or with leave\n\n  of the Court and (where the Court gives leave) subject to such terms as the Court may\n\n  impose.These are, inter alia, the observations of Nicholls LJ:-1. It is in every case for the person who seeks leave to make out a case for him to be\n\n  given leave.2. The prohibition to s 11(3)(c) and (d) is intended to assist the company, under the\n\n  management of the administrator, to achieve the purpose for which the administration order\n\n  was made. If granting leave to a lessor of land or the hirer of goods (a 'lessor') to\n\n  exercise his proprietary rights and repossess his land or goods is unlikely to impede the\n\n  achievement of that purpose, leave should normally be given .…3. In other cases when a lessor seeks possession the court has to carry out a balancing\n\n  exercise, balancing the legitimate interests of the lessor and the legitimate interests of\n\n  the other creditors of the company (see Peter Gibson J in Royal Trust Bank v Buchler\n\n  [1989] BCLC 130 at 135) …..4. In carrying out the balancing exercise great importance, or weight, is normally to\n\n  be given to the proprietary interests of the lessor ….5. Thus it will normally be a sufficient ground for the grant of leave if significant\n\n  loss would be caused to the lessor by a refusal. For this purpose loss comprises any kind\n\n  of financial loss, direct or indirect, including loss by reason of delay, and may extend\n\n  to loss which is not financial. But if substantially greater loss would be caused to\n\n  others by the grant of leave, or loss which is out of all proportion to the benefit which\n\n  leave would confer on the lessor, that may outweigh the loss to the lessor caused by a\n\n  refusal ….12. In some cases there will be a dispute over the existence, validity or nature of the\n\n  security which the applicant is seeking leave to enforce. It is not for the court on the\n\n  leave application to seek to adjudicate upon that issue, unless (as in the present case,\n\n  on the fixed or floating charge point) the issue raises a short point of law which it is\n\n  convenient to determine without further ado. Otherwise the court needs to be satisfied\n\n  only that the applicant has a seriously arguable case.11 Although in the petition for an order for judicial management, it is stated that the\n\npurpose of seeking such an order is to prevent a scramble by creditors for Sogo's assets,\n\nas well as to give Sogo an opportunity to seek buyers for its franchises or retail\n\noperators, before the court below, as well as before us, it was not seriously argued that\n\nthe contemplated proceeding by Hinckley would in any way undermine the objective which the\n\nmaking of the judicial management order was intended to achieve. Indeed, in the meantime\n\non 23 March 2001, an order for the winding up of the company was made. So most of the\n\nconsiderations relating to balancing of interests referred to by Nicholls LJ in Re\n\nAtlantic Computer Systems, which the court should take into account in determining whether\n\nto grant leave, do not arise in our present case.12 The position taken by the judicial managers was and is a straightforward one,\n\nnamely, that Sogo was not holding the sale proceeds of the RL goods in trust for Hinckley\n\nand thus the latter has no proprietary right to those moneys. What Hinckley has is only a\n\nclaim in debt simpliciter. There is no material dispute on facts. The monies collected\n\nfrom the sales of RL goods were never kept separate from the general account of Sogo. They\n\nwere banked, like the sale proceeds of all other goods in the store, into a current\n\naccount maintained with the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) and this account was used\n\nfor all the businesses of Sogo. During the period, May to July 2000, DBS account was\n\nvaccillating between credit and debit.13 In an ordinary case, especially where facts are in dispute, to obtain leave, besides\n\nthe other considerations alluded to by Nicholls LJ, all that the applicant needs to show\n\nis the existence of a seriously arguable case. In Hinckley's Case, it submits that it is\n\nnot for the court to go into the substantive merits at the leave stage. Indeed, this is\n\nthe general position to take in leave applications. However, in a case where the facts are\n\nnot in dispute, like the present, and the issue is a direct point of law, the court would\n\nbe entitled, if it thinks expedient, to proceed to determine the legal issue outright\n\nrather than take the two step-approach, first of granting leave and then making the\n\nsubstantive determination at the next stage.14 In a case such as this, where the point is one of law and where it has been\n\nadequately argued, we do not see why the court may not go into the merits now, rather than\n\nlater, and decide whether in fact there are merits in the legal point. It is highly\n\nunproductive to grant leave first and later having to dismiss the substantive application.\n\nIn an appropriate case, like the present, the court should be entitled to take a robust\n\napproach of telescoping the two steps into one.15 We therefore agree, in the circumstances of this case, that the course taken by the\n\njudge below was appropriate. So for the purposes of this appeal, we will also be going\n\ninto the merits to determine the legal issue outright.",
        "Decision below": "16 In arriving at her decision that Sogo did not hold the sum of $212,212.99 in trust\n\nfor Hinckley, who would not thereby have a proprietary claim to it, the judge below had\n\ntaken into consideration the following factors -(i) Purchasers of the RL goods paid the price of the goods to the cashiers of Sogo\n\n  located throughout the store and such moneys were not kept separately from the moneys of\n\n  Sogo obtained from the sales of the latter's own goods or of other concessionaires.(ii) Sogo was free to intermingle the proceeds from the sale of RL goods with the\n\n  proceeds of sale of their own goods and they were in fact mixed.(iii) The 20% commission due to Sogo from the sales of RL goods was not taken\n\n  immediately out of the money received. Similarly, the 80% of the sale proceeds due to\n\n  Hinckley was not paid to Hinckley from the moneys received from purchasers but an\n\n  equivalent sum of 80% was paid to Hinckley when accounts were settled between Sogo and\n\n  Hinckley monthly, 15 days after the end of each calendar month. There was no settling of\n\n  account at the end of, or soon after, each transaction;(iv) The size of the Sogo department store, the concessionaire agreement being in\n\n  standard form, the variety of merchandize being sold thereat under such an arrangement and\n\n  the very large number of daily transactions. In the light of all that, she held there was\n\n  clearly no intention to create a trust relationship.17 In coming to her conclusion the judge followed the approach adopted in Henry v\n\nHammond [1913] 2 KB 515 and Neste Oy v Lloyds Bank plc [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 658. She also\n\nconsidered and distinguished the case Re Fleet Street Disposal Services Ltd [1995] 1 BCLC\n\n345.",
        "The Law": "18 We now turn to examine the law on the issue raised in Hinckley's application. Like\n\nthe judge below, we will begin with the consideration of Henry v Hammond, where the\n\ndefendant, a shipping agent, was instructed by the plaintiff, who acted on behalf of\n\nforeign insurers, to dispose of the cargo on a vessel which was wrecked off the coast of\n\nKent. The defendant was further instructed to pay all claims and expenses in connection\n\nwith the cargo out of the proceeds of sale. There remained a balance of 96 which the\n\ndefendant did not inform the plaintiff; neither did he pay it over to the plaintiff. Some\n\n30 years later, having discovered this, the plaintiff brought an action to recover it. The\n\ndefendant pleaded limitation. In response, the plaintiff contended that the defendant had\n\nmade himself an express trustee of the sum and that the defence of limitation did not\n\napply. The court held that as this was an ordinary commercial transaction between the\n\nparties, there was no trust. The court also noted that there was no question of\n\nconstructive trust arising in the circumstances. We need only cite the following passage\n\nin the judgment of Channell J where the applicable principle was enunciated (at 521):-\"It is clear that if the terms upon which the person receives the money are that\n\n  he is bound to keep it separate, either in a bank or elsewhere, and to hand that money so\n\n  kept as a separate fund to the person entitled to it, then he is a trustee of that money\n\n  and must hand it over to the person who is his cestui que trust. If on the other hand he\n\n  is not bound to keep the money separate, but is entitled to mix it with his own money and\n\n  deal with it as he pleases, and when called upon to hand over an equivalent sum of money,\n\n  then, in my opinion, he is not a trustee of the money, but merely a debtor.\"\n\n  (Emphasis added).19 Channell J made that pronouncement after having cited what Giffard LJ said in\n\nBurdick v Garrick LR 5 Ch 243 that\"I do not hesitate to say that where the duty of persons is to receive property,\n\n  and to hold it for another, and to keep it until it is called for, they cannot discharge\n\n  themselves from that trust by appealing to the lapse of time. They can only discharge\n\n  themselves by handing over that property to somebody entitled to it.\"20 The approach taken in Henry v Hammond is consistent with that in the earlier case\n\nKirkham v Peel (1880) 43 LT 171 where the defendants, ordinary merchants and commission\n\nagents, would receive goods from the public and sell them on their behalf. There, the\n\ndefendants bartered the plaintiffs' goods for other goods. The plaintiffs' assertion that\n\nthe defendants were either bailees or trustees was rejected. Jessel MR said (at p. 172):-\"No person in their (the defendants') position ever dreamed of keeping separate\n\n  accounts at their bankers, and no consignee of goods ever dreamed of such a thing being\n\n  done. Such an idea, I am sure, was never entertained by anyone.\"21 So even in respect of physical assets placed in the hands of an agent, it does not\n\nfollow that trust would necessarily arise. Much would depend on the reasons why the assets\n\nwere placed with the agent and the nature of the dealings between the parties. 22 On the\n\nauthority of Henry v Hammond, it is clear that where under an arrangement there is no\n\nprohibition against the mixing of funds by the agent, that is a very significant\n\nconsideration in the overall determination of the question whether there is a trust. In\n\nthe absence of an express term creating a trust, the maintenance of a separate account by\n\nthe agent is crucial to constituting the money as trust money: see In Re Nanwa Gold Mines\n\nLtd [1955] 1 WLR 1080 and In re Kayford Ltd [1975] 1 WLR 279. Here we are reminded of the\n\nwords of Slade J in In re Bond Worth Ltd [1980] Ch 228 at 261:-\"… where an alleged trustee has the right to mix tangible assets or moneys\n\n  with his own other assets or moneys and to deal with them as he pleases, this is\n\n  incompatible with the existence of a presently subsisting fiduciary relationship in regard\n\n  to such particular assets or money.\"23 We next turn to the more recent case, Neste Oy v Lloyds Bank plc [1983] 2 Lloyd's\n\nRep 658, where the shipowner-plaintiffs, a Finnish company, which owned three vessels\n\noperating to UK, appointed a company, PSL, as their agents in UK. To enable PSL to perform\n\ntheir functions, (e.g., discharging liabilities incurred by the vessels such as jetty and\n\nriver dues, pilotage, towage, berth fees and other similar expenses), the plaintiffs put\n\nPSL in funds, sometimes in advance and sometimes in reimbursement of expenses already\n\nincurred by PSL in respect of the vessels. The funds were paid into the main account of\n\nPSL held at Lloyds Bank. The plaintiffs also paid PSL an agency fee. PSL got into\n\nfinancial difficulties and a receiver was appointed. Lloyds Bank exercised its right of\n\nset-off between PSL's accounts which were in credit and those which were in debit. Bingham\n\nJ (as he then was) affirmed the dictum of Channell J which we have quoted above (18).\n\nExcept for one payment, which was received by PSL after it was resolved that PSL should\n\nimmediately cease trading, the court held that the other five payments were not moneys\n\nheld on trust. The judge identified the following features, among others, which led him to\n\nthat conclusion:-(i) The payments were made into a PSL account which gave no indication whatsoever that\n\n  it was a trust or owner's account.(ii) It was not shown that it was intended that the sums received should be kept\n\n  separate;(iii) In asking for the funds, no indication was given that PSL would hold them\n\n  \"on the plaintiffs' behalf or to their account or to their order.\"(iv) There were occasions when PSL made disbursements on the plaintiffs' behalf even\n\n  when inadequately funded.(v) There was nothing in the arrangement to show that the funds should only be applied\n\n  for specified purposes, and if not so applied, would be returned.24 In Re Holiday Promotions (Europe) Ltd [1996] 2 BCLC 618, the importance of the\n\nrequirement that moneys collected on behalf of a principal should be segregated from the\n\nmoneys of the agent was again emphasised in determining whether these moneys were held on\n\ntrust for the principal. In that case, the company received from its numerous customers a\n\nrefundable deposit of 150 each which it banked into two accounts maintained with Lloyds\n\nBank. The court found that the deposits were mixed with the company's money in the two\n\naccounts and the company had used moneys in the accounts for its general purposes and\n\nthere was nothing in the agreement which prevented the funds from forming part of the\n\ngeneral assets of the company. There was, accordingly, no trust relationship between the\n\ncustomers and the company. The Deputy Judge (Timothy Lloyd QC) said (at p. 624):-\"I cannot accept that the terms of the contract carry an implication that the\n\n  deposit was to be kept separate. It is not a necessary implication from the express terms\n\n  of the contract. As a matter of language the term is equally consistent with a mere\n\n  debtor/creditor relationship and it seems to me that business efficacy does not require\n\n  any more than a mere contractual relationship. Nor does it seem to me that such an implied\n\n  term would pass the officious by-stander test. It may be that a depositor would have said,\n\n  oh yes, I assume that the deposit will be kept separate. But I cannot believe that the\n\n  company would have said that or accepted it.\"25 Henry v Hammond was endorsed in Australia in Walker v Corboy [1990] 19 NSWLR 382, a\n\ndecision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. There an agent selling the produce of\n\nfruit and vegetable growers went into liquidation. The growers claimed that the proceeds\n\nof sale of their produce were held by the agent in trust for them. The Court held that in\n\nthe absence of any contrary express or imputed intention of the parties, and having regard\n\nto the complex and multiple transactions, the agent was not holding the proceeds in trust\n\nfor the growers; the proper relationship between them was that of debtor and creditors.26 We now turn to Re Fleet Disposal Services Ltd [1995] 1 BCLC 345, a case which the\n\njudge below distinguished. The facts there were rather special. The company acted as a\n\nselling agent for major car leasing companies. The arrangement with one of the leasing\n\ncompanies (Nortel) was that the company would pay the proceeds of sale into a designated\n\nbank account and remit the proceeds less commission and costs within five days of receipt,\n\nall repayments to be by separate cheques. The company went into liquidation. There was a\n\ncredit in the designated account. But it must be pointed out that not only moneys from\n\nsales of the Nortel cars were paid into the designated account, moneys of other principals\n\nof the company were also paid into it (but those principals conceded that no trust existed\n\nin their case). Lightman J, while noting the general disinclination of the court to import\n\ntrust law into everyday commercial transaction, found in the circumstances present in the\n\ncase that the proceeds of sale of Nortel's car were held in trust for Nortel.27 Two factors seemed to play a key consideration in Lightman J's evaluation:(i) the proceeds were paid into a designated account;(ii) the company was to pay out the proceeds, less commission, within five days of each\n\n  sale by separate cheque. Lightman J also said the fact that the proceeds of sale of\n\n  Nortel's cars were also mixed with proceeds of sale of other principal's cars, while a\n\n  factor to be taken into account, was not a bar to the existence of a proprietary claim.\n\n  Nevertheless, it can be seen that there are clear distinguishing features in Re Fleet\n\n  Disposal Services which are not present in the instant case.28 Hinckley also relied upon certain opinion of Watkins LJ expressed in R v Clowes\n\n& Anor (No 2) [1994] 2 All ER 316 at 325:- \"As to segregation of funds, the\n\neffect of the authorities seems to be that a requirement to keep moneys separate is\n\nnormally an indicator that they are impressed with a trust, and that the absence of such a\n\nrequirement, if there are no other indicators of a trust, normally negatives it. The fact\n\nthat a transaction contemplates the mingling of funds is, therefore, not necessarily fatal\n\nto a trust.\"29 This statement of the law is not really in dispute. Watkins LJ in fact endorsed the\n\npropositions made in Henry v Hammond and Neste Oy v Lloyds Bank plc. The question in each\n\ncase is, where there is no requirement that the funds be kept separate, whether there are\n\nother indicators of a trust. Unless there are such other indicators, it would follow that\n\nthere would be no trust.30 There is a Malaysian case, which on the facts are very similar to the instant case,\n\nas it also involved a claim by concessionaires against a chain of department stores: Geh\n\nCheng Hooi & Ors v Equipment Dynomics Sdn Bhd and other appeals[1991] 1 MLJ 293.\n\nThere, payment for sales effected by the concessionaire was made to the department stores\n\ncash registers. The total amount collected for each concessionaire, less the rental and\n\ncommission, was to be reimbursed to the concessionaires at fixed periods of time. Because\n\nof the financial difficulties of the stores, some of the concessionaires sought an\n\namendment to the arrangement, and under the changed arrangement, it was provided\n\nspecifically that the stores would hold the moneys collected from the sale of the\n\nconcessionaires' goods in trust for those concessionaires. But such a clause was not\n\ninserted in all the concession agreements. At the High Court, the judge held that the\n\nmoneys received by the stores from purchasers of concessionaires' goods were trust moneys,\n\neven though the moneys were to be banked, and were so banked, into a common account of the\n\nstores. He found, on the facts, as well as from the conduct of the parties, that there was\n\nan implied trust clause. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision that a trust\n\ncould be so implied.31 Interestingly, this Malaysian case is not cited in Hinckley's Case. It seems to us\n\nclear that there are distinguishing features there. The new arrangement was negotiated\n\nbecause of the company's financial problems and under that new arrangement, the stores\n\nexpressly held themselves out as trustees of the proceeds. While some of the renegotiated\n\narrangements did not contain an express provision on trust, in all the circumstances, it\n\nwould probably be correct to imply such a trust clause, notwithstanding the absence of\n\nsuch an express clause in those arrangements.32 The basic arguments of Hinckley boil down to this. The RL goods on display at the\n\nstore belonged to them. On sale to a customer, it must follow that the money collected\n\nfrom the customer must also be held in trust by Sogo for Hinckley. There was no sale by\n\nHinckley to Sogo and subsequently resale by Sogo to each customer. Sogo was purely the\n\nagent for Hinckley for collecting the sale proceeds. What was set out in the\n\nconcessionaire agreement was an obligation on the part of Sogo to account to Hinckley for\n\nthe proceeds. Hinckley submitted that it is the duty of an agent, where he holds assets or\n\nmoneys of his principal, to keep them separate from his own and those of other persons.\n\nWhere this is not expressly stated, it is to be implied by law.33 The ultimate question to decide is whether, in the light of the terms of the\n\nagreement, as exemplified by the actual arrangement, there was an intention to create a\n\ntrust. No general rule may be laid down in this regard. In a case where there is no\n\nexpress term in the agreement on the question of trust, whether the equitable rules would\n\nbe implied would depend upon what may correctly be inferred to be the expectations of the\n\nparties in the light of the commercial context. Admittedly, very often in the factual\n\ncircumstances of a case, the answer is not an easy one. But it is not correct to say, as\n\nHinckley does, that an agent who holds money of the principal is automatically under a\n\nduty to segregate those moneys from those of his own. This assertion is not the answer; it\n\nonly begs the question.34 However, what the cases show is that although a trust is more readily imposed on\n\nproceeds arising from an isolated transaction, the position may not be the same where\n\nproperty is received in the ordinary course of an ongoing trading relationship: Palette\n\nShoes Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Krohn [1937] 58 CLR 1 at 30 and Walker v Corboy (supra)\n\nat 390 and 396-7.35 We would mention that in a case such as this, the question is not whether there is a\n\nconstructive trust, but whether in the light of all the circumstances a trust may be\n\ninferred or imputed. Constructive trust is one which arises by operation of law and not by\n\nreason of the intention of the parties, express or implied. It was suggested that the\n\nconcept of constructive trust may be invoked whenever justice and good conscience required\n\nit: see Hussey v Palmer [1972] 1 WLR 1286 at 1290 per Lord Denning MR. In Carl-Zeiss\n\nStiftung v Smith (Herbert) & Co (No 2) [1969] 2 Ch 276, Edmund Davies LJ, after noting\n\nthat it was not possible to give an exhaustive definition of a constructive trust, said\n\n(at p.200) that this was so as \"not to restrict the court by technicalities in\n\ndeciding what the justice of a particular case may demand.\"",
        "Our decision": "36 Reverting to the case in hand, it would be useful to recap the essential elements of\n\nthe arrangement. Until sale, the RL goods belonged to Hinckley. Upon sale, the proceeds\n\nwere collected by the cashiers of Sogo and they were banked into the general account of\n\nSogo where they were mixed with other moneys of the latter. Accounting between the parties\n\nwas only done monthly, and settlement effected within 15 days after the end of each\n\ncalendar month. The equivalent of 80% of the sale proceeds of RL goods would then be paid\n\nover to Hinckley. The concessionaire agreement did not provide that payment of the RL\n\ngoods could only be made at a specified cashier or specified cashiers at the store. It\n\nalso did not provide that such proceeds should be paid into a specified account of Sogo.\n\nNeither did it provide that the proceeds should not be mixed with other moneys belonging\n\nto Sogo or other concessionaires operating in the store. All that the agreement provided\n\nwas that within 15 days after the end of each calendar month, Sogo should pay over to\n\nHinckley 80% of the total proceeds of sale collected in the preceding month. There is no\n\nsuggestion that the actual arrangement was in any way at variance with the express terms\n\nof the agreement.37 True, the concessionaire agreement did not expressly provide or authorise Sogo to\n\nuse the proceeds of sale of Hinckley for Sogo's own purposes. But this is neither here nor\n\nthere. This fact could also be relied upon to argue for the reverse proposition. If that\n\nwas what Hinckley intended, why did Hinckley not insist that there be a separate account\n\ninto which proceeds of sale of RL goods would be paid? After all, with modern technology,\n\nat the press of a button, the sale proceeds each day of RL goods could be readily\n\nobtained.38 An important indicia to indicate trust is undoubtedly the fact that the money is\n\nbeing kept separately. This was alluded to as early as 1890 by the House of Lords in Lyell\n\nv Kennedy (1890) 62 LT 77 at 81 where the Earl of Selborne, delivering the judgment of the\n\nHouse, observed:-\"A man who receives the money of another on his behalf, and places it specifically\n\n  to an account with a banker earmarked and separate from his own moneys, though under his\n\n  control, is in my opinion a trustee of the fund standing to the credit of that account.\n\n  For the constitution of such a trust no express words are necessary; anything which may\n\n  satisfy a court of equity that the money was received in a fiduciary character is enough.\n\n  It is not requisite that any acknowledgement of such a trust should be made to the cestui\n\n  que trust or his agent: to whomsoever made, it is evidence against the trustee.\"39 We must, however, hasten to add that where there are clear indices of a trust, or\n\nwhere the express provisions create a trust, the fact that the trustees are allowed to or\n\nnot expressly prohibited from mixing trust funds with their own, cannot render the funds,\n\nwhich are subject to a trust, any less a trust. As stated by Megarry J in Re Kayford\n\n(supra) at 607:- \"Payment into a separate bank account is a useful (though by no\n\nmeans conclusive) indication of an intention to create a trust, but of course there is\n\nnothing to prevent the company from binding itself by a trust even if there are no\n\neffective banking arrangements.\"40 What is essential to bear in mind is that this was a business arrangement, initially\n\nfor a period of three years. The parties would have realised that it would involve the\n\nsales of a huge number of items of RL goods. It would be wholly unrealistic to suggest\n\nthat the parties expected a trust to arise in relation to the sum received in respect of\n\neach item of goods. The commercial context would militate against any such imputation or\n\ninference of a trust. Furthermore, at the time, there were many concessionaires operating\n\nwithin the department store. That may explain why sales proceeds were credited into a\n\ngeneral account of Sogo and accounting was done once every month.",
        "Judgment": "41 In the result, we hold that no trust may be implied in the contractual arrangement\n\nentered into between Hinckley and Sogo. What Hinckley has is a simple claim in debt\n\nagainst Sogo. For that, Hinckley has to lodge its proof of debt in the usual way.\n\nTherefore, there is no reason whatsoever to grant leave to Hinckley to pursue its claim in\n\ntrust any further. 42 The appeal is dismissed with costs. The security for costs, together\n\nwith any accrued interest, shall be paid out to the respondent (Sogo) to account of the\n\nlatter's costs.L P THEANCHAO HICK TINJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGE OF APPEALSINGAPOREDATE: 11 SEPTEMBER 2001Copyright © Government of Singapore."
