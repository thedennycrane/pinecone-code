        "Costs": "We now come to the question of costs. First, the costs below. We set aside the order as to costs made at the conclusion of the trial. The plaintiffs abandoned their claim of passing off four months before the commencement of the trial, and they should bear the costs occasioned by this claim. We so order. Next, ABB`s claim was dismissed, and the question is whether in this case there should be an order against them for payment of any costs as a result of such dismissal. We think not. The dismissal of ABB`s claim was consequent on the finding that Hunter are the proprietors of the design. There was no separate issue raised as a result of ABB being joined as the co-plaintiff of Hunter, and their joinder did not result in any additional costs to Soundtex in pursuing their defence or counterclaim against Hunter. In the circumstances, we make no order as to costs against ABB. Subject to the order as to costs occasioned by the abandonment of the claim of passing off, we order Soundtex to pay Hunter the costs of the claim and counterclaim.Next, we turn to the costs of the appeals. Although Hunter and ABB are the appellants in CA 80/99 and the respondents in CA 82/99, the real contest was between Hunter and Soundtex, and none of the orders we have made concerned ABB. We do not think it is appropriate to make an order as to costs in favour of ABB. We order Soundtex to pay Hunter the costs of the appeals. The deposit in court as security for costs in CA 80/99 is to be refunded to the appellants or their solicitors, and the deposit as security for costs in CA 82/99 be paid to Hunter or their solicitors to account of costs.Outcome:Order accordingly.Copyright Â© Government of Singapore."
