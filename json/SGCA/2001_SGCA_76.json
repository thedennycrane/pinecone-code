        "Facts": "2.    The facts giving rise to this appeal are briefly these.\n\nNancy is a senior manager in charge of corporate affairs of a large development and holding company\n\nin Singapore. She holds a degree of Bachelor of Science (Estate Management) from the National\n\nUniversity of Singapore. Nancy was married to Gary in 1991, but they had ceased to live as husband\n\nand wife since 1995.3.    Shee Chin is Nancys elder brother and is a businessman.\n\nHe holds a degree of Master of Business Administration. Until 1998, he ran the businesses of two\n\ncompanies, Oriental Sincere Printing Ltd, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, and Panasia Holdings\n\nLtd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Both companies unfortunately suffered\n\nconsiderable losses during the economic crisis in 1998, and were forced out of their businesses.4.     Gary\n\nwas employed by BNP from 23 May 1988 as an organization and method officer, and in 1994 was\n\ntransferred to BNPs Private Banking Department, holding the position of an Assistant\n\nVice-President. He retained that position until he was dismissed for his role in the disputed\n\ntransactions.",
        "Share transactions in Shee Chins account": "5.     Shee\n\nChin first became a customer of BNP on 9 May 1994, when he opened a Singapore dollar current account\n\n(Account No. 1) with BNP through Gary. In November 1994, Shee Chin applied for and was granted\n\noverdraft facilities up to S$123,000 to finance the activities of his companies, which were secured\n\nby his fixed deposit of S$250,000. On 16 April 1996, he opened a nominee account with BNP nominee\n\ncompany (BNP Nominees) for the purpose of his share transactions and another Singapore dollar\n\ncurrent account (Account No. 2) for the purpose of settling his share transactions. A\n\nMalaysian Ringgit current account (MYR Account) was also opened on the same day in Shee Chins\n\nname by Gary for the purpose of settling the share transactions. One month later, in May 1996, Shee\n\nChin deposited 50,000 shares in United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOB) with BNP as security for his\n\naccounts.6.    Following the opening of these accounts, between April and\n\nJuly 1996 numerous share purchases were made by Gary in Shee Chins nominee account. These\n\npurchases were paid for by debiting the requisite sums to Shee Chins MYR current account, which\n\neventually resulted in the account being overdrawn. Debit advices and acknowledgements of shares\n\nheld by BNP Nominees for each share transaction were sent to Shee Chins residence at Toh Tuck\n\nPlace. On 10 June 1996, a loan of S$238,000 was drawn down in Shee Chins name in Account No. 1 to\n\nrepay the overdrafts in Account No. 2 and the MYR account.7.    According to Shee Chin, upon checking the statements sent to\n\nhim by BNP, he discovered in July 1996 that Gary had entered into various share transactions in his\n\nname without his authorization. He therefore confronted Gary on these transactions and Gary assured\n\nhim that he would sell the shares purchased and cease to enter into further unauthorised\n\ntransactions. Notwithstanding that, Gary continued to enter into further share transactions in Shee\n\nChins name. In respect of these further share transactions, credit or debit advices, as the case\n\nmay be, for each transaction were sent to Shee Chin at his address in Toh Tuck Place by BNP. In the\n\ncase of share purchases, acknowledgements of the shares purchased by BNP Nominees were sent to Shee\n\nChin by BNP. Shee Chin did not disclaim any of these transactions or make any complaint to BNP about\n\nthem.8.     On\n\n26 December 1996, Nancy opened a Singapore dollar current accountwith BNP. Her purpose of opening the account was to use it to\n\nsecure the account of Shee Chin with BNP. Hence, on the same day, Nancy also signed a memorandum of\n\ncharge/deposit of securities as security for the account of Shee Chin. No securities, however, were\n\nthen deposited with BNP pursuant to the memorandum9.     On\n\nApril 1997, BNP made a margin call on Shee Chin by a letter stating that the amount of the loan\n\ndrawn down on his overdraft account had gone up to 90% of the market value of the deposited shares,\n\nand requiring him to regularise his position by either reducing the outstanding amount owing to 60%\n\nof the market value of the shares or depositing additional shares. Shee Chin claimed that as a\n\nresult of this letter he discovered that Gary had continued to trade in shares in his name without\n\nhis authorization. According to Shee Chin, when he confronted Gary the latter assured him once again\n\nthat the unauthorised trading would cease and that he would sell off the shares. No complaint or\n\nprotest, however, was made by Shee Chin to BNP. Instead, Shee Chin complied with the margin\n\nrequirements by depositing further 219,613 UOB shares with BNP. On 29 April 1997, Nancy also in\n\nresponse to the margin call deposited 10,000 shares in United Industrial Corporation Ltd (UIC)\n\nand 55,588 UOB shares with BNP to secure Shee Chins account.10.    As a result of the transactions entered into by Gary in\n\nShee Chins account, the latters MYR account went into overdraft. On 26 May 1997, a loan in the\n\nsum of MYR3,965,351.23 was obtained by Gary in Shee Chins name to repay the overdraft, thus\n\nregularising the MYR account. Credit and debit advices relating to this loan were sent by BNP to\n\nShee Chin. No complaint or query was forthcoming from Shee Chin to BNP. Shee Chins MYR account\n\nwent into overdraft yet again in June 1997 as a result of interest adjustments, and a further loan\n\nof MYR73,740 was obtained by Gary in Shee Chins name to repay the overdraft and regularise the\n\naccount. Credit and debit advices relating to this loan were sent to Shee Chin by BNP. Again, Shee\n\nChin did not disclaim the transactions or complain about any of the credit and debit advices.11.    On 26 June 1997, these two MYR loans were converted into a\n\nloan in Swiss Franc (CHF) in the sum of CHF2,316,406.15 by Gary who subsequently converted the\n\nCHF loan into Malaysia Ringgit in the sum of MYR5,051,571.84. Confirmations of these two foreign\n\nexchange conversions were sent to Shee Chin by BNP. Again, no complaint or protest was made by Shee\n\nChin about these transactions.12.    Further share transactions were entered into by Gary in\n\nShee Chins account from July 1997. In addition to the monthly statements, credit or debit advice\n\nfor each transaction, as the case may be, were sent to Shee Chin by BNP. In the case of share\n\npurchases, acknowledgements of the share purchased by BNP Nominees were also sent to Shee Chin by\n\nBNP. No query, protest or complaint was made by Shee Chin. Nor was any intimation given by him to\n\nBNP that any of these transactions was unauthorised.13.     On\n\n10 July 1997, Gary put up a credit proposal for Shee Chin to BNP proposing, inter alia, an increase\n\nof the short term loan/overdraft facility to US$2,000,000. That proposal was approved and on 13\n\nAugust 1997, BNP wrote to Shee Chin a letter offering certain facilities for general investment\n\npurposes acceptable to BNP, and that letter appeared to have been sent by registered post to his\n\naddress at Toh Tuck Place. Shee Chin himself accepted the proposal: he signed the acceptance on 20\n\nOctober 1997 and returned it to BNP. As of that date, the outstanding amount of the short term\n\nloan/overdraft facility owing to BNP in Shee Chins account was US$1,792,000.14.     On\n\n22 October 1997, the loan of S$238,000 taken in June 1996 together with interest was converted by\n\nGary into a MYR loan amounting to MYR538,204.04. On 22 January 1998, Gary repaid this loan of\n\nMYR538,204.04 and the other loan of MYR5,051,571.84 by drawing down two further loans of\n\nMYR2,500,000 and MYR2,812,767.76 in Shee Chins name. Confirmation of these transactions were sent\n\nto Shee Chin, who raised no complaint about them. Then in July 1998, these two loans were merged and\n\nconverted by Gary into a loan in Japanese Yen yielding a total sum of 169,307,681. This loan was\n\nrepaid on 2 October 1998 by a drawdown of two new Japanese Yen loans, one in the sum of\n\n100,000,000 and the other in the sum of 60,000,000. The credit and debit advices of all these\n\ntransactions as well as the confirmations of these foreign conversions loans were sent to Shee Chin\n\nby BNP, and again no query or complaint was made by Shee Chin to BNP at any one time.15.    As of 31 March 1999, the outstanding amount on the short\n\nterm loan/overdraft facility comprising the two loans denominated in Japanese Yen plus the interest\n\namounted to a total sum of 161,033,593, which BNP is now claiming from Shee Chin. It is not\n\ndisputed that this balance in Shee Chins account arose largely as a result of the share\n\ntransactions and foreign exchange transactions. Shee Chin claims that these transactions were\n\nentered into by Gary solely for his own benefit and account and without Shee Chins authorization.Forex transactions16.    We now turn to the trading in foreign exchange (forex)\n\ntransactions. The account for trading in forex transactions was opened by Gary in Shee Chins name\n\nin or around April 1998. The form for such account was signed by Gary on Shee Chins behalf. There\n\nwas no evidence that it was opened with the express authority of Shee Chin, verbal or in writing, or\n\nwith his consent or knowledge. After the account was opened, Gary used the account for dealing in\n\nforex transactions. Again, there was no evidence that Shee Chin expressly authorised such\n\ntransactions, verbally or in writing. The forex transactions started in February 1998  even\n\nbefore the account was opened  and continued to early October 1998.17.    Similarly, Gary opened an account in Nancys name to\n\ntrade in forex transactions. The account was opened also in or around April 1998. The form for such\n\naccount was signed by Gary on her behalf. There was also no evidence that Nancy had expressly\n\nauthorised the opening of this account, verbally or in writing; nor was there any evidence that she\n\nhad any knowledge or had given her consent to such account being opened in her name. Gary used this\n\naccount to carry out forex transactions. Here again, there was no evidence of any express\n\nauthorization for such transactions by Nancy. Such forex transactions started in April 1998 and\n\ncontinued to early October 1998.18.    Thus, both Shee Chins and Nancys accounts to trade in\n\nforex transactions were opened by Gary in their respective individual names without any express\n\nauthorization from them. Gary was able to do this, because BNPs procedure allowed existing\n\ncustomers to open additional accounts on the basis that they had signed the initial account opening\n\nform. Gary represented to BNPs officers that Shee Chin and Nancy had given instructions to open\n\nthe forex trading accounts. All the forex transactions in their accounts were conducted by Gary.19.    \n\nAfter each forex transaction was made, BNP sent to Shee Chin and Nancy respectively confirmations of\n\nsuch transactions as well as confirmations for offsetting transactions, where applicable. Profits or\n\nlosses from these transactions were also credited or debited, as the case may be, to the relevant\n\ncurrent accounts and reflected in the monthly current account statements sent to the Shee Chin and\n\nNancy respectively. None of these confirmations, advices and statements were queried or protested by\n\nShee Chin or Nancy. During the period between April and October 1998, there were instances when Gary\n\nreported to them over the telephone of the profits he made from the forex trading in their\n\nrespective accounts. In the case of the profits made in Shee Chins account, they were used to\n\nreduce the amounts he owed to BNP. In one of the conversation Gary told Shee Chin that he (Shee\n\nChin) had to sign a written confirmation of two forex contracts as well as a risk disclosure\n\nstatement. These documents were sent to him, and he duly signed and returned them to BNP. In the\n\ncase of the profits made in Nancys account, they were transferred out from her account mainly to\n\nShee Chins account, which were then used to reduce the amount owing to BNP. The instructions for\n\nthe transfers drafted by Gary were faxed to her for signing; she signed them and sent them by fax to\n\nBNP.",
        "The disputed forex transactions": "20.    In October Gary entered into large forex transactions\n\namounting to some US$9m in the names of Shee Chin, Nancy and two other parties. Like the previous\n\ntransactions, Gary did these without any express authorization of Shee Chin and Nancy respectively,\n\nno doubt thinking that it was a good opportunity for him to recoup the losses sustained in their\n\naccounts. Instead, heavy losses were incurred, resulting in BNP closing all positions taken out by\n\nGary in their respective names. This resulted in net losses of 90,662,000 and 32,365,000 in Shee\n\nChins and Nancys accounts respectively, which are now the subjects of the claim. Shee Chin and\n\nNancy were each advised of this by BNP and were required to meet the claims. Both Shee Chin and\n\nNancy declined and claimed that Gary entered into the transactions without their authorization, and\n\nthat they were not aware of these transactions entered into in their names, until Gary informed them\n\non 8 October 1998. On 14 October 1998, Shee Chin faxed a letter to BNP saying that the transactions\n\nwere entered into by Gary without his authority. Similarly, on 15 October 1998, Nancy faxed a letter\n\nto BNP informing BNP that she was not aware that Gary had entered into the transactions in her name,\n\nand that she had not authorised him to do so. Two days later, she lodged a police report.21.    \n\nFollowing investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), Gary was charged with the\n\noffences under the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289) and Futures Trading Act (Cap 116). On 8 July\n\n1999, Gary pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months.\n\nIn pleading guilty to the charges, Gary admitted in court, inter alia, that he entered into the\n\ntransactions in the names of Nancy and Shee Chin without their authorization.",
        "Proceedings below": "22 BNP initiated proceedings against, inter alios, Shee Chin and Nancy, claiming:(a) from Shee Chin (i) a sum of 161,033,593 being the amount owing on the\n\n  short term loan/overdraft facility extended to him, and (ii) a sum of 90,662,000 being the loss\n\n  incurred in the forex transactions in October 1998; and(b) from Nancy a sum of 32,365,000 being the loss incurred in the forex\n\n  transactions in October 1998.BNP claimed that Shee Chin and Nancy had given authority to Gary to enter into\n\nthe forex transactions, and that Shee Chin had done so with respect to his share transactions.\n\nAlternatively, the bank claimed that they had by their respective conduct and actions ratified the\n\nunauthorised transactions. In the further alternative, the bank claimed that both of them were\n\nestopped from denying that the transactions were not authorised by them. In the event that the\n\ntransactions were held to be unauthorised, BNP claimed the following: (i) that Shee Chin and Nancy\n\nhad dishonestly assisted Gary in committing breaches of fiduciary duties to BNP or had been\n\naccessory to such breaches of fiduciary duties; (ii) that they wrongfully induced or procured Gary\n\nto commit a breach of his employment contract with BNP; and (iii) that Shee Chin and Nancy conspired\n\nwith Gary to injure BNP by unlawful means.23.     The\n\nclaims were resisted by Shee Chin and Nancy. Their main defence was that that they were not aware of\n\nthe transactions carried out by Gary and did not authorise Gary to carry out those transactions.\n\nThey denied that they dishonestly assisted Gary in committing breaches of fiduciary duties to BNP.\n\nThey contended that it was Garys rogue trading activities and a series of control weakness\n\nand judgmental failures at various levels of BNP`s management, which were the primary causes of\n\nBNP`s losses arising from the unauthorised transactions carried out by Gary.",
        "The Appeal": "24.    The main issues raised in this appeal are as follows:(a) whether Shee Chin and Nancy (the respondents) knew that Gary was\n\n  entering into the transactions that were entered in their respective accounts;(b) whether the respondents had given authority in any way to Gary to enter\n\n  into the forex transactions in their names and for their accounts respectively, and whether Shee\n\n  Chin had done so with respect to his share transactions;(c) if the transactions were unauthorised, whether the respondents had by their\n\n  conduct and actions ratified the unauthorised transactions;(d) whether, in the circumstances of the case, the respondents are in any event\n\n  estopped from denying that Gary had no authority to enter into the transactions for them in their\n\n  names; and(e) if the transactions were unauthorised, whether the respondents had\n\n  dishonestly assisted Gary in committing breaches of fiduciary duties to BNP.25.    The first issue is crucial in this appeal. Before the trial\n\njudge, both the respondents testified that they were unaware that Gary was carrying out the\n\ntransactions in their names and for their accounts, as they trusted Gary completely with the\n\nhandling of their accounts, and that they were manipulated and deceived by Gary. The judge accepted\n\ntheir evidence and made findings in their favour. These findings are challenged before us.",
        "Shee Chins knowledge of the share transactions": "26.    We turn first to consider the evidence relating to Shee\n\nChins knowledge of the share transactions carried out by Gary in his name and for his account.\n\nThere is no dispute that in April 1996, Shee Chin opened an account with BNP Nominees for his share\n\ntransactions and a Singapore dollar current account for the purpose of settling his share\n\ntransactions. The MYR Account was also opened on the same day for the purpose of settling the share\n\ntransactions. One month after these accounts were opened, Shee Chin deposited 50,000 UOB shares with\n\nBNP as security for his accounts.27.    Following the opening of these accounts, numerous share\n\npurchases were made by Gary in Shee Chins name and for his account. Debit advices and\n\nacknowledgements of shares held by BNP Nominees for each share transaction were sent to Shee Chins\n\nresidence at Toh Tuck Place. These purchases were paid by debiting the requisite sums to Shee Chins\n\nMYR current account, which eventually resulted in the account being overdrawn. On 10 June 1996, a\n\nloan of S$238,000 was drawn down in Shee Chins name to repay the overdrafts in Account No. 2 and\n\nthe MYR Account. According to Shee Chin, in July 1996, upon checking the statements sent to him by\n\nBNP, he discovered that Gary had entered into various share transactions in his name without his\n\nauthorization. He said that, upon such discovery, he confronted Gary with respect to these\n\ntransactions, and Gary then assured him that he would sell the shares purchased and cease to enter\n\ninto further unauthorised transactions. Upon this assurance being given, Shee Chin did not proceed\n\nfurther, such as reporting or complaining to BNP of the unauthorised dealings by Gary, for fear that\n\nGary might lose his job.28.    It seems to us that, if indeed Gary had given such\n\nassurance, he certainly did not abide by it, for he continued to enter into share transactions in\n\nShee Chins name and for his account. Credit or debit advices, as the case may be, for these\n\ntransactions and also monthly statements of Shee Chins accounts continued to be sent by BNP to\n\nShee Chin at his residence at Toh Tuck Place. In the case of share purchases, acknowledgements of\n\nthe share purchased by BNP Nominees were also sent to Shee Chin by BNP. Shee Chin on his part took\n\nno action to stop Gary from so doing; nor did he complain or report to BNP that the transactions\n\nwere unauthorised. In fact, he did not at any time disclaim any of these transactions or make any\n\nobjection or complaint to BNP about them.29.     On\n\n10 July 1997, to regularise Shee Chins accounts with BNP, Gary put up a proposal for short term\n\nloan/overdraft facility in the aggregate sum of US$2,000,000, which was approved by BNP, and the\n\nproposal was later sent to Shee Chin by registered mail. He must have received it soon thereafter,\n\nbut he did not respond to it promptly. Only on 20 October 1997 did he sign the acceptance and return\n\nit to BNP, at which time the amount of loans drawn down in his account was US$1,792,000.30.    It seems to us that by then Shee Chin must have known the\n\nextent of his liabilities to BNP. Unless he had been turning a blind eye to the voluminous\n\ncontemporaneous documents, such as credit and debit advices, acknowledgments of shares, and monthly\n\nstatements of his accounts, sent to him by BNP, he must have known that innumerable share dealings\n\nhad been transacted by Gary in his name and for his account. He must have known also roughly the\n\namount of loss he had sustained and the extent of his liabilities to BNP. The volume of share\n\ntransactions entered into was certainly not insignificant. Between 17 April 1996 and 9 January 1998,\n\nthere was a total of 116 share purchases and 120 share sales done in his account with BNP. From the\n\nevents that unfolded, the clear inference is that Shee Chin knew that these share transactions were\n\ncarried out by Gary in his name and for his account. The conclusion is irresistible that he allowed\n\nGary to carry out, and to continue to carry out, the share transactions in his name and for his\n\naccount. It appears to us that he was content to leave it entirely to Gary to handle his account at\n\nGarys discretion.",
        "Shee Chins knowledge of the forex transactions": "31.    We now turn to the forex account of Shee Chin. The account\n\nwas opened by Gary in Shee Chins name. Shee Chin did not have any personal involvement in the\n\nopening of the account, such as signing any form of authorization or instruction. There was no\n\nevidence that Shee Chin expressly authorised Gary to open the account, whether verbally or in\n\nwriting. Nor was there any evidence that it was opened with his consent or knowledge.32.    After the account was opened, Gary used it for entering\n\ninto forex transactions. After each forex transaction, a written confirmation of the transaction and\n\noff-setting transaction, where applicable, was sent to Shee Chin. Profits or losses from these\n\ntransaction were credited or debited to the account, as the case may be, and credit and debit\n\nadvices were sent to him. In addition, monthly statements of the account were also sent to him. None\n\nof these documents, namely, the confirmations, credit and debit advices and monthly statements, were\n\nqueried by Shee Chin in any way. The forex transactions in his account started in February 1998 or\n\nthereabouts and continued until October 1998. Throughout this period, no disclaimer of any of the\n\ntransactions was made by Shee Chin; nor did he raise any query or make any complaint or protest in\n\nrespect of any of the transactions either to Gary or to BNP.33.    In the face of what had transpired, it is difficult to\n\naccept that Shee Chin did not know that Gary had carried out the forex transactions in his name and\n\nfor his account. There were a couple of instances of telephone conversation between him and Gary\n\nwhich were recorded by BNP and which showed that he was informed by Gary of the forex transactions\n\nthat the latter had transacted, and that he condoned and approved what Gary had done.",
        "Telephone conversation": "34.     The\n\ntelephone conversations between Gary and Shee Chin were recorded and the relevant transcripts were\n\nproduced at the trial and were admitted in evidence. We now turn to the material transcripts of\n\nthese conversations. On 5 March 1998, there was a long telephone conversation between Gary and Shee\n\nChin and the material part of the transcript reads as follows:Gary : Aiyah  ok, soeh can I just erererlet you know ah, that\n\n  erm, you see, what  what happened was ah, did some erspeculative foreign exchange, ahShee Chin : AhGary : weweforfor your account ahShee Chin : AhGary: Ok, at the end of it ah, there is a net profit ah, of about ninety two erthousand\n\n  Ringgit lahGary : Ok? Now, er  but the prob  the thing is er you did not\n\n  previously have lines ah?Shee Chin : MmmhGary : eranderthis thing and er ..youShee Chin : Youyou have a line in my line what right?Gary : Yah, that  but that is on for share financing lah!Shee Chin : AhGary : Not for for foreign exchange lah. And then the other thing is is er\n\n   because er wer had never talked of er foreign exchange ah, so thats why erm you\n\n  did not sign the Risk Disclosure Form,Shee Chin : MmmhGary : Er  but anyway ah, er  this  er  the  I  I  I took\n\n  er  I opened 2 contracts, which I closed, both today, ok? Because the dollar rally very quickly\n\n  against the RinggitShee Chin : MmmhGary : So, one  one there is a small loss of 62 thousand the other one there\n\n  is a profit of one hundred and 53 over thousand, so er  on a net-net basis there is still a 91\n\n  thousand er  profit you see?Shee Chin: Mmmh35.    Pausing here, we think that in this conversation Gary\n\nreported what appeared to be the first two forex deals he had made for Shee Chin, and that from\n\nthese two deals, a net profit of about MYR91,000 was made. Here, Gary admitted that they had never\n\ntalked about foreign exchange before, and that was why Shee Chin had not signed a risk disclosure\n\nstatement. It seems to us that Shee Chin understood what Gary was saying. We note that, on Gary\n\nexplaining the problem that he [Shee Chin] did not previously have lines for foreign exchange,\n\nShee Chin promptly replied that he had, whereupon Gary corrected him by pointing out that the\n\nline was for share financing and not for forex trading. From this part of the conversation, it is\n\nclear to us that Gary entered into the two forex transactions without Shee Chins consent or\n\nknowledge. Those two deals were clearly unauthorised. However, Shee Chin on being informed of them\n\nwas quite happy and he approved and adopted them, presumably because a profit had been made for him\n\nby Gary. Clearly, there was no sign of any objection from Shee Chin.36.    \n\nFurther, in that conversation, Gary went on to explain that his office needed Shee Chin to sign\n\ncertain documents to regularise the forex transactions, and that a risk disclosure statement and\n\nletters acknowledging the loss on one contract and profit on the other would be sent to him for his\n\nsignature. The following is what they said:Gary : So, or  on that basis (inaudible)  pacify my er my credit\n\n  risk people lah, because they notice that there was ersome exchanges you see, eralthough\n\n  there was no line, so they erm you know, pressuring me to you know, regularise the documentationShee Chin : MmmhGary : So, erm  I tell you what ah? Can I send the ferShee Chin : Dont send, Im going back tomorrow.Gary : Youre going back tomorrow ah? Ok, so I will just mail the  the forms\n\nto your house lahShee Chin : MmmhGary : Ok? The Risk Disclosure Form, with a letter to say that, ok there are\n\nthese 2 contracts and then you know one is a loss one is profit, and then you know to credit the\n\nprofit to a certain account lah. So erm  I will need you to sign the from to erer I mean\n\nerto agree to these contracts you see. Because the  nowadays the ererbank isisis\n\nvery very ererwary lah, because er previously we had a lot of  I mean some customers ah,\n\n in the good old days ah,Shee Chin : MmmhGary :  when everything is well, you know thenShee Chin : Yah yah yah yahGary :  so no problem, no, the documentation not in order,Shee Chin : YahGary : you know its no problem you see, but when the market collapse and they\n\nstart owing the bank a lot of moneyShee Chin : AhGary :  then they start to dispute and look for all kinds of technicalities\n\nlah, you know like, oh I didnt have line why did you do this, I didnt sign the from why did\n\nyou allow, you know that kind of thingShee Chin : AhGary : sosothats why the credit ererpeople have been on my back\n\nyou know, because of this contract, but anyway theres no loss to you because you know thethethethere\n\nis a profit, ok? So I just need you to sign the form to regularise everything you knowShee Chin : Mmmh\"The documents referred to were sent to Shee Chin, and on 6 March 1998, Shee Chin\n\nsigned the confirmation of the forex contracts with the profit and loss figures stated there as well\n\nas the risk disclosure statement relating to forex trading, all of which were then returned to BNP.37.    \n\nLastly, in that conversation, Gary explained to Shee Chin that the purpose of the forex transactions\n\nwas to use the gains to pay off the loan owing to the bank. This is borne out by the following part\n\nof the conversation:Shee Chin : So, ah  hows the loan do  hows the repayment ah \n\n  going ah?Gary : The repayment, er  weve been working on it, thats why were\n\n  doing this type of thing  toShee Chin : Ah huhGary :  generate some funds to help reduce it lah!Shee Chin : Cash  Ah huhGary : Erm  theShee Chin :  its not getting bigger is it?Gary : Oh no  no  Im try  I mean  likeShee Chin : (laughter)Gary : Im using you know  other funds to  toShee Chin : OhGary : To pay off the interest and all that, because I  at this point in\n\n  time, I want to reduce it, you know, as  to as small as possibleShee Chin : Yar lor, exactly  ok lah ok lahGary : And  and the  the Ringgit is er  weakening now, after it has\n\n  weakened er  er  you know Im looking at er  er  its weakened beyond 4 or\n\n  whatever it is, I may convert to another er  currency  a weaker currency, so that you know\n\n  over time ah, you knowShee Chin : You know we should have  we should haveGary : It will get smaller and smaller and smaller you seeShee Chin : Actually last time you should asked Suharto and say eh! We\n\n  convert to Rupiah! (Laughter) then we already pay off  (laughter)Gary : (Laughter) yah  yah  I mean, it would have been a wonderful idea!\n\n  You know, you know immediately ah, the  my  my  the  the loan would have halfed you\n\n  know! (Laughter)Shee Chin : Yah Yah (Laughter) exactly!Gary : But the problem  the problem, with the  ok, there is some problem\n\n  with borrowing Rupiah, because the interest rate is very high.Shee Chin : YahGary : Yah, because er  even for a one ah, on a one month ah, its almost\n\n  fifty over percent per annum you see?Shee Chin : Whah  thats bad.Gary : Yah, unless ah, unless we were able to er  er  borrow it ah, when\n\n  everything was very stable, the interest rate, even then ah, the interest rate was twenty over\n\n  percent you know?Shee Chin : YahGary : Before anything happen, ok? We  we  we  borrow long term ok,\n\n  and we lock it in, ok? You get what I mean or not? So that lets say if you borrow say for one\n\n  year or 6 months ahShee Chin : AhGary : Even though the interest will go up and down ah, youre not affected,\n\n  because you have already fixed itShee Chin : Oh38.    \n\nWhat has emerged from this entire conversation is this: Gary on his own did the two forex\n\ntransactions in Shee Chins name in late February or early March 1998 without his knowledge. Only\n\nthereafter, did he inform Shee Chin by telephone on 5 March 1998, and Shee Chin appeared to be\n\ncontented with the results and raised no query or objection to them. On the contrary, he approved\n\nthem. The tenor of the entire conversation shows that Shee Chin understood what Gary was saying, and\n\nwhen the conversation turned to currency conversion Shee Chin even took part in it without\n\nexpressing any surprise. It is significant that Shee Chin did not request or instruct Gary not to\n\nenter into any forex transaction without his (Shee Chins) consent in the future.39.    \n\nThere was another material conversation on the telephone between Gary and Shee Chin and that took\n\nplace on 29 July 1998. The conversation began with Gary informing Shee Chin of the dire state of his\n\naccount. The relevant part of the transcript reads:Gary : Ok, anyway, the reason I, I call, is because eh, you know, the account\n\n  that you have here, erm  because of the fall in the er  er  share prices in this couple\n\n  of, in fact, you know it has been falling, and also because er  er  er  Malaysia has been\n\n  trying to go around, you know trying to borrow money and that all of the sudden because of the\n\n  Moody downgrade and all that lah.Gary :  very badly affected by Malaysia, even the merger by DBS and eh eh eh\n\n  and POSB, the the the euphoria was very short lived lahShee Chin : MmmhGary : It was just, on Monday, sorry on yah, on Friday and then on Monday the\n\n  whole thing got fizzled out lah. So anyway, er  so the utilisation margin eh, in in the, in the\n\n  account ahShee Chin : MmmhGary :  is in excess of you know the previous agreed ratio, alright so Ive\n\n  been telling the Bank, that you know, er  er  look we will try our best to to to pay off the\n\n  loan lah. .Gary : OK? So anyway, I told them you know, that a, a, a grace period is\n\n  required lahShee Chin : Ah hahGary : to regularise the account, and then er er er we will try to\n\n  pay, you know maybe around ok, no commitment but, just try okShee Chin : AhGary : to pay maybe around you know 20 thousand US per month ahShee Chin : Wah, how am I going to do that?Gary : We have to, you know, eh eh eh, do some you know currency trading to\n\n  to to earn it lahShee Chin : Eh, yahGary :  on a conservative basis, ah? So try to  its not a, a, a big\n\n  sum lah, so soShee Chin : Wah its a big sum man, looking at my own account, it is a huge\n\n  sumGary : (laugh)Shee Chin : (laugh). .Gary : So I have drafted a letter, alright, eh well I mean, basically stating\n\n  all these things lah, alright?Shee Chin : Mmmh. .Gary : but of course if the er  er  opportunity you know er  er ,\n\n  arise, and you know we can put more we put more lah. Because I think ultimately the best thing to\n\n  do is to pay offShee Chin : Yar lorGary :  you know the entire loan and free up the shares lahShee Chin : Yah, you see, 20 thousand US is a big amount per month?Gary : Eh, I think, eh that could be possible lah?Shee Chin : Ah? Aiyo, sounds a bit high, I dont know whether, I mean, hows\n\n  your confidence (laugh) in doing t man? AiyahGary : Erm  so anyway theres no firm commitment, you know Im sure, well\n\n  try to you know raise this sum, and  but like I said, you know of course well try to raise\n\n  more lah, you know because we also want to speed up the repayment you see40.     It\n\nis plain that this telephone conversation centred on the problem as to how Shee Chin was going to\n\nrepay the loans to BNP. He clearly understood what Gary was saying. He was not passive but\n\nparticipated in the conversation. In the course of their discussion, Gary referred to currency\n\ntrading to generate profits to repay the loans. No protest or complaint was raised by Shee Chin\n\nto this suggestion; nor did he request Gary not to go into currency trading in the future. He was\n\nquite aware of what Gary was saying. In the course of the conversation, he merely questioned Garys\n\nconfidence in procuring payment through forex trading.41.    \n\nFollowing the conversation, a draft letter was faxed to Shee Chin who approved it; he signed and\n\nsent it by fax to BNP on 29 July 1998. In it, Shee Chin said that he acknowledged that his account\n\nutilization margin was in excess of the agreed ratio and sought a grace period to regularise the\n\naccount, and that in the meanwhile he proposed to pay BNP US$20,000 per month with the first payment\n\nto be made in August 1998.42.    In our opinion, these telephone conversations indicate\n\nthat, although Shee Chin might not have been aware of the actual transactions entered into by Gary\n\nin his name and for his account at the relevant times, he was fully aware that Gary was using his\n\nname to trade in forex transactions. Our conclusion is that he let Gary manage and operate his\n\naccount in the way Gary had done, and allowed Gary to carry on trading in forex transactions in his\n\nname and for his account.43.    \n\nLastly, there were two important telephone calls made by Shee Chin to Mr Hamery, then the head of\n\nthe Private Banking Department of BNP, on 8 October 1998, which was after the loss was incurred as a\n\nresult of the huge forex transactions carried out by Gary on his behalf. On both calls, Mr Hamery\n\nwas not in, and Shee Chin left the following recorded message:[Shee Chin] : Ah Mr Hamery, eh  Im eh  calling in reply to what eh Mr\n\n  Gary Hew had told me. Umm  Im out in the field right now, so Im unable to give you a\n\n  phone number (kid wailing in background). So, anyway ahh, Gary, Mr Gary Hew (kid wailing in\n\n  background) has advised me eh .. to say that, you know, eh  want to close all the account, eh,\n\n  close the position eh, please do so. Ill try to call in a few minutes time to eh, talk to you\n\n  again, thank you.In the second call, Shee Chin left the following message:[Shee Chin] : Eh, Im Mr Tan here, Mr Tan Shee Chin, I called earlier and was\n\n  unable to get through to you, eh, my previous message has eh  including this one (kid wailing\n\n  in background) now, will be umm  that eh, Ive heard from Mr Gary Hew (kid wailing in\n\n  background) and then eh, hed suggest that ah, I close the position, eh  ask the bank to\n\n  close the position whatever, so, I, basically I agree with his suggestion eh, please do so. Eh, Im\n\n  unable to give you a telephone number to call back, because Im out in the field now. Eh, I, if\n\n  you didnt get this message Im leaving on your message phone, eh, Ill try to call umm \n\n  a few minutes later, ok?44.     A\n\nfew days later, on 12 October 1998, Shee Chin spoke to Mr Billy Au-Yeung, the officer in charge of\n\nthe matter at BNP regarding his accounts with BNP. There was no word of objection or protest from\n\nhim for the massive loss incurred in the forex transactions. In fact, Mr Au-Yeung suggested\n\ndiscussing a settlement with Shee Chin. On 13 October 1998, Shee Chin instructed BNP to stop all\n\ntransactions in his account; but even at that stage no protest was made by him. Nor was there any\n\nindication from him to the effect that he was unaware of the forex transactions. Only on 14 October\n\n1998, did he fax a letter to BNP informing them that the transactions were entered into by Gary\n\nwithout his authority.",
        "Nancys knowledge of forex transactions": "45.     We\n\nnow turn to the issue relating to the extent of Nancys knowledge of the forex transactions\n\ncarried out by Gary in her name and for her account. Nancy became a customer of BNP only in December\n\n1996, when she opened an account with the bank. Her purpose for so doing was to provide security for\n\nShee Chin, whose account with the bank was then overdrawn. In opening the account, Nancy also signed\n\na memorandum of charge/deposit of securities to secure the indebtedness and liabilities of Shee Chin\n\nto BNP. It did not appear that at that time any stock or shares were deposited by her with the bank\n\npursuant to the memorandum.46.     In\n\nApril 1997, when the margin call was made on Shee Chin, she deposited with BNP 10,000 UIC shares and\n\n55,588 UOB shares as security for Shee Chins account in addition to those provided by Shee Chin.\n\nUp to that stage she had not authorised Gary to carry out any trading either in stock and shares or\n\nin forex transactions. In fact, during the period between December 1996 and March 1998, no trading\n\nof any kind in her name was carried out by Gary.47.    \n\nThen in April 1998, Gary opened an account in her name with BNP to trade in forex transactions.\n\nNancy also had no involvement in the opening of the account. Whatever form of authorization or\n\ninstruction or other document required to be signed was signed by Gary. There was no evidence that\n\nshe expressly authorised Gary to open the account, whether verbally or in writing. Nor was there any\n\nevidence that the account was opened with her knowledge or consent.48.    \n\nFrom April 1998, Gary made use of her account to enter into forex transactions and continued to do\n\nso until October 1998. It appears that Gary first made use of her account for the forex transactions\n\nentered into in mid-April 1998 or thereabouts. On 23 April 1998, shortly after two forex\n\ntransactions were carried out in her name, and profits in the sums of 2 million Yen and a 1\n\nmillion Yen respectively were made, Gary telephoned her and reported to her these transactions and\n\nthe profits made. The transcript of the material part of this conversation reads as follows:Nancy : HelloGary : Hello? Nan?Nancy : YupGary : Hi Gary here ah!Nancy : Hi. YaGary : Eh sorry are you busy?Nancy : Er  non, its ok, no problemGary : Ah ok, er  just want to check ah, will you be in the office tomorrow\n\n  ah?Nancy : No.Gary : Oh, youre  youre not going to the office ah?Nancy : Er  I got, Im going in for a while onlyGary : Ah ha  ah ha  I see ok. Erm, alright, basically whats happened\n\n  is this, er  they .. there is going to be a 2 million Yen ahNancy : MmmhGary : Hel  Hello?Nancy : YahGary : Profit ah?Nancy : YahGary : Er  er  in your account, ok?Nancy : MmmhGary : That will be paid to you ah, on the 27th ah, which is next MondayNancy : MmmhGary : Alright? And then there will be a 1 and a half million Yen profit that\n\n  will be paid to you on the 30th ahNancy : MmmhGary : Alright?Nancy : MmmhGary : So I will er prepare aaa note ah, to transfer this profit ah,\n\n  to Ah Chins account.Nancy : OkGary : So ererer when when youre in the office you give me a callNancy : You want me to sign is it?Gary : Yes. I need you to sign for the transfer of the funds ah, ererfrom\n\n  your account to Ah Chins account.Nancy : Ok lah, probably in the morning ah49.    \n\nFollowing the conversation, Nancy signed an instruction dated 23 April 1998 (which was faxed to her)\n\nto transfer certain profits in her account to Shee Chins account. The instruction bore the\n\nfollowing bold underlined caption: \"TRANSFER OF FOREX PROFITS IN ACCOUNT 50-015684\"\n\nand contained clear instructions to BNP to transfer a sum representing the profits from Nancys\n\naccount to Shee Chins account. A similar instruction dated 24 April 1998 (also faxed to her) was\n\nalso signed by her. It is significant that Nancy did not raise any query on or objection or protest\n\nto Garys actions. She willingly signed the transfers and returned them to BNP. She must have\n\nrealized then, if not earlier, that Gary had carried out certain forex transactions in her name;\n\nhence the profits were generated and credited to her account which she transferred to Shee Chin.50.    \n\nSoon after that date, Gary entered into another forex transaction in Nancys account, and on 27\n\nApril 1998 reported to her on the telephone the profit he made. The transcript of the material part\n\nof the conversation is as follows:Gary : HelloNancy : Yah, sorryGary : Yah hi! AH, ok, eh er  sorry to interrupt you,Nancy : No problemGary : I just want to ermlet you knowertoday I made 1.3 million\n\n  Yen.Nancy : AhGary : Ok? Its going through your account,Nancy : OkGary : Er I need er again, you know, to do the same thing we did the last\n\n  time,Nancy : Ok.Gary : Because the  I  the  the  the contract was just closed a few\n\n  minutes ago I dont have all the numbers. The numbers will not be er  available until it is\n\n  keyed into the computer tomorrow evening.Nancy : MmmhGary : So, Ill  I  Ill just put in the rate lah. What rate it was\n\n  bought, what rate it was soldNancy : MmmhGary : What the  and the profit and then Ill er  Ill just say\n\n  convert to  to  to Ringgit and then credit you know, Ah  Ah Chins account lah. All the\n\n  details, the rest, Ill  I will sort it out later lah.Nancy : Ok can.By the expression the same thing we did the last time, Gary meant and Nancy\n\nunderstood that Gary would send her a form of transfer of the profit in her account to Shee Chins\n\naccount and that she would sign and return it to the bank. Here again she must have realized that\n\nGary had traded in a forex transaction in her name; otherwise it would be difficult to account for\n\nthe profit he made on her behalf which was credited to her account.51.     On\n\n18 May 1998, there was a conversation between Gary and Nancy dealing with Garys actions with\n\nrespect to Nancys account. The material part of the transcript reads as follows:Gary : Yah, did you send me back my the  this thing ah, the er  the \n\n  the  fax ah, the instructions to transfer the contra profits to Ah Chins account?Nancy : Er  actually I sent back, but I think dont know whether the fax\n\n  go through or not, because you know, the  the  thing didnt come out. You didnt\n\n  receive it is it?Gary : No, I didnt receive it.Nancy : Ok never mind, you fax to my office, can or not?Gary : Ok. Ok lahNancy : Er  then Ill fax back to you later, Im going back52.    There was a subsequent conversation between Nancy and Gary\n\non the same day relating to the same fax instruction, because Nancy had failed to append her full\n\nsignature to the form. The relevant part of the transcript reads:Gary : Yah, eroh yah yahyoueryou always sign ah, just Nancy right?\n\n  But on the er in your specimen card ah, its signed as Nancy Tan.Nancy : Ive amended it already right?Gary : You amended already, you re-fax to me is it?Nancy : Er I told my secretary to fax to you what?Gary : You hold on, let me check. Hello yah yah I got it.Nancy : Yah, ok lor.Gary : Ok, but it doesnt appear very clear. Anyway never mind lah er but \n\n  but next time just sign in full lah, so that we dont have problem with signature verification.52.    \n\nClearly, Nancy knew that Gary had used her account to trade in forex transactions. However, no\n\nobjection or protest was raised by Nancy against Gary for having carried out such transactions\n\nwithout first consulting her and seeking her consent. Not even a query was raised. On the contrary,\n\nfrom the conversations between them, Nancy appeared to condone and approve what Gary had done. There\n\nappeared to be an understanding between them, in which Gary was allowed to enter into forex\n\ntransactions in her name and for her account and upon any profit being made she would transfer such\n\nprofit to Shee Chins account.53.     On\n\n29 September 1998, Gary again informed Nancy of the forex transactions he made in her name and the\n\nneed to remit these profits to Shee Chins account. The material part of the transcript of the\n\nconversation is as follows:Gary  HelloNancy  HaiGary  Hai, how are you, sorry am I interrupting anythingNancy  No, its ok, I am just walking to the _____Gary  Where are you workingNancy  Central Square.Gary : I see so how is businessNancy : No good lahGary : No good hah, I see, ai I am calling you hah because ah ok you actually\n\n  at the moment have 200 over thousand ok first and foremost your account is completely regularised\n\n  already, there is no more overdraft in your account, ok, so in fact at this point in time hah\n\n  there is 200 over thousand Yen ok credit in your account, ok almost 300 thousand, tomorrow there\n\n  is going to be about 2 million dollar Yen going into your account, ok now part of this money has\n\n  to be remitted out lah, okNancy : OkGary : Which means that because there are payment to be made alright, so what\n\n  happens was that today there was a 2 million over Yen contract you know, which you know we put\n\n  under your name lah, right, so what happened is that tomorrow I will need I mean I will prepare a\n\n  letter then I will need to fax it to you to sign and then sent it back to me so that you know the\n\n  payment can go out lahNancy : Ok lah can lah you fax to me first lah. ..Gary : I see, ok, ah  so tomorrow, but morning you will be in is itNancy : Yah, morning I should be inGary : If thats the case hah, ah ah ah my secretary is Harni, HARNI, maybe\n\n  what I can do is I can, you know what time will you be in the office hahNancy : 9.00 lohGary : 9.00 oclock hah, ok so I will ask my assistant Harni to give you a\n\n  call alright make sure you are there and then fax the letter over to you lohNancy : Ok lah canGary : After that when you have sign the letter, alright you fax it back to us\n\n  so that when I come in the afternoon I can settle I mean handle all the administration lahNancy : Sure sure ok no problemGary : You are sure that means you are going into the office in the morning lah\n\n  definitely rightNancy : YahGary : I see ok then I will get my assistant to liaise with you in the morning54.    \n\nFollowing this conversation, Nancy signed three letters of instruction to BNP which she returned to\n\nthe bank. The first was an instruction to transfer the entire credit balance in her Yen account to\n\nShee Chins account. The second expressly referred to two forex contracts and instructed the bank\n\nto offset the two forex contracts and convert the contra profit from Japanese Yen to\n\nSingapore Dollars [and] then remit the SGD proceeds to four specific named accounts by telegraph\n\ntransfer. The third letter contained in substance the same instruction as the second, but in a\n\nslightly different style: it instructed the bank to debit a certain sum to her Singapore dollar\n\ncurrent account and remit the sum to four specific named accounts.55.    \n\nThese conversations between Gary and Nancy demonstrate that, during the period from April to\n\nSeptember, Nancy not only knew that Gary was using her account to enter into forex transactions in\n\nher name, but willingly allowed him to do so. It was their understanding that, as and when profits\n\nwere made on the forex transactions in Nancys account, they would be transferred to Shee Chins\n\naccount. It seems to us that Nancy trusted Gary and was content to leave it entirely to Gary to\n\noperate her account at his discretion.56.     It\n\nis undisputed that Nancy, on no less than five separate occasions, signed a total of 7 letters\n\ninstructing the bank to transfer the forex profits from her account to Shee Chins account.\n\nAdmittedly, those instructions were drafted by Gary, but they were in clear terms and bore a caption\n\nof the subject matter in bold font which was also underlined. For example the instruction she signed\n\non 23 April 1998 bore the following caption:TRANSFER OF FOREX PROFITS IN ACCOUNT 50-015684and the 18 May 1998 instruction bore the caption:OFFSET FX CONTRACT REF 20058439 AND\n\n20060341. In respect of these instructions which Nancy signed, the trial judge was of the\n\nopinion that one could not quadrate the fact that she knew that there were profits to be\n\ntransferred out that she must have known of the forex deals in her name. With respect, we are\n\nunable to agree with the judge. On the basis of those instructions which she had signed and the\n\nevidence of the telephone conversations between her and Gary, we find that that Nancy knew that Gary\n\ntraded in forex transactions in her name and that profits were generated by Gary from these forex\n\ntransactions and credited to her account; otherwise, as we have said, it would be difficult to\n\naccount for them. It should be noted that these profits were of relatively large sums, and what was\n\nmade and credited to her account was not just one isolated instance, but several instances.57.    It is relevant to consider also the events that took place\n\nimmediately after the huge loss was incurred as a result of the forex deals made by Gary on or just\n\nbefore 8 October 1998. Soon thereafter, on 9 October 1998, Mr Billy Au-Yeung telephoned Nancy\n\nand briefly discussed her account with BNP. There was no hint or slightest suggestion by Nancy that\n\nthe transactions entered into by Gary were unauthorised. Apparently, at that time she was in a car\n\nwith her colleagues. The relevant part of the conversation is as follows:Billy : Ya, my name is Billy Au-Yeung. Im calling from BNP.Nancy : Yes.Billy : Im Garys colleague.Nancy : Yup.Billy : Ya, regarding  Im calling regarding the 2 dollar yen contracts\n\n  that you have done with him ah.Nancy : Mm.Billy : Now, we have cut the positions now.Nancy : Mm.Billy : And then, mm,  at the rate of about one,  one 40, yesterday.Nancy : MmBilly : The 2  the losses on these 2 contracts are equivalent to yen, about\n\n  32 point 4 million.Nancy : Mm.Billy : Well, I would like to ask your ideas, how,  how youre gonna\n\n  settle these losses.Nancy : Oh, I see. What are the various ways to be done?Billy : Yes, maybe shall we meet sometime next week so,  so that we can have\n\n  a discussion?Nancy : Ok. Ya because I am in a meeting right now so its not convenient.\n\n  Can I call you or can I get Gary Hew toBilly : No, maybe you call me.Nancy : Eh, ok, ya.Following that conversation, she called Mr Au-Yeung and suggested that they meet\n\nat lunch the following week. Immediately after this call, Nancy wrote to BNP to hold her account\n\nuntil she met up with Mr Au-Yeung. Only on 13 October 1998, did she write to BNP disputing liability\n\nfor the loss incurred.",
        "Correspondence": "58.    \n\nLike Shee Chin, Nancy also received voluminous documents from BNP during the material times when the\n\nforex transactions in her name were entered into. The documents included monthly statements of\n\naccount, credit and debit advices and, most importantly, confirmation slips in respect of each and\n\nevery forex transaction that was entered into. It is undisputed that these statements of account and\n\nconfirmation slips reflected the transactions that had been effected in her name and for her\n\naccount. It is also undisputed that she had never raised any query on or objection or complaint\n\nagainst any of the statements.59.     In\n\nmaintaining that they were not aware of Garys actions, both Shee Chin and Nancy claimed that they\n\ndid not read or even open some of these statements from the bank. That appeared to be true with\n\nregard to some of the documents sent to them; however, whether it be true or not is immaterial. The\n\nfact that they did not open or read the statements or for that matter did not quite understand them\n\ncannot be a valid ground of denying knowledge of the statements. These statements were sent to them\n\nby BNP with a view to confirming the transactions that had been carried out, and if they chose not\n\nto open and read them, the statements would still have the effect intended and serve the purpose for\n\nwhich they were sent. The fact that they were not too concerned to read the statements and find out\n\nexactly what they were and what they contained gives rise to the inference that they each had\n\nimplicit and unquestioning trust in Gary, and in his skill and ability in managing their accounts\n\nand effecting the deals for them. They were content to leave it to entirely Gary to operate their\n\nrespective accounts wholly at his discretion.",
        "Gary evidence": "60.    \n\nGary was not called as a witness by either BNP or the respondents; both sides for obvious reasons\n\nrefrained from calling him. That is perfectly understandable. Before us, both BNP and the\n\nrespondents rely on a statement of agreed facts, which was admitted by Gary in the district court,\n\nwhen he pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him. This statement was admissible in court\n\nunder s 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) and was admitted by the trial judge. That\n\nstatement was no doubt relevant. In the statement, Gary admitted, inter alia, that he opened a\n\nSingapore dollar account and a Japanese Yen account in Shee Chins name without the latters\n\nknowledge and consent. He went on to make the following admissions with regard to Shee Chins\n\nposition in BNP:9. The Accused [Gary] carried out his own share and foreign exchange trading in\n\n  the other accounts of TSC, which were kept separate from TSCs own transactions carried out in\n\n  the SGD 41 account.10. In respect of the 2ndcharge (DAC 21811/99), the Accused carried\n\n  out the share transactions as particularised at Annex 1, which is also the schedule to the 2ndcharge, in his own behalf using account number 01 012617 002 38 SGD, in TSCs name.11. In respect of the 5thcharge (DAC 21814/99), the Accused carried\n\n  out the leveraged foreign exchange transactions with BNP as particularised at Annex 2, which is\n\n  also the schedule to the 5thcharge, in his own behalf using account number 50 013656\n\n  006 70 JPY, in TSCs name.12. TSC subsequently became aware that the Accused had opened other accounts in\n\n  his name, which the Accused was using for trading. TSC then confronted the Accused, who assured\n\n  him that he would sell off the shares and close the accounts. The Accused also took responsibility\n\n  for all the unauthorised trades at that time. Therefore TSC allowed the Accused to continue\n\n  trading in his accounts, in order to recover some of the losses incurred, and eventually to close\n\n  out all the positions.61.    \n\nWith respect to Nancys position with BNP, Gary admitted the following:19. The Accused [Gary] had, in fact, opened a Japanese Yen account (number 50\n\n  015684 001 22 JPY) in Nancys name without her knowledge and consent. He then used this account\n\n  to carry out his own leveraged foreign exchange trading, mainly buying US dollars against Japanese\n\n  Yen.20. The Accused carried out the leveraged foreign exchange transactions with\n\n  BNP as particularised in Annex 3, which is also the schedule to the 7thcharge, in his\n\n  own behalf using account number 50 015684 001 22 JPY, in Nancys name.21. Nancy subsequently became aware that the Accused was using her account to\n\n  trade. However, she took no action, as the Accused assured her that he would be responsible for\n\n  his transactions.62.     We\n\nhave some reservations in accepting these admissions made by Gary. First, they are somewhat\n\ninconsistent with the evidence which we have discussed. Secondly, Gary himself had not been called\n\nand what he admitted in that statement had not been truly tested in cross-examination. We are\n\ntherefor unable to place much weight on these admissions.",
        "Authorization": "63.    We now come to the issue of authorization by Shee Chin and\n\nNancy of the transactions carried out by Gary. The evidence we have considered leads inescapably to\n\nthe following conclusions: that both Shee Chin and Nancy knew or were aware that Gary was trading in\n\ntheir respective accounts, in the case of Shee Chin, trading in shares and foreign exchange, and in\n\nthe case of Nancy, trading in foreign exchange; that they knowingly allowed and continued to allow\n\nGary to do so; and that they condoned and approved the transactions entered into by Gary in their\n\nrespective names. They acquiesced in the way he traded in their names and for their accounts\n\nrespectively. As counsel for BNP submits and we agree, whatever might have been the position with\n\nregard to the initial transactions, Shee Chin and Nancy had by their conduct and actions authorised\n\nGary to trade in their respective accounts, which he did. The following events or actions are only\n\nexplicable on the basis that they had, in effect, authorised Gary to carry out the transactions in\n\ntheir respective accounts: the margin call made by BNP on Shee Chin on 10 April 1997 and his\n\nresponse thereto by the deposit of further shares and also Nancys response by the deposit of her\n\nown shares; Shee Chins acceptance on 20 October 1997 of the proposal for the loan/facility up to\n\nthe aggregate sum US$2,000,000 offered by BNP; the contents of the telephone conversations between\n\nGary and Shee Chin on 5 March and 29 July 1998 respectively; Shee Chins signing of the letters of\n\nconfirmation of the two forex transactions and the risk disclosure statement in March 1998; his\n\nproposal made in July 1998 for repayment to BNP of the amount owing by instalments of US$20,000 per\n\nmonth; the contents of the several telephone conversations between Gary and Nancy; Nancys\n\nacceptance and signing of the transfers of the profits made from the forex transactions to Shee Chins\n\naccount; and finally the flood of contemporaneous documents detailing the transactions entered into\n\nby Gary in their accounts received by them respectively and the complete absence of any query,\n\nobjection or protest from them or either of them. In the circumstances, it can hardly be disputed\n\nthat the transactions carried out by Gary in their names were authorised. In this case, the actual\n\nauthority given to Gary, though not expressed, was implied from the conduct and actions of the\n\nparties and the circumstances of the case.64.     InHely-Hutchinson\n\nv Brayhead Ltd and Anor[1967] 3 All ER 98 at 102; [1968] 1 QB 549 at 583, Lord Denning MR said:[A]ctual authority may be expressed or implied. It isexpresswhen it is\n\n  given by express words, such as when a board of directors pass a resolution which authorises two\n\n  of their number to sign cheques. It isimpliedwhen it is inferred from the conduct of the\n\n  parties and the circumstances of the case, such as when the board of directors appoint one of\n\n  their be managing director.In that case, one Richards was the chairman of directors of the defendant company\n\nand was its chief executive or de facto managing director. He often committed the company to\n\ncontracts on his own initiative and only disclosed them to the board subsequently. The board\n\nacquiesced in his manner of conducting business and was content to leave the running of the company\n\nto him. The defendant was then negotiating to take over another company (Perdio), in which the\n\nplaintiff was the chairman and managing director. An agreement was reached between the plaintiff and\n\nRichards whereby, among other things, Richards on behalf of the defendant gave two undertakings: one\n\nwas to indemnify the plaintiff against the personal liability which he might incur by his having to\n\nhonour a personal guarantee given to a merchant bank, and the other was to guarantee the payment of\n\na certain loan from the plaintiff to the Perdio. Having given these undertakings, Richards did not\n\nreport them to the board of the defendant. Subsequently, Perdio went into liquidation and the\n\nplaintiff was called upon by the merchant bank to honour his guarantee, which he did, and he sued\n\nthe defendant on the undertakings. The defendant alleged that Richards had no authority to give the\n\nundertakings. Roskill J held that Richards had apparent authority to bind his company. The defendant\n\nappealed. The Court of Appeal, comprising Lord Denning MR, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Pearson,\n\naffirmed the decision of Roskill J, but on the ground that Richards had actual (and not apparent)\n\nauthority to bind the company. Lord Denning MR said ([1967] 3 All ER 98 at 102, [1968] 1 QB 549 at\n\n584):It is plain that Mr Richards had no express authority to enter into these\n\n  two contracts on behalf of the company: nor had he any such authority implied from the nature of\n\n  his office. He had been duly appointed chairman of the company but that office in itself did not\n\n  carry with it authority to enter into these contracts without the sanction of the board. But I\n\n  think that he had authority implied from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the\n\n  case. The judge did not rest his decision on implied authority, but I think that his findings\n\n  necessarily carry that consequence.Lord Wilberforce and Lord Pearson also came to a similar conclusion.65.    \n\nThis case was followed by this Court inSPP Ltd v Chew Beng Gim and Anor[1993] 3 SLR 393.\n\nThere, two executive directors of the board of SPP Ltd, Chew Beng Gim and Leonard Cheng, were\n\nappointed as nominee directors on the board of another company, Flamco Pte Ltd. As directors of\n\nFlamco, they were asked to execute personal guarantees in respect of hire purchase financing\n\nobtained by Flamco. Chew and Cheng referred the matter to their superior, Ong Tiong Soon, the\n\nmanaging director of SPP Ltd. Ong authorised them to sign the guarantees, implicitly assuring them\n\nthat they would be indemnified by SPP Ltd. Subsequently, Ong, Chew and Cheng were forced off the\n\nboard of SPP Ltd. Flamco defaulted in repayment of the facilities and the finance company sued Chew\n\nand Cheng on their personal guarantees. They in turn sought an indemnity from SPP Ltd as nominee\n\ndirectors. SPP Ltd declined to indemnify them, on the basis that the board of SPP Ltd had not\n\nspecifically authorised them to execute the guarantees. SPP Ltd further argued that Ong had no\n\nauthority to give Chew or Cheng the assurance that they would be indemnified. The evidence was the\n\nOng was the moving spirit behind SPP Ltd at the material time, and the management of the\n\ncompany was carried out informally. Ong was left very much to himself as far as running of SPP Ltds\n\nbusiness was concerned. The trial judge held on these facts that Ong had the actual authority to\n\nassure Chew and Cheng that they should execute the guarantees. Accordingly, SPP Ltd was obliged to\n\nindemnify them. This Court affirmed the trial judges decision. The Court said at p 400:It seems to us, and this is our inference, that in the context of these facts\n\n  and from the way in which the appellants and their group were managed Ong was impliedly authorized\n\n  to do what he did and, in particular, to authorize or approve the execution of the guarantees by\n\n  the respondents.The Court then referred to the case ofHely-Hutchinsonand said at p 402:In the instant case, Ong was the managing director and chief executive officer\n\n  of the appellants. He it was who ran the appellant company and their group of companies. There was\n\n  rarely any board meeting and decisions were made informally at discussions. In the words of the\n\n  judicial commissioner, he seemed to have run the appellant company very much as a one man show.\n\n  The board was content to let him manage and run the appellant company in the way he did and\n\n  acquiesced in what he did. In the circumstances, in our judgment, Ong had the authority to do what\n\n  he did, and, in this case, to authorize the respondents to execute the guarantees.66.    Reverting to the present case, we think that probably both\n\nShee Chin and Nancy had implicit and unquestioning trust in Gary, and in his skill and ability in\n\nmanaging their accounts. They were content to let him manage and operate their accounts in the way\n\nhe did, and they acquiesced in what he did. By their conduct and actions, they had each authorised\n\nGary to trade in his or her account, as the case may be.",
        "Apparent Authority": "67.    \n\nEven if it can be said that, at no stage, had Shee Chin and Nancy given any authority, express or\n\nimplied, to Gary to carry out the transactions in their accounts respectively, by their conduct and\n\nactions they had held out Gary as having the necessary authority. They had allowed Gary to carry out\n\nthe transactions and continue to do so, and in that sense they had equipped him with the necessary\n\nauthority for the transactions that he carried out. In other words, vis--vis BNP, Gary had the\n\napparent authority.Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency(16thedn) in Article 74\n\nstates as follows:Where a person, by words or conduct, represents or permits it to be represented\n\n  that another person has authority to act on his behalf, he is bound by the acts of that other\n\n  person with respect to anyone dealing with him as an agent on the faith of any such\n\n  representation, to the same extent as if such other person had the authority that he was\n\n  represented to have, even though the had no such actual authority.68.     The\n\nrelevant case in point isFreeman & Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd\n\nand Anor[1964] 4 All ER 630, [1964] 2 QB 480. The case involved one K, who held himself out to\n\nbe the managing director of the company, Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd (Buckhurst),\n\neven though he was not appointed as the companys managing director. Everyone in the company\n\nacquiesced in K so doing. K engaged a firm of architects, Freeman & Lockyer, who carried out the\n\nworks for Buckhurst but did not get paid for it. Freeman & Lockyer sued Buckhurst for payment of\n\nthe works. Buckhurst later claimed that K did not have the authority to bind the company, as he was\n\nnot properly appointed, and therefore the company was not bound by Ks act and was not liable to\n\npay for the works. The court found in favour of Freeman & Lockyer, and held that Buckhurst was\n\nbound by Ks act even though K had no actual authority, because his act of engaging the architects\n\nwas within his apparent authority as a managing director. In the course of his judgment, Diplock LJ\n\nsaid ([1964] 1 All ER 630 at 644, [1964] 2 KB 480 at 503):An apparent or ostensible authority is a legal relationship\n\n  between the principal and the contractor created by a representation, made by the principal to the\n\n  contractor, that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a\n\n  kind within the scope of the apparent authority, so as to render the principal liable to\n\n  perform any obligations imposed upon him by such contract. To the relationship so created the\n\n  agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the\n\n  representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal himself. The\n\n  representation, when acted upon by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent,\n\n  operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by the\n\n  contract. It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the contract.69.    \n\nReverting to the instant case, we are of the opinion that there are two requirements which have to\n\nbe satisfied, namely:(i) there must be a representation made by the respondents that Gary had\n\n  authority to enter into the transactions on their behalf; and(ii) BNP must have relied on this representationIn relation to the first requirement, we find that by their conduct and actions\n\nShee Chin and Nancy had represented that Gary had the authority to enter into the transactions on\n\ntheir behalf. Having had the knowledge that Gary was carrying on the transactions without their\n\nexpress authority, they continued to allow him to enter into further transactions, and they approved\n\nthe transactions which Gary had carried out, and this course of conduct continued until October\n\n1998.70.     As\n\nto the second requirement, there is no question that BNP had relied on such representation. There\n\nhad been no instance, where either Shee Chin or Nancy notified it that Gary had not been authorised\n\nto carry out the share or forex transactions which had been carried out. In addition to their\n\nsilence and acquiescence with regard to Garys actions, they also did many positive acts\n\nconsistent with their representation of Garys authority which BNP had accepted and on which it\n\nhad relied. All these have been discussed above, and we do not find it necessary to repeat them\n\nhere.71.     In\n\nour judgment, Gary had the authority, actual or ostensible, to enter into the transactions on behalf\n\nof Shee Chin and Nancy respectively, and accordingly they were bound by what he did. What we have\n\ndecided is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, and it is not necessary to consider the remaining\n\nissues.",
        "Conclusion": "72.    \n\nThis appeal succeeds and is allowed. We set aside the judgment below and allow the claims of BNP\n\nagainst Shee Chin and Nancy with interest at 6% from the date of the writ to this date hereof.73.    \n\nBefore we decide the question on costs, we wish to hear arguments from counsel. Counsel are invited\n\nto submit their written arguments within seven days from the date hereof.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
