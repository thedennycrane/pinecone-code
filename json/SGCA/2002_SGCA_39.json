        "Appellant’s contention": "8        The main argument raised by Guobena was\n\nthat, in determining what was due to NCB, after the mutual set-offs, no account should be\n\ntaken of the contract sum of $16,413,047.88 or the full contract sum of $16,800.732.03,\n\ninclusive of the agreed variation.",
        "Our decision": "9        The following essential facts must be borne\n\nin mind. The sub-contract value was originally $16,413,047.88 but it was increased by\n\nagreed variations of $387,684.15, making it a total of $16,800,732.03. Up to the time NCB\n\ncommenced the action, NCB had received payment of $13,165,974.82. The judgment of 29\n\nFebruary 2000 awarding the sum of $1,813,981.95 to NCB was subject to set-off against any\n\nsum found due to Guobena in the assessment of Guobena’s counter-claim for expenses\n\nincurred to complete the works. The Assistant Registrar assessed the counter-claim at\n\n$3,528,177.56. So, all in all, Guobena incurred $18,508,134.33 in completing the works.\n\nBut according to the contract, Guobena would only have to pay $16,800,732.03. The\n\ndifference of $1,707,402.30 was, therefore, the sum which Guobena was entitled to claim as\n\ndamages from NCB, who had terminated the works. Setting off this sum of $1,707,402.30\n\nagainst the sum of $1,813,981.95 which the court adjudged being due from Guobena to NCB,\n\nthere was a balance of $106,579.65 due to NCB. Moreover, it would be recalled that Guobena\n\nhad called on the PB and had received the sum of $1,642,045. This should also be returned\n\nto NCB. Adding these two sums would give a grand total of $1,748,624.65, which was what\n\nGuobena should pay to NCB.10        For a better comprehension of the\n\narithmetic involved, the figures are re-stated below in the form of a table:-Contract sum\n\n                   \n\n      $16,413,047.88Agreed variation$\n\n      387,684.15New Contract sum$16,800.732.03(sum\n\n      A)Payment received by NCB\n\n                  $13,165,974.82Judgment sum due to\n\n                          \n\n      $ 1,813,981.95NCBExpenses incurred by\n\n                          \n\n      $ 3,528,177.56Guobena to completethe work\n\n                                              \n\n      ____________Total sum incurred to$18,508,134.33(sum B)have the entire worksdoneDamages due to Guobena        $\n\n  1,707,402.30 (sum C)(sum B less sum A)Balance due from Guobena      $ 106,579.65\n\n  (sum D)to NCB after setting-offsum C against judgmentsum of $1,813,981.95Return of PB sum\n\n                      \n\n  $ 1,642,045.65 (sum E)Total due to NCB\n\n                     \n\n  $ 1,748,624.65(sum D plus sum E)11        In our respectful opinion, the cause of\n\nall the confusion would appear to stem from the argument of Guobena, that in determining\n\nhow the final accounts between the parties were to be computed, the contract sum should be\n\nignored. A basic principle of contract law is that an aggrieved party is entitled to claim\n\nas damages the losses or additional expenses which he has to incur to get what he has\n\ncontracted to obtain from the party in breach. To make that determination, the price at\n\nwhich the innocent party would have to pay under the contract must be reckoned.12        The point can, perhaps, be more readily\n\nappreciated by a simple illustration. Say A employs B to do a piece of work for $100/-.\n\nAfter three-quarters of the way and having been paid $75, B abandons work and A has to\n\nengage others to complete it. A incurs $35/- to have the job done. On Guobena’s\n\nargument, it will mean that A can claim the $35/- from B. This is obviously wrong. A, in\n\ntotal, incurs $110/- ($75 plus $35). That is $10/- more than the contract sum. A can only\n\nclaim $10/- as damages and nothing more. If A were to be entitled to claim $35 as damages\n\nfrom B, A would have benefitted because A would then have got the job done for only $75/-.13        The principle of damages in contract is to\n\ncompensate the aggrieved party for the loss he suffers, based on the concept ofrestitutio\n\nin integram, and not to give him any gain beyond such loss. Here, we would quote\n\nAsquith LJ inVictoria Laundry (Winsdor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd[1949] 2 KB\n\n528 at 539:-\"In cases of breach of contract, the aggrieved party is only\n\n  entitled to recover such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the\n\n  contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.\"Often times, disputes on damages centre on two main areas: the question\n\nof remoteness and the question of the measure of damages. The second question arises where\n\nthe losses which are suffered by the aggrieved party are not amenable to precise\n\ndetermination. In the present case, none of these two questions arose.14        Before we conclude, we should mention that\n\nin the trial judge’s written grounds of decision which she rendered later, she seemed\n\nto have second thoughts about the correctness of her decision, caused no doubt in part by\n\nthe manner in which the various figures were presented to her. We would, for the reasons\n\ngiven above, affirm that her decision was correct.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOW        CHAO HICK TIN\n\n            TAN LEE MENGCHIEF JUSTICE\n\n               JUDGE\n\nOF APPEAL        JUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
