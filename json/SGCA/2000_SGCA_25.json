        "The facts": "2.    The facts giving rise to this admiralty action were largely\n\nundisputed. The respondents claim was in respect of a cargo of 2,000 metric tons of raw sugar\n\n(the cargo) which was shipped by a Thai company, Pacific Sugar Corporation Ltd (Pacific Sugar), on\n\nboard the appellants vessel, \"Hung Vuong-3\",at Bangkok for discharge at the\n\nmain port of South China.3.    By a contract dated 19thDecember 1997, the\n\nrespondents agreed to sell 4,000 metric tons of raw sugar, FOB Bangkok (and/or three other Thai\n\nports), to a company in China calledGuangxi Yulin Prefecture Economic Trade Development Co (Guangxi).\n\nShipment was to be effected during the period of 15 December 1997 to 15 February 1998. Payment was\n\nto be by way of letter of credit (LC). To fulfil in part the obligations of the respondents under\n\nthis contract, they purchased the cargo from Pacific Sugar.4.    For the shipment of the cargo, the appellants issued a\n\n\"to order\" B/L to Pacific Sugar as the shipper. The B/L was in turn endorsed over in blank\n\nby Pacific Sugar to the respondents in this manner:\"PACIFIC SUGAR CORPORATION LTDSgd.____________________________________(YONCHAILAI JATURAFIS)GENERAL MANAGER\"The B/L (in three original copies) was duly conveyed by Pacific Sugar to the\n\nrespondents.5.    Problems arose whenHuang Vuong-3, on arrival at\n\nBeihai, China, delivered the cargo toGuangxi, without the production of any of the copies of\n\nthe B/L. The respondents had tendered all the relevant documents to negotiate the LC but failed to\n\nreceive payment under it. The B/L was in due course returned to the respondents. However,Guangxidid make part payment for the cargo - US$120,772.95 out of US$654,000, being the purchase price.\n\nThereafter the appellants sought to pressuriseGuangxito pay the balance. But it remained\n\nunpaid at the time the action was commenced.6.    Upon the institution of Admiralty in Rem No 733 of 1998, the\n\nrespondents caused to be arrested\"Hung Vuong-2\", a sister ship of the\"HungVuong-3\". \"Hung Vuong-2\"was later released after the appellants P&I\n\nClub posted sufficient security to meet the respondents claim.",
        "Stay application": "7.    The basis of the respondents claim was that the B/L was\n\nendorsed in blank to them by Pacific Sugar. Being the holders of the original B/L (all three copies\n\nthereof), they had acquired title to the cargo and were entitled to delivery of the same. The\n\nappellants delivery of the cargo toGuangxi, without the production of the B/L,\n\nconstituted a clear breach of contract and/or duty on the part of the appellants. Thus the\n\nrespondents claimed for their losses, based on the balance purchase price of the cargo amounting to\n\nUS$533.227.05.8.    The respondents took out an application for summary judgment\n\nagainst the appellants on the ground that there was no defence to the respondents claim. They\n\ncontended it was clear beyond doubt that the appellants were in breach when the latter delivered the\n\ngoods toGuangxiwithout the production of any of the original copies of the B/L. However,\n\nthe appellants applied to have the proceedings stayed on the ground that there was a jurisdiction\n\nclause in the B/L which read as follows:\"Any dispute arising from this B/L shall be decided in the country where\n\n  the Carrier has his principal place of business, and law of such country shall apply except as\n\n  provided elsewhere herein.\"As the appellants principal place of business was and is in Vietnam, they\n\ncontended that the action here should accordingly be stayed. As a result, the respondents\n\napplication for summary judgment was adjourned pending the outcome of the stay application, which\n\nwas eventually dismissed by the assistant registrar. That decision was affirmed by the learned\n\njudge.",
        "Issues": "9.    Two main issues were canvassed before us. They were broadly\n\nthe same issues which were raised before, and rejected by, the learned judge, namely:(i) whether the appellants had raised a dispute for the purposes of the\n\n  jurisdiction clause, so that by virtue of the clause, the respondents claim would have to be\n\n  brought in Vietnam and not Singapore.(ii) whether the circumstances of this case were such that they constituted\n\n  strong cause justifying this court to disregard the jurisdiction clause.",
        "Was there a dispute": "10.    It is trite law that a party seeking to bring an action in\n\na Singapore court in breach of a jurisdiction clause must show \"strong cause\". The factors\n\nor circumstances which the court would take into account in determining \"strong cause\"\n\nwere those enunciated by Brandon J inThe Eleftheria[1969] 1 Lloyds Rep 237 at 242 and\n\nwhich were adopted by this Court inAmerco Timbers Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd[1975-77]\n\nSLR 258. They were:-\"(a) In what country the evidence on the issues of fact is situated or\n\n  more readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of trial as\n\n  between the Singapore and foreign courts.(b) Whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so, whether it differs\n\n  from Singapore law in any material respects.(c) With what country either party is connected and, if so, how closely.(d) Whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or\n\n  are only seeking procedural advantages.(e) Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign\n\n  court because they would:(i) be deprived of security for their claim;(ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained;(iii) be faced with a time-bar not applicable here; or(iv) for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a\n\n    fair trial.\"11.    It was in relation to factor (d) that the question, whether\n\nthere was a genuine dispute between the parties, became crucial. It would be difficult for a party\n\nto contend that he seriously desires trial in the contractual forum if he was unable to show that\n\nthere was a real dispute, or putting it another way, that he had a real defence to the claim. In the\n\nrecent decision of this Court inThe Jian He[2000] 1 SLR 8, we reviewed the cases where the\n\ncourts had refused a stay on the ground that there was no real dispute. There is clearly\n\njurisdiction on the part of the court to make this determination.12.    We will now examine the basis upon which the appellants\n\ncontended that there was a dispute. Counsel for the appellants conceded that the burden was on them.\n\nTheir point was that notwithstanding the \"blank\" endorsement, the respondents were not the\n\npersons entitled to receive the cargo and thus sue for the loss. For this they relied upon the legal\n\nopinion of a Vietnamese Attorney-at-Law, Mr Tran Quang Cuong (Mr Cuong). The basis upon which Mr\n\nCuong arrived at his conclusion was article 84(b) of the Maritime Code of Vietnam, which reads\"A bill of lading may be transferred in accordance with the following\n\n  principles:..An order bill of lading is transferred by writing in its counter signing square on the back\n\n  of the bill of ladingthe name of the person who has the right to issue an order for delivery\n\n  of the cargo.The last person who has the right to issue an order for delivery of cargo is the\n\n  legal cargo receiver, even where counter signing square remains blank.\"According to Mr Cuong, in order for the respondents to be the \"legal cargo\n\nreceivers\" their names had to be written on the back of the B/L. In the present instance, this\n\nwas not done as Pacific Sugar had only endorsed their own name on the back of the B/L and not the\n\nname of the respondents.13.    For a more complete picture, it is necessary for us to also\n\nset out the provisions of articles 81(2) and 93 of the same Code:Article 81(2)\"The original B/L is a document of title for disposing of the cargo and for\n\ntaking delivery thereof.\"Article 93\"When the vessel arrives at the port of destination, the carrier is obliged\n\nto deliver the cargo to the legal cargo receiver who has at least one original bill of lading or\n\nforwarding document or similar way bill as referred to at paragraph 2 of Article 80 of this Code.\n\nAfter the cargo has been delivered, all other copies of the bill of lading stand void for receiving\n\nthe cargo.\"14.    First, we would observe that the opinion of Mr Cuong seemed\n\nsomewhat tentative as he stated that \"the defendants (the owners)maynot be liable to\n\nthe plaintiffs (cargo owners)\". Furthermore, his conclusion was that \"the defendants may\n\nhave a defence to the claim.\"15.    On the other hand, the legal expert of the respondents, Mr\n\nNguyen Manh Dung (Mr Dung), deposed that in accordance with article 93 the shipowners should only\n\ndeliver the cargo against the production of the B/L (at least one original copy) and if they did\n\notherwise they would be acting at their own risk. He said the Vietnamese Maritime Code allowed the\n\ntransfer of a \"to order\" B/L by endorsement and upon such transfer, the consequential\n\nrights and interest in the cargo were similarly transferred. It was adequate that the B/L was\n\nendorsed \"in blank\". Mr Dung opined that in the light of the blank endorsement of the B/L\n\naffected by Pacific Sugar, together with the actual transfer of the B/L to the respondents, the\n\nlatter had acquired title to the cargo. The respondents were entitled therefore to sue the\n\nappellants, who were liable to the respondents for the misdelivery of the cargo toGuanxi,without the production of any of the original copies of the B/L. All the three original copies of\n\nthe B/L were at all material times in the possession of the respondents.16.    We recognised that questions of foreign law are questions\n\nof fact and where the opinions of experts conflict on such foreign law, the court should as a\n\ngeneral rule refrain from making a determination on the basis of affidavit evidence. Furthermore,\n\nthere is much to be said for the proposition that disputes about foreign law should more\n\nappropriately be resolved by the courts of that foreign country: seeThe Asian Plutus[1990] 2 MLJ 449. But it does not follow that in every instance where there is a conflict of opinions, the\n\nSingapore courts should always shy away from examining the opinions given. Counsel for the\n\nappellants conceded that this Court was entitled to consider the opinions.17.    Upon a prima facie examination of Mr Cuongs opinion and\n\nthe relevant provisions of the Vietnamese Maritime Code, it was clear to us that there was no basis\n\nfor his opinion that article 84(b) required the specific endorsement of the transferees name\n\n(i.e., the respondents) on the reverse side of the B/L. It was common ground between the parties\n\nthat the B/L here was an \"order\" B/L. It would be useful for us to set out again the\n\nrelevant portion of article 84(b):-\"An order bill of lading is transferred by writing in its counter\n\n  signing square on the back of the bill of lading the name of the person who has the right to issue\n\n  an order for delivery of the cargo.\"18.    The critical words in this provision are \"the person\n\nwhohas the rightto issue an order.\" The question to ask is, who at that point in time\n\nimmediately before the execution of the transfer, has the right to issue an order for delivery of\n\nthe cargo. It cannot be the transferee. It has to be the transferor, who is the person who \"has\n\nthe right\". Until the transfer is completed and effected the transferee would have no right to\n\nissue any order for delivery. Therefore, in this case, the party whose name that must be endorsed on\n\nthe reverse side of the B/L was that of Pacific Sugar. This was what was done here. Thus, the rights\n\nto receive the cargo had effectively been transferred to the respondents upon the B/L being\n\ndelivered to the latter. We found the following opinion of Mr Dung wholly logical and sensible\"Such an \"Order\" Bill of Lading is transferred in writing. It is\n\n  transferred in writing when the name of the person who has the right to issue an order for\n\n  delivery of the cargo countersigns his name on the back of the Bill of Lading. The person who has\n\n  that right on this Bill of Lading is Pacific Sugar Corporation Ltd, the shipper. The Bill of\n\n  Lading is marked \"To Order\" which means it is to the order of Pacific Sugar Corporation\n\n  Ltd. Pacific Sugar Corporation Ltd is the last person who has the right to issue an order for\n\n  delivery of the cargo. They can transfer this right by countersigning their name in the counter\n\n  signing square on the back of the Bill of Lading.In this case there is no square on the back of the Bill of Lading providing for\n\n  this. Pacific Sugar Corporation Ltd therefore can sign their name on the reverse side of the Bill\n\n  of Lading. By doing so, they transfer in writing the right to an issue of the Delivery Order. That\n\n  right becomes transferred to the Holder of the Bill of Lading. This Bill of Lading itself states\n\n  on the face of it that the Holder of this Bill of Lading is also bound by the contract evidenced\n\n  by the Bill of Lading. That is the manner in which an \"Order\" Bill of Lading is\n\n  transferred under Article 84(b) of the Maritime Code of Vietnam.\"19.    In our judgment, the opinion of Mr Cuong, that what must be\n\nendorsed on the reverse side of the B/L was the name of the transferee, was clearly unsustainable.\n\nIt, therefore, followed that the appellants assertion that Vietnamese law did not recognise the\n\nconcept of \"holder of the bill of lading\" also could not be sustained. It seemed to us\n\nthat what was reflected in article 84(b) was really that concept and was wholly in line with\n\ninternational maritime practice. In passing, we would add that we felt fortified in this view by the\n\nfact that the B/L itself had provided that \"the shipper, consignee and the holder of this bill\n\nof lading hereby expressly accepts  all printed provisions  on this bill of lading, including\n\nthose on the back hereof\". On the back of B/L, the term \"shipper\" was defined to\n\ninclude, inter alia, \"the holder of the bill of lading\". It was quite disingenuous on the\n\nappellants part to deny the existence of such a concept.20.    The appellants, while submitting that the respondents were\n\nnot the persons entitled to receive the cargo, asserted that they need not \"prove who (would)\n\nbe the legal cargo receiver\". However, they volunteered the view that the legal cargo receiver\n\nwere \"the shippers\", presumably they meant, Pacific Sugar. But under the terms of the B/L,\n\n\"the shipper\" would include \"the holder of the bill of lading\". With respect, we\n\nthought it was absurd for the appellants to so suggest when all the three original copies of the B/L\n\nhad already been transferred by Pacific Sugar to the respondents. Pacific Sugar had already been\n\npaid for the cargo and would not have any basis whatsoever to make any claim to the cargo.",
        "Strong cause": "21.    We now turn to the second main issue, the question of\n\nstrong cause, which we do not think should detain us for long in the light of our views on the first\n\nissue. The factors which a court should take into account are those which are listed in 10 above.\n\nThe weight which the court should accord to each factor is a matter of judgment in the light of the\n\nnature of the claim and all the surrounding circumtances. However, this exercise is not just a\n\nnumbers game. It does not follow that because a greater number of factors favour one approach, that\n\napproach would necessarily be adopted by the court. The weight to be given to each factor is not the\n\nsame. We recognised that in this case the B/L was governed by Vietnamese law and the appellants were\n\nresident in Vietnam. The respondents were a Hong Kong company, although they had since moved their\n\noperations to Singapore. But once it is shown that there is no defence to the claim, and thus no\n\ndispute, as in the present case, then there is really nothing to go for trial at the contractual\n\nforum. In these circumstances to insist, as the appellants had, that the claim should nevertheless\n\nproceed to trial in the contractual forum would cast considerable doubt as to the bona fides of that\n\nparty in wanting to have a trial in the contractual forum.22.    InThe Vishva Prabha[1979] 2 Lloyds Rep 286, the\n\nplaintiffs shipped bales of cloth on board the defendants vessel. However, there was a hole in\n\nthe bulkhead of the hold. Oil went through the hole and damaged the cloth. The plaintiffs brought an\n\naction in England despite the existence of a jurisdiction clause referring any dispute to the place\n\nof the carriers principal place of business, Bombay. The plaintiffs asserted that the hole had\n\nbeen in the bulkhead even before the loading of the goods, so that the defendants had no defence to\n\nthe plaintiffs claim. All the defendants could do was to suggest that the hole could have been\n\ncaused by an act of sabotage that occurred after the goods had been loaded into the hold. Sheen J,\n\nhaving examined the allegation of sabotage, rejected it. He said (at p.288):Apart from the suggestion of sabotage in Boulogue, as a suggestion that\n\n  cannot be excluded, the shipowners have not at any stage since the damage occurred suggested any\n\n  defence to this claim. I am left in no doubt that as to that part of the claim there is no dispute\n\n  at all. I hold that there is no dispute on the question of liability, which ought to be submitted\n\n  to the Court in India.23.InThe Jian Hethis\n\ncourt had reviewed three other cases where a similar approach was also taken:The Atlantic Song[1983] 3 Lloyds Rep 394,The Frank Pais[1986] 1 Lloyds Rep 529 andStandard\n\nChartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp[1995] 2 Lloyds Rep 365. We do not propose\n\nto traverse over them again. What those cases show is that this Court is entitled to look into the\n\nalleged defence to see whether there is any real substance in it.24.    Reverting to the instant appeal, we did not think there was\n\nany dispute to be submitted for trial at the contractual forum. There would be no sense in staying\n\nthe proceedings. It seemed to us that the appellants were really seeking to gain a technical\n\nadvantage in asking for a stay. Furthermore, any stay would only cause unnecessary delay.25.    Finally, the appellants had also made the point that there\n\nwas a dispute as to the correct measure of damage, asserting that the loss should be based on the\n\nmarket value of the cargo at the discharge port and not the contract value, citing, ironically, the\n\nPrivy Council case from SingaporeJag Shakti[1986] 1 Lloyds Rep 1, in support. This would\n\nsuggest that the Vietnamese law on quantum of damages was the same as that applied by the\n\nSingapore/English courts. In the statement of claim the respondents claim was also based on the\n\n\"arrived value of the cargo\". Thus, the applicable principle was not in dispute. The\n\n\"arrived value\" would be that as at Beihai, China, not Vietnam. To insist that the mere\n\ndetermination of the value warranted a trial in Vietnam seemed again to us to indicate a desire for\n\ndelay or other procedural advantages.26.    In the premises, we were satisfied that a strong cause had\n\nbeen shown and the stay application should be refused. Thus, we upheld the decision of the learned\n\njudge below.27.    Before we conclude, we ought to mention that various other\n\nmatters had also been raised by the respondents in their affidavits which they thought were germane\n\nto the courts consideration of the stay application. Among them were the following : doubts as to\n\nthe competence of the Vietnamese judges on maritime law; doubts as to the independence of the\n\nVietnamese courts; and the question whether the maritime law of Vietnam was sufficiently developed.\n\nWe must point out at once that it is not for this court or any court in Singapore to pass judgment\n\non the competence or independence of the judiciary of another country , all the more so of a\n\nfriendly country. Comity between nations would be gravely undermined if such a wholly invidious\n\npursuit is embarked upon. We have to disregard entirely such arguments. Equally it is not for this\n\ncourt to say whether the maritime law of Vietnam is sufficiently developed, especially when the\n\nparties themselves had agreed that Vietnam law would apply to the B/L. We would observe that all\n\nthese matters are wholly alien to the factors enunciated by Brandon J inThe Eleftheria(supra)\n\nwhich the court ought to give consideration to.Yong Pung HowL P TheanChao Hick TinChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
