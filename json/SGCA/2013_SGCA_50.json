        "Introduction": "1       Civil Appeal No 90 of 2012\n                    (“CA 90”) and Civil Appeal No 91 of 2012\n                    (“CA 91”) were appeals against the decision by the judge\n                    (“the Judge”) inVirsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd\n                        v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd[2012] SGHC 207 (“the\n                    GD”). 2       We dismissed the appeals and now give the\n                    detailed grounds for our decision.",
        "The facts": "",
        "Background to the dispute": "3       In 2006, the Building and Construction Authority\n                    of Singapore (“BCA”) invited companies to set up authorised\n                    overseas training centres (“OTCs”) in India and Bangladesh. These\n                    OTCs trained, tested and certified workers for employment in the construction\n                    industry in Singapore. The companies which ran these OTCs had to meet certain\n                    criteria determined by the BCA. Welltech Construction Pte Ltd\n                    (“Welltech”) met these criteria but Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd\n                    (“Virsagi”) did not, even though it had the necessary expertise in\n                    operating OTCs. Accordingly, Mr Lee Siong Kee (“Victor”), the\n                    director and shareholder of Virsagi, approached Welltech with the following\n                    proposition: Welltech was to apply for the BCA licence pursuant to which\n                    Victor/Virsagi would run an OTC in Dhaka. 4       Welltech was successfully shortlisted in an\n                    initial ballot exercise conducted by the BCA in October 2006. Under the terms\n                    and conditions set out by the BCA for the setting-up and operation of OTCs,\n                    Welltech was required to set up a company in Bangladesh to manage the OTC as\n                    well as retain at least a 30% shareholding in that company. 5       Virsagi introduced a Bangladesh-registered\n                    company, Rupsha Overseas Ltd (“Rupsha”), to Welltech as their\n                    local partner for the joint venture. Welltech, Virsagi and Rupsha entered into\n                    an undated agreement (“the Rupsha Agreement”) under which the\n                    parties agreed to set up a joint venture company, Welltech Test Pvt Ltd\n                    (“WTPL”), for the purpose of operating the OTC.[note: 1]The Rupsha Agreement was\n                    submitted to the BCA by Welltech by way of a letter dated 24 November 2006.\n                    We will return to the main narrative momentarily but we pause here to mention\n                    that the Rupsha Agreement was never carried out, as Rupsha was replaced by\n                    another Bangladesh incorporated company, GN International (“GNI”).\n                    GNI was eventually replaced by Mr Ferdous Ahmed Badel (who claims it should\n                    be spelt “Fardous Ahamad Badel”) trading as Gazipur Air Express\n                    International (“Badel” or “Gazipur”, as the case may\n                    be) in 2009 (see further at [9] below). 6       On 25 November 2006, the joint venture\n                    company, WTPL, was incorporated with 100 shares issued. Victor held\n                    40 shares as a representative of Virsagi, Mr Woon Wee Phong\n                    (“Woon”), a director of Welltech, held 30 shares and\n                    Badel/Gazipur held or came to hold 30 shares. 7       On 6 December 2006, the BCA granted\n                    Welltech in-principle approval to set up an OTC in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This\n                    approval was valid for a period of three years with effect from\n                    6 December 2006, and would be reviewed yearly thereafter. 8       In early 2007, Virsagi and Welltech entered into\n                    a written agreement (“the Principal Agreement”) under which they\n                    set out their respective roles in the establishment and operation of the OTC in\n                    Dhaka. Welltech was to obtain the BCA licence and also agreed to employ workers\n                    trained by the OTC for its own construction business in Singapore. Virsagi was\n                    to do everything else that was necessary for the running of the OTC including\n                    the operations in Bangladesh. This included the incorporation of a joint venture\n                    company in Bangladesh named WTPL. It is not disputed that the Principal\n                    Agreement was terminated on 31 December 2011. 9       Virsagi then entered into an agreement dated\n                    26 April 2007 with GNI, to establish the OTC (“the GNI\n                    Agreement”). GNI was controlled by Mr Aminul Hossain Sarker\n                    (“Sarker”) and Badel. Subsequently, Badel and Sarker fell out, and\n                    this led to Virsagi entering into a fresh agreement with Gazipur, which was\n                    controlled by Badel, on 26 April 2009 (“the Gazipur\n                    Agreement”). Under the Gazipur Agreement, Gazipur was to obtain the\n                    necessary licences to set up and run the OTC in Bangladesh, while Virsagi was to\n                    handle the BCA testing of the workers and to mobilise them to work in Singapore\n                    as well as to obtain approval from the Ministry of Manpower for their employment\n                    in Singapore.",
        "Events leading up to the dispute": "10     According to Victor, Woon and Badel met in\n                    Singapore in 2010. At that meeting, they agreed to operate the OTC to the\n                    exclusion of Virsagi. It appears that Victor found out about that. He told the\n                    parties that he intended in any case to retire from the OTC business and invited\n                    them to buy him out instead. 11     The parties worked out a scheme pursuant to\n                    which Virsagi would provide the requisite training to Welltech to take over the\n                    business, and Victor would also sell his 40% share in WTPL to Badel. This\n                    arrangement was later abandoned, because Victor took issue with Gazipur working\n                    together with a person named Mr Taneem Hasan in the OTC business in Dhaka.\n                    While the buyout negotiations continued, the parties agreed to extend the\n                    Principal Agreement, which was due to expire on 31 December 2010, by\n                    another year, to 31 December 2011. It was not extended further\n                    thereafter. 12     In the event, the buyout negotiations failed.\n                    Virsagi wrote to Welltech on 14 December 2011 threatening legal action if\n                    it continued to be excluded from the OTC business.",
        "The Bangladesh proceedings": "13     Victor (since the shareholder in WTPL is\n                    Victor and not Virsagi) commenced legal action in Company Matter No 8 of\n                    2012 (“CM 8/2012”) on 5 January 2012 in the Supreme\n                    Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division (Statutory Original Jurisdiction) in\n                    Dhaka (“Dhaka High Court”) seeking orders concerning WTPL. Victor\n                    claimed that the other majority shareholders were carrying out the business of\n                    an OTC and mobilising workers with other parties without the participation of\n                    WTPL and Victor/Virsagi. Victor made an application under s 233 of the\n                    Companies Act (Bangladesh) 1994 (Act No 18 of 1994) (“Bangladesh\n                    Companies Act”) and sought from the Dhaka High Court: (a)     a direction that the other\n                        shareholders of WTPL are “to continue their business as an [OTC] in\n                        Bangladesh through [WTPL] with the active participation of the\n                        petitioner”; and (b)     pending the disposal of CM 8/2012, an ad-interim\n                        order restraining Woon and Badel “from doing [OTC] business in\n                        Bangladesh for export of manpower to Singapore by themselves, or through any\n                        company in which they are an officer or a shareholder, except through the\n                        [OTC] operated by [WTPL] and with the active participation of the\n                            petitioner”.[note: 2] 14     On 9 January 2012, Victor obtained the\n                    ad-interim order (see above at [13(b)]) from the Dhaka High Court restraining\n                    Welltech and Gazipur from conducting the OTC business in Bangladesh for export\n                    of manpower to Singapore by themselves or through any company except WTPL, and\n                    with the active participation of Victor (“the Dhaka Order”). The\n                    Dhaka Order was then stayed on 15 January 2012 pursuant to an application\n                    made by Badel in Bangladesh. 15     CM 8/2012 was heard by the Dhaka High\n                    Court on 15 and 16 April 2012, and a written judgment was delivered on\n                    21 June 2012 dismissing Victor’s application. Victor appealed against\n                    the Dhaka High Court’s decision and that appeal was still pending at the\n                    time we heard the present appeals.",
        "The proceedings in Singapore": "16     On 26 January 2012, after the Dhaka Order\n                    was stayed but before CM 8/2012 was heard by the Dhaka High Court, Virsagi\n                    commenced Suit No 63 of 2012 (“Suit 63”) and Suit\n                    No 64 of 2012 (“Suit 64”) in the Singapore\n                    courts. 17     Suit 63 was an action by Virsagi against\n                    Welltech for inducing Badel to breach the Gazipur Agreement and for unlawful\n                    interference with the Gazipur Agreement. Virsagi sought,inter alia, an injunction to restrain Welltech from further\n                    interference with the Gazipur Agreement, an order that Virsagi be allowed to\n                    resume its scope of work under the Gazipur Agreement, damages, and an account of\n                    profits. 18     Suit 64 was an action by Virsagi against\n                    Badel for breach of contract seeking,inter alia,\n                    an injunction to restrain Badel from terminating the Gazipur Agreement, an order\n                    that Virsagi be allowed to resume its scope of work under the Gazipur Agreement,\n                    damages, and an account of profits.",
        "The decision in the court below": "19     The Judge stayed both Suit 63 and\n                    Suit 64 on the grounds of bothlis alibi\n                        pendens(however, see below at [41] on the correct terminology to\n                    be used) as well asforum non\n                conveniens. 20     The Judge found that although the causes of\n                    action of the various proceedings were different, the reliefs claimed against\n                    Welltech and Gazipur by Virsagi in both jurisdictions were substantially the\n                    same. In particular, Virsagi wanted to ensure that Welltech and Badel could only\n                    carry on the OTC business in Bangladesh with Virsagi’s involvement. On\n                    this basis, the Judge found that the proceedings in both jurisdictions concerned\n                    the same issues. The Judge also held that the issues arose from the same factual\n                    matrix. In addition, the Judge said (see the GD at [27]) that the common issues\n                    before both the Singapore and Dhaka courts, were as follows: (a)     whether Virsagi was “entitled\n                        to insist that Badel/Gazipur continue with the Gazipur Agreement when the\n                        Principal Agreement has been validly terminated”;\n                    and (b)     “in\n                        these circumstances, whether Welltech and Badel/Gazipur could carry on OTC\n                        business in Dhaka without involving Virsagi”. 21     The Judge added that even if the issue oflis alibi pendenshad been the only issue\n                    before him, he would have been prepared to grant a stay of Suit 63 and\n                    Suit 64 on the facts as they appeared at that stage of the\n                    proceedings. 22     For completeness, the Judge also found that\n                    Bangladesh was clearly the more appropriate forum to determine the disputes\n                    after considering the principles offorum non\n                        conveniensset out in the leading House of Lords decision ofSpiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd[1987] AC 460 (“theSpiliadaprinciples”) (see the GD at [28]–[38]).",
        "The issues": "23     The issues before this Court were: (a)     Whether the proceedings in\n                        Suit 63 and Suit 64 should be stayed based on the doctrine oflis alibi pendens(however, see below at\n                        [41] on the correct terminology to be used)\n                        (“Issue 1”). (b)     Whether the proceedings in Suit 63 and Suit 64\n                        should be stayed on the ground offorum non\n                            conveniens(“Issue 2”). 24     We should state at the outset that, whilst we\n                    agree wholly with the decision of the Judge with regard to Issue 2, we\n                    respectfully differ from him with regard to Issue 1. Indeed, as we shall\n                    explain in a moment, Issue 1 ought not to have been canvassed in the manner\n                    it was in the court below. Further, we are of the view that, in any event, the\n                    Judge’s holding on this particular issue in relation to the facts is\n                    (again, with respect) erroneous. In the circumstances, these grounds of decision\n                    are confined to only these two (related) matters in respect of Issue 1.\n                    Given, however, our decision with regard to Issue 2, we dismissed the\n                    appeals.",
        "Our decision": "",
        "Staying of proceedings on the ground of lis alibi pendens": "25     It will be recalled that the Judge considered\n                    the issue oflis alibi pendensas a distinct issue\n                    in its own right tostay the proceedingsin\n                    Suit 63 and Suit 64. 26     Alis alibi\n                        pendens, translated literally, means an action or suit pending\n                    elsewhere. Strictly speaking, one would utilise the concept of alis alibi pendensonly in relation to\n                    “simultaneous actions pending in [the local court, in this case\n                    Singapore] and in a foreign country between the same parties and involving the\n                    same or similar issues” (seeDicey, Morris and Collins\n                        on the Conflict of Lawsvol 1\n                    (Sweet & Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 12-042). The\n                    more pertinent question in the context of the present judgment is how the\n                    presence of alis alibi pendensaffects the\n                    decision of the court in respect of its exercise of jurisdiction over\n                    proceedings seised in Singapore. Some clarification of the various effects of alis alibi pendensin this regard is\n                    necessary. The effect of a lis alibi pendens on the issue of jurisdiction before\n                the court 27     As a starting point, alis\n                        alibi pendensmay arise in two types of factual situations; as\n                    observed by M Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of this court inYusen Air & Sea Service (S) Ptd Ltd v KLM\n                        Royal Dutch Airlines[1999] 2 SLR(R) 955 (“Yusen Air”) (at [16]): This appeal requires the consideration of the applicable principles\n                        governing a situation where a plaintiff commences two sets of proceedings,\n                        one the local forum and another in a foreign jurisdiction against the\n                        defendant in respect of the same issues arising from the same underlying\n                        factual matrix. Suchlis alibi pendenscan\n                        come about intwo ways: first, where the same plaintiff\n                            sues the same defendant in Singapore and abroad; and second, where the\n                            plaintiff sues the defendant in Singapore and the defendant sues the\n                            plaintiff abroad, orvice versa. [emphasis added] For ease of reference as well as analysis, we will term the first way\n                    “common plaintiff” situations, and the second way “reversed\n                    parties” situations (see the taxonomy used in J D McClean,\n                    “Jurisdiction and Judicial Discretion” (1969) 18 ICLQ 931 at\n                    934). 28     This distinction was held to have a\n                    substantive significance; as further observed by Karthigesu JA (also at [16] inYusen Air): It is settled law that, in the [reversed parties] situation, the existence\n                        of concurrent proceedings in another jurisdiction is only an additional\n                        factor to be considered under the test laid down by the House of Lords inSpiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd[1987] AC 460 (“Spiliada”) in\n                        deciding whether to stay the local proceedings (De\n                            Dampierre v De Dampierre[1988] AC 92;The\n                            Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v Seltron Pte Ltd[1994] 3 SLR(R)\n                        757). However, in the [common plaintiff] situation, the English courts have\n                        taken the view that, except in very unusual circumstances, such a plaintiff\n                        would be put to an election and he would have to decide which jurisdiction\n                        he wishes to pursue his claim. The leading authority on this point is the\n                        judgment of Sir Browne-Wilkinson VC (as he then was) in the case ofAustralian Commercial Research[Australian Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ\n                            McCaughan Merchant Bank Ltd[1989] 3 All ER 65]. 29     Alis alibi\n                        pendenstherefore operates as afactto which our rules on private international law accordlegal significanceby reference to two (and\n                    only two) separate legal doctrines. The first is what we shall term “the\n                    doctrine of forum election”, whilst the second is the more familiar\n                    doctrine offorum non conveniens. It is clear fromYusen Airthat whether the doctrine of forum\n                    election applies, however, is dependent on how thelis alibi\n                        pendenscomes about (ie, whether it\n                    is a common plaintiff or reversed parties type situation). We will elaborate, in\n                    turn, on how each doctrine operates and their legal significance on how the\n                    court will decide a question of jurisdiction when faced with alis alibi pendens. (1)   The doctrine of forum election 30     An application made by the defendant to put\n                    the plaintiff to an election is the first way in which alis\n                        alibi pendensmay affect the jurisdiction of the court under\n                    private international law. This will applyonlyin\n                    acommon plaintiffsituation. The court inYusen Airfurther elaborated (at [27]) on the\n                    approach to be taken in such cases: In our judgment, when a plaintiff sues the same defendant in two or more\n                        different jurisdictions over the same subject matter, the defendant can take\n                        up an application to compel the plaintiff to make an election as to which\n                        set of proceedings he wishes to pursue.For the purposes\n                            of an election, the considerations offorum conveniensdo not come into play. However, the defendant would\n                            need to demonstrate a duplicity of actions in the different\n                            jurisdictions. Once this is established, the burden of proof then shifts\n                            to the plaintiff to justify the continuance of the concurrent\n                            proceedings by showing “very unusual circumstances”. If\n                            the plaintiff fails to demonstrate such unusual circumstances, he would\n                            have to make an election.[emphasis added] It is important to note that the court inYusen\n                        Airmade clear that when the plaintiff is electing which forum to\n                    proceed in, any questions regarding which forum is the more appropriate, or\n                    natural, forum for the dispute to be tried are irrelevant. 31     How then does this process of election operate\n                    within the framework of our private international law rules on jurisdiction? As\n                    Prof Yeo Tiong Min clearly observes (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Conflict of Lawsvol 6(2) (LexisNexis, Singapore, 2009) (“Yeo”) at para 75.094): … [Lis alibi pendens]raises factors either within the test inThe\n                        Spiliada,or within the issue of forum management\n                            generally. Within the framework ofThe\n                            Spiliada, lis alibi pendensraises issues of duplication of\n                        resources, as well as the risk of conflicting judgments. [emphasis\n                        added] The learned author then proceeds to provide the following commentary\n                    on how the doctrine of forum election operates in the context of forum or (as\n                    the learned author terms it) case management (seeYeoat para 75.108): Where a plaintiff is proceeding against the same defendant in two\n                        jurisdictions in relation to the same subject matter,the\n                            court will compel the plaintiff to elect one jurisdiction to pursue the\n                            claim, because the pursuit of such concurrent proceedings will be\n                            regarded as vexatious unless there are very unusual circumstances to\n                            justify it. Once the defendant establishes duplicity of\n                        proceedings, the burden is shifted to the plaintiff to justify continuation\n                        of concurrent proceedings by showing the existence of very unusual\n                        circumstances. One possible justification may be that the parties had\n                        contractually provided for that possibility. If the plaintiff fails to\n                        provide justification, then he would be put to an election.Natural forum considerations are not relevant to the question\n                            of election. Instead, issues of case management are raised.\n                        [emphasis added] 32     We agree with Prof Yeo’s approach.\n                    In a common plaintifflis alibi pendenssituation,\n                    the court, when asking the plaintiff to elect which forum he wishes to proceed\n                    in, isnotdeciding on the appropriateness of the\n                    court in exercising its jurisdiction over the dispute – unlike in the\n                    situation relating to a stay of proceedings where the doctrine offorum non conveniensis applied. That is the reason why\n                    the question of whether Singapore is the natural forum to hear the dispute is\n                    not relevant when the plaintiff is asked to make an election. The court is\n                    merely managing its own process. The reason why a plaintiff should be compelled\n                    to elect in a common plaintiff situation was stated by this court inKoh Kay Yew v Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd[1997]\n                    2 SLR(R) 148 (“Koh Kay Yew”) as\n                    follows (at [22]): In the latter situations [in which a party had commenced actions\n                        concurrently in two jurisdictions], it is understandable that any court\n                        should feel uncomfortable about allowing both actions to go on. Not only\n                        would thesame issue be litigated twice but there would\n                            also be the risk of having two different results, each\n                        conflicting with the other. And these problems would have arisen simply\n                        because one party decided to sue in one place too many. In such\n                        circumstances, courts, including those in Singapore, shouldprevent the inherent abuse of the different judicial systems in\n                            different jurisdictionsby compelling that party to choose\n                        the jurisdiction that he wants to litigate in. The underlying need to\n                        prevent a multiplicity of similar proceedings justifies the courts being\n                        more prepared to grant an injunction. [emphasis added] 33     Karthigesu JA inYusen\n                        Airwas also at pains to point out that the doctrine offorum non conveniensis not superseded by the doctrine\n                    of forum election in common plaintiff cases (at [34]): It is also our considered view that the plaintiff’s election is not\n                        the only way to resolve this issue. Apart from compelling the plaintiff to\n                        elect, it remains open to the defendant to take up an application for a stay\n                        of local proceedings or a restraint of foreign proceedings if the defendant\n                        wishes to have the action tried in one of the jurisdictions where the\n                        plaintiff has commenced an action. 34     Indeed, it seems to us that the doctrine of\n                    forum election in common plaintiff situations oflis alibi\n                        pendensand the doctrine offorum non\n                        conveniensdonotoverlap in any\n                    way on aconceptuallevel. The two principles can\n                    – and do – operate alongside each other, although, practically\n                    speaking, it is perhaps inevitable that the two doctrines will interface with\n                    one another given that they both concern questions of jurisdiction in private\n                    international law. To that end, we highlight certain scenarios of such\n                    interaction between these doctrines. 35     When the plaintiff is put to an election, and\n                    he then elects to continue his claim in Singapore, the court will enjoin the\n                    plaintiff to stop all other foreign proceedings by way of an injunction. At this\n                    juncture, the defendant may be happy for the dispute to be heard in Singapore,\n                    and nothing more needs to be done. However, where the defendant does not want\n                    proceedings to continue in Singapore, it is open to it to rely on the doctrine\n                    offorum non conveniensto argue that the overseas\n                    forum is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum for the dispute to be\n                    heard, and therefore to have the Singapore proceedings stayed. This is clear\n                    from the observations of Karthigesu JA inYusen\n                        Air(see above at [33]). 36     On the other hand, if the plaintiff elects to\n                    pursue its claim in the overseas forum (instead of in Singapore) but the\n                    defendant wants the proceedings to continue in Singapore, the latter may seek an\n                    anti-suit injunction from the Singapore courts to prevent the plaintiff from\n                    carrying on with the foreign proceedings. The plaintiff’s election does\n                    not,ipso facto, preclude the granting of such an\n                    injunction. Where, however, the defendant is happy to have the dispute heard\n                    abroad, it would have (in substance) obtained the same outcome pursuant to an\n                    application to stay proceedings under the doctrine offorum\n                        non conveniens. It has been said that in such a situation the\n                    court willdiscontinuethe local proceedings\n                    (rather than just grant a stay): see the English High Court decision ofAustralian Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ\n                        McCaughan Merchant Bank Ltd[1989] 3 All ER 65\n                        (“Australian Commercial\n                    Research”) at [70] as well asYusen\n                        Airat [32] (citing Smart, “Lis Alibi\n                        Pendens: Staying or Discontinuing English Proceedings”\n                    [1990] LMCLQ 326 at 329)). However, we take the view that the court is not\n                    restricted to discontinuing the local proceedings, and may, in theappropriate circumstances, grant a stay of proceedings\n                    instead. This might be the case where the foreign court’s jurisdiction is\n                    being challenged (see, for example, the English High Court decision ofAG v Arthur Andersen & CoThe Independent\n                    (31 March 1988) andYusen Airat [32]), or\n                    where the action in Singapore is brought to obtain security by way of aMarevainjunction or attachment of assets\n                    (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision ofMulti-Code Electronics Industries (M) Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon\n                        and others[2009] 1 SLR(R) 1000 (“Multi-Code Electronics”)). 37     It should therefore be clear that the doctrine\n                    of forum election, as a mechanism of case management, is never finally\n                    dispositive of where the dispute will be heard unless the defendant has no\n                    objections to the plaintiff’s election. (2)Lis alibi pendensas part of\n                the doctrine offorum non conveniens 38     The second effect alis\n                        alibi pendenswill have on a question of jurisdiction is under\n                    the rubric of the doctrine offorum non conveniens(pursuant to theSpiliadaprinciples). This will\n                    apply regardless of how thelis alibi pendensarises (ie, whether as a result of a common\n                    plaintiff or reversed parties case). In a reversed parties situation, this is\n                    the only way alis alibi pendenscan have any\n                    legal significance for the purposes of jurisdiction. The doctrine of forum\n                    electiondoes notapply. In a common plaintifflis alibi pendenssituation, where the\n                    defendant wishes to stay proceedings under the doctrine offorum non conveniens, thelis alibi\n                        pendenswill (just as in a reversed parties situation) feature as\n                    one of the factors in deciding whether it is appropriate for the Singapore court\n                    to hear the dispute. It should be noted at this juncture, however, that there\n                    could be situations which relate toparallel\n                        proceedingswhich might not necessarily fall within the narrower\n                    compass of alis alibi pendens(see above at [26]\n                    and later below at [46]–[47]). Such proceedings would equally constitute\n                    one of the factors in the application of theSpiliadaprinciples (see, for example, the decisions of this\n                    court inCIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [70] andRickshaw\n                        Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [90]; as well asYeoat para 75.094 (see below at [39])). 39     Accordingly, when alis\n                        alibi pendensoperates within the doctrine offorum non conveniens, it must be considered in light of the\n                    general principles applicable to theforum non\n                        conveniensanalysis (viz, theSpiliadaprinciples). In this regard,\n                    Prof Yeo provides helpful guidance on the weight to be given to parallel\n                    proceedings generally (including situations oflis alibi\n                        pendens) (seeYeoat\n                    para 75.094): The weight to be given to the fact of existence of parallel proceedings\n                        will depend on the circumstances. The degree to which the respective\n                        proceedings have advanced is an important consideration; although the\n                        advanced stage of proceedings may be disregarded if proceedings had been\n                        deliberately advanced at the insistence of the party seeking to rely on this\n                        as a factor.The degree of overlap of issues and parties is another\n                        consideration. However, little ornoweight\n                        will be given to fact that there are foreign proceedings if they are\n                        commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the case of a clearly more\n                        appropriate forum elsewhere. Where there has been or is litigation involving very complex facts which\n                        call for highly specialised expert evidence, and such expertise has been\n                        built up in a particular jurisdiction, that could be a very important\n                        indication of the prima facie natural forum. This factor, discussed inThe Spiliada, came to be known as theCambridgeshirefactor (named after the\n                        vessel involved in the prior proceedings where the expertise had been\n                        developed), is recognised as a highly exceptional factor and has rarely been\n                        applied since then. The risk of conflicting judgments arising from concurrent proceedings is\n                        another factor to consider, but it is not decisive and will need to be\n                        weighed with other factors. If it is a straight competition between\n                        proceedings in the forum and proceedings elsewhere, this factor should carry\n                        no weight, because the only question before the court is whether it should\n                        exercise its own jurisdiction and it has no control over foreign\n                        proceedings. Of course, ideally the trial should be held at only one of the\n                        competing fora, but trial in either forum alone will obviate the risk.\n                        However, the problem usually arises in the context of complex litigation\n                        involving multiple issues and/or multiple litigants. [emphasis added] 40     It bears emphasis that, for the purposes of\n                    the doctrine offorum non conveniens, it is\n                    sufficient for there to be related (or parallel) proceedings (as compared to a\n                    strictlis alibi pendens(see above at [26] as\n                    well as below at [46]–[47])) in order for the foreign proceedings to weigh\n                    into the analysis of appropriateness. This is a sensible approach to take, given\n                    that the existence of parallel proceedings is never wholly dispositive of the\n                    issue of the natural forum as a matter of course, but is only a factor to be\n                    considered in the application of theSpiliadaprinciples. (3)   Summary and further considerations 41     We reiterate that alis\n                        alibi pendenswill affect how the court would deal with an issue\n                    of jurisdiction to hear proceedings seised in Singapore in two ways: the first,\n                    pursuant to common plaintifflis alibi pendenssituations, where the doctrine of forum election will be applicable; and,\n                    second, as part of the application of the doctrine offorum\n                        non conveniens(pursuant to theSpiliadaprinciples), regardless of whether it is a common\n                    plaintiff or reversed parties situation. We note that in some prior cases, and\n                    indeed in the present case at first instance, the first way has been referred to\n                    as “the doctrine oflis alibi\n                    pendens” (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions\n                    ofAng Ming Chuang v Singapore Airlines Ltd (Civil\n                        Aeronautics Administration, Third Party)[2005] 1 SLR(R)\n                    409;Tan Kah Hock and Another v Chou Li Chen and\n                        Others[2008] SGHC 82 andMulti-Code\n                        Electronics). It should be clear by now that such an approach is\n                    terminologically confusing, and might (unfortunately) lead to confusion (as well\n                    as conflation) of substantive legal principles. We are therefore of the view\n                    that it is best for common plaintifflis alibi\n                        pendenssituations which raise the issue of forum election (as it\n                    has been in these grounds of decision) to be referred to as the doctrine of\n                    forum election instead. 42     The doctrine of forum election operates by\n                    putting the plaintiff to an election once the defendant has established that\n                    there is alis alibi pendens, unless the plaintiff\n                    can demonstrate why the multiple proceedings are justified. This is to ensure\n                    that the defendant is not vexed or oppressed by the plaintiff’s abuse of\n                    the court process. As demonstrated above, it is clear that this is a separate\n                    analytical framework from that offorum non\n                        conveniens, and the two do not elide on a conceptual\n                    level. 43     However, some aspects of the doctrine of forum\n                    election and its relationship to the principles in relation toforum non conveniensas well as anti-suit injunctions do\n                    raise some issues of concern. Does a common plaintiff situation where the\n                    plaintiff is unable to show unusual circumstances mean that there is,prima facie, vexation and oppression to the defendant?\n                    Should this have an effect on how vexation and oppression operate in the context\n                    of anti-suit injunctions (see, for example,Koh Kay\n                        Yewas well as the Singapore High Court decision ofBeckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another[2011]\n                    1 SLR 524)? Why doesforum electionresult,\n                    by default, in a discontinuance of proceedings if the plaintiff elects to\n                    proceed overseas, rather than, say, a stay of proceedings? We need not address\n                    these (problematic) questions in the context of the present appeal, given our\n                    decision onthe facts of the present appeal(ie, that the doctrine of forum election could\n                    not have resulted in a stay of proceedings, and that there was nolis alibi pendenson the facts of the present case\n                    although the doctrine offorum non conveniensnevertheless applied in favour of the Respondents). These questions can be dealt\n                    with when they next arise directly for decision by the court. It is, instead, to\n                    our findings on the facts in relation to the present appeal which our attention\n                    must now turn.",
        "The doctrine of forum election applied to the facts of the present\n                case": "44     In the present case, Welltech and Gazipur both\n                    sought tostay proceedingson the ground oflis alibi pendens, relying on the principles\n                    set out inYusen Air. The Judge referred toYusen Airin his decision, but did not raise\n                    the issue of the plaintiff making an election as such. In fairness, this was\n                    probably appropriate, given that Welltech and Gazipur only sought to have the\n                    proceedings in Singapore stayed. Furthermore, the proceedings in Bangladesh were\n                    decided against Victor, and it would be practically certain that Virsagi, if put\n                    to an election, would have chosen to continue proceedings in Singapore. If that\n                    was the case, however, the Judge must, with respect, be mistaken in observing\n                    that he would havestayed the proceedingson the\n                    ground of the doctrine of forum election had it been the only issue before him.\n                    The only way that the proceedings in Singapore could have been stayed if Virsagi\n                    had elected to proceed with its claim in Singapore would be by Welltech and\n                    Badel demonstrating that there was a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere\n                    pursuant to the doctrine offorum non\n                    conveniens.",
        "No lis alibi pendens on the facts of the present case": "45     As also indicated earlier, it is,in any event, clear that there was nolis alibi pendenson the facts of the present case. In this\n                    regard, it is important to be clear what precisely constitutes alis alibi pendens, especially since the case law does\n                    not evidence a uniform manner of assessment. 46     InYusen Air,\n                    the Court of Appeal appeared to focus on three things: the identity of the\n                    parties, the issues arising from both sets of proceedings, and the underlying\n                    factual matrix giving rise to these issues. In most cases, these three factors\n                    will be considered. However, some decisions have considered the causes of action\n                    and reliefs sought by parties in the various proceedings in order to determine\n                    whether or not there was alis alibi pendens(see,\n                    for example, the Singapore High Court decisions ofTranstech\n                        Electronics Pte Ltd v Choe Jerry and others[1998]\n                    1 SLR(R) 1014 at [12] andLanna Resources Public Co\n                        Ltd v Tan Beng Phiau Dick and another[2011] 1 SLR 543\n                        (“Lanna Resources”) at [16]).\n                    Indeed that was the approach taken by the Judge in the court below; in\n                    particular, he considered the similar reliefs sought by the parties important in\n                    his finding that there was alis alibi\n                    pendens. 47     We are of the view that in deciding whether\n                    there is alis alibi pendens, the first legal port\n                    of call ought to be the identity of the parties and the causes of action\n                    concerned. This will enable to court to identify whether there are same or\n                    similar issues arising from the same factual matrix which are before both the\n                    local and foreign court(s), and, if so, the extent of these similarities. The\n                    nature of the reliefs sought will be relevant to the analysis, given that in\n                    most cases the reliefs sought and the causes of action concerned will be\n                    inextricably linked with each other. However, the court ought not to hold,\n                    without more, that the local and foreign court(s) are faced with the same or\n                    similar issues by focusing merely on the reliefs sought – for example,\n                    whether the claimant is entitled to the same quantum of damages as a remedy. As\n                    for the degree of similarity necessary, the party seeking to demonstrate that\n                    there is alis alibi pendensneed not show a total\n                    correspondence of issues, but the court will be more likely to find alis alibi pendenswhere the issues are of a greater\n                    degree of similarity. The identity of the parties 48     Turning to the facts of the present appeal, it\n                    is clear that the parties in the Singapore and Bangladesh proceedings werenotthe same. In Singapore, the plaintiff was\n                    Virsagi while the defendants were Welltech and Badel/Gazipur. In Bangladesh, the\n                    plaintiff was Victor while the defendants were WTPL, Woon and Badel. Arguments\n                    were made by Welltech and Badel, initially, at first instance, that the parties\n                    are effectively the same, but this was not taken any further by the Judge since\n                    counsel for Virsagi conceded this point subsequently. The causes of action and issues raised 49     It will be recalled that in Suit 63,\n                    Virsagi claimed that Welltech was liable for the tort of inducing breach of\n                    contract, or alternatively, for the tort of unlawful interference with the\n                    Gazipur Agreement. Some of the issues which need to be addressed in order to\n                    establish the validity of the claim in Suit 63 would include the\n                    following: (a)     whether the Gazipur Agreement is\n                        valid; (b)     whether\n                        the Gazipur Agreement is not illegal or in restraint of trade or is capable\n                        of being rescinded; (c)     whether Welltech had knowledge of the existence of the Gazipur\n                        Agreement; (d)     whether Welltech intended to interfere with Gazipur’s performance of\n                        the Gazipur Agreement; (e)     whether Gazipur breached the Gazipur Agreement (which is\n                        the issue to be decided in Suit 64); (f)     whether Welltech has committed an unlawful act\n                        affecting Gazipur; (g)     whether Welltech did so intending to injure Virsagi;\n                    and (h)     whether Virsagi\n                        suffered any loss. 50     In Suit 64, Virsagi claimed that Gazipur\n                    had breached the Gazipur Agreement, and the main issues related to the\n                    construction of certain clauses in the contract, as well as whether there were\n                    breaches of those clauses. 51     On the other hand, CM 8/2012 was\n                    commenced by Victor in Dhaka pursuant to s 233 of the Bangladesh Companies\n                    Act, which provides for the protection of minority shareholder interests. The\n                    main issue was whether Victor, as the petitioner in the action, was\n                    “entitled to get any relief under the Provisions of Section 233 of\n                    the Companies Act 1994”.[note: 3]The only issue for the Dhaka High Court to decide in CM 8/2012 was whether\n                    relief in the form of a direction to the other shareholders of WTPL “...\n                    to continue their business as an [OTC] in Bangladesh through [WTPL] with the\n                    active participation of the petitioner” should be granted.[note: 4]The subsidiary issues\n                    arising from this main issue were identified by Abdur Rahman J in his\n                    written judgment (at pp 21–22) where it was found that WTPL was a\n                    non-functioning company. The OTC setup in Bangladesh was not established under\n                    WTPL and was instead owned and run by Victor and Badel under the terms of the\n                    Gazipur Agreement. Finally, the lending of the BCA licence by Welltech\n                    (represented by Woon) to establish and run the OTC business in Dhaka had nothing\n                    to do with WTPL.[note: 5] 52     Therefore, it is clear, in our view, that the\n                    causes of action in Suit 63, Suit 64, and CM 8/2012 were entirely\n                    different, and did not give rise to the same issues. The Singapore court in\n                    deciding Suit 63 and Suit 64 would not have to traverse much of the\n                    grounds considered in CM 8/2012. The reliefs sought by the parties 53     We agree with the Judge that the injunctive\n                    relief sought in both sets of proceedings were similar in substance.\n                    Victor/Virsagi was seeking not to be excluded from the OTC business now\n                    conducted by Gazipur and Welltech, whether by way of specific performance of the\n                    Gazipur Agreement or through relief for the action of minority shareholder\n                    oppression. Conclusion 54     Considering all the factors, we found that\n                    there was insufficient similarity between the Singapore and the Bangladesh\n                    proceedings and that there was therefore nolis alibi\n                        pendensin the context of the present proceedings\n                    (notwithstanding our agreement with the Judge’s decision regarding the\n                    similarity of reliefs sought). Welltech and Badel were not subject to vexation\n                    or oppression by Virsagi bringing Suit 63 and Suit 64, respectively,\n                    in Singapore. 55     We should note, however, that even if there\n                    was nolis alibi pendenson the facts of the\n                    present case, this did not mean that there were no parallel or related\n                    proceedings. There were, undoubtedly, parallel or related proceedings in both\n                    Bangladesh as well as Singapore. These proceedings would be (and, in fact were)\n                    considered as a factor to be applied in relation to the doctrine offorum non conveniens, which constituted Issue 2 in\n                    the present case and which we have decided in both Welltech’s and\n                    Gazipur’s favour, in agreement with the Judge.",
        "Conclusion": "56     For the reasons set out above, we held that\n                    the Judge, with respect, was mistaken with regards to Issue 1, and should\n                    not have stayed proceedings on the ground oflis alibi\n                        pendens(or rather, the doctrine of forum\n                election). 57     Notwithstanding our decision on Issue 1,\n                    as already noted above, given our decision on Issue 2, we dismissed the\n                    appeals. However, in light of our decision on Issue 1, the costs awarded in\n                    the court below of $4,000 to Welltech and $8,000 to Badel/Gazipur were each\n                    reduced by fifty per cent. As for the costs of CA 90 and CA 91, we\n                    respectively awarded Welltech and Badel/Gazipur the costs of these appeals fixed\n                    at $7,500 (including disbursements) each. The usual consequential orders\n                    applied.  [note: 1]Respondent’s Supplementary Core Bundle at\n                                pp 7–8.
