        "The facts": "2.    The facts giving rise to the charge\n\nwere largely undisputed and they were as follows. On 25 September 1999, at about 10.25am,\n\nthe appellant drove a Malaysian registered car MS 1265 (the car) into Singapore’s\n\nWoodlands Immigration and Customs Checkpoint from Johore Bahru, Malaysia. Having cleared\n\nImmigration, he proceeded to the Customs area through the Green channel. At the Primary\n\nInspection Bay, Customs Officer Muhamad Yazid Bin Haidi (CO Yazid) directed him to proceed\n\nto the Secondary Inspection Bay, where upon request he opened the boot of his car and\n\nlifted the carpet on the floor of the boot. Underneath the carpet was a circular metallic\n\ndepressed area which was the spare tyre compartment. Six packets, wrapped in newspapers,\n\nwere tucked in the upper gap between the spare tyre and the spare tyre compartment. Upon\n\nseeing those packets, CO Yazid asked the appellant in Malay ‘apa ini’\n\n(‘what is this’). There was a dispute as to the reply of the appellant.\n\nAccording to CO Yazid, the appellant answered in Malay that he did not know. In\n\nexamination-in-chief, the appellant said he did not mention anything about medicine. But\n\nin cross-examination and in re-examination he alleged that he said it was\n\n‘ubat’, meaning medicine.3.    CO Yazid then took out one of the\n\npackets and instructed the appellant to remove the newspaper wrapping. This was complied\n\nwith. What was inside the wrapping was a transparent plastic packet containing a yellowish\n\ngranular substance. CO Yazid, suspecting it was drugs, asked the appellant in Malay what\n\nthe substance was. According to CO Yazid, the appellant again answered in Malay that he\n\ndid not know.4.    CO Yazid then took the unwrapped\n\npacket of yellowish granular substance and escorted the appellant to the Customs Green\n\nChannel Duty Office. Before moving away from the car, CO Yazid had the boot of the car\n\nlocked. At the office, Senior Customs Officer Mohamed Ahmad Ibrahim (SCO Ibrahim)\n\nreferring to the packet, asked the appellant in Malay, ‘apa barang ini’\n\n(‘what is this thing’). The appellant remained silent. SCO Ibrahim asked again\n\n‘drug kah’ (‘is it drug’). What was again in dispute was the reply of\n\nthe appellant. According to SCO Ibrahim, the appellant answered ‘wah agak’\n\n(‘I think so’). In cross-examination it was put to SCO Ibrahim that the\n\nappellant had replied ‘wah agak ubat’ (‘I think medicine’). SCO\n\nIbrahim testified that he only heard the words ‘wah agak’.5.    SCO Ibrahim then seized the packet\n\nand had the appellant handcuffed. Thereafter, SCO Ibrahim, CO Yazid and the appellant\n\nreturned to the car MS 1265, together with Superintendent of Customs Wee Hong Lock (SC\n\nWee). The boot of the car was searched and the remaining five newspaper-wrapped packets\n\ncontaining yellowish granular substance were seized. All six packets were then placed in a\n\ncarton box.6.    The appellant was then brought to a\n\nnearby office for a body search. The search by SCO Ibrahim revealed four airmail envelopes\n\nhidden in the appellant’s socks – two on each leg. The four envelopes contained\n\na total of 16 sachets of yellowish granular substance. SC Wee asked the appellant in\n\nMandarin what the substance was, but the appellant kept silent.7.    The six plastic packets and 16\n\nsachets of yellowish granular substance were sent to the Department of Scientific Services\n\nfor analysis. They were found to contain a total nett weight of 139.27 grams of\n\ndiamorphine.8.    After his arrest and while in remand\n\nat the Queenstown Remand Prison, the appellant cut his own wrists. According to Dr Stephen\n\nPhang Boon Chye, Associate Consultant at the Institute of Mental Health, who examined the\n\nappellant after the cut, he did not find any psychotic or depressive symptomatology in the\n\nappellant. In his opinion, the appellant was not suffering from any mental illness. In\n\nfact, according to Dr Phang, the appellant told Dr Phang that he cut his own wrists out of\n\na sense of frustration and distress upon realizing that he would be facing the death\n\nsentence for drug trafficking. In the view of Dr Phang, what the appellant experienced was\n\n\"a transient but understandable and not unexpected reaction to a stressful life\n\ncircumstances.\" Dr Phang was called as a witness by the defence.",
        "Statements made by the appellant": "9.    Altogether three statements were made\n\nby the appellant to the police and they were put in evidence by the prosecution. The\n\nappellant did not challenge that the statements were voluntarily made by him. The first\n\nwas an oral statement made by him on 25 September 1999 which was reduced into writing. In\n\nthis statement, the appellant in gist said that someone by the name ‘Ang Moh’\n\nasked him to carry those packets into Singapore. He knew they were illegal things but he\n\nagreed because he needed money. He himself placed the packets in the boot of the car. He\n\nalso gave these answers which we would like to quote:-\"Q: When you placed these things and\n\n  saw them, were you aware what was inside?A: I did not pay attention. I placed them\n\n  there after he gave to me.Q: Do you have anything more to say?A: I know what I did is an offence, but I\n\n  did not know how serious it could be. Because things had to be hidden are\n\n  questionable.\"10.    In the second statement, which the\n\nappellant gave on the same day but under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), he\n\nmerely stated:-\"Firstly, it is because I owe\n\n  people’s money. Secondly, my son is mad. Need money to support him. I did not know it\n\n  is a serious offence. That was why I did not hide the drugs. That is all I want to\n\n  say.\"11.    The third statement was a long\n\nstatement made by him under s 121(1) of the CPC where he gave a more detailed account of\n\nhow he came to be in possession of the packets and what he thought they were. The relevant\n\nportions read:-4. About a month ago, in August 1999, I\n\n  met a male Chinese called \"Ang Moh\". I met him at \"Sakura\" coffeehouse\n\n  in Johore. I told him I needed money. He said he could help me …5. One week later, Ang Moh called me. We\n\n  met at \"Sakura\" coffeehouse. He knew I went in and out of Singapore quite often.\n\n  He asked me to bring into Singapore prohibited medicines. I asked him how much he was\n\n  going to pay me. He told me I would get 300RM for one packet of about 400 grams. He told\n\n  me these medicines were to help heroin addict to stop the urge for heroin. I asked him\n\n  what happened if I got arrested. Ang Moh said at the most, I would be fined and the\n\n  medicines confiscated. If fined, I would pay the fines from my own money.6. On 24thSep 1999, Friday,\n\n  Ang Moh called at 2 p.m. asking me to go to Sakura to pick up something from him\n\n  …….9. When I reached home, I opened the\n\n  car-boot, opened the red bag. I saw six packets of stony substances that were not sealed\n\n  properly. So I stapled them properly. I then used Chinese newspapers to wrap the 6\n\n  packets. One piece of the newspapers to wrap one packet. I also saw four envelopes. I did\n\n  not open them but I knew there were 16 sachets of substances as \"Ang Moh\" had\n\n  told me. These 16 sachets were already sealed properly. I put all the 6 packets and the 4\n\n  envelopes back into the red bag, put the red bag into the car-boot. I then went to sleep.10. The next day, on 25thSep\n\n  1999 (Saturday) ….. I took the red bag from the car-boot of Honda Accord JBV 3606 and\n\n  put it into the car-boot of a white Madza MS 1265. Just before leaving my house, I took\n\n  out from the red bag the 4 envelopes. I put 4 envelopes into my socks. I put 2 envelopes\n\n  containing 5 sachets each into the sock of my right leg. I put 2 envelopes containing 5\n\n  sachets and one sachet into the sock of my left leg. I did not use the red bag anymore. I\n\n  put the 6 packets of stony substances already wrapped with newspapers along the spare\n\n  tyre. I then covered the spare tyre with the car-boot carpet. I did not bother to hide too\n\n  well, as I thought the most, these things would be confiscated.12.    In his oral testimony in court, the\n\nappellant repeated the defence raised in his statements, namely, that he did not know the\n\ntrue nature of the substance he was bringing into Singapore on behalf of Ang Moh. He was\n\nmisled by Ang Moh. He thought it was Chinese medicine.",
        "Decision of the trial judge": "13.    The learned trial judge, Judicial\n\nCommissioner Amarjeet Singh, rejected the claim of ignorance. He did not believe that the\n\nappellant really thought that the substance he was bringing into Singapore was Chinese\n\nmedicine which helped heroin addicts curb their urge for heroin. He held that the\n\nappellant had failed to rebut on a balance of probabilities the statutory presumption of\n\nknowledge of the true nature of the substance. There was no basis for the appellant to\n\nplace trust in what Ang Moh said bearing in mind the circumstances under which the\n\nsubstance was being passed from Ang Moh to the appellant to be brought here. The trial\n\njudge noted that as far as the appellant knew, Ang Moh did not run or own a Chinese\n\nmedicine shop. He did not even know where Ang Moh lived or what his contact number was. No\n\nevidence was adduced to show that there was in fact a type of Chinese medicine that was\n\nknown for helping heroin addicts.14.    As regard the appellant’s claim\n\nin cross-examination that he told CO Yazid, when the latter opened the boot of the car and\n\nnoticed the six packets, that they were medicines, the trial judge noted that he did not\n\nmake such a claim during examination-in-chief. The trial judge did not accept this\n\nassertion as it was never put to CO Yazid that the appellant told him that what were in\n\nthe packets were medicines. The trial judge, having regard to Dr Phang’s evidence,\n\nalso did not accept counsel’s claim that the appellant had a dull mind and could\n\neasily be duped.",
        "The appeal": "15.    In the appeal before us, counsel for\n\nthe appellant reiterated the same contention which was made before the trial judge, i.e.,\n\nthat he did not know that the substance he brought into Singapore was diamorphine. It is\n\nsettled law that for an accused person to be guilty of drug trafficking it must be shown\n\nnot only that he brought the drugs into Singapore, it must also be shown that he knew or\n\nintended to bring those drugs into the country: seeNg Kwok Chun & Anor v PP[1993] 1 SLR 55.16.    In the present case, the physical\n\nact of bringing the diamorphine into Singapore was not in dispute It had been proved. In\n\nany case, the appellant did not challenge that he was in possession of the drugs. By\n\nvirtue of s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, he was presumed to have knowledge of the\n\nnature of the drugs. Thus, the burden shifted to the appellant to rebut the presumption on\n\na balance of probabilities.17.    The appellant relied upon two\n\nprevious cases to contend that the trial judge should have found that he had sufficiently\n\nrebutted the presumption of knowledge. We would observe that this issue is really one of\n\nfact and how a trial judge would determine it must necessarily depend on the evidence and\n\nthe circumstances of the case. On a question of fact, no decision on any one case can ever\n\nbe a precedent for another as the facts could hardly be identical. The only essential\n\nsimilarity between this case and the two cases referred to by the appellant,PP v HL\n\nWin[1995] 2 SLR 424, andPP v Khampali Suchart(unreported Cr Appeal 8/96), is\n\nthat in those two cases, the accused persons also claimed that they thought the things\n\nthey were asked to carry were something else and that they had been misled. The trial\n\njudges in those two cases accepted their explanations and acquitted them and the\n\nacquittals were upheld on appeal. There the similarity ends. The other relevant facts were\n\nquite different.18.    It cannot be over-emphasised that by\n\nits very nature, every assertion of ignorance by an accused person facing such a charge\n\nwould have to be scrutinized in the light of all the surrounding circumstances. He has to\n\nsatisfy the judge, on a balance of probabilities, that his claim of ignorance is genuine.\n\nThe trial judge in the present case did carefully consider both cases and found them to be\n\n\"readily distinguishable\" on the facts.19.    It was clear to us that in the\n\npresent case, the trial judge in coming to his conclusion did carefully examine the\n\nevidence and every significant point which the appellant had raised. First, he noted that\n\nthe appellant had ample opportunity to check and ascertain the nature of the substance he\n\nwas asked to carry (he left for Singapore the day after receiving the substance from Ang\n\nMoh). The circumstances under which the appellant got the substance were so suspicious\n\nthat any reasonable person would have made an effort to verify what Ang Moh had said.\n\nSecondly, he found that the appellant was not a dull person as alleged by his counsel.\n\nWhile it is true that he only completed primary VI in a Chinese school, he had worked as\n\nan insurance/house agent, a car salesman and a horse bookie. In his passport it was stated\n\nthat he was a contractor. The trial judge had also closely observed the appellant when he\n\ngave evidence. He did not find the appellant \"slow of understanding, obtuse or\n\nstupid.\" Thirdly, though the appellant claimed that he knew Ang Moh (\"red\n\nhair\") some three years ago, he did not know his real name or where Ang Moh lived or\n\nwhat was his contact telephone number. He had no means of contacting him. Neither did he\n\nask Ang Moh for these particulars. Presumably, it was to show that he knew Ang Moh for\n\nsome three years and could trust him that the appellant alleged that a loan of MR500 which\n\nhe gave to Ang Moh three years ago was repaid some days before the incident. On the\n\ncontrary, the trial judge observed that the fact that Ang Moh had delayed repaying his\n\ndebt for some three years (assuming the sum was in fact lent) should have alerted the\n\nappellant that he should be slow to trust Ang Moh. Fourthly, when CO Yazid saw the six\n\npackets upon opening the boot of the vehicle and lifting the floor carpet, the appellant\n\ndid not tell the Custom Officer that that was ‘ubat’. He also found that when\n\nSCO Ibrahim asked the appellant if the substance was drugs, he answered \"I think\n\nso\" which he rightfully took it to mean \"yes\". Fifthly, the trial judge\n\ncould not accept his explanation that he did not think the substance was diamorphine\n\nbecause he thought diamorphine was powdery white whereas the colour of the substance was\n\nyellow. He felt that the appellant was merely taking advantage of a literal interpretation\n\nof the Hokkien expression in referring to diamorphine as \"peh hoon\", meaning\n\nwhite powder, to substantiate his point. After all, the appellant said that he had never\n\nseen \"peh hoon\" before. Sixthly, while it was true that he also intended to come\n\nto Singapore to collect an insurance premium from a client, the trial judge found that\n\nthat was merely incidental to the main object of bringing the diamorphine into Singapore\n\nfor which he would be paid MR2000/-. Seventhly, in the light of Dr Phang’s evidence,\n\nthe trial judge held that the appellant cut his wrists not because he felt he was duped\n\nbut because of emotional despair in failing to successfully import the drugs into\n\nSingapore and having to face a charge which carried the extreme penalty.20.    In the light of the evidence which\n\nwas before the trial judge, it was our judgment that he was amply justified to have found\n\nthat the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. We would only\n\nhighlight three striking aspects of the case which undoubtedly demonstrated that the\n\nappellant’s claim that he thought the substance was Chinese medicine could not be\n\ntrue. First, why didn’t the appellant, upon being asked by CO Yazid what the six\n\npackets were, answer that they were Chinese medicine and instead answered that he did not\n\nknow. In fact, his answer in examination-in-chief was he did not explain to any officer\n\nwhat he thought the packets were. Only in cross and re-examination, did he say he did\n\nmention it was ‘ubat’, a case of an afterthought. Secondly, if he really thought\n\nthat the substance was just some prohibited Chinese medicine, nothing that serious, why\n\ndid he hide the sixteen sachets which contained the substance in his socks? He was\n\nspecifically asked about this and all he could say was \"because the tyre compartment\n\nwas dirty, so I first put it in my trousers pocket, subsequently then I transferred them\n\ninto my socks.\" In our opinion the real answer was clear. Thirdly, he knew that drug\n\ntrafficking carried the extreme penalty in Singapore. He had ample opportunity to verify\n\nwhat the substance was and yet deliberately chose not to do so. The observation of this\n\nCourt inWong Soon Lee v PP(Cr Appeal No 7/1999) of \"turning a blind\n\neye\" is most pertinent. On his own evidence, he said he was desperate for money. He\n\ntook the risk and was caught.21.    In the premises, there was no basis\n\nfor us to interfere with the decision of the trial judge. Accordingly, we affirmed the\n\nconviction and sentence.Yong Pung HowL P TheanChao Hick TinChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
