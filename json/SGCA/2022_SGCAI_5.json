        "Introduction": "1 DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“DyStar”) is part of a global group which carries on business in the manufacture and sale of dyes.  From 2012 Senda International Capital Ltd (“Senda”) was a majority shareholder of DyStar with 62.43% of its shares.  Kiri Industries Ltd (“Kiri”) was a 37.57% shareholder.  In 2015, Kiri commenced proceedings against Senda alleging oppressive conduct by Senda.  In a judgment dated 3 July 2018, a three judge coram of the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) found for Kiri and ordered that Senda purchase Kiri’s 37.57% shareholding in DyStar, which was to be valued as at the date of the judgment (seeDyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another suit[2018] 5 SLR 1 (the “Main Judgment”)).  In making the buyout order, the SICC held that the value of Kiri’s shareholding was to take into consideration the effects of various aspects of oppressive conduct by Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co Ltd (“Longsheng”), of which Senda was a wholly-owned subsidiary.  The SICC’s decision was upheld on appeal (seeSenda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another appeal[2019] 2 SLR 1). 2 Further proceedings then took place before the SICC to determine how Kiri’s shareholding was to be valued for the purposes of the buyout order.  The SICC delivered four judgments for the valuation proceedings, the first of whichwas delivered on 21 December 2020 (seeKiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another[2021] 3 SLR 215 (the “First Valuation Judgment”)).  An oral judgment was delivered on 17 March 2021 (the “Oral Judgment”), a second judgment on 3 June 2021 (seeKiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another[2021] 5 SLR 1 (the “SecondValuation Judgment”)and a final judgmenton 21 June 2021 (seeKiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another[2021] 5 SLR 111 (the “Final Valuation Judgment”).  These appeals by both Senda and Kiri raise issues arising out of those judgments concerning matters affecting the valuation of DyStar and adjustments for various factors as well as the valuation of Kiri’s shareholding and adjustments relevant to that.",
        "The SICC’s judgments in the valuation proceedings": "",
        "The First Valuation Judgment": "3 In theFirstValuation Judgment, the SICC dealt with questions of valuation methodology and adjustments to DyStar’s enterprise value.  The valuation of DyStar for the purposes of the buyout order was derived from its enterprise value after subtracting net debt and other accounting adjustments.  The parties presented expert evidence on those issues - Kiri’s expert being Ms Roula Harfouche (“Ms Harfouche”) and Senda’s being Mr Lie Kok Keong (“Mr Lie”).  Senda also called Mr Chan Kheng Tek (“Mr Chan”) who gave evidence on the impact of the oppressive acts.  The SICC generally preferred the valuation methodology used by Ms Harfouche (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [76]).  It rejected objections advanced by Senda that various broker and market reports containing information and forecasts about companies comparable to DyStar upon which Ms Harfouche relied in her valuation exercise were inadmissible hearsay (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [104] and [115]). 4 The SICC also found that DyStar management forecasts prepared in April 2019 (the “April 2019 Forecasts”), which Mr Lie had relied on in his valuation exercise, were unreliable and skewed in Senda’s favour (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [138]-[150]).  It was of the view that Mr Lie’s valuation had been overly depressed because of his reliance on the April 2019 Forecasts (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [137]).  A financial model purportedly building on the April 2019 Forecasts and which quantified the impact of various risk events that Senda said negatively impacted DyStar’s valuation (the “February 2020 Model”) was also rejected by the SICC (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [154]).  The SICC considered that most of the assumptions made by the February 2020 Model were not backed up with evidence and the circumstances in which it had been prepared suggested that, like the April 2019 Forecasts, it had been prepared specifically for the valuation proceedings and consciously skewed in Senda’s favour (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [152]-[153]). 5 The SICC accepted Ms Harfouche’s valuation of US$1,636m but required nine adjustments: (a) Incorporation in DyStar’s valuation of notional licence fees payable by Longsheng for its use of a patent known as Orange 288 (the “O288 Patent”) (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [178]-[203]).  The O288 Patent is owned by a DyStar affiliate, DyStar Colour Deutschland GmbH and is used in the manufacture of black and navy blue disperse dyes.  The O288 Patent had temporarily been assigned to Longsheng in August 2010 for the purpose of Longsheng defending it from invalidation proceedings in China.  It was not reassigned after the settlement of those proceedings and Longsheng had exploited the O288 Patent in its commercial production of black and navy blue disperse dyes and also collected licence fees from third parties for the use of the O288 Patent without accounting to DyStar, which the SICC had found to constitute an oppressive act (seeMain Judgmentat [74]-[78] and [189]-[198]).  In connection with the quantification of the notional licence fee, the SICC held that: (i) The litigation costs incurred by Longsheng in defending the O288 Patent were not to be deducted from the notional licence fee because the terms on which the O288 Patent had been assigned to Longsheng suggested that such costs were to be borne by Longsheng (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [195]-[197]). (ii) The benefits obtained by Longsheng from the use of the O288 Patent were not to be quantified by way of an account of profits made by Longsheng from the sale of products manufactured by Longsheng using the O288 Patent, as Kiri had urged the SICC (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [185]). (iii) The notional licence fee was to be calculated based upon the quantity of products manufactured using and falling within the scope of the O288 Patent (also referred to by the SICC and Kiri as “Related Products”).  The SICC relied on Senda’s evidence in this regard although it accepted that there had been incomplete disclosure of the same by Senda (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [194]). (b) The downstream financial impact on DyStar due to the expiration of the O288 Patent to be deducted from Ms Harfouche’s computation of DyStar’s maintainable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) with an impact of US$6.5m, as suggested by Mr Lie (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [210]-[213]). (c) The downstream financial impact on DyStar due to the expiration of other patents used in the manufacture of a solution known as Indigo 40% for the production of Indigo dyes (the “I40 Patents”) to be deducted from DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA.  This event would have an impact of US$17.2m as suggested by Mr Lie (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [214]-[223]). (d) A discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”) of 19% to be applied to the value of Kiri’s 37.57% share in DyStar (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [224]-[246]). (e) A country risk premium of 1.6% to be accounted for in DyStar’s cost of equity, which would increase DyStar’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and result in a larger discount rate in the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) approach (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [247]-[250]).  The SICC however rejected Senda’s contention that a size premium be applied in calculating DyStar’s cost of equity (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [251]-[265]). (f) The applicable tax rate for DyStar’s revenue to be 26.7% instead of 23% (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [266]-[268]). (g) The tax rate for substantial sums paid by DyStar to Longsheng purportedly as payment for services and support that Longsheng had provided in 2015 and 2016 (the “Longsheng Fees”) (seeMain Judgmentat [79]-[92]), which the SICC had found in theMain Judgmentto constitute oppressive conduct (at [202] and [225]), was to be adjusted to match DyStar’s historical tax rates (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [276]).  For the purposes of the buyout order, the Longsheng Fees were to be incorporated into DyStar’s valuation. (h) A “special incentive payment” of US$2m made in 2014 by DyStar to one Mr Ruan Weixiang (“Mr Ruan”), a director of both Senda and DyStar at the material time, and which the SICC had found in theMain Judgmentto be an act of oppression (at [71]-[73] and [179]), had been accounted for in Ms Harfouche’s valuation (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [291]-[292]).  However, an adjustment to the applicable tax rate was required.  That was to be DyStar’s historical rate in 2014 when the special incentive payment was made (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [293]). (i) A US$4m insurance payout to DyStar in May and June 2019, to be incorporated into DyStar’s valuation (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [302]). 6 The SICC rejected Senda’s contentions that DyStar’s enterprise value should be adjusted downwards by reason of: (a) The closure of DyStar’s plant in Nanjing, China (the “Nanjing Plant”) following an explosion in February 2018 (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [157]-[163]). (b) The closure of Dystar’s plant in Wuxi, China (the “Wuxi Plant”) following the acquisition by Chinese authorities of the land upon which it was built (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [164]-[169]). (c) The closure of DyStar’s plant in Ankleshwar, India which was a post-valuation event held not to be foreseeable at the date of valuation (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [170]-[177]). 7 The SICC made the following directions (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [313]): (a) The parties’ experts are to revise the notional licence fee of US$473,744 proposed by Mr Chan to take into account a starting point of 2010 and not 2013.  This was because, as the SICC found, Longsheng had begun trading products falling within the scope of the O288 Patent since 2010 and so any such notional licence fee payable by Longsheng to DyStar for the use of the O288 Patent would have been chargeable from 2010 onwards (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [192]).  On the other hand, the long-stop date for the notional licence fee was the date of the expiration of the O288 Patent (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [191]). (b) The parties’ experts are to ascertain the relevant historical tax rates and general interest rates. (c) The parties’ experts are to ascertain how the notional licence fee and third party licence fees collected by Longsheng are to be factored into DyStar’s valuation. (d) The parties’ experts are to revise Ms Harfouche’s final valuation and submit the same within 28 days of the judgment. (e) If unable to agree on the matters directed, the parties are to submit within 28 days of the judgment a joint statement identifying points of agreement and disagreement with succinct explanations of their reasons for disagreeing. 8 The SICC reserved all issues of costs pending the determination of a final valuation (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [314]). 9 On 25 January 2021, the parties’ experts provided a joint statement of experts (the “Joint Expert Report”) addressing the nine issues on which they had been ordered to provide their views.  The Joint Expert Report was accompanied by a letter from Kiri, in which Kiri raised a question whether it was entitled to pre-judgment interest on the amount payable to it pursuant to the buyout order and, if so, the date on which such interest should run. In that letter, Kiri also sought clarification of the relief to which it was entitled if Senda fails to comply with the buyout order (see also [321] below).",
        "The Oral Judgment": "10 In the Oral Judgment(see [2] above), the SICC held that pre-judgment interest cannot be awarded in an oppression claim, but noted that it had been accepted by the Court of Appeal inYeo Hung Khiang v Dickson Investment (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others[1999] 1 SLR(R) 773 (“Yeo Hung Khiang”) that the court, in an oppression claim, has the discretion to enhance or adjust the value of the shares to arrive at a fair and equitable result.  The SICC held there was no basis, in this case, to make an adjustment to the value of DyStar’s shares.  It declined to impose any discretionary enhancement on DyStar’s share value.",
        "The Second Valuation Judgment": "11 In theSecond Valuation Judgment, the SICC referred to the nine outstanding issues identified in theFirst Valuation Judgment. 12 In the Joint Expert Report, Senda’s experts, Mr Lie and Mr Chan (the latter two referred to collectively as “PwC”) disagreed with the approach that Ms Harfouche was taking.  In her preliminary comment in the Joint Expert Report, Ms Harfouche had said: Ms Harfouche has updated her valuation model, from which her valuation of US$1,636m was derived, for the … adjustments [in theFirst Valuation Judgment], without changing her valuation approach, as requested by the Court.  PwC has instead adopted a surprising interpretation of the [First Valuation Judgment] and used its own model, as is explained in Ms Harfouche’s column of this joint statement. 13 Mr Lie and Mr Chan stated: Instead of complying with the court’s directions [in theFirst Valuation Judgment], Ms Harfouche unilaterally re-performed her entire valuation methodology, whilst trying to revisit and relitigate issues which the Court had already ruled on e.g. she attempts to propose ‘sensible corrections’ to the Court-endorsed US$23.7 million impact on DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA.  This explains many of the disagreements between the experts. [emphasis in original] This difference was reflected in arguments put to this court by Senda, which are discussed below. 14 The issues on the DLOM and the special incentive payment were not in dispute.  The experts had agreed upon them and their joint position was incorporated into the SICC’s final valuation of DyStar (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [7]).  There remained seven issues in dispute.  The experts disagreed on how the matters in respect of these issues were to be incorporated into the final valuation of DyStar.  These were: (a) The notional licence fee and third party licence fees in respect of the O288 Patent. (b) The effect of the expiration of the O288 Patent and the I40 Patents (collectively referred to as the “Patent Expirations”). (c) Country risk premium and the effective tax rate. (d) Longsheng Fees and applicable tax rates. 15 The SICC made some preliminary observations to the following effect (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [12]): (a) Ms Harfouche provided a well-reasoned report on the seven disputed issues. (b) In theFirst Valuation Judgment, it had accepted Ms Harfouche’s valuation model. (c) Accordingly, the impact of the nine adjustments that it ordered to be made in theFirst Valuation Judgment(see [5] above) must be assessed in the context of that model and methodology. (d) Mr Lie had adopted an approach departing in some instances from Ms Harfouche’s valuation model. 16 The SICC described Ms Harfouche’s approach in an overview paragraph (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [13]): In the valuation proceedings, Ms Harfouche adopted an approach synthesising the market and DCF approaches.  Both methods were based on a cluster of companies with similar characteristics to DyStar (in terms of the industry in which they operated, EV, EBITDA, and the geographical reach of their businesses).  We had accepted Ms Harfouche’s selection of the comparable companies ….  As noted …, Ms Harfouche took this approach because of significant shortcomings in DyStar’s disclosure of financial information.  The experts were consequently unable to verify DyStar’s actual financial performance and their ability to project its financial performance into the future using a pure DCF method was therefore constrained.  Using a pure DCF method was not suitable for this reason.  Ms Harfouche therefore devised a valuation model under which she charted a range of DyStar EV values derived from both the market approach and DCF method, employing a graphical representation which was referred to in the valuation proceedings as the ‘football field’.  Using the football field, she arrived at an estimated valuation. 17 The SICC also noted that Ms Harfouche, in supporting her positions in the Joint Expert Report, had referred to underlying documents.  On several issues, Mr Lie and Mr Chan had failed to refer to any underlying documents (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [14]). 18 The SICC identified the positions of the experts and their conclusions on the issues in dispute.  Each of them is referred to as a “Trial Issue” to distinguish them from the appeal issues before this court. Trial Issue 1: Notional and Third-Party Licence Fees 19 The SICC held that DyStar’s group tax rates were to apply.  The applicable tax rates were determined having regard to the evidence of Ms Harfouche and Mr Chan and were set out in a table (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [28]). YearEffective tax rate20100%201135.6%20120%201320.3%201418.4%201520.0%201625.1%201726.7%201845.5%201926.7% 20 The SICC held that third party licence fees of US$12.6m as proposed by Ms Harfouche should be applied (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [29]).  The SICC however rejected the contention that audit fees which Longsheng allegedly incurred in respect of the third party licence fees ought to be taken into account in determining the quantum of those third party licence fees which are to be added back into DyStar’s final valuation (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [33]-[34]). Trial Issues 2 and 3: The Patent Expirations 21 The SICC had held in theFirst Valuation Judgmentthat the expiration of the O288 Patent and the I40 Patents held by DyStar must be taken into account in determining DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA.  The best evidence was Mr Lie’s view that the expiration of the O288 Patent would lead to a US$6.5m drop in DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [213]).  In relation to the I40 Patents, the SICC referred to the evidence of DyStar’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Eric Hopmann (“Mr Hopmann”), that the benefits that had accrued upon validation of the I40 Patents would be reversed upon expiration with a proportional drop in revenue (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [214]-[215]).  The SICC held this to be a logical and sound position.  Mr Hopmann’s estimations and that of DyStar’s management resulted in a 16.42% to 16.67% drop across five years for the average selling price (“ASP”) of Indigo 40% products.  These projections were held to be reasonable (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [218]-[219]).  In this respect the SICC accepted Mr Lie’s calculations of a US$17.2m drop in DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [223]). 22 In theSecond Valuation Judgment, the SICC held that the effect of the Patent Expirations should be modelled only for a finite period as Ms Harfouche contended, rather than in perpetuity which reflected Mr Lie’s position (at [45]).  The SICC explained that theFirst Valuation Judgment, which had accepted Mr Lie’s evidence in relation to impact on EBITDA of US$6.5m for the O288 Patent and US$17.2m for the I40 Patents, did not involve a determination that the effect should be modelled into perpetuity (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [44]).  The SICC also noted that, as was also common ground between the experts, the finite impact of the Patent Expirations could only be assessed using the DCF method (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [54]).  On that basis, Ms Harfouche had made a US$72.5m deduction to DyStar’s enterprise value.  The SICC considered that was “the best available information upon which the court [was] able to act” (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [57]). Trial Issues 5 and 6: Country risk premium and effective tax rate of 26.7% 23 The SICC held that Ms Harfouche’s model was to be updated in accordance with theFirstValuation Judgment.  Mr Lie’s calculations on country risk premium and effective tax rates involved fresh DCF calculations that did not accord with its acceptance of Ms Harfouche’s valuation method (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [58]). 24 Ms Harfouche had worked a country risk premium of 1.6% (as directed in theFirstValuation Judgment) into her valuation model.  There was no meaningful shift in the line representing the valuation range obtained using the DCF method which she had previously drawn on a diagrammatic representation of the application of different modes of valuation that was referred to by the SICC as “the football field” (see [16] above).  Her position was similar in respect to the 26.7% DyStar group tax rate.  Corporate tax rates for comparable companies ranging from 18% to 34% had already been factored into her valuation approach.  Thus, no further adjustment was required because the tax rate of 26.7% had already been taken into account in her model by the selection of comparable companies with similar characteristics for the valuation exercise (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [60]). 25 The SICC rejected Mr Lie’s fresh set of calculations using a pure DCF method.  The SICC considered that his approach did not assess the impact of the country risk premium and the 26.7% tax rate in the context of Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [61]-[62]).  It considered that Senda was effectively relitigating the appropriate valuation approach by putting forth the fresh set of calculations by Mr Lie (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [62(b)]).  The SICC therefore accepted Ms Harfouche’s position forthe adjustments to be made under Trial Issues 5 and 6 (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [63]). Trial Issue 7: Longsheng Fees for 2015 and 2016 26 Trial Issue 7 also had to do with applicable tax rates.  The difference between the experts arose from disagreement over the applicable rates.  They were apart by about US$4.2m.  Mr Chan’s position was that DyStar’s group rates ought to apply.  The SICC preferred his position as a matter of consistency (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [37]).  The SICC also noted that Ms Harfouche’s position (that the tax rates of the second respondent in these appeals, and not DyStar’s group rates, ought to apply) was inconsistent with the conclusion in theFirstValuation Judgmentthat the applicable tax rate ought to be that of the DyStar group, not its individual entities (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [38]).  The SICC held that DyStar’s group rates ought to apply (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [40]).  On that basis, it had been Ms Harfouche’s view in the Joint Expert Report that the value of Kiri’s shares would “fall by at most US$1.2m”.  The SICC stated that Ms Harfouche must clarify that point because the term “at most US$1.2m” seemed to indicate a range rather than a figure.  The SICC therefore directed that Ms Harfouche incorporate the final figure into DyStar’s final valuation (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [40]). Trial Issue 9: Insurance payout 27 The SICC resolved Trial Issue 9 in Kiri’s favour.  Ms Harfouche had provided updated calculations and arrived at a net impact of US$4.6m to be added to DyStar’s final valuation.  The SICC considered that Mr Lie’s position on this issue had not conformed with the SICC’s direction in theFirstValuation Judgment.  The SICC considered that it had been clear that its direction in theFirstValuation Judgmentrequired the final figure to be that found in Ms Harfouche’s updated calculations which Kiri had submitted to the SICC in the valuation proceedings (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [65]).  Instead, Mr Lie had put forth an entirely different figure.  The SICC therefore agreed with Ms Harfouche that the net impact of the insurance payout was US$4.6m, an amount which ought to be incorporated into DyStar’s final valuation (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [66]). Outstanding Issues and Directions 28 The SICC directed the experts to arrive at DyStar’s final valuation based on its conclusions in theSecond Valuation Judgmentas set out above.  The SICC considered that Ms Harfouche’s figure of US$482.5m for the updated value of Kiri’s shares would have to be revised in light of the findings in theSecond Valuation Judgment, specifically on the issues on which SICC had departed from Ms Harfouche (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [67]).  Those were: (a) That while the applicable tax rates for all years except for 2018 should be as proposed by Ms Harfouche, the rate for that year ought to be 45.5% (see also [19] above). (b) For Trial Issue 7, Ms Harfouche ought to apply DyStar’s group rates and not the tax rates of the individual companies in the group (see [26] above). 29 The SICC emphasised in theSecond Valuation Judgmentthat the experts were to arrive at a final value of Kiri’s shares based solely on the preceding conclusions (at [68]).  Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach and methodology was to be developed and all that was left was to undertake specific calculations to arrive at a number for DyStar’s final valuation.",
        "The Final Valuation Judgment": "30 In theFinal Valuation Judgment, the SICC noted that on 16 June 2021, pursuant to its directions, the parties’ experts had tendered an agreed calculation for DyStar’s final valuation.  They had agreed that the value of Kiri’s shares as at the valuation date on that basis was US$481.6m (at [3]).  The SICC adjudged the final valuation of Kiri’s shares to be that amount for the purposes of the buyout order made in theMain Judgment.",
        "The appeals": "31 The parties lodged three Notices of Appeal each.  They may be summarised briefly as follows.",
        "CA 8": "32 In Civil Appeal No 8 of 2021 (“CA 8”), Senda appealed against theFirst Valuation Judgment, including (amongst others), the following: (a) The decision that post-valuation events unforeseeable at the valuation date should not be used to adjust DyStar’s valuation. (b) The decision that Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach be adopted over Mr Lie’s valuation approach and the acceptance of Ms Harfouche’s final equity value of US$1,636m, including the SICC’s decision that the various broker and market reports relied on by Ms Harfouche in her valuation exercise were not inadmissible hearsay (see [3] above).   On the appeal to this court, Senda accepted Ms Harfouche’s interim valuation of US$1,636m.  Its principal contention on appeal was that the SICC-directed adjustments (see [5] above) should be incorporated into the interim valuation using Mr Lie’s rather than Ms Harfouche’s approach. (c) The decision to reject Mr Lie’s valuation approach and his final equity value of US$609m (see [3] above). (d) The decision that the April 2019 Forecasts, which Mr Lie had relied in his valuation model, were unreliable (see [3] above). (e) The decision that the closure of the Nanjing Plant would not significantly impact DyStar’s valuation (see [6(a)] above). (f) The decision that the closure of the Wuxi Plant would not significantly affect DyStar’s valuation (see [6(b)] above). (g) The decision that (i) the long-stop date for licence fees notionally charged to Longsheng for its use of the O288 Patent ought to be the date of the expiration of the O288 Patent (see [7(a)] above); and (ii) that the appropriate starting date to compute the licence fees notionally charged to Longsheng for its use of the O288 Patent ought to be from 31 August 2010 (see [7(a)] above). (h) The decision that litigation costs incurred by Longsheng should not be deducted from the notional licence fees (see [5(a)] above) and be added back to the valuation. (i) The decision that the application of a size premium in the valuation of DyStar was inappropriate (see [5(e)] above). (j) The decision that tax liabilities and associated administrative penalties should not be factored into the valuation of DyStar. 33 Senda’s case on appeal did not address the issues set out at [32(a)], [32(h]) and [32(j)] above.",
        "CA 45": "34 Following the issuance of theSecond Valuation Judgment, Senda filed Civil Appeal No 45 of 2021 (“CA 45”), appealing against parts of that judgment, including (but not limited to) the following: (a) The decision that audit fees incurred by Longsheng in relation to the third party licence fees it had collected for the O288 Patent should not be added back to DyStar’s valuation. (b) The decision that the impact of the Patent Expirations would only be for a finite period (see [21] above). (c) The decision that the quantification of the impact of the Patent Expirations by Kiri’s expert, Ms Harfouche, was appropriate (see [22] above). (d) The decision that it was not appropriate for Senda’s expert, Mr Lie, to prepare new DCF method calculations to take into account the impact of a country risk premium of 1.6% and DyStar’s effective tax rate of 26.7% on Ms Harfouche’s valuation (see [15] and [25] above). (e) The decision that Ms Harfouche had properly adjusted her model to take into account a country risk premium of 1.6% and DyStar’s effective tax rate of 26.7% (see [24] above). (f) The decision to accept Ms Harfouche’s calculated valuation of Kiri’s shares at US$482.5 million (subject to prescribed adjustments) and the direction that the parties’ experts were to arrive at a final valuation of Kiri’s shares in DyStar based on adjustments to Ms Harfouche’s calculated valuation of Kiri’s shares at US$482.5 million (see [28]-[29] above). 35 Senda’s case on appeal did not address the issue set out at [34(a)] above.",
        "CA 48": "36 Finally, following the issuance of theFinal Valuation Judgment, Senda filed Civil Appeal No 48 of 2021 (“CA 48”), appealing against the SICC’s decision that the final valuation of Kiri’s shares be US$481.6 million for the purposes of the buyout order.",
        "CA 7": "37 In Civil Appeal No 7 of 2021 (“CA 7”), Kiri appeals against the following parts of the SICC’s decision in theFirst Valuation Judgment: (a) The decision that the quantification of the benefits derived by Longsheng from its wrongful exploitation of the O288 Patent be based upon a notional licence fee instead of an account of profits, as well as the SICC’s decision on the basis upon which the quantum of the notional licence fee was to be determined (see [5(a)(ii)] and [5(a)(iii)] above).  Kiri urged this court to accept calculations by Ms Harfouche of the estimated quantity of Related Products (as defined at [5(a)(iii)] above) produced by Longsheng using the O288 Patent as the basis for quantifying the notional licence fee. (b) The decision that there be a DLOM of 19% to Kiri’s 37.5% share in DyStar (see [5(d)] above).

CA 47 also referred to the grounds for Kiri’s appeals against theFirst Valuation Judgmentand the Oral Judgment.",
        "Issues on the appeals": "40 The issues raised on the appeals, each referred to as an “Appeal Issue”, may be summarised as follows: (a) Appeal Issue 1: Whether information and forecasts for comparable companies found in generally available market and broker reports used by Ms Harfouche involved a reliance by Ms Harfouche upon inadmissible hearsay evidence to establish the basis of her opinions?

        "Written submissions": "42 The court received extensive written submissions from both parties, supplemented by oral argument at the hearing of the appeals.  The submissions were helpful but marred in some instances by distracting polemic.  Such terms as “charade”, “blatant untruth”, “with a sleight of hand” and “conveniently and brazenly” — conclusionary epithets impugning the integrity of an expert witness — were of little assistance to this court on the appeal.  This court is concerned to hear each party’s substantive arguments on whether and if so how the SICC erred — not free character analyses of the opposing party’s witnesses or generalised denunciations of the opponent’s case.",
        "Appeal Issue 1: The hearsay objection": "43 Senda had raised a general challenge to Ms Harfouche’s valuation methodology.  This included an objection to her reference to information and forecasts for comparable companies found in market and broker reports, which Ms Harfouche had relied on in arriving at her interim valuation of US$1,636m.  Senda says that these reports constitute inadmissible hearsay evidence.  It is not necessary, however, for this court to deal with the hearsay issue because Senda accepted in its Skeletal Arguments in these appeals that this court could adopt Ms Harfouche’s interim valuation of US$1,636m – which was only 2% higher than Mr Lie’s figure.  In those submissions and before this court, Senda stated that its case in these appeals was instead focused on how the SICC-directed adjustments were to be applied to that interim valuation.  The hearsay question no doubt raises matters of interest at both common law and under statute.Although it need not be determined now, this court notes that it is common practice in commercial litigation for expert evidence to draw upon material of the kind to which Ms Harfouche referred in her reports.  Indeed, Mr Lie in his reports referred to analogous material.  In the event, the hearsay question does not fall for determination as both parties accept the interim valuation of Ms Harfouche of US$1,636m.",
        "Appeal Issue 2: Valuation methodology applied to adjustments": "",
        "The SICC’s approach to the valuation methodologies of the experts": "44 Kiri’s expert, Ms Harfouche, relied upon figures derived from the DCF method and from market-based approaches. On the other hand, Senda’s expert, Mr Lie, primarily applied the DCF method, relying on the April 2019 Forecasts as the main (if not sole) source of information on DyStar’s revenue forecasts, and used the market-based approach only as a cross-check. 45 Ms Harfouche’s application of the DCF method involved a projection of DyStar’s revenue to financial year (“FY”) 2027 using average revenue forecasts of comparable companies and the compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 6% for the global textile dyestuff industry over 2017 to 2022 as set out in a report published by “MarketsandMarkets” (the “MM Report”).  Ms Harfouche also referred to another report published by “Research Reports Insights” (the “RRI Report”).  She derived a long-term CAGR of 2.1%.  Using this long-term CAGR of 2.1%, Ms Harfocuhe identified the pool of companies from which she reached projected cash flows for DyStar and projected growth trends for the dyestuff industry.  She also projected DyStar’s EBITDA based on the performance of 13 comparable companies and applied a flat EBITDA margin of 14.8% from FY 2020 onwards.  Using the projected revenue and EBITDA figures she reached a figure for DyStar’s enterprise value applying the DCF method. 46 The SICC rejected Senda’s submission that Ms Harfouche was wrong to refer to the MM Report and the RRI Report.  These reports set out the revenue growth rates of the global textile dyestuff industry.  On the other hand, the report published by IHS Markit that Senda relied upon related to volume growth rates.  The SICC considered that revenue growth rates were more relevant given that the DCF approach to valuation was based on revenue projections.  It held that Ms Harfouche’s reliance on the MM Report and the RRI Report and, in particular, the 6% CAGR in the MM Report, was well-founded.  Ms Harfouche’s selection of 13 comparable companies from a starting sample of 811 was held to be sound.  The SICC found that her approach conformed with the standards for a valuation exercise stipulated in the International Valuation Standards (“IVS”), a set of guidelines issued by the IVS Council. 47 Ms Harfouche used EBITDA and revenue forecasts of the 13 comparable companies to determine a projected future EBITDA for DyStar and also to project DyStar’s financial performance until FY 2020.  The projected revenue and EBITDA margins for the comparable companies had been taken from broker forecasts collected by Capital IQ.  Ms Harfouche then extrapolated her projections for DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA (as mentioned earlier) from FY 2020 to FY 2027, which gave her a “steady state” of revenue growth and EBITDA.  In her extrapolation, Ms Harfouche gradually decreased the annual revenue growth rate to a terminal growth rate of 2.1%, which was the International Monetary Fund’s long-term US dollar inflation rate.  This involved a conservative assumption of no real revenue growth for DyStar from FY 2027 onwards.  EBITDA growth from FY 2020 was also capped at 14.8%. 48 The SICC also held that Ms Harfouche had applied an appropriate discount rate to DyStar’s projected earnings.  Ms Harfouche had correctly taken into account the relevant factors affecting DyStar’s projected earnings and growth and her approach had resulted in a reasonable application of the DCF method. 49 The SICC then reviewed Ms Harfouche’s application of the market-based approach.  She had used the enterprise values of the 13 comparable companies to establish enterprise value ranges from which she could determine sound trading multiples.  In calculating her trading multiples, Ms Harfouche  applied a ratio of EV/(EBITDA-Capital Expenditure (“Capex”)).  This was in contrast with Mr Lie.  In his application of the market approach, he disregarded Capex and used EV/EBITDA to derive a trading multiple.  The SICC agreed with Ms Harfouche’s approach of using EV/(EBITDA-Capex) (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [71]): … The logic behind factoring in Capex … is sound.  Investors would sensibly take into account a company’s earnings levelswithreference to its capital expenditure. [emphasis in original] The SICC also noted that Mr Lie’s application of the market approach had only considered the non-listed segment of one comparable company in deriving his trading multiple.  That was “a less robust method”. 50 Ms Harfouche had also used a transactions multiple method — analysing acquisitions of companies similar to DyStar.  She reviewed four comparable transactions.  The relevant companies were all large players in segments of the paint/pigment manufacturing industries.  The transactions were held to be “valid reference points”.  The SICC did not accept Mr Lie’s contention that it was difficult to find transactions for companies which were comparable to DyStar. 51 A useful summary of Ms Harfouche’s approach was provided in Kiri’s Respondent’s Case filed in these appeals: 74. Ms Harfouche’s valuation of the equity of DyStar has always been derived from the enterprise value (‘EV’) of DyStar that she obtained bycomparing the Comparable Listed Companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY2017. 75. Ms Harfouche also used other trading multiples (eg EV/(EBITDA-Capex) of Comparable Listed Companies) and transaction multiples (EV/Revenue vs. EGITDA margin and EV/EBITDA) in her market approach as well as the DCF approach to compute DyStar’s EV.  Ms Harfouche presented the ranges of values derived from her preferred valuation methods as a ‘football field’ for DyStar’s EV, which ultimately gave her comfort over her final valuation conclusion obtained bycomparing the Comparable Listed Companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY2017.  This has consistently been Ms Harfouche’s approach to the valuation of DyStar’s EV, and the method from which her US$1,636m valuation of the equity of DyStar was derived has consistently been thecomparison of the Comparable Listed Companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY2017, as can be seen from the following football fields … [emphasis in original]",
        "Ms Harfouche’s calculations following the First Valuation Judgment": "52 Ms Harfouche’s calculations of DyStar’s enterprise value based on the DCF method and market-based approaches were represented in her first report, her updated calculations as at 30 March 2020 and in the Joint Expert Report as horizontal bar chart diagrams, which she designated “football fields” (see also [16] above).  These “football fields” showed value ranges derived from the different valuation methods she had adopted.  It is sufficient to reproduce the last of those, which appeared in the Joint Expert Report: Figure 1: Ms Harfouche’s “football field” in the Joint Expert Report 53 It should be noted that the term “transaction multiples” had been explained briefly in Ms Harfouche’s outline of valuation methods in her first expert report dated 22 August 2019, where she said: 4.23 In addition to the trading multiples analysis, I review reported transactions in specialty chemicals companies in 2017 and 2018.  I used the published information on these transactions to calculate EV/EBITDA multiples and cross-checked these against the multiples calculated under the trading multiples method. 54 Ms Harfouche’s chosen valuation of DyStar (US$1,636m) was described by Kiri in its Respondent’s Case as corresponding to DyStar’s enterprise value derived from one of the valuation methods under the markets-based approach - namely, by comparing the comparable companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY 2017.  That is the right-most edge of the fourth bar in figure 1 above described as “EV/Revenue vs EBITDA-Capex % (FY2017-19)” in all of Ms Harfouche’s reports.",
        "The SICC’s findings on valuation methodology of the experts": "55 In theFirst ValuationJudgment, the SICC held that (at [76]): The integrity of the approach that the experts adopted was critical in our view.  This was because the projected financial performance of DyStar could not be arrived at based on DyStar’s financial documents alone given the shortcomings in the disclosure obligations highlighted earlier, and the difficulties with the integrity of the April 2019 Forecasts as later described … For these reasons, an alternative approach that was robust and comprehensive was key in arriving at the correct valuation of DyStar.  We therefore prefer Ms Harfouche’s approach. 56 The SICC had also referred earlier in theFirst Valuation Judgmentto Senda’s failure to disclose key financial documents for the purposes of the valuation proceedings and observed (at [43]): Senda’s breaches of its disclosure obligations – particularly as regards DyStar’s financial information that undergirded the board packs, the April 2019 Forecasts and February 2020 Model [see [4] above] – significantly influenced the approach that Ms Harfouche took.  She felt compelled as a result to turn toindependent market research and broker forecasts, as opposed toDyStar’s actual historical performance. [emphasis in original] 57 A consequence of those shortcomings was that Senda’s case on valuation was undermined.  To the extent that Senda’s conclusions and positions were not supported by primary evidence, they were held by the SICC to be of questionable evidential value (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [44]). 58 The April 2019 Forecasts, which we have earlier referred to in this judgment (see [3] above), were forecasts prepared by the DyStar board.  Ms Harfouche did not rely on them in the valuation exercise as she regarded them as unreliable and skewed (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [14]).  They were, however, relied upon heavily, if not unquestioningly, by Mr Lie (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [137]).  The SICC agreed with Ms Harfouche’s assessment of the April 2019 Forecasts. 59 The SICC observed that before adjustments for risk events, Ms Harfouche’s assessment of DyStar’s equity value was US$1,636m as at the valuation date, excluding the Longsheng Fees for 2017 and 2018 and the benefits and third party licence fees earned by Longsheng from the O288 Patent.",
        "Senda’s concession on interim valuation": "60 In its Skeletal Arguments, Senda submitted that this court could, as a starting premise, adopt Ms Harfouche’s interim valuation of US$1,636m, which was only 2% higher than Mr Lie’s after adjustments (see also [43] above). 61 In particular, Senda wrote: Given the similarity in pre-adjustment equity value, Senda is prepared – as a compromise, and notwithstanding Senda’s position as to the arbitrariness and unreliability of [Ms Harfouche]’s valuation approach – for this Honourable Court to adopt and direct the necessary adjustments to be made from [Ms Harfouche]’s interim valuation of US$1,636 million, which was adopted by the [SICC].  The adjustments on appeal include: (a) closure of the Nanjing and Wuxi Plants; (b) expiry of [the O288 Patent and the I40 Patents]; (c) adjustments arising from [Longsheng’s] exploitation of the O288 Patent; (d) [country risk premium], size premium; (e) effective tax rate; and (f) DLOM. Senda then submitted that this court should decide how adjustments should be made to the starting figure of US$1,636m. 62 Ultimately, Senda’s attack on Ms Harfouche’s valuation methodology was directed to her approach to incorporating the SICC-directed adjustments into the interim valuation of US$1,636m.  According to Senda, that approach supposedly represented a departure from her pre-adjustment valuation methodology (see [72]-[73] below).  That did involve criticism of Ms Harfouche’s pre-adjustment valuation (which the SICC accepted as the interim valuation of DyStar), but it was a criticism which was in tension with Senda’s acceptance of the interim valuation in these appeals.",
        "SICC’s approach to valuation of adjustments": "63 In theSecond Valuation Judgment,when considering the quantum of the adjustment to be made on account of the Patent Expirations, the SICC held that the impact was finite.  That finding is addressed specifically in relation to Appeal Issues 4 and 7 (see [118] and [166] below).  At this point, this court is concerned with the allegedly arbitrary variations in Ms Harfouche’s approach to the incorporation of the necessary adjustments into the interim valuation. 64 In applying its finding that the impact of the Patent Expirations was finite, the SICC referred to Ms Harfouche’s methodology in quantifying that impact.  Her position was that only the DCF method would allow a finite impact of the Patent Expirations to be modelled.  Senda had complained before the SICC that Ms Harfouche had “force-fed” the DCF method into her valuation of DyStar, which was derived using the markets-based approach (seeSecond Valaution Judgmentat [51]).  The SICC understood that as a criticism against Ms Harfouche for not applying the market-based approach in computing the impact of the Patent Expirations (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [52]). 65 The SICC quoted from Mr Lie’s contributions to the Joint Expert Report in which he had said that Ms Harfouche “should have carried out the [SICC-directed] adjustments using a particular chosen method, instead of selectively deriving certain inputs using one approach, and force-feeding that input into her computation in another approach” (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [52]).  Mr Lie had complained that in computing the overall impact of the court-directed adjustments, Ms Harfouche had adopted the market-based approach.  However, when computing the impact of the Patent Expirations, Ms Harfouche arbitrarily relied upon and adopted the value of the US$72.5m (as the quantum of the impact) which she computed using the DCF method (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [52]). 66 The SICC observed that Ms Harfouche did apply the market-based approach in determining the impact of,inter alia, the country risk premium on DyStar’s valuation (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [59]), which is discussed later in this judgment.  The question that consequently arose was whether it was acceptable for Ms Harfouche to use the market-based approach in determining the impact of,inter alia, the country risk premium on DyStar’s valuation, but use a different approach, the DCF method, in computing the impact of the Patent Expirations. 67 The SICC accepted Ms Harfouche’s methodology.  Her approach, while a “compromise solution”, was explicable (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [53]).  Ms Harfouche did not accept that Mr Lie’s method of computing the impact of the Patent Expirations using the market-based approach would achieve an accurate figure as it assumed a perpetual impact flowing from the Patent Expirations.  It was necessary for her to arrive at a figure based on a finite impact.  That was only possible with the DCF method and not the market approach.  Using the DCF method, the figure of US$72.5m was arrived at which had then to be incorporated into the market-based approach.  That was done by way of deduction.  The overall approach was the “compromise” that Ms Harfouche had acknowledged (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [54]). 68 The SICC accepted that Ms Harfouche had adopted a differing method when computing the impact of the country risk premium and a 26.7% tax rate, but it considered that this could be explained (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [56]).  Apart from the fact that the DCF method was the only method applicable to estimate the finite impact of the Patent Expirations, the SICC pointed to a further difficulty with incorporating the impact by making deductions to DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA-Capex margin as Mr Lie had done. That difficulty was encapsulated in the following observations (seeSecond Valuation Judgmentat [56]): (a) It must be borne in mind that DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA-CapEx margin were derived with reference to the cluster of comparable companies selected by Ms Harfouche.  In other words, the revenue and EBITDA figures of the comparable companies were used as proxies. (b) As noted by Ms Harfouche, it is not necessary to adjust DyStar’s EVs for country risk premium … based on the market approach because it hasalready been factored intothe market approach.  Specifically, the comparable companies used by Ms Harfouche to derive the [enterprise values] ‘are subject to country risk to at least the same extent as DyStar, and so no further adjustment for country risk should be made to the multiples derived from their share prices’.  … (c) The same cannot be said as regards expiration of [the O288 Patent and the I40 Patents].The patents and their importance are factors that are unique to DyStar.  Consequently, the impact of the expiration of the patents can only be assessed with reference to DyStar. … [emphasis in original in italics] [emphasis added in underline]",
        "Senda’s criticism of Ms Harfouche’s valuation methodology as applied to the SICC-directed adjustments": "69 In its Skeletal Arguments, Senda submitted,inter alia, that: (a) The dotted vertical line applied by Ms Harfouche to her “football field” (see [52] above) did not achieve a central pricing tendency (for context, that dotted line was drawn based on Ms Harfouche’s chosen value of US$1,636m and Ms Harfouche had considered that the position of that line, relative to the enterprise value ranges derived from the other valuation methods, gave her comfort over her chosen value (see [51] above)).  According to Senda, it should be moved to the left and DyStar’s value in her first and second reports should be reduced by at least US$100m to US$150m. (b) Ms Harfouche completely reformulated her valuation approach after theFirstValuation Judgmentwas issued. (c) Ms Harfouche used her reformulated valuation approach to avoid adjustments such as country risk premium, effective tax rate and, potentially, DLOM, but abandoned her market approach and reverted to the DCF method in respect of some other adjustments. 70 Senda’s argument about Ms Harfouche’s approach to the adjustments can be dealt with discretely.  There is no basis for interfering with the SICC’s acceptance of the pre-adjustment valuation method adopted by her.",
        "Senda’s submission on Ms Harfouche’s approach to the adjustment valuation": "71 The question raised by Appeal Issue 2, given Senda’s concession, is whether Ms Harfouche adopted an approach to the adjustments inconsistent with the methodology which she had applied to reach the pre-adjustment figure. 72 In its Skeletal Arguments, Senda said that Ms Harfouche had “completely reformulated her valuation approach” after theFirst Valuation Judgmentwas issued.  She allegedly took the position in the Joint Expert Report that her valuation was based solely on her chosen valuation method – by comparing the comparable companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY 2017 to derive the value of DyStar (see [54] above).  So, according to Senda, the values computed by the other methods, including the DCF method, had simply been cross-checks to her sole valuation method. 73 This new approach, according to Senda, served the purpose of enabling Ms Harfouche to avoid taking into account some of the SICC-directed adjustments.  Those adjustments, it was said, were not valuation-approach agnostic and became irrelevant if computed purely using a markets-based approach.  The adjustments which are the subject of that argument were country risk premium and effective tax rates, which it was said, would only apply if the DCF method was employed. 74 Ms Harfouche’s “entirely new narrative” was also said to enable her to “completely side-step the [SICC’s] direction that a 19% DLOM should apply”.  Then it was said by Senda that Ms Harfouche had abandoned the market-based approach and reverted to the DCF method for other SICC-directed adjustments where the same were favourable to Kiri. 75 Senda submitted that there was a clear basis for this court to find that Ms Harfouche’s approach was arbitrary and should not be accepted.",
        "Kiri’s submission on Ms Harfouche’s approach to the adjustment valuation": "76 In answer, Kiri pointed out that Ms Harfouche’s position had consistently been that herchosenvaluationof DyStar was derived by comparing the comparable companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY 2017 to derive the value of DyStar (see [54] above).  Thus, Senda was wrong to allege that hervaluationapproach(which involved the use of different valuation methods: see the “football field” at [52] above) was based solely from the same. 77 Neither Kiri nor Ms Harfouche had ever said that her chosen valuation was the result of an “amalgamation” of her DCF method and various markets-based approach methods.  The term “amalgamation” had been used by the SICC in the context of thevaluationapproachesthat Ms Harfouche had adopted - namely the DCF method and the market-based approaches.  It was not used to describe an amalgamation of respectivevaluationsthat Ms Harfouche obtained from those approaches. Ms Harfouche’schosenvaluationfor DyStar was selected by comparing the comparable companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY 2017. 78 Kiri referred to the SICC’s understanding of her approach and in particular directed attention to a passage in theSecond Valuation Judgmentin which the SICC described Ms Harfouche’s valuationmethodology, which has been quoted earlier in this judgment (see [16] above). 79 Kiri took issue with Senda’s contention that, by deriving her valuation solely by comparing the comparable companies’ EV/Revenue to their EBITDA-Capex margins in FY 2017, Ms Harfouche was able to maximise the value of Kiri’s shares in DyStar by negating the impact of the various SICC-directed adjustments in Senda’s favour.  Kiri pointed to the SICC’s finding in theFirst Valuation Judgmentthat (at [133]): Ms Harfouche [had] applied the market approachto Kiri’s detriment, in the sense that her valuation based on this approach resulted in a lower valuation range than that under the DCF method (which depressed her overall aggregated valuation).  If Ms Harfouche had applied only the DCF approach, her final valuation would have been even higher. [emphasis in original] 80 Kiri also took issue with Senda’s contention that Ms Harfouche’s insistence that her valuation approach was solely a methodology under the market-based approach allowed her to side-step the SICC’s direction that a DLOM of 19% should be applicable.  Kiri pointed out that in the Joint Expert Report, Ms Harfouche deducted a DLOM of 19% from her final value of her chosen valuation of DyStar.  In the same vein, the final valuation of Kiri’s shares in DyStar, which the SICC found to be US$481.6m, was arrived at after deducting a DLOM of 19%.",
        "Conclusion on Senda’s criticism of Ms Harfouche’s valuation methodology as applied to the SICC-directed adjustments": "81 There was no impermissible arbitrariness in the approach adopted by Ms Harfouche in her valuation methodology when considering the adjustments which she was required to make.  The SICC did not err in its consideration of her application of that methodology.  It gave a perfectly comprehensible explanation of the difference in approach between valuation of the impact of the Patent Expirations and the other adjustments to be made (see [68] above).  This court accepts the substance of the submissions on this issue by Kiri.  Senda’s challenge under Appeal Issue 2 does not succeed.",
        "Appeal Issue 3: Closures of the Nanjing Plant and the Wuxi Plant": "",
        "The SICC’s reasoning": "293 In the Oral Judgment (see [2] above), the SICC referred to a submission by Kiri that it should have an “adjustment to the final purchase price as an element of compensationfor the oppression” [emphasis added].  Kiri submitted to the SICC that the adjustment to the value of its shares should run from the date of the Writ of Summons, which was 26 June 2015.  It was proposed that the statutory default interest rate of 5.33% be used as a proxy for the adjustment. 294 The SICC observed that pre-judgment interest could not be awarded in an oppression case and citedYeo Hung Khiang([10] above).  Although holding that pre-judgment interest (which is only given in respect of “debt[s] or damages” (see s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed)) could not be awarded, the Court of Appeal in that case nevertheless accepted that in an oppression claim the court has a discretion to enhance or adjust the value of the shares to give a fair and equitable result (seeDickson Investmentat [39] and [71]). 295 The SICC, however, found “no basis to make an adjustment to the value of the DyStar shares …”.  It reached that conclusion for four reasons focusing, not on date of the issue of the writ, but on the date of the valuation and the date of the buyout order: (a) In the present case the valuation date and the date of the buyout order were the same.  On that basis, the SICC distinguishedYeo Hung KhiangandLim Ah Sia v Tiong Tuang Yeong and others[2014] 4 SLR 140 (“Lim Ah Sia”) in which enhancements were ordered and where there was a gap between the date of the buyout orders and the valuation dates.  The SICC reasoned that, in those cases, the enhancement had been ordered to reflect the value of the shares as at the date of the buyout order because events occurring in the intervening period between the date of the buyout order and the valuation date has had an impact on the value of the shares. (b) There was no evidential basis to adjust the value of Kiri’s shares.  Kiri, in closing submissions, had made a vague reference to having been denied “all benefits of its shareholding in DyStar (such as dividends)” as justification for an enhancement.  However, there was no evidential basis for identifying or quantifying such benefits and dividends that Kiri said it had been denied of.  Kiri also provided no substantiation for why the court should impose a discretionary adjustment tied to the statutory default interest rate at 5.33%. (c) Kiri did not provide a cut-off date for the adjustment.  The SICC considered that Kiri was essentially making a backdoor attempt to seek post-judgment interest, which it could not award for the same reasons as pre-judgment interest (seeYeo Hung Khiangat [39]; see [294] above). (d) In any event, the point wasres judicatain so far as it concerned an enhancement in the valueof Kiri’s shares.  It ought to have been canvassed and tested at trial before theMain Judgmentwas released.",
        "Senda’s submissions": "307  Senda submitted that this court should not disturb the decision of the SICC on a discretionary matter simply because it may have been inclined to exercise the discretion differently had the matter come before it afresh. 308 Senda submitted, by way of preliminary objection, that the relief that Kiri seeks from this court (see [296] and [302] above) is completely different from that which it sought before the SICC.  It characterised Kiri’s approach as a sleight of hand, framing its new claim as one for a discretionary enhancement from the valuation date,ie3 July 2018, to the date when Senda actually buys Kiri’s shares or, in the alternative, until the date of theFinal Valuation Judgment.  This was to be contrasted with Kiri’s position before the SICC that discretionary enhancement should run from the date of the Writ of Summons as pre-judgment interest, a proposition which it now conceded to be untenable (see [293] above). 309 Senda argued that in seeking a discretionary enhancement from the valuation date till the date of the execution of the buyout order Kiri was in substance seeking a discretionary enhancement akin to post-judgment interest from the date of the buyout order to the date of the actual purchase.  This was said to be a claim that was never put before the SICC.  Senda referred to a number of authorities relating to the raising of new points on appeal. 310 On the merits Senda argued that the SICC had taken into account all relevant matters between post-writ and valuation date in its liability judgment. 311 Senda submitted that in any event the conclusion of the SICC was completely defensible.  The SICC had directed that the financial impact of Senda’s oppressive conduct be factored into the valuation of Kiri’s shares by directing various adjustments to be made to “write back” the impact of such conduct. 312 Senda pointed out, that, at the valuation tranche of the proceedings, the SICC had received evidence on the quantitative impact of each of the oppressive acts, and directed discretionary adjustments.  Kiri had had more than ample opportunity then to raise any and all acts of oppression or other circumstances which would have had an impact on the value of its shares in DyStar as well as to adduce any relevant evidence.  Discretionary enhancement in the form of pre-judgment interest up to the date of a buyout order, should have been pleaded and canvassed at the liability tranche of the proceedings. 313 Senda submitted that the SICC correctly distinguishedYeo Hung Khiang([10] above)andLim Ah Sia([295(a)] above).  Each had involved a meaningful interval between the valuation date and the date of the buyout order, for which the court recognised that the minority shareholder needed to be compensated.  InYeo Hung Khiang,there had been a period of seven years between commencement of the suit and the commencement of the hearing during which the minority shareholders were denied the benefits of their shareholding, while the majority shareholders plundered the company and siphoned off its profits.  In that case, the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision below, increased the share value as assessed by the valuer by 5% per year to take into account the allegations of wrong doings and oppression for the intervening seven years.  The same reasoning had been adopted inCoombs([240] above).  InLim Ah Sia([295(a)] above),the court had fixed the valuation date two years earlier from the date of the buyout order and awarded an uplift of 10% to reflect that the plaintiff was getting paid two years later. 314 Kiri had offered no authority to support the argument that the court may grant a discretionary enhancement to compensate for the deferment of its receipt of payment for its shares.  In any case, Senda submitted that such an enhancement would not lead to a fair and equitable valuation of the shares.  The deferred payment argument was not premised on any oppressive conduct on the part of Senda. 315 Senda submitted that there was no reason why it should be made to pay a greater price for Kiri’s shares in DyStar simply because time was required by the parties to properly canvass their position and for the court to determine issues involving the value of Kiri’s shares. 316 Senda submitted that Kiri had adduced no evidence to demonstrate that it had suffered any loss which should be compensated by an uplift equivalent to statutory post-judgment interest of 5.33% over three years (that is, the interval which Kiri says it should be compensated for deferred payment, between the valuation date and the date of theFinal Valuation Judgment: see [302] above).  Further, the discretionary enhancement sought by Kiri ignored the financial condition of the market in the past two years.  Since 2020. the global economy has been emasculated by the COVID-19 pandemic which has had a material adverse financial impact on DyStar.  As Ms Harfouche had admitted in cross-examination, if the COVID-19 pandemic was taken into account, both her and Mr Lie’s valuation of DyStar would have been considered very optimistic.  On that basis, it was argued that having regard to the pre-COVID-19 valuation date fixed by the SICC, Kiri had already benefited from a significantly enhanced valuation of DyStar. 317 Like Kiri, Senda also made some post-hearing submissions on the issue of discretionary enhancement (see [305] above).  It complained that the specific relief now sought by Kiri was not before the SICC and that Kiri was seeking to justify its claim on a new basis.  Kiri had claimed before the trial court that it was entitled to pre-judgment interest on the amount payable to it pursuant to the buyout order.  Kiri accepted that it was not entitled to the relief it sought before the trial court by pre-judgment interest.  It seeks new relief on a completely different basis under the guise of an appeal — that is discretionary enhancement of the buyout order.  Kiri had not sought leave from the Court of Appeal pursuant to O 57 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed). 318 Senda went on to make further submissions, including references to its own financial position and its ability to comply with the buyout order at the price directed by the SICC.  It also referred to the need to secure prior approval from various regulatory authorities in China, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. 319 Senda sought a direction that Kiri should file a formal application stating the precise basis of the relief it seeks with liberty given to Senda to respond on affidavit so that Senda could put the issues raised by it properly before the court. 320 On 8 February 2022, the solicitors for Kiri wrote to the court objecting to those further submissions made by Senda.  They were said to be inconsistent with the court’s direction, which only provided for Senda to respond to issues raised by Kiri at the hearing that Senda did not have the opportunity to respond to, by providing references to documents in the appeals.  The submissions made by Senda, it was said, did not relate to any of the appeals and were not canvassed before the SICC. 321 Senda responded by a further letter of 10 February 2022, defending its submissions stating that they were made in the context of, and in response to, Kiri’s appeal against the SICC’s decision in the Oral Judgment.  It had further made reference to Kiri’s alternative prayer that Senda complete the buyout within three months, failing which an independent auctioneer be appointed to market and sell the equity of DyStar.  The SICC did not grant that relief and there was no appeal against that decision.  Senda took the view that it was relevant and indeed important for this court to be appraised of the relief sought by Kiri and denied by the SICC pursuant to the Oral Judgment. 322 As to that, the relevance of the alternative relief and its disposition is not apparent.",
        "Kiri’s submissions": "296 Kiri submitted that there was a gap between the valuation date and the date of implementation of the buyout order and that it should be compensated for the deferred payment of its investment in DyStar.  This was not a submission about compensation using interest as a proxy for an adjustment operating from the date of the Writ of Summons. 297 Kiri referred to the use inYeo Hung Khiangof an interest award as a “proxy for measuring the loss suffered [by the oppressed shareholder] through not having access to his investment rather than being strictly interest in the conventional sense ...” (at [21]).  Kiri also referred to the first instance decision of the Federal Court of Australia inCoombs([240] above).The Australian Court had found it “necessary to add an interest factor on the value of the shareholding … to compensate for the deferred payment of that value” because a period of 6.25 years had passed between the valuation date and the date of the buyout order. 298 The Court of Appeal inYeo Hung Khiang([10] above)had accepted that s 216 of the Companies Act conferred on the court the discretion to enhance the share value in a minority oppression case and endorsed the following statement of principle fromCoombs(at [70]): To arrive at a fair value to be paid now by valuing the shareholding at some date in the past and by adding to that value an allowance for the fact that the shareholder has been kept out of the enjoyment of that value in the meantime, to borrow the words of Lord Denning, [inScottish Cooperative Wholesale Society Ltd v Myer([240] above)] is to give the oppressed shareholder ‘what is in effect money compensation for the injury done to [the shareholder] but I see no objection to this.  The section gives a large discretion to the court and it is well exercised in making an oppressor make compensation to those who have suffered at his hands’ … 299 Kiri also referred toLim Ah Sia([295(a)] above)in which the High Court held that it was appropriate to enhance the value of the plaintiff’s shares by 10% to reflect the fact that the plaintiff would only be getting paid pursuant to the buyout order two years after the valuation date (at [95]). 300 Kiri made the point that the valuation dates in bothYeo Hung KhiangandLim Ah Siahad been fixed before the commission of the oppressive acts.  The valuation date in the present case was fixed at the date of the main liability judgment.The approach of choosing a valuation date shortly before the oppressive conduct began resulted in a valuation of the shares as if the oppressive conduct had not taken place.  It would not take into account the effect of any oppressive act to be written back into the value of the shares.  Accordingly, it followed, that the enhancement of share value inYeo Hung KhiangandLim Ah Siawas to account for “the deferred payment of [the] value” of the shares. 301 Kiri said it was not seeking interest as interest but as a proxy to compensate it for the deferred payment of its share value in DyStar. 302   Kiri acknowledged that the valuation date and the date of the buyout order were both 3 July 2018.  However, any order made on 3 July 2018 for Senda to buyout Kiri’s shares could not come into effect unless and until the issue of valuation had been finally determined by the SICC.  Kiri then submitted, as a matter of principle, that the interval for which it should be compensated for the deferred payment would be from 3 July 2018 — the valuation date — to the date of the actual transaction of the buyout order.  In the alternative and at the very least, the end date should be 21 July 2021 (which was the date that the SICC rendered a final determination on the value of Kiri’s shares in theFinal Valuation Judgment) or the date on which this court finalises the valuation figure.  Kiri accepted that it would not be entitled to an enhancement in its share value before the valuation date as the SICC had already taken that period and the events that occurred in that period into account in itsMain Judgment. 303 The statutory default interest rate of 5.33% as a proxy to compensate Kiri for the deferred enjoyment of payment pursuant to the buyout order was said to be appropriate.  It is within the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to s 216(2) of the Companies Act.  It should not be mischaracterised as a backdoor attempt to obtain statutory interest on debt or damages. 304 Further, it was submitted that the matter was notres judicataas held by the SICC.  The issue went solely towards the value of Kiri’s shares in DyStar, which was a matter to be assessed at the valuation tranche of the proceedings. 305 At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeals, the court granted leave to the parties to file brief written submissions in relation to their arguments in reply. 306 On the issue of a discretionary enhancement, Kiri, in its letter to the court dated 4 February 2022, referred to the statutory default interest rate of 5.33%.  That rate was taken from the prime lending rate of the ten leading banks and finance companies and was fixed pursuant to Supreme Court Practice Direction No 1 of 2007.  In the course of argument, the court asked whether it could take judicial notice of prevailing rates.  Kiri, in its letter, referred to current and historical prime lending rates in Singapore, which could be derived from the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s website.  This was: (a) 5.33% per annum in 2018 and 5.25% per annum from 2019 to 2021; (b) fluctuating between 5.34% per annum and 7.90% per annum from October 1990 to April 1998; and (c) 5.38% per annum in 2012 and 2013 and 5.35% per annum in 2014.",
        "Conclusion on the closures of the Nanjing Plant and the Wuxi Plant": "117 On the evidence there was ample support for the SICC’s conclusions.  Senda seeks to use the appellate process to invite this court to draw inferences from the evidence to which it refers that differ from those drawn by the SICC.  However, the conclusions which the SICC drew in relation to the closures of the Nanjing Plant and the Wuxi Plant were plainly open to it.  The primary function of an appellate court is to decide whether the trial court at first instance has reached the right conclusion on the material before it (seeRecovery Vehicle 1 Pte Ltd v Industries Chimiques Du Senegal and another appeal and another matter[2021] 1 SLR 342 at [111], referring toBryanston Finance Ltd v De Vries (No 2)[1976] 1 Ch 63 at 77).  The mere fact that reasonable arguments for a different conclusion exist does not warrant this court substituting a different conclusion based on those arguments. The SICC had the advantage, enjoyed by any trial court, of immersion in the minutiae of the evidence, which this court does not.  Absent demonstrable error on the part of the SICC, this court will not interfere with its findings in relation to the closures of the Nanjing Plant and the Wuxi Plant.",
        "Appeal Issue 4: Duration of the impact of the Patent Expirations": "",
        "Conclusion on the impact of the Patent Expirations": "140 It is useful to refer back to theSecond Valuation Judgmentin which the SICC said (at [48]): We acknowledge Senda’s point that there is no evidence, as the court found in the [FirstValuation Judgment], of thecontingency measuresthat DyStar was prepared to take to ameliorate the impact of the expiration of the [O288 Patent] and [I40 Patents].  But Senda’s argument takes the point too far.  Our finding on the absence of evidence on contingency measures simply means that the expiration of the relevant patentswould havean impacton DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA, which must be factored into DyStar’s valuation.  That is precisely what the experts were tasked to evaluate.  Our conclusion on the absence of contingency measuresdoes not meanthat the impact of the expiration of the [O288 Patent] and the [I40 Patents]would extend into perpetuity. [emphasis in original] 141 In the course of oral argument, it was put to Senda that the SICC’s approach (as set out in the above quoted portion of theSecond Valuation Judgment) framed the question as one in terms of burden of proof of extension of the impact into perpetuity.  A five-year impact had been established based on the management forecast from Mr Hopmann (see [123] and [128(b)] above).  It was put to counsel that that was the only concrete projection which the SICC had and that Senda had not established that it went on forever. 142 Counsel responded that the SICC was wrong in coming to that conclusion.  He said that Mr Hopmann’s evidence had not proved that proposition.  It was not Mr Hopmann’s evidence that the impact of the Patent Expirations would only last for five years and that the effects of the Patent Expirations would be fully adjusted thereafter.  Also, Mr Hopmann’s evidence that DyStar will engage in research and development efforts to develop new patents to ameliorate the impact of the Patent Expirations was only a “general aspirational statement with nothing specific”.  And with the SICC’s acceptance of Mr Lie’s evidence in theFirst Valuation Judgmentthat the impact on maintainable EBITDA was cumulatively US$23.7m — came the recognition that the effect of the Patent Expirations extended to perpetuity.  That was said to be because any impact on maintainable EBITDA necessarily extends indefinitely without limitation.  Counsel then said: Now, what is important is also the fact that [the SICC] hadno evidenceto work on to say that well, after five years, things would be back to the same level as of July 2018. [emphasis added] 143 It was for Senda to establish what, on the face of it, was the basis for what seemed to be a rather improbable proposition that the effect of the Patent Expirations would extend indefinitely.  Mr Hopmann’s table and forecast demonstrated an effect for a period of five years (see [123] and [128(b)] above).  As counsel recognised, there was no evidence of what things would be like after the five-year period.  In other words, there was no evidence that the impact of the Patent Expirations would persist after the five-year period and extend thereafter.  In any case, whether or not a table might have been produced which showed an effect at 10 years, or 15 years, or 20 years, is beside the point.  Such a table (whatever the timeframe therein) would still not substantiate Senda’s case that the impact of the Patent Expirations would extendindefinitely. 144 The SICC was entitled to reach the conclusion that it did based on the evidence before it and there are no grounds for this court to intervene with that conclusion.  Senda’s contentions on Appeal Issue 4 fail.",
        "Appeal Issue 5: Accounting for size premium in DyStar’s cost of equity": "",
        "Conclusion on size premium": "159 The application of a size premium reflects an assessment of a market response to a theoretical sale of DyStar.  The SICC was entitled to take the view, which it did, that clear evidence was needed to demonstrate that DyStar presented clear and patent risks to its investors by virtue of its size within the market in which it operated (see [152] above).  It came to the conclusion that there was no such clear evidence.  The SICC has not been shown to have been in error in reaching that conclusion and therefore that no size premium was shown to be applicable.",
        "Appeal Issue 6: Accounting for country risk premium in DyStar’s cost of equity": "",
        "Conclusion on country risk premium": "165 The arguments advanced by Kiri against a country risk premium were relatively slight and do not persuade this court that the SICC was in error in its approach to reject the application of a country risk premium.  Kiri sought to persuade this court that country risks of a globally diversified corporation like DyStar are diversifiable and effectively cancel out, but that, as the SICC noted, had not been Ms Harfouche’s evidence (see [161] above).   The fact that the broker reports had not added a country risk premium to the discount rates of the comparable companies did notper seadvance Kiri’s case on why a country risk premium should not apply to DyStar since a country risk premium could have been excluded in those cases for reasons specific to the comparable companies.  Kiri’s challenge to the country risk premium finding of the SICC therefore does not succeed.",
        "Appeal Issue 7: No downward adjustment to DyStar’s valuation on account of the Patent Expirations": "166 As appears earlier in this judgment (see [118]-[139] above), the SICC rejected Senda’s contention that a discount for the impact of Patent Expirations should be made on the basis that the impact continues in perpetuity.  It accepted the proposition that the impact was finite — bounded by a period of five years.",
        "Conclusion": "168 This court has already referred to the evidence in relation to the impact of the Patent Expirations.  The SICC had evidence upon which it could reach the conclusion that it did.  It was a conclusion that was reasonably open.  Moreover, it was a conclusion which was in the nature of an evaluative judgment.  There is no reason for disturbing that conclusion.",
        "Appeal Issue 8: Application of a DLOM in the valuation of Kiri’s shareholding in DyStar": "",
        "Conclusion on DLOM": "217 The lack of a clear path of principle on the existing state of the authorities is apparent from the various lines of argument advanced by Kiri and Senda, which have been set out above.  The entanglement of those lines with the views of the valuers provides the occasion for confusion.  It is necessary to start from first principles governing the operation of s 216 of the Companies Act. 218 InTomolugen Holdings Ltdand another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals[2016] 1 SLR 373, the Court of Appeal described the history and purpose of s 216 of the Companies Act and its ancestry in s 210 of the Companies Act 1948(c 38) (UK) (“the 1948 UK Companies Act”) (at [85]-[88]).  That discussion was summarised inSenda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltdand others and another appeal[2019] 2 SLR 1 ( “Main Appeal Judgment”), in which this court dismissed, amongst others, Senda’s appeal against the SICC’s decision in theMain Judgment([1] above)to grant Kiri’s relief for oppression and to order a buyout of Kiri’s shares by Senda pursuant to s 216(2) of the Companies Act.  In theMain AppealJudgment, this court also set out a number of propositions relating to s 216 of the Companies Act, which were quoted from the Court of Appeal’s decision inOver and Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd[2010] 2 SLR 776.  Relevantly for present purposes, they included the following (seeMain Appeal Judgmentat [36]): (a) Section 216 provides for four limbs under which relief may be granted – oppression, disregard of a member’s interest, unfair discrimination and prejudicial conduct … (b) The four limbs are not to be applied disjunctively but as aspects of a common element of unfairness … … (g) Commercial fairness is the touchstone by which the court determines whether to grant relief under s 216 of the [Act].  It involves ‘a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect’ … 219 As this court observed in theMain Appeal Judgment(at [37]): … the standard of fairness is always the same but its content varies according to context, analogous to the way in which there is one standard of natural justice or procedural fairness which differs in content according to context. That rubric of fairness necessarily informs the shaping of particular relief — and in the case of a buyout order, the approach to valuation.  That approach is not confined to “a fair market value”, which might inform a sale and purchase between willing but not anxious parties.  A fair market value approach may be an answer to the question — what is fair? — for the purposes of s 216 of the Companies Act, but the question must be posed before the fair market value answer can be given. 220 The SICC’s approach to a DLOM in theFirst Valuation Judgmentwas much influenced by its interpretation of the High Court’s observations inThio Syn Kym([169] above) (see [172] above).  There, the court had made findings of oppression in limited respects in what was essentially a family dispute.  Having regard to the breakdown of goodwill and trust among the parties and the irretrievable unravelling of their relationships, the court had made a buyout order in favour of the plaintiffs “on the basis of a share price to be determined by an independent valuer who was to value the company as at the date of the [liability judgment] … as a going concern” (seeThio Syn Kymat [14]).  The court also gave the parties liberty to apply for directions if any were required (seeThio Syn Kymat [14]). 221 Thereafter, the defendants sought to include in the valuer’s terms of reference a requirement that the plaintiffs’ shares were to be valued on the basis of “fair market value”, which would allow for a discount to be applied to their valuation (seeThio Syn Kymat [15]).  The parties sought directions on that issue.  The sole issue before the court inThio Syn Kymwas “…whether any discount should be applied to the plaintiffs’ shares” (at [17]).  The defendants argued that discounts should be applied both for lack of control and marketability (seeThio Syn Kymat [21] and [23]). 222 The court inThio Syn Kymdiscussed questions of principle under the heading “[t]he law on the application of minority discounts”.  The term “minority discounts” was a reference to a DLOC, a discount for lack of control.  The court considered that, in the case of a quasi-partnership, there was a strong presumption that a DLOC should not be applied, though it may be displaced in “special circumstances” (seeThio Syn Kymat [25]).  After considering all the cases cited by counsel, the court took as a starting point that there was no such general rule in cases involving companies that were not quasi-partnerships (seeThio Syn Kymat [30]).  Instead, the court must look at all the facts and circumstances when determining whether a discount should be applied in any case (seeThio Syn Kymat [31]).  The court also considered that it would be more inclined to order no discount where the majority’s oppressive conduct was directed at worsening the position of the minority shareholders so as to compel them to sell out (seeThio Syn Kymat [31]).  As with cases involving quasi-partnerships, the court considered that it was likely to order a discount where the conduct of the minority themselves contributed to their exclusion from the company or the oppressive conduct complained of (seeThio Syn Kymat [31]). 223 The court then stated, as quoted by the SICC (see [170] above), that the principles it had enunciated “related only to the question of whether the court should order a minority discount for lack of control [ie, DLOC], and not in respect of a discount for non-marketability [ie, DLOM]” (seeThio Syn Kymat [32]).  In so doing, however, as appears from the passage quoted by the SICC, the court acknowledged that the prevention of unfairness to a minority shareholder who would not otherwise have sold out would apply with equal force even where the question of a discount for non-marketability was concerned (seeThio Syn Kymat [32]). 224 The court then identified countervailing considerations which might distinguish the case for a DLOM from the case for a DLOC (seeThio Syn Kymat [32]).  It considered, as the defendants had pointed out, the case for aDLOMthere arose from the difficulty of selling shares due to share transfer restrictions and the narrowness of the market, regardless of whether they were majority or minority shares.  The factors to be weighed where the applicability of a DLOM was concerned were also distinct from those relevant where the applicability of a DLOC was concerned.  The court acknowledged, as had been observed by counsel, that existing case law did not provide much guidance on when a DLOM should apply.  The court’s view was that the question of whether to apply a DLOM should ordinarily be left to be determined by the independent valuer in his expertise.  The court then said (at [32]): With that said, I do not foreclose the possibility that in an exceptional case, the circumstances may warrant an order by the court that no discount be applied in order to remedy the unfairness to the minority that would otherwise result. 225 As appears from the preceding, the court inThio SynKymdid not embark upon any elaborated discussion of the principles governing the application of a DLOM.  The court’s views must be read in the context of that particular case, which included express restrictions on the transfer of shares. 226 The observation made by the court inThio Syn Kymand quoted by the SICC, that the applicability of a DLOM should ordinarily be left to the expert valuer, and only apply in “exceptional circumstances”, was made in the context of the particular facts inThio Syn Kymand cannot be taken as a statement of general principle, defining theratioof the court’s decision in so far as it applied to a DLOM generally.  The focus of the judgment appears to have been on minority control in a company that was not a quasi-partnership (seeThio Syn Kymat [30]-[32]). 227 The High Court’s decision inThio Syn Kymwent on appeal and the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal inThio Syn Pyn v Thio Syn Kym Wendy andothers and another appeal[2019] 1 SLR 1065.  The focus of the Court of Appeal in that case was whether a distinction could be made between quasi-partnerships and other companies in determining whether shares should be valued on a discounted basis.  The court held that there was no overarching principle or legal policy that justified, as a general rule, the raising of a presumption of a discount in the context of non-quasi-partnerships (at [17]).  It does not appear from the judgment that there was any substantial argument about the applicability of a DLOM. 228 The SICC, as noted earlier, also relied upon the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal inLiew Kit Fah([173] above)for the general proposition that shares in a privately held company are not readily marketable.Liew Kit Fahwas a case in which there had been no finding of minority oppression.  The parties had compromised the proceedings before any such finding was made.  They had agreed to consent to an order by the court that the defendant-majority shareholders should purchase the shares of the plaintiff minority shareholders (see also [186] above). 229 A notable feature ofLiew Kit Fahwas the majority’s holding that the court’s powers under s 216(2) of the Companies Act were only enlivened where it was satisfied that minority oppression under s 216(1) has been established (at [20]).  In other words, absent a finding of oppression, the court had no power to order a buyout (seeLiew Kit Fahat [58]).  In those circumstances (at [58]): … the only way out for a disenchanted shareholder would be through the established processes for the sale of shares under the company’s articles. Those processes invariably contain restrictions on the transfer of shares, which, … give rise to the lack of marketability. 230 Importantly,Liew Kit Fahwas not a case in which the discretion under s 216 was exercised by the court.  Had there been a finding of oppression, the position and the approach taken by the court would have been informed by the principles flowing from such a finding and applicable to the remedial discretion. 231 Thus, inLiew Kit Fah, the majority’s comments about the valuation of the minority shareholder’s shareholding related to a buyoutoutsidethe minority oppression context.  The court stated (at [60]): We conclude by stating thatoutside the minority oppression context, the courts cannot be an avenue through which a minority shareholder obtains a pricehigherthan what he could have obtained had he gone through the usual process of selling his shares to the remaining shareholders. [emphasis in original in italics] [emphasis added in underline] Importantly, the majority also said (at [61]): In the light of our holding above that the sale of the respondents’ shares under the Buyout Order is to be treated as akin to avoluntary commercial transaction, and in the absence of a finding of oppression or any other extraordinary circumstances that justify the disapplication of the discounts for lack of control and lack of marketability, it necessarily follows, in our judgment, that the independent valuer is entitled to take into account those discounts in the valuation of the respondents’ shares in the Samwoh Group. [emphasis added] 232 The court offered a caution to shareholders seeking to resolve their differences by way of a similar consent order that it carried the risk that the valuation of the shares may be subject to minority discounts for lack of control and/or lack of marketability or both (at [62]). 233 As appears from the majority judgment inLiew Kit Fah, it drew a sharp and important distinction between consensual disposition of a minority shareholding, albeit pursuant to a consensual buyout order on the one hand, and non-consensual disposition pursuant to a buyout order made under s 216(2) of the Companies Act on the other hand.  It is in the latter context that general principles of fairness which must inform remedial dispositions under s 216(2) of the Companies Act play a role that they do not play in a consensual sale. 234 Relevant principles applicable to the valuation of shares under a compulsory buyout order were discussed, in the context of US jurisprudence, in “Shareholder Oppression and ‘Fair Value’: of Discounts, Dates and Dastardly Deeds in the Close Corporation” (2004) 54(2) Duke LJ 293 (“Shareholder Oppression”), a helpful article by Professor Douglas Moll (“Prof Moll”).  Prof Moll’s discussion is at a sufficiently high level of principle to be relevant to cases in analogous jurisdictions involving the valuation of shares which were the subject of a buyout order in oppression cases.  Prof Moll pointed out that the case against applying a DLOM depends upon the adoption by courts of anenterprise value interpretationof “fair value” rather than afair market value approach.  The latter involves the court valuing the minority’s shares by considering what a hypothetical purchaser would pay for them, while the former involves the court valuing the minority’s shares as apro ratashare of the company’s overall value (seeShareholder Oppressionat pp 296-297).  In the latter (but not the former), a marketability discount is applied since a hypothetical purchaser is likely to pay less for shares which lack a ready market (seeShareholder Oppressionat p 296). 235 Prof Moll observed, uncontroversially, that valuation is inherently contextual (seeShareholder Oppressionat p 319).  Assessment of the fair value of a minority investor’s shares require consideration of the context in which the fair value inquiry is made (seeShareholder Oppressionat 319): When that context is a buyout proceeding in an oppression setting, minority and marketability discounts are inappropriate, as the forced-sale nature of the buyout proceeding and the identity of the purchasers involved weigh heavily against the application of discounts. Further, a fair market value appraisal assumes the presence of a willing seller and a willing buyer who are under no obligation to act (see also [183] above;cf[208] above).  That prescription fails to reflect the actual circumstances surrounding compulsory buyouts in the oppression context (seeShareholder Oppressionat pp 319-320): A willing, no-obligation seller contemplates a person who voluntarily offers to sell—i.e., a person selling because he wants to do so, not because he has to do so.  The seller in a buyout setting, however, is typically an aggrieved minority shareholder who, one should presume, would have preferred to remain a shareholder in the company absent the oppressive conduct.  Stated differently, it is the oppression itself that forces the minority to seek an exit from the corporation. The fair market value concept of willing non-compelled buyers, was also said to be a poor fit with respect to the buyer (seeShareholder Oppressionat p 320): The buyer in an oppression lawsuit is typically the oppressive majority shareholder who has been ordered by the court to purchase the shares of the aggrieved minority investor.  A purchase dictated by judicial order, of course, is far from the willing, no-obligation-to-act assumption of the fair market value standard. 236 In the present case, the SICC took as a starting point the proposition fromThio Syn Kym([169] above) that a DLOM is to be applied save in “exceptional circumstances” (see [172] above).  That starting point, with respect, elevated an incidental observation into a principle of law (see [225]-[226] above).  That elevation was not warranted having regard to the context in which the observationwas made.  The countervailing considerations referred to by the court inThio SynKymin relation to a DLOMwere factors relevant to that particular case, including the existence of share transfer restrictions stipulating that the shares could only be sold to Singaporeans. 237 An important distinction is to be made between the general criterion of fairness which the court must apply in shaping the orders it makes under s 216(2) of the Companies Act (see [218]-[219] above) and the valuation test of “fair market value” which a valuer may be required to apply (see [219] above).  It is not for the court to substitute the judgment of the valuer for the judgment which the court has to make in determining whether the application of a DLOM isfairor not.  That is the anterior question.  It is not a question of “valuation science”.  If answered in the affirmative, it is for the valuer to determine the quantum of the DLOM, applying appropriate principles.  It may be that, applying valuation principles, the valuer may come to the view that no DLOM should be applied (see,eg,[193]-[197] above).  That conclusion would be answering a different and narrower question than the wide anterior question offairnessto be addressed by the court. 238 A value for minority shares is not necessarily to be determined only by reference to their fair market value in a market for those shares.  A fair value might instead reflect the underlying value of the company enterprise — for example, by reference to the cost of acquisition of those shares in a merger or takeover. 239 Prof Moll argued that the value of the investment that the oppressive shareholder has relinquished is at a minimum that shareholder’spro rataportion of the company’s overall value as an operating business (seeShareholder Oppressionat p 322).  As he observed (seeShareholder Oppressionat p 323): … it is not accurate to maintain, as discount proponents often do, that minority shareholders can only realize the value of their shares by selling them independently to a third party.  In the absence of oppression, a close corporation shareholder can expect to receive, over time, his percentage share of the company’s value through dividends, salary, acquisition consideration, and/or other distributions.  In a merger, for example, a 33 percent shareholder would receive 33 percent of the total price paid for the company—a price that should reflect the overall value of the business.  Assuming no oppressive conduct, therefore, an aggrieved shareholder could have maintained his investment and earned his proportional share of the company’s going-concern value.  When forced to relinquish that investment because of oppressive conditions, the shareholder should receive compensation for what has been taken—the right to receive a pro rata portion of the company’s overall value. 240 The primacy of the criterion of fairness was apparent from the very first UK case concerning a buyout order under s 210 of the 1948 UK Companies Act—Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyerand another[1959] AC 324, in which Lord Denning observed (at 369): One of the most useful orders mentioned in the section—which will enable the court to do justice to the injured shareholders—is to order the oppressor to buy their shares at a fair price: and a fair price would be, I think, the value which the shares would have had at the date of the petition, if there had been no oppression. So too, inIn Re Bird Precision Bellows Ltd[1984] Ch 419, Nourse J observed thatit was “axiomatic that a price fixed by the Court must be fair” (at 429).  In a frequently cited decision in the Supreme Court of British ColumbiaDiligenti v RWMD Operations Kelowna Ltd (No 2)(1977) CarswellBC 139, Fulton J said  “[t]he Court is concerned not with the market value of shares but with the fair value or price to be set in the circumstances” (at [81]) (see also the Australian cases ofSanford v Sanford Courier Service Pty Ltd(1986) 10 ACLC 549;ES Gordon Pty Ltd v Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd(1994) 15 ACSR 536 at 540;Coombs v Dynasty Pty Ltd(1994) 14 ACSR 60 (“Coombs”);Re Dalkeith Investments Pty Ltd(1984) 9 ACLR 247 at 255;Re Bagot Well Pastoral Company Pty Ltd(1992) 9 ACSR 129;Re QuestExploration Pty Ltd(1992) 6 ACSR 659;Short v Crawley (No 30)[2007] NSWSC 1322 and the discussion in in R Brockett, “The Valuation of Minority Shareholdings in an Oppression Context – A Contemporary Review” (2012) 24(2) Bond LR101). 241 The approach to the application of a DLOM in the making of a buyout order under s 216(2) of the Companies Act has not been authoritatively determined by the courts in Singapore.  The variety of cases which were cited tended to turn on their own facts or were distinguishable in one way or another without enunciating any general principle.  In the view of this court, it is appropriate that courts making buyout orders and referring the question of valuation to an independent expert or experts shouldfirstdetermine whether it is appropriate to order a DLOC and/or a DLOM.  The answers to those questions respond to a broader principle than the quantification of the discounts, which is properly within the sphere of the experts.  This accords with the approach taken by the House of Lords inO’Neill v Phillips[1999] 1 WLR 1092,dealing with the valuation of shares subject to a buyout order under provisions of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) that are analogous to s 216(2) of the Companies Act.  Lord Hoffman, with whom all other members of the House agreed, said (at 1107): In the first place, the offer must be to purchase the shares at a fair value.This will ordinarily be a value representing an equivalent proportion of the total issued share capital, that is, without a discount for its being a minority holding.  The Law Commission (paragraphs 3.57-62) has recommended a statutory presumption that in cases to which the presumption of unfairly prejudicial conduct applies, the fair value of the shares should be determined on a pro rata basis.  This too reflects the existing practice.  This is not to say that there may not be cases in which it will be fair to take a discounted value.  But such cases will be based upon special circumstances and it will seldom be possible for the Court to say that an offer to buy on a discount basis is plainly reasonable, so that the petition should be struck out. [emphasis added] 242 In the present case, having regard to the findings of oppression made by the SICC, the fact that Senda will acquire full ownership of the enterprise through its shareholding, an enterprise whose value will not be affected by the marketability of minority shares, the proper course for the SICC was to order that there be no DLOM.  That was not a decision dependent upon the complexities of the differing approaches taken by the valuation experts.  This is not to say that there will not be circumstances in which a court, in the interests of fairness, takes the view that the lack of control and/or lack of marketability should attract discounts to be assessed.  No doubt the circumstances under which the court may order that such discounts be applied will be worked out on a case-by-case basis. 243 The general rubric of fairness which informs the exercise of the discretion under s 216(2) of the Companies Act (see [219] above) would readily authorise the court to conclude that a limitation to “fair market value”, assessed in the hypothetical context of willing buyers and sellers, would not be fair.  That consideration applies equally to a DLOC and a DLOM.  Of course, it may be said and with some force, that questions of marketability are best left to the experts to determine. 244 Having regard to the findings of oppressive conduct in the present case which, unlikeThio Syn Kym([169] above), is not simply a multi-dimensional breakdown of family relationships, and involved reprehensible conduct on the part of Senda, it is difficult to see why Senda, which will gain total control of DyStar as a result of the buyout order, should gain the benefit of a discount on the basis that it might wish to on-sell Kiri’s minority shareholding to another party where the price might be affected by their marketability. 245 There was no case made in theFirst Valuation Judgmentfor the proposition that a DLOM should be the default position in valuation of shares under a buyout order made pursuant to s 216(2) of the Companies Act.  The SICC’s reasons in theFirst Valuation Judgmentdid not disclose why a sale forced upon Kiri by the conduct of Senda, not involving any contributory conduct by Kiri, should reflect anything less than the enterprise value of DyStar underpinning the value of Kiri’s shareholding.  There will no doubt be cases in which the ambulatory content of fairness, deployed in the exercise of the court’s remedial discretion conferred by s 216(2), may require the application of a DLOM, if a DLOM can be quantified.  That was not the case here.  Kiri’s appeal on Appeal Issue 8 should therefore be allowed.",
        "Appeal Issue 9: Exploitation benefit for Longsheng’s use of the O288 Patent — account of profits or notional licence fee": "",
        "The SICC’s Reasoning": "246 In theMain Judgment([1] above),the SICC had held the O288 Patent to have been exploited by Longsheng, which used it in producing black and blue disperse dyes, and that such exploitation by Longsheng amounted to oppression.  The question for the valuation proceedings was how the benefits derived by Longsheng from that exploitation was to be factored into DyStar’s valuation (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [178]). 247 The SICC held that the benefits obtained by Longsheng from its exploitation of the O288 Patent ought to be incorporated into the valuation of DyStar based on the value of the notional licence fee that Longsheng would have paid to DyStar (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [178]). 248 The conceptual basis for assessing the benefits obtained by Longsheng from its exploitation of the O288 Patent by way of a notional licence fee was said to be rooted in the notion of hypothetical damages set out inWrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd[1974] 1 WLR 798 (“Wrotham Park”), an approach endorsed by the Court of Appeal inTurf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Huaand others and another appeal[2018] 2 SLR 655, and more recently, applied by the High Court inHT SRL v Wee Shuo Woon[2019] 5 SLR 245. 249 The SICC characterised the rationale behind theWrotham Parkrule thus (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [180]): … an injured party must besufficientlycompensated for monies that itwould have demandedin allowing the defaulting party to do what would otherwise have been prohibited under the contract between them. [emphasis in original] 250 Reference was also made by the SICC to the decision of the UK Supreme Court inOne-Step (Support) Ltd v Morris-Garner[2018] 2 WLR 1353.  That case concerned compensation for breach of a restrictive covenant prohibiting competition, solicitation and use of confidential information.  The UK Supreme Court held that compensation for breach might be based on “user damages” or the appropriate fee to be paid for release from the covenant. 251 The SICC applied theWrotham Parkrationalemutatis mutandis.  It said (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [182]): We must incorporate into DyStar’s valuation the hypothetical loss suffered by DyStar, in recognition of the fact that DyStar would have demanded a licence fee from Longsheng (and thereby have grown in value) but for Longsheng’s oppressive exploitation of the Patent. 252 The hypothetical loss suffered by DyStar was to be calculated based on a notional licence fee, being the royalties that DyStar would have charged Longsheng for its exploitation of the O288 Patent. 253 The SICC rejected Senda’s argument that DyStar would not be able or entitled to charge a licence fee at all (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [184]).  The SICC considered that cl 8 of the agreement under which Longsheng took an assignment of the O288 Patent (the “Patent Assignment Agreement”), had been unequivocal.  It noted that Senda had not been able to describe a single circumstance under which Longsheng would have been able to exploit the O288 Patent without having to pay DyStar. 254 The SICC expressly rejected Kiri’s contention that DyStar should be entitled to an account of profits for the benefits obtained by Longsheng from its exploitation of the O288 Patent.  The SICC reasoned thus: Longsheng would have been able to exploit the O288 Patent with DyStar’s consent, and the failure by Longsheng to obtain DyStar’s consent was the oppressive act.  Had Longsheng sought and obtained DyStar’s consent, DyStar would have charged Longsheng a licence fee (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [185]). 255 More importantly, the SICC accepted Senda’s contention that DyStar was not in a position to fully exploit the O288 Patent itself and had mainly sought to profit from the O288 Patent by using it for strategic and competitive purposes.  The SICC observed that (seeFirst Valuation Judgmentat [186]): Kiri was unable to challenge Eric’s testimony to this effect in the valuation proceedings.  Kiri has not been able to adduce any evidence to demonstrate that DyStar was in a position to exploit the [O288 Patent] in the manner that Longsheng did given DyStar’s infrastructural and resources limitations.",
        "Conclusion on patent exploitation benefit": "260 This ground can be dealt with shortly.  For Kiri to succeed, it would be necessary to show that the remedial discretion invested in the SICC under s 216(2) of the Companies Act miscarried.  The reasoning which led the SICC to assess the benefits obtained by Longsheng from its exploitation of the O288 Patent (of which Longsheng had been a proprietor under the Patent Assignment Agreement) by way of a notional licence fee was perfectly defensible.  It was reflective of the reality that theonlyrelevant counterfactual was Longsheng’s use of the O288 Patent under a licencing arrangement.  There is no basis for this court to interfere with the SICC’s finding that DyStar was not in a position to fully exploit the O288 Patent itself.  DyStar would (and could) only have charged Longsheng a licence fee had Longsheng sought and obtained DyStar’s consent for use of the O288 Patent.  This aspect of Kiri’s appeal therefore does not succeed. 261 This is also an appropriate juncture for this court to deal with Summonses Nos 1 and 2 of 2022 (“SUM 1 & 2”).  Those were applications filed by Kiri for leave to introduce a new point on appeal.  Kiri says that it filed SUM 1 & 2 out of caution after Senda contended in its Skeletal Arguments that Kiri has advanced a new point in its Appellant’s Reply.  That new point was Kiri’s argument that the conduct of the Longsheng directors in connection with Longsheng’s failure to re-assign and its subsequent exploitation of the O288 Patent amounted to breaches of fiduciary duty to DyStar, which it made in support of its case that an account of profits be ordered to remedy the oppression (see [257] above).  Given our decision on Appeal Issue 9, it is not necessary for us to consider the merits of those arguments.  For present purposes, it suffices to state that those arguments had never been part of Kiri’s pleaded case before the SICC.  Applying the factors considered by a court in determining if a party ought to be granted leave to introduce a new point on appeal (seeBintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&T Corp and another[2019] 2 SLR 295 at [67]), we consider that leave ought not be granted to Kiri and so we would have dismissed SUM 1 & 2 in any event.",
        "Appeal Issue 10: The calculation of the notional licence fee": "",
        "Conclusion on notional licence fee quantum": "289 The extent of the submissions by Kiri and Senda on this question rather throws up the brevity of the consideration of this matter by the SICC. 290 The SICC appears to have decided this aspect of the case on the basis that: (a) the burden of proof was on Kiri; and (b) the burden was for Kiri to show exactly how severe the under-disclosure of tonnage of products manufactured by Longsheng and which were covered by the claims of the O288 Patent was. 291 There have been many cases in which the courts have been urged to take a robust approach to the assessment of damages where loss has been suffered but the quantum is difficult to assess (see,eg,Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“Robertson Quay Investment”) at [30] and [36];MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd and another v Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd and another appeal[2011] 1 SLR 150 at [57]).  This is particularly so when the problem arises from a defaulting party’s lack of disclosure.  As was said in those cases (seeRobertson Quay Investmentat [30], citing Devlin J (as he then was) inBiggin & Co Ltd v Permanite, Ld[1951] 1 KB 422 at 438): [W]here precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to have it.  Where it is not, the court must do the best it can. 292 It is not for this court to now write a first instance judgment examining the evidence on this point, not least because it is not clear whether and to what extent the SICC had accepted Kiri’s position with respect to the Related Products.  This was an important quantum element in the assessment of damages.  It was not one to be disposed of on the application of a burden of proof where that burden operated to the disadvantage of one party because of the apparent under-disclosure of another.  The appropriate course is to remit this aspect of the matter to the SICC for determination on the best evidence available to it.  Kiri’s ground of appeal on the quantum of the notional licence fee succeeds.",
        "Appeal Issue 11:  Discretionary enhancement on the value of Kiri’s shares in DyStar": "",
        "Conclusion on discretionary enhancement": "323 As the Court of Appeal stated inYeo Hung Khiang([10] above), s 216(2) of the Companies Act is a wide-ranging section that gives the court appropriately extensive discretionary powers to effect justice in the particular circumstances of individual cases (at [71]).  In our view, it is open to a court to order a discretionary enhancement of the value of the shares to be purchased under a buyout order, particularly where the innocent minority shareholder is to receive the value of the shares as at the buyout date and has to wait for a significant period before he receives payment for the value of those shares (ie, where there is a delay in the execution of the buyout order).  This may occur where there are protracted valuation proceedings before a final figure is adjudged and an enforceable judgment is delivered.  Such a discretion is not directed towards penalising the oppressing party.  Its proper purpose is to ensure that the minority shareholder is not unfairly disadvantaged by delays between the making of a buyout order and the adjudgment of a final valuation figure and the delivery an enforceable judgment. 324 As is with any matter involving the court’s exercise of its remedial discretion under s 216(2) of the Companies Act, fairness is the governing rubric (see [218]-[219] above).  Thus, it would be a factor relevant to the exercise of the discretion that either party was responsible to any extent for the delay which occurred in the execution of the buyout order.  It would also be a relevant factor that the conduct of either party prior to the making of the buyout order had contributed to the complexity, and hence the duration, of the valuation process.  In the case of extraneous events causing delay, such as disruption to availability of legal representatives or court staff by reason of a pandemic, the burden of that delay might be divided equally.  This is not to lay down any prescriptive rules governing the operation of the discretion, but rather to indicate the kinds of factors that may be relevant to how it is exercised in a particular case. 325 There can be no doubt that the parties have joined issue on the question of discretionary enhancement, albeit the scope of the claim by Kiri appears to be narrower than that put before the SICC (see [293] and [296] above).  That said, the SICC dealt with the issue on a basis applicable to discretionary enhancement where there is a delay between the valuation date and the buyout date.  It distinguishedYeo Hung KhiangandLim Ah Sia([295(a)] above)on that basis.  It does not appear to have been asked to consider discretionary enhancement in the context of a delay between the making of the buyout order and its completion.  That being so, what is put before this court is not an appeal point but an application to vary the outcome secured before the SICC on a basis not clearly put before it.  While there may well have been merit in such an application, it is not a matter on which this court should intervene in what would, in effect, be an exercise of original rather than appellate jurisdiction.  The application for discretionary enhancement fails.",
        "General conclusions": "326 As appears from the preceding, Senda has failed on each of the five Appeal Issues which it raised.  Kiri has succeeded on two of the six Appeal Issues which it has raised. 327 Each of Senda’s appeals will be dismissed with costs.  Kiri’s appeal point in relation to the applicability of a DLOM (Appeal Issue 8) was raised in CA 7.  So too was its appeal point in relation to the quantum of the notional licence fee (Appeal Issue 10).  Kiri has prevailed on both these issues (see [245] and [292] above).  Thus, the appeal in CA 7 will be allowed in part.  The discretionary enhancement point (Appeal Issue 11) was raised in CA 22 and given our determination of that issue (see [325] above), CA 22 will be dismissed.  Kiri’s appeal against theFinal Valuation Judgmentin CA 47 is allowed in part consistently with the outcome in CA 7. 328 Kiri has sought costs of $300,000 and disbursements of $16,872.97 in respect of Senda’s appeals.  The court will, however, fix the costs payable by Senda to Kiri at $180,000 inclusive of disbursements.  It may be noted that there was little by way of proper substantiation by either party for their costs claims. 329 In relation to Kiri’s appeals, Senda had claimed costs of $450,000 and disbursements of $53,146.86.  Kiri claimed costs of $750,000 and disbursements of $47,623.46.  Having regard to the mixed outcomes of Kiri’s appeals and its lack of success on four of the six Appeal Issues which it argued, the court is of the view that each party should bear its own costs of those appeals.  The court will, however, allow Kiri its claimed disbursements, fixed at $47,623.46. 330 The orders of this court are as follows: (a) Senda’s appeals in CA 8, CA 45 and CA 48, are dismissed. (b) Senda is to pay Kiri’s costs fixed at $180,000 inclusive of disbursements as one sum applicable to all of Senda’s appeals. (c) Kiri’s appeal in CA 7 is allowed in part: (i) The SICC’s decision that a DLOM be applied in determining the value of Kiri’s shareholding in DyStar for the purposes of the buyout order is set aside. (ii) The quantum, determined by the SICC, of the notional licence fee payable by Longsheng to DyStar for its wrongful exploitation of the O288 Patent is set aside. (d) Kiri’s appeal in CA 22 is dismissed. (e) Kiri’s appeal in CA 47 is allowed and the final valuation of Kiri’s shares as determined by the SICC is set aside. (f) The matter is remitted to the SICC to give effect to the judgment of this court in relation to the application of the DLOM and the quantification of the notional licence fee payable by Longsheng to DyStar for its wrongful exploitation of the O288 Patent. (g) Senda is to pay Kiri’s disbursements of $47,623.46 fixed as one set of disbursements with respect to Kiri’s appeals in CA 7 and CA 47.
