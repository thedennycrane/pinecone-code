        "Introduction": "1 This judgment deals with two issues occasioned by this court’s decision in allowing the appeal by the fourth and fifth appellants in CA/CA 113/2020 (“VMF3” and “VMIII”, respectively), while dismissing the appeal by the first to third appellants (“Crest Capital”, “Crest Catalyst” and “EFIII”, respectively) (collectively, the “Crest Entities”): seeCrest Capital Asia Pte Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) and another and other appeals[2021] SGCA 25 (“the Appeal Judgment”). 2 The first issue pertains to a consequential order (“the Consequential Order”) sought by VMF3 and VMIII (the “Consequential Order Issue”): that the sums VMIII paid the [respondents] in satisfaction of the judgment sum be restored to VMIII, together with interest at 5.33% p.a. calculated from the date of receipt. 3 The second issue pertains to how costs should be ordered in relation to the respondents’ claims against VMF3 and VMIII, both at first instance and on appeal (“the Costs Issue”). 4 In the Appeal Judgment at [3], we cautioned that when different principals are represented by the same set of lawyers, it is essential to undertake a separate factual inquiry as to whether the acts or omissions of their representatives and/or agents can be attributed to each of the principals. An omission to do so may lead the parties to overlook this critical distinction, resulting in the court treating these principals alike although they might in fact be situated differently. The risk of unintended consequences in treating all the principals alike can also occur in a post-judgment scenario whenoneof the principals, as a judgment debtor, pays thefulljudgment debt in discharge of thejoint and several liabilityofallthe principals. That risk materialised in this case precisely because one of the appellants,VMIII, paid the judgment debt and the costs in discharge of the joint and several liability ofall the Crest Entities. Through the two issues outlined above, VMIII seeks toundothe unintended consequences of its payment of the judgment debt and costs on behalf of all the Crest Entities. 5 After due consideration of the parties’ respective submissions on the two issues, our decision, in brief, is as follows: (a) On the Consequential Order Issue, the sums paid by VMIII to the respondents should notbe restored to VMIII. The sums paid by VMIII were, in our view, meant to discharge the joint and several liability of thesame indivisiblejudgment debt on behalf ofall the Crest Entities. Therefore, VMIII should look to Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII for reimbursement of the funds that it had paid out on behalf ofall the Crest Entities. (b) On the Costs Issue, the costs order at first instance should be upheld. VMIII should likewise look to Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII for reimbursement of the costs that it had paid out on behalf ofall the Crest Entities. As for the costs order on appeal, the respondents are to pay VMF3 and VMIII costs fixed at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements. Such costs are to reflect the limited ground on which their appeals succeeded.",
        "Consequential Order Issue": "",
        "Background": "26 To recap, the High Court ordered the Crest Entities to pay the respondents costs for the trial to the tune of about $350,000. The $350,000 was fully paid by VMIII in September 2020, together with the $10.3m payment.",
        "The parties’ positions": "VMF3 and VMIII 27 For the costs of the trial below, VMF3 and VMIII seek a refund of the $350,000 paid by VMIII, for reasons similar to those in relation to the $10.3m payment. They further estimate their share of the costs below to be at about $100,000. They thus submit that the respondents should, after refunding the full sum of $350,000 to VMIII, be allowed to seek recovery of only $250,000 (being $350,000$100,000) from Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII. In addition, the respondents are also to pay them costs of $100,000. 28 For their appeal costs, VMF3 and VMIII are not seeking their full estimated costs of about $100,000. Instead, they seek only costs from the respondents to the tune of $80,000, which, coincidentally or otherwise, is the same amount that Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII have been ordered to pay the respondents. The respondents 29 For the costs of the trial below, the respondents submit that: (a) No order as to costs should be made in favour of VMF3 and VMIII. (i) The Crest Entities’ positions were aligned during the trial below, as they relied on the same set of pleadings and on the evidence of the same witness. This was notwithstanding an apparent conflict of interest between VMF3 and VMIII on one hand, and the remaining the Crest Entities on the other. Given that the Crest Entities ran their casejointlyduring the trial below, VMF3’s and VMIII’s costs cannot beseparatedfrom those of the remaining Crest Entities. In the same vein, the High Court ordered the Crest Entities to pay costs on a joint and several basis. Therefore, if the respondents are to be liable to VMF3 and VMIII for the costs of the trial below, it would have the effect of the respondentssubsidisingthe costs of Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII. (ii) Further, the Crest Entities, including VMF3 and VMIII, ran a very wide defence in the trial below, the large part of which failed. (b) In the alternative, aSandersonorder should be made such that Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII should be liable for VMF3’s and VMIII’s costs. (i) It was reasonable for the respondents to have pursued against VMF3 and VMIII, since they were parties to the Disputed Facilities. (ii) Further, this court found that VMF3 and VMIII were misled by the investment memorandums for which the remaining Crest Entities were responsible. 30 For their appeal costs, the respondents accept that they should be liable to VMF3 and VMIII for their costs. However, the respondents submit that VMF3’s and VMIII’s appeals only succeeded on a narrow issue,ie, on the issue ofproofof attribution while the remaining points raised by VMF3 and VMIII on appeal failed. To that extent, thequantumof costs should not be the full sum estimated by VMF3 and VMIII at $100,000, but only a quarter of that or $25,000.",
        "Our decision": "Costs of the trial below (i) Refund of the $350,000 31 The first issue with respect to the costs below is whether the $350,000 in costs paid by VMIII should be fully refunded to VMIII. We are of the view that there should be no refund, for the same reasons as those set out in [13]–[20] above. The Crest Entities were found to be jointly and severally liable for the costs below, and the $350,000 paid by VMIII was likewise intended to discharge the joint and several liability for costs ofall the Crest Entities. That being the case, it is for VMIII to seek contribution from the remaining Crest Entities in the same way as it would have to look to the remaining Crest Entities for reimbursement of the $10.3m payment (see [20] above). (ii) Adjustments to the costs order below 32 The second issue relates to the possible adjustment of the costs order below. VMIII and VMF3 succeeded in their appeals on the limited issue of attribution. Ordinarily, costs should follow the event, and on that basis VMIII and VMF3 argue that they should be awarded costs for the trial below in relation to this issue. In response, the respondents raise two arguments that they should not be liable to VMII and VMF3 in costs for the attribution issue. First, they argue that the Crest Entities pursued a joint defence below, and that the specific issue of attribution was not exhaustively ventilated. Second, and in the alternative, they argue that it should be Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII which should be liable for VMF3’s and VMIII’s costs (ie, that aSandersonorder should be ordered), since they were the parties who concealed the true purpose of the Standby Facility from VMF3 and VMIII. 33 We accept the respondents’ first argument. We observed in [119]–[120] of the Appeal Judgment that therewassome divergence in the court below between VMF3 and VMIII on one hand, and the remaining three Crest Entities on the other, in relation to the attribution issue. This issue might not have been thoroughly and exhaustively explored below, but it was nevertheless explored. However, the purpose of that observation was to make the point that the attribution issue was not a new one that took the respondents by surprise. In other words, it was open to VMF3 and VMIII to pursue the attribution issue on appeal. Whether any costs should be awarded to VMF3 and VMIII in relation to the attribution issue is another matter altogether. In our view, for the reasons that follow, the costs order below should not be disturbed. 34 The costs order below was awarded by the Judge after taking into account the respondents’ claims and the Crest Entities’consolidateddefences raised below. The costs incurred by the respondentsvis-à-visall the Crest Entities would not have been materially different from the costs incurredvis-à-visthe remaining three Crest Entities whose appeals failed. Even on the footing that there was some divergence between the Crest Entities in relation to the attribution issue, such divergence was minimal and would not have caused the costs incurred below to be materially different between VMF3 and VMIII on the one hand and the other three Crest Entities on the other, keeping in mind the following: (a) The Crest Entities relied on the same set of pleadings, the same Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief and the same set of submissions for the trial below. (b) In the Crest Entities’ written opening statement for the trial below, there was in fact no reference to the attribution point. The first mention of the attribution point appears to have been only in the oral opening statement. (c) In the Crest Entities’ closing submissions for the trial below, only six paragraphs (out of 490) dealt with the attribution point; in the reply closing submissions, only eight paragraphs (out of 178) were devoted to the attribution point. 35 To that extent, as far as the respondents are concerned, it cannot be said that they incurred more costs by reason of the defence raised by VMF3 and VMIII generally, or on account of the attribution point specifically. A total of 14 paragraphs was devoted to the attribution issue, a negligible fraction of the whole that does not warrant our intervention in the costs order below. In our view, the costs order below still essentially reflected the same work done by the respondents, albeitvis-à-visthree instead of all five Crest Entities. The costs order imposed by the Judge below therefore ought to stand. 36 For completeness, we do not accept the respondents’ second and alternative argument for aSandersonorder. By way of background, aSandersonorder would require the losing defendants (in this case, Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII) to be liable for the costs of the successful defendants (in this case, VMF3 and VMIII). The rationale of aSandersonorder was explained by this court inChua Teck Chew Robert v Goh Eng Wah[2009] 4 SLR(R) 716 (“Goh Eng Wah”) at [40]: The purpose of a Sanderson order … is to avoid the injustice of a successful claimant having what he recovers in damages eroded by an order to pay costs to successful defendants whom it was reasonable for him, when he does not know which of the defendants to sue, to join … In deciding whether to grant a Sanderson order, the court’s principal consideration is whether it would be fair and reasonable for the unsuccessful defendant to bear the costs of the successful defendant(s) … 37 The crux of the respondents’ argument is that Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIIIconcealedthe true purpose of the Disputed Facilities from VMF3 and VMIII, and thus the former three should be responsible for any costs incurred by the latter two. We do not find this argument persuasive. As the respondents themselves recognised, the crucial consideration behind the grant of aSandersonorder is whether the unsuccessful defendants haveshifted some or all of the liability to the successful defendants, such that the plaintiffwas forced to join the successful defendants to the proceedings(seeGoh Eng Wahat [41],Denis Matthew Harte v Tan Hun Hoe and another[2001] SGHC 19 at [11(c)]). Here, on the respondents’ own case, they would have pursued VMF3 and VMIII regardless, since VMF3 and VMIII were parties to the Disputed Facilities. It cannot be said that the concealment of the true purpose of the Disputed Facilities by Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII caused orforcedthe respondents to join VMF3 and VMIII in the suit below. 38 The facts of the present appeal can be contrasted with cases whereSandersonorders have been imposed. InDBS Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Chin Pang Joo andanother[2009] SGHC 248, the plaintiff bank sued the first defendant for losses incurred on the first defendant’s trading account with the plaintiff. The first defendant claimed that the relevant transactions were carried out by the second defendant without authorisation. It was eventually found that the second defendant did have the authorisation to carry out the relevant transactions. On that basis, the High Court issued aSandersonorder requiring the first defendant to pay the costs of the second defendant. 39 In the same vein, inGoh Eng Wah, the titular plaintiff (“Goh”), Robert Chua Teck Chew (“Chua”) and Daikin Industries Limited (“Daikin Japan”), were shareholders of Daikin Airconditioning (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Daikin Singapore”). Goh sued Chua, Daikin Japan and Daikin Singapore (amongst others) for payments due under an incentive scheme entered into between them. At the trial below, Goh succeeded in his claim against Chua but failed in his claims against the other defendants. Chua appealed against the High Court’s decision in finding him liable, while Goh appealed against the High Court’s refusal to order Chua to pay the costs of the other successful defendants (ie, to make aSandersonorder). 40 On appeal, this court noted that Chua had repeatedly tried to lay blame for the shortfall in the incentive payments on Daikin Japan and Daikin Singapore, and continued to do so throughout the course of the trial below (at [41], [43]). In those circumstances, this court found it just to make Chua liable for half the costs of Daikin Japan and Daikin Singapore. 41 It can thus be observed that the unsuccessful defendants in the two authorities mentioned above had all tried to shift the blame on the successful defendants. In the present case, there was no question of Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII shifting the blame to VMF3 and VMIII. The former might have misled the latter as to the true purpose of the Disputed Facilities, but that, if anything, merely meant that VMF3 and VMIII werenotblameworthy in contrast with the remaining three Crest Entities. In this regard, we note that the remaining three Crest Entities were content for VMF3 and VMIII to pursue this argument below. Therefore, we are not satisfied that the grant of aSandersonorder would be appropriate in this case. While the fact remains that VMF3 and VMIII were misled as to the true purpose of the Disputed Facilities, the prerogative rests withthemas to whether they wish to pursue any claim against the remaining Crest Entities. Costs of the appeal 42 The parties agree that the respondents are liable for VMF3’s and VMIII’s costs. The disagreement only concerns thequantumof such costs. 43 We agree with the respondents that VMF3 and VMIII should not be awarded the full sum of $100,000, or the alternative amount of $80,000. As the respondents have pointed out, VMF3 and VMIII succeeded in their appeals only on a narrow point ofproofof attribution, while their remaining arguments were rejected. While we did engage Mr Toby LandauQC, counsel for VMF3 and VMIII, primarily on the attribution issue during the oral hearing, the remaining arguments which we did not accept were nonetheless prominently featured in VMF3’s and VMIII’s written case on appeal. Further, the questions posed to Mr Landau on the attribution issue also concerned the sub-issue ofpleadings, on which VMF3 and VMIII did not succeed. 44 We are of the view that VMF3 and VMIII should only be awarded slightly less than one-third of their estimated costs, or $30,000 inclusive of disbursements.",
        "Costs Issue": "",
        "Conclusion": "45 In conclusion, we dismiss the Consequential Order sought by VMF3 and VMIII. VMIII should look to Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII instead of the respondents for reimbursement of the $10.3m payment if indeed it was funded entirely by VMIII. We observe that the information as to which partyactuallyfunded the payment of $10.3m resides exclusively with all the Crest Entities. We find it rather odd that this vital aspect of the payment was inexplicably omitted by VMIII. 46 In relation to the Costs Issue: (a) For the costs for the trial below, VMIII should again look to Crest Capital, Crest Catalyst and EFIII for the reimbursement of the $350,000, and not the respondents. The costs order imposed below stands. (b) In relation to the appeal, the respondents are to pay VMF3 and VMIII costs fixed at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements.
