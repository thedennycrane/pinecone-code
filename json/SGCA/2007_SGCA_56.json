        "The nature of CDR": "24           Formal mediation was introduced for civil cases in the Subordinate Courts in June 1994. In 1995, the Court Mediation Centre was created to merge, refine and develop the various mediation services offered by the Subordinate Courts. As stated inThe Judiciary, Singapore: Annual Report 1996at p 53: The objectives of the Court Mediation Centre areinter aliato provide a forum for parties to explore settlement options with a view to the resolution of their disputes without trial adjudication. The resolution of conflicts through mediation results in the saving of time and costs. 25           Mediation is a form of consensual dispute resolution. In the Subordinate Courts, mediation is conducted in the PDRC under the auspices or with the assistance of the court, hence, the nomenclature “CDR” for short. The PDRC has provided, and continues to provide, mediation services in a wide spectrum of matters, including civil, family, small claims, juvenile and criminal matters. In September 2000, the PDRC introduced electronic mediation by establishing an additional facility called the “e@dr Centre” to reflect the inclusion of online mediation and virtual dispute resolution in its portfolio. The PDRC is a centre; therefore, by definition, it is neither a court of law nor intended to be one. It is, instead, a collective name or description for the various venues where CDR settlement conferences are held. 26           CDR settlement conferences are conducted by CDR settlement judges, who are also district judges. Although para 25(11) of theSubordinate Courts Practice Directions(2006 Ed) gives the Registrar the power to appoint “non-judicial officers such as legal assistants” to conduct CDR settlement conferencesin “actions arising out of collision on land where there are no claims for personal injuries and where the issues in dispute are factual and not issues of law”, this power has hitherto not been exercised. 27The CDR settlement judge is a key feature ofSingapore’s CDR model, the salient features of which are described in Liew Thiam Leng,Alternative Dispute Resolution in Singapore<http://www.e-adr.gov.sg/archives/PAPER%20FOR %20SPIDR.pdf> (accessed 20 December 2007) at pp 7–8 as follows: (a)        Mediation under the CDR process is court-based,ie, it occurs only in cases where the parties in dispute have filed an action in court. (b)        CDR settlement judges act as mediators as, being judicial officers of the State, “[t]hey command public confidence and respect[,] which in turn makes them more effective mediators” (ibid). (c)        CDR is a directive form of court-assisted mediation, with the CDR settlement judge playing a “pro-active role by suggesting and guiding the parties with possible options but not to the extent of giving a definite opinion on the matter” (ibid). 28           There are several ways in which a case filed in the Subordinate Courts may be referred for CDR, namely: (a)        at the request of the parties or their counsel; (b)        by the Registrar at the point of a summons for directions; (c)        by the district judge overseeing the pre-trial management of cases that have been set down for trial; or (d)        by a general court direction, such as that applicable in what are termed “non-injury motor accident” (“NIMA”) cases. Feedback from litigants shows an overwhelming preference for district judges to act as mediators because of the public confidence and respect that they command (see also [27] above), as well as the convenience to the parties of being able to directly enforce a court-mediated settlement by means of a court order. 29           This judge-driven nature of our CDR model makes it considerably different in nature from other facilitative alternative dispute resolution processes where the mediator facilitates settlement by helping the parties to appreciate how their interests will be advanced by settling the matter. The parties obtain the best legal advice that litigants in an adversarial system of dispute resolution can get,viz, that of a judge who has experience in assessing evidence and determining liability. In this regard, our CDR model issui generis, and is particularly suited to a jurisdiction where litigants respect the impartiality of judges in giving objective views on the merits of the claim and the defence respectively. 30           If the parties cannot resolve their dispute via CDR, the case simply proceeds to trial before another judge who is not the CDR settlement judge involved in the matter. However, if the case is settled, the practice hitherto has been for the terms of that settlement to be recorded by the CDR settlement judge in the form of either a settlement agreement or a consent order. The problem in this case was that the Court Order stipulated that a notice of discontinuance was to be filed within eight weeks. There was some ambiguity as to what those words meant, which in turn gave rise to the mess that subsequently developed as a result of the actions of Mr H.",
        "Our decision": "31           In RAS 17/07, the substantive issue that was put to the Judge by Mr A was whether a CDR settlement judge had the jurisdiction or power to issue an order of court. Mr A submitted that a CDR settlement judge was not so empowered since a CDR settlement conference was not a court proceeding and since the PDRC, where such settlement conferences take place (see [25] above), was not a court of law vested with judicial authority. In his oral arguments, Mr A referred to,inter alia, the Subordinate Courts’ directions on the CDR process, including the protocol applicable in NIMA cases, to show that CDR had 13 features which made it distinct from court proceedings. In contrast, Mr H argued that CDR was part of the judicial process, and that, in any case, the respondent should have taken out an application for judicial review in respect of the District Judge’s decision instead of appealing to the High Court. Mr H also pointed out that the version of the Court Order which he had extracted (see [6] above) had been settled by the court. But, he also appeared to have conceded before the Judge that he should not have extracted the Court Order. The Judge further observed that, in his letter dated 13 April 2006 seeking the Registrar’s approval of the draft of the Court Order (see [6] above), Mr H had stated that “defendant’s counsel didn’t reply”, which was “not true” [emphasis added] (see p 6 of the certified transcript of the notes of argument of the hearing before the Judge on 4 April 2007). 32           Regrettably, neither counsel appeared to have made any arguments based on the facts of the case; in particular, they did not address the question of whether the actions which they had taken before and after the extraction of the Court Order were evidence of what they had contemplated or agreed upon as the object of the CDR effected in the present case. Additionally, neither counsel was concerned about the economics of bringing a dispute over a sum of about $60 (initially) to the High Court, especially when both the appellant and the respondent were insured by the same insurer. 33           In the circumstances, given the way in which the questions of law were framed before the Judge, it was inevitable that she would hold that: (a) the PDRC was not a court of law; (b) CDR was not part of the court process whilst a CDR settlement judge was acting as a mediator; and (c) therefore, a CDR settlement judge acting in that capacity (ie, as a mediator under the CDR process) could not exercise any judicial power. It followed that the Judge concluded that the Court Order was not an order of court that could be enforced through the normal court processes. 34           In our view, Mr A posed the wrong questions, resulting in both counsel addressing the wrong arguments to the Judge. The correct question was whether the CDR process contemplated that the terms of a court-mediated settlement would be embodied in an order of court. If this question had been asked and considered, the answer would, surely, have been “Yes”, as there would be little point in having a dispute resolved by CDR if the settlement reached thereby could not be enforced as a court order. If a court-mediated settlement is binding, there would be no point in requiring the successful party to bring a separate contractual action against the other party on the basis of the settlement in order to enforce that very settlement. Such a result would be unnecessary and repugnant to the very purpose of CDR. In this respect, both parties’ counsel agreed that a court-mediated settlement was meant to bind the parties and had to be complied with as if it was a contract. This must be correct; otherwise, it would be an utter waste of time and resources for litigants to even resort to CDR to resolve their disputes in the first place. 35           When we asked Mr A whether, in principle, CDR also contemplated the enforcement of a court-mediated settlement by the court if one party failed to discharge his obligations under the settlement, Mr A readily agreed, except that he contended that the parties must then go back to the CDR settlement judge who presided over the settlement process for further directions. Furthermore, Mr A’s view was that the CDR settlement judge could not make a court order to enforce the terms of the court-mediated settlement as he was sitting in the PDRC, but that another district judge not sitting in the PDRC could do so if the matter was brought before him. 36           This gave rise to the question of whether a CDR settlement judge had the power to make orders of court in connection with and following the successful resolution of a dispute via CDR. We could not accept Mr A’s submission (as set out in the preceding paragraph) as it would result in the triumph of form over substance. It would mean that CDR entails not only a two-stageprocess, but a two-judgeprocess as well. In our view, this is not how the CDR process works or is intended to work. Unless the two-stage, two-judge process propounded by Mr A is specifically prescribed by statute or subsidiary legislation such as the Rules of Court (in which case there would be some policy reason for such prescription), the courts are – or should be – more concerned with the substance of the matter rather than its form. In our view, there is no reason why, in the situation just postulated, the CDR settlement judge, having successfully conducted CDR, cannot immediately don his judicial hat, so to speak, and enter judgment in accordance with the terms of the court-mediated settlement for the purpose of enforcing that settlement. 37           In our view, the CDR scheme envisages that the CDR settlement judge will first carry out his mediatory function by giving the parties an indication of how he would view their respective rights or liabilities if he were to try the case (see [29] above). This function does not entail the exercise of any judicial power. If and when the parties reach a court-mediated settlement on liability and/or damages and the CDR settlement judge records the terms of the settlement, his mediatory function comes to an end. Thereafter, he resumes the ordinary judicial role of a district judge such that he may exercise any judicial power in relation to the settlement and enter judgment against the losing party in accordance with the terms of the settlement for enforcement purposes. 38           In sum, in order to give efficacy to CDR, a court-mediated settlement must be binding on the parties and carried out according to its terms. Any failure to comply with those terms by any party entitles the other party to enforce the settlement as a court order without the necessity of another hearing before the same CDR settlement judge or another judge.",
        "What went wrong in the present case": "39           The problem in this case was not the infirmity of the CDR process, but the conduct of Mr H in taking unnecessary and unwarranted steps with undue haste to enforce the Court Order, as well as the conduct of Mr A in taking full advantage of the eight-week period for filing the notice of discontinuance by not paying up the Settlement Sum in the interim. It may be recalled that the Settlement Judge had recorded the terms of the settlement as follows (see [2] above): (a)        the respondent was to pay the appellant $187.50 and costs of $1,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be taxed or agreed; and (b)        “Notice of Discontinuance [was] to be filed in 8 weeks” (“the NOD notation”). Before us, there was disagreement between Mr Joseph Chen and Mr A as to the meaning of the NOD notation. Mr Joseph Chen argued that it simply meant that the appellant had eight weeks from 31 March 2006 to discontinue the action, and not that the appellant had to wait for eight weeks to be paid the Settlement Sum, which should be paid within a reasonable time from the date of the Court Order. Mr Joseph Chen further contended that, if the respondent failed to pay the sum concerned within a reasonable time, the appellant was entitled to obtain an order of court so that he could enforce the settlement reached on 31 March 2006. The further question, therefore, was whether a reasonable time had elapsed in this case. It should be noted that Mr A, who was in a better position than Mr Chen to know what the NOD notation meant since he was present when it was made, did not make submissions on this particular point to the Judge as he preferred to stick to his argument that the respondent had agreed to a settlement and not a consent judgment. 40           In our view, it is possible to criticise the Settlement Judge for not making clear what he intended the NOD notation to mean. However, a reasonable interpretation of that notation would be that the parties had eight weeks from 31 March 2006 to fully implement the settlement reached. That settlement could not be implemented in full immediately in so far as the parties had yet to agree to the amount of disbursements incurred by the appellant. At this juncture, it is necessary for us to state that, since the amount of disbursements involved was trivial, the Settlement Judge should not have given such a long period of time for filing the notice of discontinuance. In our view, the CDR procedure should be revised so that, once a court-mediated settlement is reached, a reasonable time for paying the sum agreed on by the parties should be stipulated by the CDR settlement judge so that the losing party cannot delay payment and, thus, defeat the very purpose of CDR as a means of expediting the resolution of disputes. 41           Most unfortunately, both parties’ counsel appeared to have subsequently disregarded what the NOD notation actually meant. Mr H went his own way, against the protests of Mr A, in extracting the Court Order and in issuing the WSS so as to enforce that court order. Mr A was then forced to respond by applying to set aside not only the WSS, but the Court Order as well. The result was that what would otherwise have been a routine court-mediated settlement escalated into a titanic struggle for vindication by each party’s counsel without regard for the costs involved. Indeed, in their ensuing contest of wills, counsel completely subverted theraison d’êtreof the CDR process, with no regard at all for the interests of their respective clients and the public interest in not wasting public resources for private gain. 42           In our view, Mr H acted precipitately and unnecessarily in: (a) extracting the Court Order without giving the correct information to the Registrar (viz, that Mr A had objected to the extraction of the Court Order); and (b) issuing the WSS to attach the respondent’s assets without giving Mr A reasonable time to obtain the requisite funds from the parties’ common insurer in order to pay the amount claimed. The unreasonable conduct of Mr H was matched equally by the conduct of Mr A in: (a) quibbling over a sum of $60.35 (see [5] above); and (b) taking out – unnecessarily – an application to strike out the WSS (which no longer had any bite by the time the application was made as both the Settlement Sum and the disbursements claimed by Mr H had been paid by then) as well as the Court Order (which Mr A had tacitly endorsed by participatingwithout protestin the taxation of the bill of costs filed pursuant to the Court Order (see [7] above)).",
        "Why we referred Mr H’s conduct for inquiry": "43           We will now explain why we ordered this matter to be referred to the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) for inquiry into Mr H’s conduct on the matters set out in the Brief Grounds at [8]. At the hearing of the appeal, when we asked Mr Joseph Chen how this mess had come about, Mr Joseph Chen’s associate counsel, Mr Joseph Tan Chin Aik, consulted the appellant in court and thereafter informed us that the appellant had: (a) been kept in the dark about the forensic tussle between Mr H and Mr A, and (b) not been informed about or consented to all the actions done by Mr H in his name. If these assertions were indeed true, Mr H would have much to answer for, given that the appellant had been exposed to litigation costs exceeding $100,000 (see [21] above) just to recover a mere sum of $187.50 for damage to his motorcycle. However, since Mr Tan was only making a statement from the Bar and since Mr H was not present in court then, we considered that the best way to deal with the appellant’s assertions was to refer the matter to the Law Society. In coming to this decision, we took into account the following exorbitant actions of Mr H: (a)        He extracted the Court Order in spite of the ambiguity of the NOD notation and without seeking clarification from the Settlement Judge as to the meaning of that notation. (b)        He extracted the Court Order notwithstanding Mr A’s objection that it was unnecessary to do so, and without informing the Registrar that Mr A had protested against the extraction of that order. (c)        He continued to threaten to levy execution for the costs of taking out the WSS even though he had, as a result of warning Mr A that he would take out execution proceedings, already received payment of $1,187.50 “for damages and costs” (see [8]–[9] above) from Mr A on 16 May 2006. Further, in giving Mr A only a short period of time to pay the costs of the execution proceedings (which costs were based solely on Mr H’s own calculation), Mr H himself contributed to Mr A’s subsequent decision to take steps to set aside the WSS. 44           In the Brief Grounds at [6], we also mentioned that we had been shown a letter dated 13 July 2007 from Mr H to the appellant stating that his (Mr H’s) fees for work done up to the stage of his discharge were in the region of $150,000, and that we were troubled by this. That letter was sent after Mr A filed the party and party bill of costs (ie, BC 120/07) on 7 June 2007: see [19] above. We quote below the relevant extracts from the letter: Thirdly, throughout the proceedings in the Subordinate Courts, I have billed you at the party and party rate, that is at the same amount as the costs that were ordered against the Defendant and which the Defendant paid. I could not bill you any lower as that would have contravened the rules. You therefore did not have to come out with any money of your own. This was done as you are the brother of David Lock, a longtime friend. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, you should not expect that our legal fees for work done in the High Court, namely Originating Summons No. 2141 of 2006/A and RAS 17/2007, or the work done for the appeal to the Court of Appeal, namely Originating Summons 682 of 2007 and Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2007 would be at party and party level. Fourthly, if you are changing solicitors, we will be issuing you with our invoice for the work done in the High Court and Court of Appeal which we will require you to pay within seven (7) days. You are free to have our bills taxed, that is determined by the Court. Our bills for work done to date in the High Court and Court of Appeal would be in the region of $150,000.00 excluding disbursements. The purpose of setting out the information above is to ensure that you have all the facts before you make a hasty decision that you may regret. Ultimately, we will accede to your instructions as you are the client. These passages are self-explanatory in content, but not necessarily in intent. As we have directed the Law Society to look into this aspect of the case, it would not be appropriate for us to say anything more in this respect.",
        "The duty of counsel to evaluate a client’s case": "45           We would like to conclude these grounds of decision with some observations on the role of counsel in pursuing their clients’ interests in a court of law where monetary claims are involved. The present case did not concern potential loss of life or liberty, physical or mental injury, injury to a person’s reputation or even injury to his sense of pride. Instead, this was a case about dollars and “sense”. There was no high principle at stake. What was involved here was a paltry sum of about $60. Yet, both counsel, instead of exercising the degree of responsibility expected of an officer of the court and advising their respective clients to settle the dispute with minimum fuss and, therefore, minimum cost, proceeded to broaden the areas of contention between their clients unnecessarily and in a highly wasteful manner. As we pointed out to Mr A, the outcome of the case, even assumingarguendothat his submissions (as outlined at [31], [34] and [35] above) were correct, would not benefit his “real” client, NTUC Income. Such an outcome would ultimately only lead to higher operational costs for the insurance industry. 46           Plainly, this case could not have gone this far if both counsel involved had acted reasonably in the interests of their clients. Although an advocate and solicitor has a duty to pursue his client’s interest vigorously, he should only do so with the informed consent of the client, especially when pursuing the client’s interest is counter-productive or results in an overall loss to the client (as was the case in these proceedings). Rule 40 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2000 Rev Ed) requires an advocate and solicitor to evaluate with his client, in an appropriate case, “whether the consequence of a matter justifies the expense or the risk involved” in going to court. If ever there was a case where the evaluation delineated in r 40 should have been carried out, the present matter was likely to have been such a case. We could not imagine any prudent party condoning the solicitors’ conduct in this case if a proper risk-benefit evaluation pursuant to r 40 had been undertaken. 47           Given all these considerations, we decided that, until the conduct of Mr H had been properly investigated by the Law Society, he should not be allowed to tax his solicitor and client costs against the appellant. Such costs might not be recoverable if it is found that Mr H acted in his own interests, rather than in those of his client, in taking all the steps that he did to enforce payment of the Settlement Sum and the disbursements claimed.",

        "Brief grounds of decision": "1          These are our brief grounds of decision which we will elaborate on in greater length in due course. 2          Mediation in the Subordinate Courts is now part of the court process. It was introduced in 1994 in order to provide a court-supervised method of resolving disputes amicably and to save costs. It is held before a District Judge who, when he conducts a mediation, will not be exercising his judicial powers.  A mediated settlement is binding on the parties. When such a settlement is reached, the CDR process contemplates that the settlement may be embodied in a court order for the purpose of enforcement. In other words, the CDR process contemplates the District Judge exercising his judicial power to make an order of court to give effect to the terms of the settlement, whenever necessary. 3          In the present case, the parties contemplated, that in the event of a default in the payment of the agreed settlement sum, the appellant could enforce the agreement through an order of court. Thus, when the appellant’s solicitor took steps to extract the court order, which he did on 31 March 2006, the respondent’s solicitor did not object on jurisdictional grounds, but only complained that a court order was unnecessary. Moreover, the respondent accepted the jurisdictional basis of the court order of 31 March 2006 when her solicitor appeared before the court on 5 May 2006 to tax the plaintiff’s bill of costs.  Furthermore, the respondent raised her objection to the validity of the court order only after she had paid the settlement sum embodied in the court order without any protest as to its validity. Her challenge to the validity of the court order was made after she had filed an application to set aside the writ of seizure and sale issued by the appellant’s solicitor when she realised that she could not set aside the WSS without also setting aside the court order. By that time, there was effectively no dispute orlisin relation to the settlement sum. 4          Because the Settlement Judge had also set the condition of 8 weeks for the Notice of Discontinuance to be filed, it might well be that the appellant’s solicitor acted precipitately and unnecessarily in extracting the court order and also in issuing the WSS. However, these actions do not affect the validity of the court order. 5          The response of the respondent’s solicitor was also disproportionate, having regard to the small amount in dispute. There was no necessity to set aside the WSS as after the respondent had paid up the settlement sum and taxed disbursements, the WSS had nothing to bite on and execution could not have been effected. The District Judge’s decision not to set aside the court order was correct in the circumstances. When the appeal was heard by the High Court, the wrong arguments were made before the Judge. We nevertheless acknowledge that the High Court has erred in giving leave to appeal and in holding that a mediation judge has no power to direct the entry of a consent order or judgment or make other consequential orders once a settlement has been reached. 6          For the moment, we wish to make the following observations. This case should never have come this far. It would not, if the solicitors in this case had acted reasonably in the interests of their clients.  A dispute involving a puny sum of about $60 escalated into contests of wills between two solicitors, resulting in wastage of judicial time and unnecessary expenditure in terms of court fees and disbursements which exceeded $100,000 even before the date of this hearing. We have, in fact, been shown a letter dated 13 July 2007 from the appellant’s former solicitor stating that his fees up to the stage of his discharge from these proceedings are in the region of $150,000. We are troubled by this. 7          This is an incredible case. We have not seen one like it in all our years in the law. It has brought no credit to counsel involved and the legal system as a whole. All that the appellant wanted from the defendant was $375 being $285 for the cost of repairs to his motorcycle and $90 for loss of use, for which he eventually agreed to settle at $187.50. For this, he was put at risk of having to pay a sum in excess of $100,000 in legal fees.",
        "Direction": "8          In the light of the short account given to us by counsel for the appellant of the conduct of his former counsel, Mr Hanam, it is necessary that his alleged conduct in exposing the appellant to unnecessary monetary risks and adverse legal consequences, apparently without his knowledge or consent, should be investigated for possible breach of his professional duties to the appellant. Accordingly, we will be directing the Registrar of the Supreme Court to refer this matter to the Council of the Law Society for it to determine whether it should refer the matter to the Chairman of the Inquiry Committee under s 85(2) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) to inquire into the following matters, i.e. whether Mr Hanam had: (a)       acted with the appellant’s  knowledge or consent in commencing enforcement proceedings in relation to the settlement; (b)       acted in the best interests of the appellant  in seeking to enforce the settlement agreement by way of a writ of seizure and sale; (c)       kept the appellant informed or had explained to him the risks involved in taking all the steps he did in these proceedings; (d)       acted inappropriately in indicating in his letter of 13 July 2007 that he would be sending a bill of costs for $150,000 to the appellant upon his discharge as counsel in the appeal."
