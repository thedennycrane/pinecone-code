        "Introduction and facts": "1       This was an appeal against the decision of the\n                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) who had refused to grant the\n                    defendants a stay of the action brought against them by the plaintiff (seeMineral Enterprises Ltd v JIO Minerals FZC and\n                        others[2010] SGHC 109). 2       Dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge, the\n                    defendants appealed. After hearing counsel, we allowed the appeal. We now give\n                    the detailed grounds for our decision.",
        "The Parties": "3       Mineral Enterprises Ltd (“the\n                    Respondent”) is the plaintiff. It is an Indian company with expertise in\n                    mining and marketing iron ore in India and internationally. The Respondent has\n                    projects in Indonesia which are coordinated by its Mining and Operations\n                    Manager, Joseph Cyriac (“Cyriac”). 4       JIO Minerals FZC (“the First\n                    Appellant”) is a company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates\n                    (“UAE”) and was set up by Jimmy Singh (“the Second\n                    Appellant”) and Raman Srinivasan (“the Third Appellant”).\n                    The First, Second and Third Appellants are the defendants and we will refer to\n                    them collectively as “the Appellants”. The Second Appellant is the\n                    President and Director of an Indonesian company known as PT JIO Energi\n                    Resources (“PT JIO”). The Second Appellant is also a\n                    commercial licensee and manager of the First Appellant. PT JIO owns iron\n                    ore mining concessions in 12 hectares of land in Pelaihari, Kalimantan\n                    (“the Pelaihari Concession”). 5       The Third Appellant is a commercial licensee of\n                    the First Appellant. Although it was suggested that the Third Appellant had\n                    control over PT JIO, together with the Second Appellant, the exact nature\n                    of the Third Appellant’s association with PT JIO was not addressed by\n                    the parties.",
        "Initial Meetings in Indonesia": "6       Cyriac met the Second and Third Appellants in\n                    Indonesia around August 2005. At this first meeting, Cyriac told the Second and\n                    Third Appellants that the Respondent was interested in mining iron ore in\n                    Indonesia. The Second and Third Appellants told Cyriac that a company that they\n                    controlled, PT JIO, had mining concessions in Pelaihari,\n                Kalimantan. 7       Cyriac later visited the Pelaihari Concession.\n                    The outcome of this visit is disputed. The Appellants’ version is that\n                    Cyriac assessed that the Pelaihari Concession contained approximately 300,000 to\n                    500,000 tonnes of iron ore and that Cyriac communicated this assessment to\n                    the Respondent’s directors. The Respondent’s version was that Cyriac\n                    did not explore the Pelaihari Concession because the Appellants did not provide\n                    sufficient facilities and logistical arrangements for Cyriac to do\n                so.",
        "The Singapore Joint Venture": "8       On 7 April 2006, the Respondent entered\n                    into a joint venture agreement (“the Singapore JVA”) with JIO\n                    Corporation Pte Ltd (“JIO Singapore”), a Singapore company. The\n                    Second Appellant was the majority shareholder and a director of JIO\n                    Singapore. 9       The Singapore JVA provided for the incorporation\n                    of a joint venture company in Singapore. JIO Singapore was to procure marketing\n                    rights over at least 1 million tonnes of iron ore from Indonesia for the\n                    joint venture company. The Respondent and JIO Singapore were to have an equal\n                    number of shares in the joint venture company. 10     The Singapore JVA stipulated Singapore law as\n                    its governing law and included both a Singapore International Arbitration Centre\n                    arbitration clause and a forum selection clause for the Singapore\n                courts. 11     After an amendment on 9 May 2006 to the\n                    Singapore JVA’s payment provisions, the Singapore JVA was, however, not\n                    pursued further. The Respondent’s director, H R Jain, deposed in\n                    his affidavit dated 18 January 2010 that the Singapore JVA was not\n                    pursued because of “the more advantageous income tax benefits” of\n                    forming the joint venture vehicle in the UAE instead. 12     JIO Singapore was struck off the register of\n                    companies in Singapore on 4 July 2008.",
        "Visits to the Tanah Bumbu Concession": "13     From February to August 2006, the\n                    Respondent’s representatives visited a mining concession in Tanah Bumbu,\n                    Kalimantan (the “Tanah Bumbu Concession”). 14     The Second Appellant deposed in his affidavit\n                    dated 23 November 2009 that two representatives of the local government in\n                    charge of the Tanah Bumbu Concession were aware of these visits by the\n                    Respondent’s representatives.",
        "The Exclusive Mining Agreement": "15     On 2 August 2006, the UAE Government of\n                    Ajman issued a commercial license to the First Appellant. Shortly thereafter, on\n                    7 August 2006, the First Appellant entered into an agreement with\n                    PT JIO. This agreement was termed an “Exclusive Irrevocable\n                    Exploration, Exploitation, Mining and Marketing Agreement” (“the\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement”). Under the Exclusive Mining Agreement,\n                    PT JIO appointed the First Appellant as “its sole and exclusive\n                    international agent with irrevocable rights of exploration, exploitation, mining\n                    and marketing of Iron Ore Concession [sic]”. The Exclusive Mining Agreement did not define the term\n                    “Iron Ore Concession”. 16     Under Article 5.1 of the Exclusive Mining\n                    Agreement, however, PT JIO represented that it had iron ore concessions\n                    with an estimated reserve of 1 million tonnes of “+65 Fe iron\n                    ore”. 17     The Exclusive Mining Agreement selected the\n                    laws of Ajman, UAE, as its governing law. The Exclusive Mining Agreement\n                    provided for disputes in connection with it to be resolved “under the\n                    rules of the UAE International Arbitration [sic]”. 18     On 7 September 2006, PT JIO sent the\n                    Respondent a copy of the Exclusive Mining Agreement via email. PT JIO sent\n                    the copy from Indonesia and the copy was received by the Respondent in\n                    India.",
        "Meetings in Indonesia": "19     The Respondent’s representatives had\n                    meetings and negotiations with the Second and Third Appellants in Indonesia in\n                    or around August 2006. The outcome of the meetings is material to the dispute\n                    between the parties. 20     According to the Appellants, the Respondent\n                    and the Appellants had agreed that the Pelaihari Concession was to be used as a\n                    “pilot project”. The Appellants further allege that the parties\n                    agreed that the Appellants would procure mining concessions with iron ore\n                    deposits of 1 million tonnes. In procuring these iron ore deposits, the\n                    Appellants werenotto be limited to the Pelaihari\n                    Concession. 21     According to the Respondent, the outcome of\n                    the meetings was that the Respondent was to be given a first right of refusal\n                    for all other concessions that the Appellants held and that the Pelaihari\n                    Concession was to be the first project for the parties. The Respondent further\n                    alleged that the Appellants assured it at the meetings that they had control\n                    over the Tanah Bumbu Concession and could bring that concession within the scope\n                    of the joint venture that the parties intended to enter.",
        "The Letter of Offer": "22     On 7 September 2006, the First Appellant\n                    sent a letter of offer to the Respondent (“the Letter of Offer”).\n                    The Second Appellant signed the Letter of Offer. 23     The material terms of the Letter of Offer were\n                    as follows: (a)     The First Appellant offered the\n                        Respondent 50% shareholding in the First Appellant. (b)     The First Appellant represented that\n                        it “has a high grade iron ore reserve of 1 million tones\n                            [sic]”. 24     The Letter of Offer was sent from Indonesia.\n                    The Respondent received the Letter of Offer in India.",
        "Cyriac’s Assessment of the Tanah Bumbu Concession": "25     Cyriac visited the Tanah Bumbu Concession\n                    around the time when the First Appellant sent the Letter of Offer to the\n                    Respondent. After the visit, Cyriac made a written report (“the Cyriac\n                    Report”) that stated that the Tanah Bumbu Concession had approximately 5\n                    to 6 million tonnes of iron ore deposits. The Cyriac Report was dated\n                    14 September 2006. 26     The Appellants argued that the Respondent only\n                    accepted the Letter of Offer after it received the Cyriac Report. In contrast,\n                    the Respondent argued that it was not aware of the contents of the Cyriac Report\n                    before it accepted the Letter of Offer.",
        "Payment of Consideration": "27     The Respondent accepted the offer in the\n                    Letter of Offer by paying the requisite consideration (“the Investment\n                    Funds”) to the bank accounts of the Second and Third Appellants in\n                    Singapore on 27 September 2006. We will refer to the resulting contract\n                    between the parties as the “Investment Agreement”. 28     The Second and Third Appellants then\n                    transferred 30 and 20 shares, respectively, in the First Appellant to the\n                    Respondent.",
        "The Respondent’s drilling activities at the Pelaihari\n                Concession": "29     The Respondent started drilling at the\n                    Pelaihari Concession some time after the Investment Agreement was concluded. The\n                    exact date when the Respondent’s drilling commenced and the extent of the\n                    Respondent’s drilling activities are, however, disputed. 30     The Appellants alleged that the\n                    Respondent’s drilling activities were insufficient for it to form a firm\n                    view on the amount of iron ore deposits in the Pelaihari Concession. The\n                    Appellants alleged that representatives of the local government in charge of the\n                    Pelaihari Concession witnessed the Respondent’s drilling activities and\n                    would be able to give evidence on those activities.",
        "Partial Repayment of the Investment Funds": "31     The Appellants returned the Respondent a sum\n                    of US$699,000. The purpose of this repayment is disputed. 32     The Appellants argued that the sum was\n                    returned because they felt that they had no choice but to return the unutilised\n                    portion of the Investment Funds because the Respondent was not going to restart\n                    drilling. The Appellants further argued that they did not agree to return the\n                    balance of the Investment Funds. 33     The Respondent alleged that the Appellants\n                    returned that sum because they admitted that the Pelaihari Concession did not\n                    contain sufficient deposits. The Respondent also argued that the Appellants\n                    promised to return the balance of the Investment Funds.",
        "The Claim": "34     On 19 February 2009, the Respondent\n                    commenced proceedings against the Appellants in the Singapore High Court for,inter alia: (a)     a declaration that the Respondent\n                        had validly rescinded the Investment Agreement; (b)     the return of the balance of the Investment\n                        Funds (amounting to US$1,028,695); (c)     damages to be assessed; and (d)     further or alternatively, damages for fraudulent\n                        misrepresentation or misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act\n                        (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Misrepresentation\n                        Act”).",
        "The decision below": "35     The Judge allowed the Respondent’s\n                    appeal from the Assistant Registrar’s decision to stay the action on the\n                    ground offorum non conveniens. 36     The Judge’s reasons for holding that\n                    Singapore was notforum non convenienswere as\n                    follows: (a)     The only legally significant\n                        geographical connections that the dispute had with Indonesia were:\n                        (i) the location of the concessions in Indonesia; and (ii) the\n                        Indonesian residency of the Second Appellant, who, in the Judge’s\n                        opinion, was the “directing mind behind the corporate structures and\n                        documentation”. (b)     The Appellants did not raise a compelling argument that\n                        the Investment Agreement was governed by Indonesian law. Rather, reasonable\n                        persons in the position of the parties would not have concluded that\n                        Indonesian law should govern the Investment Agreement, given that:\n                        (i) the Exclusive Mining Agreement was governed by UAE law; and\n                        (ii) the Singapore JVA was governed by Singapore\n                    law. (c)     The\n                        Appellants’ arguments on the law governing the alternative tort claims\n                        did not present “insurmountable obstacles”. (d)     The Appellants were not able to show\n                        that the evidence of two Indonesian witnesses who allegedly witnessed the\n                        extent of the Respondent’s drilling operations would be material. The\n                        Appellants also failed to show whether these witnesses would be available or\n                        whether other witnesses would be able to provide the same\n                    evidence. (e)     On the\n                        whole, the Appellants had failed to demonstrate the presence of another more\n                        appropriate forum for the dispute.",
        "The issue": "37     The sole issue on appeal was whether the\n                    Respondent’s action should be stayed on the ground offorum non conveniens. In particular, we were concerned with\n                    whether or not Indonesia was a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than\n                    Singapore for the hearing of the dispute between the parties.",
        "The applicable legal principles": "",
        "The approach inSpiliada": "38     The general principles to be applied in the\n                    context of the present appeal are well-established and may be traced back to the\n                    seminal House of Lords decision ofSpiliada Maritime\n                        Corporation v Cansulex Ltd[1987] AC 460\n                        (“Spiliada”). Indeed, the\n                    principles set out inSpiliadahave been approved\n                    and applied a great many times by the Singapore courts. The applicable\n                    principles were recently summarised in the decision of this court inCIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd[2008]\n                    4 SLR(R) 543 (“CIMB\n                    Bank”), as follows (at [25]–[26]): 25    Thelocus classicuson the question of when a stay would be granted on the basis offorum non conveniensisSpiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd[1987] AC 460 (“Spiliada”), a decision of the House of Lords where\n                            Lord Goff of Chieveley, in delivering the leading judgment, laid\n                            down certain guiding principles (at 476-478) for determining the\n                            question offorum non conveniens(“theSpiliadatest”). Those\n                            principles have been adopted by this court in several cases such asBrinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast\n                                Services Indonesia[1992] 2 SLR(R) 345,Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern[1995]\n                            2 SLR(R) 851,PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu\n                                Enterprises(Holdings)Ltd[2001] 1 SLR(R) 104 andRickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von\n                                Uexkull[2007]\n                                1 SLR(R) 377 (“Rickshaw\n                                Investments”). 26    The gist of these principles is that, under the\n                            doctrine offorum non conveniens, a stay\n                            will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some\n                            other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action.\n                            The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and it is not\n                            enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate\n                            forum. The defendant must also establish that there is another available\n                            forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore.\n                            The natural forum is one with which the action has the most real and\n                            substantial connection. In this regard, the factors which the court will\n                            take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience\n                            or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other\n                            factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where\n                            the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court\n                            concludes, at this stage of the inquiry (“stage one of theSpiliadatest”), that there is\n                            no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial\n                            of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it\n                            concludes that there is some other available forum whichprima facieis clearly more appropriate for the\n                            trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are\n                            circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should\n                            nevertheless be refused. In this connection, the court will consider all\n                            the circumstances of the case. For this second stage inquiry\n                            (“stage two of theSpiliadatest”), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the\n                            existence of those special circumstances. 39     We will, in fact, proceed to analyse the facts\n                    of the present appeal in accordance with the two stages enunciated inSpiliadaand, consistent with the terminology adopted inCIMB Bank, will refer to each stage as\n                    “stage one of theSpiliadatest” and\n                    “stage two of theSpiliadatest”,\n                    respectively. 40     It is worth noting that a decision on whether\n                    to grant a stay of proceedings is, ultimately, a discretionary one. The\n                    discretionary nature of the determination necessarily limits the role of an\n                    appellate court; as this court has observed inCIMB\n                        Bank(at [84]): It is clear that in determining whether or not to grant a stay of\n                        proceedings, the judge will be exercising a discretion. Such an exercise of\n                        discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate court unless the\n                        judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or he had taken into\n                        account matters which he ought not to have taken into account or had failed\n                        to take into account matters which he ought to have taken into account, or\n                        his decision is plainly wrong (seeThe Abidin\n                            Daver[1984] AC 398 at 420perLord Brandon of Oakbrook).",
        "Factors to consider under stage one of theSpiliadatest": "41     The courts will generally consider the\n                    relevant connecting factors atstage oneof theSpiliadatest. Although the list of factors is\n                    obviously not closed and much will depend upon the precise factual matrix\n                    concerned, Prof Yeo Tiong Min has furnished some helpful guidance, as\n                    follows (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore –\n                        Conflict of Lawsvol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009)\n                        (“Halsbury’s Laws of\n                    Singapore”) at para 75.090): General connecting factors are considered at this stage. These include the\n                        locations of the parties, relevant witnesses, facts, and evidence, and the\n                        applicable law to the issues in dispute. As the search is for the forum that\n                        is prima facie clearly more appropriate to try the case, it is important to\n                        see what the case is about, and connections which have no or little bearing\n                        on adjudication of the issues in dispute between the parties will carry\n                        little weight. While there is a natural emphasis on the minimisation of\n                        expense and inconvenience of trial at this stage, it should be borne in mind\n                        that the true test is appropriateness. At this stage, differences in legal systems are generally ignored. In\n                        general, five types of connections may conveniently be identified, but they\n                        are not exhaustive. 42     The learned author then proceeds to list the\n                    following “five types of connections” which he states (and as also\n                    observed in the preceding paragraph) “are not exhaustive” (and see\n                    generally the very helpful and perceptive account of these factors inHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat\n                    paras 75.091–75.095): (1)Personal Connections(2)Connections to Events and\n                        Transactions(3)Governing Law(4)Other Proceedings(5)Shape of the LitigationStage two of theSpiliadatest43     In so far asstage\n                        twoof theSpiliadatest is\n                    concerned, Prof Yeo observes as follows (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat para 75.096):In Stage Two, the court is primarily concerned with the question whether\n                        there are circumstances by reason of justice why it should exercise its\n                        jurisdiction even if it is not the prima facie natural forum. The ultimate\n                        question of where the case should be heard for the interests of the parties\n                        and the ends of justice must not be lost sight of. This part of the test\n                        requires all circumstances to be taken into consideration, including factors\n                        already taken into consideration in Stage One. The main consideration in\n                        Stage Two is whether substantial justice can be obtained in the foreignprima facienatural forum. The court of\n                        the forum needs to tread a fine balance between justice to the parties and\n                        international comity. In considering this question, the court will not pass\n                        judgment on the competence or independence of the judiciary of another\n                        country, all the more so of a friendly foreign country,and will assiduously avoid comparing the quality of justice\n                        obtainable under its own legal system and the foreign legal system. It is\n                        not true that the quality of foreign judiciary will never be questioned, but\n                        the court of the forum will take a very cautious approach. The mere fact\n                        that the plaintiff has a legitimate or juridical advantage in proceedings in\n                        Singapore will not be decisive. The plaintiff must establish with cogent\n                        evidence that he will be denied substantial justice if the case is not heard\n                        in the forum.44     The learned author then proceeds to consider a\n                    number of related issues under the following headings (and see generally (again)\n                    the very helpful and perceptive account inHalsbury’s\n                        Laws of Singaporeat paras 75.097–75.101):(1)Denial of Substantial Justice(2)Contractual Choice of Law(3)Time Bar(4)Negative Declarations(5)Substantial Justice in the ForumAustralian approach not followed45     Before proceeding to apply the principles just\n                    stated, it might be appropriate to emphasise, once again, that the approach\n                    adopted in the Singapore context may becontrasted\n                        withthat adopted in theAustraliancontext (consisting in what has been termed the “clearly inappropriate\n                    forum test”, which is elaborated upon below). In so far as the present\n                    Australian approach is concerned, it may, in fact, be traced back to the seminal\n                    High Court of Australia decisions ofOceanic Sun Line Special\n                        Shipping Co v Fay(1988) 165 CLR 197 (“Oceanic Sun”) andVoth v\n                        Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited(1990)\n                    171 CLR 538 (“Voth”).\n                    However, it should be noted that the Singapore courtsrejectedthe Australian approach (in favour of the approach inSpiliada) fairly early on. In the Singapore\n                    Court of Appeal decision ofEng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak\n                        Hern[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851, for example,\n                    L P Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the court, observed thus\n                    (at [24]–[25]):24    Counsel for the appellant sought to set out the\n                            basis for theSpiliadatest and submitted\n                            that it was formulated at the time to prevent “forum\n                            shopping” when the parties had little or no connection with the\n                            forum in which the case was brought. On the strength of the Australian\n                            authorities counsel submitted that the test inOceanic Sunand approved inVothshould apply and urged this court to depart from\n                            the principles enunciated inSpiliada Maritime Corp v\n                                Cansulex Ltd.25    On authority and on principle we cannot agree.The Spiliadahas been considered and\n                            approved inBrinkerhoffand we can see no\n                            reason for departing from that authority. The underlying basis in this\n                            test is whether the local court is clearly an appropriate forum or not\n                            and whether there is another forum which is distinctly and clearly more\n                            appropriate. It has a more liberal approach which cut down local\n                            parochialism as regards judicial adjudication and attaches greater\n                            importance to consideration of international comity.46     It is notable that, whilst it was decided\n                    first,Oceanic Sunwas only a bare majority\n                    decision of 3 to 2 in so far as the general approach to be adopted was\n                    concerned (unlike the majority, both Wilson and Toohey JJ preferred the\n                    test inSpiliadaand (not surprisingly) arrived at\n                    a different decision on the facts). However, the judgments of the majority also\n                    raised a number of uncertainties inasmuch as it could not be said that there was\n                    a clear majority (amongst the majority judges inOceanic\n                        Sun) in favour of what is presently known as the “clearly\n                    inappropriate forum test” in the Australian context. Indeed, this\n                    last-mentioned test was clearly set out in the judgment by Deane J (at\n                    247–248). However, only Gaudron J (albeit not Brennan J) agreed\n                    with Deane J in this particular regard (at 266).47     The “clearly inappropriate forum\n                    test” was, however, clearly endorsed inVoth(with only one judge (Toohey J (who was also in the\n                    minority inOceanic Sun)) being in the minority,\n                    the learned judge stating (at 590) that he was “impenitent in adhering to\n                    the view which Wilson J. and [he] expressed inOceanic\n                        Sun”). Significantly, Brennan J, who adopted a\n                    narrower approach than “the clearly inappropriate forum test” inOceanic Sun(see above at[45]), endorsed this particular test inVoth; as the learned judge put it (at 572):As I think it is more important that a test be authoritatively settled\n                        than that I adhere to the test I prefer, and as any such test is judge-made\n                        law, I add my acceptance of the test proposed by the majority. It is\n                        unnecessary to consider whether the performance of the institutional duty of\n                        enunciating the law authoritatively should prevail when Justices’\n                        individual views diverge on questions of the true construction of the\n                        Constitution or perhaps on questions of the true construction of a statute,\n                        for that is not the present case. I therefore join in the decision that the\n                        “clearly inappropriate” test be adopted for the determination\n                        of applications of the three classes mentioned.However, although Brennan J agreed with the majority of the court\n                    inVothas to the particular test to be applied,\n                    he did “respectfully dissent from the result of its application”\n                        (id). In contrast, Toohey J, who (as we\n                    have just seen) adopted the approach inSpiliadainstead, nevertheless arrived at thesameconclusion as the majority (who applied “the clearly inappropriate forum\n                    test” instead) – thus illustrating the following observation made\n                    by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment in\n                    the same decision (at 558) (see also below at[54]):The “clearly inappropriate forum” test is similar to and,\n                        for that reason, is likely to yield the same result as the “more\n                        appropriate forum” test in the majority of cases. The difference\n                        between the two tests will be of critical significance only in those cases\n                        – probably rare – in which it is held that an available foreign\n                        tribunal is the natural or more appropriate forum but in which it cannot be\n                        said that the local tribunal is a clearly inappropriate one.Reference may, in this regard, also be made to the following\n                    observations by Prof Yeo (seeHalsbury’s Laws of\n                        Singaporeat para 75.083):A notable variation is found in Australian jurisprudence, where the courts\n                        have struck a different balance. The Australian court will refuse to\n                        exercise its jurisdiction only if it is demonstrated that it is a clearly\n                        inappropriate forum. In many cases, the result will be the same as the\n                        approach inThe Spiliada, but there may be a\n                        marginal case where it may be demonstrated that there is a clearly more\n                        appropriate forum available elsewhere yet the forum is not a clearly\n                        inappropriate forum, in which case stay of proceedings wouldprima faciebe granted under theSpiliadaapproach but denied under the Australian approach.\n                        The Singapore courts apply theSpiliadaapproach because it is thought to be more consistent with international\n                        comity.48Voththerefore\n                    marks the clear establishment of the “clearly inappropriate forum\n                    test” (see also Martin Davies, Andrew Bell and Paul Le Gay Bereton,Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia(LexisNexis, 8th ed, 2010) (“Nygh’s\n                        Conflict of Laws in Australia”) at\n                    paras 8.13-8.24).49     And, in the decision of this court inMurukami Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi\n                        Murukami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others[2009] 1 SLR(R) 508, the current Australian position was summarised\n                    thus (at [32]–[35]):32    In so far as those\n                            of the disputed foreign properties situated in Australia (“the\n                            Australian properties”) are concerned, the appellant also\n                            previously brought claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\n                            Gzell J, inMurakami v Wiryadi[2006] NSWSC 1354 (“Murakami”), stayed those proceedings on the\n                            ground offorum non conveniens.

That having been\n                            said, it is important to guard against simply equating the two tests\n                            because (if nothing else) their respective points of emphasis are quite\n                            different (see, for example,Vothat 558perMason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; the\n                            learned judges, however, also observed that, in applying the test under\n                            Australian law, “the discussion by Lord Goff inSpiliadaof relevant ‘connecting factors’ and ‘a\n                            legitimate personal or juridical advantage’ provide[d] valuable\n                            assistance” (idat 564-565) - observations which\n                            were also cited and applied by Gzell J inMurakamiat ([39]).34    While we have\n                            previously rejected the Australian approach toforum\n                                non conveniensin favour of the test inSpiliada, which calls for a determination of\n                            whether there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more\n                            appropriate than Singapore (see, for example, the decision of this court\n                            inEng Liat Kiangat [26]), Gzell J's\n                            observations inMurakami([32] supra) are\n                            nevertheless helpful. This is because the factors which the learned\n                            judge considered would apply with equal force in the context of the\n                            doctrine offorum non conveniensas set\n                            out inSpiliada. In particular,\n                            Gzell J noted that (seeMurakamiat\n                            [45]):The connecting factors ... do not favour New South Wales against\n                            Indonesia. [The appellant] is not resident in New South Wales and [the\n                            first respondent] and [the fourth respondent] do not live in Australia.\n                            The events [which are] the subject of complaint are just as much centred\n                            in Indonesia where the non-disclosure of the New South Wales assets is\n                            alleged to have occurred as in New South Wales where the assets were\n                            acquired.The learned judge also noted (idat [46]), just as we have (see[29]above), that thelex\n                            causaewas Indonesian law. He further commented (at [47] ofMurakami) that:If matters are to be determined in the New South Wales court expert\n                            evidence will be required. If the issues are to be determined in the\n                            Indonesian courts there is no need for experts.Indeed, Gzell J was of the view (idat\n                        [52]) that “it [was] in the interests of the parties that a proper\n                        resolution of the issues be made in proceedings to be commenced in\n                        Indonesia”.35    The factors and the arguments considered by\n                            Gzell J in the preceding paragraph, although analysed in the\n                            context of the Australian approach toforum non\n                                conveniens, apply equally in the context of the approach\n                            of this court as embodied inSpiliada([26]supra). Indeed, there is a\n                            considerable overlap between the factors and the arguments considered by\n                            Gzell J inMurakamiand those\n                            discussed above in the context of the present proceedings. There is, in\n                            fact, good reason to believe that this is one instance where there would\n                            be no difference in result regardless of whether the Australian approach\n                            or the approach inSpiliadais adopted\n                            (see also above at [33]).50     It should be noted that the decision of\n                    Gzell J inMurakami v Wiryadi[2006] NSWSC 1354 was in fact reversed on appeal in the decision of\n                    the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision ofMurakami v\n                        Wiryadi & Ors[2010] NSWCA 7. However, the\n                    general principles as well as observations set out in the quotation in the\n                    preceding paragraph continue to represent the Australian approach towards the\n                    issue offorum non conveniens, notwithstanding the\n                    following observations by Kirby J in the High Court of Australia decision\n                    ofRegie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang(2002) 210 CLR 491 (“Zhang”) (at 525):Like the Pilgrim I have not lost faith. One dayVothmay be overruled and a principle of the common law may\n                        be established more appropriate to contemporary circumstances of global and\n                        regional disputes in which Australian courts, like those of every country,\n                        must now operate. But until overruled by this Court or replaced by valid\n                        legislation,Vothmust be applied.51     Indeed, a challenge mounted recently against\n                    the present Australian approach in the subsequent (also) High Court of Australia\n                    decision ofPuttick v Tenon(2008)\n                    238 CLR 265 was rejected, in no uncertain, terms by the majority. The\n                    challenge (which was mounted by the Respondent) was, in fact, framed by way of\n                    an invitation to the court to either overrule the “clearly inappropriate\n                    forum test” inVoth ortorestatethe test inVothin amodifiedform by also permitting a stay when\n                    there was a more appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute. The latter\n                    was, in effect, an invitation to introduce theSpiliadatestin addition tothe\n                    “clearly inappropriate forum test”. Not surprisingly, perhaps,\n                    French CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Kiefel JJrejectedthis invitation and reaffirmed the “clearly\n                    inappropriate forum test” inVoth. Heydon\n                    and Crennan JJ, however, whilst clearly of the view thatVothcould not be overruled in that particular case, did\n                    (perhaps somewhat curiously) add thus (at [38]):Voth’scase should simply be followed\n                        until the time comes, if it ever comes, for full argument to be developed\n                        about its correctness, and for an argument that it is wrong to be\n                        accepted.The learned judges proceeded to give reasons as to why the test inVothcould not be challenged in that\n                    particular case. These included, first, that there was no “satisfactory\n                    forensic background against which to explore the correctness ofVoth’scase” (at [39]); that it was not\n                    satisfactorily explained in detail how the considerations relevant to overruling\n                    prior authorities (here,Voth) had been satisfied\n                    (at [40]); that the written submissions advanced by the Respondent in relation\n                    to the correctness ofVoth“were not\n                    developed in the detail which is desirable when a question of this important\n                    kind is presented” (at [41]); that “it was not demonstrated that\n                    even if theVothtest were overruled or modified,\n                    there would be any difference in the result of the appeal”; and that\n                    “[i]n the absence of that demonstration, any observations making a change\n                    to theVothtest would in one sense be dicta\n                    only”, which was “not in general a satisfactory method of\n                    developing the law” (at [42]).52     The observations of both Heydon and\n                    Crennan JJ are, on one reading at least, ambiguous although it might, on\n                    another reading, be open to the interpretation that they were at least open to\n                    the “clearly inappropriate forum test” inVothbeing revisted on an appropriate occasion in the\n                    foreseeable future. Looked at in this light, the following observations by the\n                    authors of a leading Australian textbook may appear a little too strong (seeNygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australiaat\n                    para 8.24):[Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary\n                            Limited(1990) 171 CLR 538] has been part of\n                        Australian law for twenty years. In [Puttick v Tenon\n                            Ltd(2008) 250 ALR 482], a new generation of High Court\n                        justices, none of whom participated inVoth,\n                        showed no inclination to reconsider the ‘clearly inappropriate\n                        forum’ test. Despite all the academic lamentation and complaint,\n                        judicial reform of theVothtest appears to be\n                        past praying for. Without legislative change, the test is entrenched in\n                        Australian law and critics must just grin and bear it.A final point – relativity of natural forum53     A final point might be noted. Counsel for the\n                    Appellant, Mr Cavinder Bull, laid great emphasis upon the fact that there\n                    were, in effect, no substantive connecting factors in relation toSingapore. He argued that this was a relevant factor as\n                    stage one of theSpiliadatest wascomparativein nature. There is some force in this\n                    argument inasmuch as the defendant must, under the first limb of the test in theSpiliada, establish that there isanotheravailable forum which is clearly or distinctly\n                    more appropriate than Singapore. Tothatend, the\n                    number as well as quality of connecting factors in theSingaporecontextisrelevant from\n                    a comparative (or relational) perspective. And, to the extent that there arenosubstantive connecting factors in relation\n                    to Singapore, that must surely weigh in favour of the defendant. However, as\n                    this court pointed out inCIMB Bank(at [26]; also\n                    reproduced above at[38]), “it is not\n                    enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate\n                    forum” – which would, of course, be the situation if there were, in\n                    the case concerned,nosubstantive connecting\n                    factors in relation toSingapore. The defendant\n                    must, as we have already noted, gofurtherand\n                    establish that there isanotheravailable forum\n                    which isclearly or distinctly more appropriate than\n                        Singapore(see also the decision of this court inSiemens AG v Holdrich Investment Ltd[2010] 3 SLR\n                    1007 at [4] (“Siemens AG”)). Hence,\n                    notwithstanding the fact that there might be few – or evenno– substantive connecting factors in relation toSingapore, this doesnot\n                        necessarilymean that the defendant would have discharged the\n                    burden that is placed upon it under the first limb of the test in theSpiliada. This is, in fact, an excellent example of the\n                    moregeneralprinciple thateveryperspective in a given legal testmustbe considered. Indeed, in so far as this particular issue\n                    is concerned, the following summary by Prof Yeo is particularly helpful\n                    (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore(at\n                    para 75.089), appropriately entitled “Relativity of Natural\n                    Forum”):The principle of the natural forum does not seek to identifythemost clearly appropriate forum in the absolute\n                        sense. The search is foranatural forum, notthenatural forum. Four implications\n                        follow.Firstly, there may be cases where no forum can be said to be comparatively\n                        more appropriate than any other. In such a case, stay will not be granted\n                        because it cannot be shown that there is another forum that is clearly more\n                        appropriate. Similarly, in a service out of jurisdiction case, it cannot be\n                        rebutted that Singapore is the proper forum to hear the case. The Singapore\n                        court will exercise its jurisdiction in such cases, even if it means\n                        multiplicity of proceedings.Secondly, although the formulation inThe\n                            Spiliadais that the defendant seeking a stay of proceedings\n                        must not only show that Singapore is not an appropriate forum, but that\n                        there is clearly another more appropriate forum elsewhere, it should be\n                        borne in mind that the inappropriateness of Singapore as a forum is relative\n                        to the existence of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere. It is not\n                        necessary to show that Singapore is a clearly inappropriate forum.Thirdly, the defendant may show that two (or more) fora are clearly more\n                        appropriate than Singapore, without having to identify one of them\n                        specifically asthemost appropriate\n                        forum.Fourthly, if the parties have chosen not to have their dispute decided in\n                        the foreign forum with the strongest connections with the case, and this\n                        alternative forum is not put forward to the court for consideration, the\n                        court is still obliged to consider whether any other forum put forward by\n                        the defendant is a clearly more appropriate forum than Singapore. A more\n                        difficult situation arises where the defendant applies to stay Singapore\n                        proceedings on the basis that forum X is clearly more appropriate than\n                        Singapore, while the plaintiff presents evidence that forum Y is clearly\n                        more appropriate than either X or Singapore (but neither the plaintiff nor\n                        the defendant is interested in litigating in Y). In principle, this does not\n                        affect the proposition that the court shouldprima\n                            faciestay the proceedings when the defendant has\n                        demonstrated that there is a clearly more appropriate and available forum\n                        elsewhere.[emphasis in original]54     We should note – parenthetically –\n                    that, incontrastto theSingaporeposition, theAustralianposition (see above at[47]–[48]) tends, by its very nature, to be focused,\n                    instead, on (as Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ put it inVoth(at 565)) “the inappropriateness\n                    of the local court and not the appropriateness or comparative appropriateness of\n                    the suggested foreign forum”. And, in the same decision, the learned\n                    judges also observed, in a similar vein (at 558), that:...the question which the [“clearly inappropriate forum”]\n                        test presents is slightly different [from the approach inSpiliada] in that it focuses on the advantages and\n                        disadvantages arising from a continuation of the proceedings in the selected\n                        forum rather than on the need to make a comparative judgment between the two\n                        forums.Likewise, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ\n                    observed inZhang(at 503) that “it should\n                    at once be noted that a court is not an inappropriate forum merely because\n                    another is more appropriate”. However, we would think that, on a\n                    practical level at least, some comparative analysis is probably inevitable in\n                    most cases. Indeed, inVoth, Mason CJ, Deane,\n                    Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed (at 558) that:[The focus on the inappropriateness of the local forum] is not to deny\n                        that considerations relating to the suitability of the alternative forum are\n                        relevant to the examination of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of\n                        the selected forum.(See alsoVothat 564-565 and[47]above).55     Let us turn now to apply both the first limb\n                    as well as the second limb of the test in theSpiliadato the facts of the present appeal. Before proceeding\n                    to do so, it would be appropriate to review – in summary form – the\n                    main arguments proffered on behalf of both parties.The parties’ argumentsThe Appellants’ arguments56     The Appellants argued that, as between\n                    Singapore and Indonesia, Indonesia was the more appropriate forum for hearing\n                    the dispute between the parties. The Appellants emphasised that the following\n                    connecting factors pointed towards Indonesia as the natural forum:(a)     Events relevant to the dispute\n                        occurred in Indonesia. For example, Indonesia was the place where Cyriac\n                        first met the Second and Third Appellants. Indonesia is also the location of\n                        the mining concessions that are the subject of the\n                    dispute.(b)     The\n                        parties have connections with Indonesia. The First Appellant is a UAE\n                        company but it has a registered office in Indonesia. Both the Second and\n                        Third Appellants are resident in Indonesia. The Respondent carries out\n                        projects in Indonesia and its representative, Cyriac, spends a significant\n                        amount of time there.(c)     The Appellants will have to rely on non-party witnesses who are\n                        resident in Indonesia (“the Indonesian Witnesses”). Some of\n                        these witnesses may have to be compelled to testify. In this regard, the\n                        Judge erred in predetermining the witnesses that the Appellants wished to\n                        call for the trial on the merits.(d)     Documentary evidence relevant to the dispute is presently\n                        located in Indonesia.(e)     In so far, at least, as the Respondent’s alternative claim for\n                        misrepresentation in tort is concerned, the natural forum is Indonesia\n                        because that is the place where the tort occurred.(f)     The Respondent’s claims are\n                        governed by Indonesian law. The claim for misrepresentation is governed by\n                        Indonesian law because Indonesian law is thelex loci\n                            delicti. Indonesian law is also the law governing the\n                        Investment Agreement because that is the law which has the closest and most\n                        real connection with the Investment Agreement. In relation to the governing\n                        law of the Investment Agreement, the Judge erred in suggesting that UAE law\n                        might govern the Investment Agreement even though neither party raised the\n                        applicability of UAE law in the hearing below.(g)     The Appellants sought leave to raise a new\n                        argument on the Respondent’s claim under the Misrepresentation Act.\n                        The Appellants argued that the Respondent has no claim under the\n                        Misrepresentation Act because the Misrepresentation Act does not have\n                        extraterritorial effect,ie, that this Act\n                        does not apply to misrepresentations occurring outside the territory of\n                        Singapore.57     On the whole, the Appellants submitted that,\n                    as between Singapore and Indonesia, Indonesia is the more appropriate forum for\n                    hearing the dispute. The Appellants further argued that, even if the Investment\n                    Agreement was governed by UAE law, the connecting factors were still\n                    overwhelmingly in favour of Indonesia. In any case, the Appellants urged us to\n                    only consider whether Singapore was a more appropriate forum than Indonesia\n                    since neither party was contending that the dispute should be heard in any forum\n                    apart from Singapore or Indonesia.The Respondent’s arguments58     The Respondent submitted that the following\n                    connecting factors pointed towards Singapore as the more appropriate forum for\n                    hearing the dispute:(a)     The Appellants chose to receive the\n                        Investment Funds in Singapore.(b)     Both the Second and Third Appellants have connections\n                        with Singapore. The Second Appellant studied in Singapore. He also has a\n                        Singapore bank account and he previously owned an apartment in Singapore.\n                        The Second Appellant also previously held shares and directorships in\n                        Singapore companies. The Third Appellant also holds shares and directorships\n                        in Singapore companies. The Respondent also has connections with Singapore\n                        in the form of a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in\n                    Singapore.(c)     As for\n                        the location of witnesses, the dispute is in relation to the discussions\n                        between the Appellants and the Respondent. Therefore, the party witnesses\n                            (ie, the Second and Third Appellants and\n                        the Respondent’s representatives) are the most relevant witnesses. In\n                        any case, the Appellants have not shown that adducing evidence via\n                        video-link would be unsuitable. Furthermore, the travel time between\n                        Indonesia and Singapore is not long and so the inconvenience occasioned by\n                        having the case heard in Singapore is not significant. As for the need to\n                        compel the witnesses, the Appellants have not adduced evidence on whether\n                        the witnesses are compellable in Indonesia.(d)     The location of documents should not be given\n                        any weight. The expense of transporting the documents to Singapore may be\n                        compensated with an appropriate costs order.(e)     Indonesian law is not the governing law of the\n                        Investment Agreement. Rather, the Investment Agreement is governed by\n                        Singapore law because the Singapore JVA was abandoned only because of the\n                        more advantageous tax benefits of using a UAE entity. The parties always\n                        intended for Singapore law to govern the Investment Agreement.\n                        Alternatively, the governing law is UAE law. As for the misrepresentation\n                        claim, the Judge did not err in considering that the application of\n                        Indonesian law was not an insurmountable obstacle. The Judge was merely\n                        ascribing the weight that he was giving to the governing law as a connecting\n                        factor. In any event, the Indonesian law issues for the tort claim are not\n                        complex.(f)     The\n                        place of the tort is indeed theprima facienatural forum for the misrepresentation claim. However, this is just one of\n                        the factors that the court should consider. Furthermore, this factor should\n                        be given less weight because Indonesian tort law has not been shown to be\n                        different from Singapore law.(g)     As for the Respondent’s claim under the\n                        Misrepresentation Act, the Respondent took issue with the Appellants’\n                        raising of a new point that was not canvassed before the Judge. On the\n                        merits, the Respondent argued that the applicability of the\n                        Misrepresentation Act has no bearing on theforum non\n                            conveniensanalysis because it is not a connecting\n                        factor.(h)     On\n                        balance, the connecting factors do not point clearly and distinctly away\n                        from Singapore to Indonesia. The connecting factors in favour of Indonesia\n                        should be given little weight.Our decisionIntroduction59     It is perhaps important to state an obvious\n                    point right at the outset. Notwithstanding the principles stated above, thefactsof each case are of equal importance.\n                    Put simply, there is no mechanistic method that can be utilised in this –\n                    indeed, any – legal context. To adopt such an approach would be a sure\n                    recipe for legal disaster, producing (in the majority of cases at least) great\n                    injustice. Hence, a close attention to the factual matrix of the present appeal\n                    is imperative.The Judge’s discretion60     As we noted earlier (at[40]), a decision to grant, or to refuse to grant,\n                    a stay of proceedings is discretionary. We were of the view that the appeal\n                    could not be allowed merely because we disagreed with the Judge’s exercise\n                    of his discretion inasmuch as we might have arrived at a different conclusion on\n                    the facts. To reiterate, the guiding principles in this regard were, as this\n                    court stated inCIMB Bank(at [84] reproduced\n                    above at[40]), that:...an exercise of discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate\n                        court unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or\n                        he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into\n                        account or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have\n                        taken into account, or his decision is plainly wrong.In this regard, the Appellants’ arguments suggested that the\n                    Judge might have misapplied certain principles. For example, the Appellants\n                    submitted that the Judge failed to correctly apply theAlbaforthprinciple, which, as will be seen below (at[106]), is a principle that, in a dispute\n                    involving a tort, the place where the tort occurred isprima\n                        faciethe natural forum. It was, therefore, necessary for us to\n                    apply theSpiliadatest afresh to the facts in\n                    order to ascertain whether or not the Judge had misapplied the principles just\n                    stated. We pause to observe – parenthetically – that the relevant\n                    factors in the context of the facts of the present appeal fall (as we shall see)\n                    principally within the purview of the first three categories of connections\n                    identified by Prof Yeo (above at[42]).Stage one of theSpiliadatestThe residence and place of business of the parties61     The First Appellant is a UAE corporation.\n                    However, it has a representative office in Jakarta. The First Appellant appears\n                    to have conducted most of its business from that office, as evidenced by the\n                    following facts: (i) it sent the Letter of Offer to the Respondent from\n                    Indonesia; (ii) it conducted its meeting of its board of directors to\n                    increase its share capital at the representative office; and (iiii) it sent\n                    the Respondent a copy of the Exclusive Mining Agreement from\n                Indonesia.62     As for the other parties, the Second and Third\n                    Appellants are resident in Indonesia. The Respondent is an Indian company with\n                    operations in Indonesia.The availability of non-party witnesses63     We were of the view that the parties were\n                    conflating two factors: (i) theconveniencein having the case decided in the forum where the witnesses are ordinarily\n                    resident (“the Witness Convenience Factor”); and (ii) thecompellabilityof those witnesses (“the\n                    Witness Compellability Factor”). We should analyse these factors\n                    separately because each may suggest that different forums are the natural forum.\n                    In addition, the Witness Compellability Factor could also be a relevant factor\n                    under the second stage of theSpiliadatest, as\n                    was the argument of counsel inRickshaw Investments Ltd and\n                        another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377\n                    at [91]–[92] (“Rickshaw\n                    Investments”). In this regard, we agreed with the following\n                    observations of Prof Yeo (Halsbury’s Laws of\n                        Singaporeat para 75.091):The connections of relevant witnesses can be important too. The physical\n                        locations of witnesses are generally of less significance today given the\n                        ease of travel and the possible use of information and communication\n                        technology.A more important consideration is the\n                            compellability of the witnesses. This has been considered as\n                        a Stage One factor although it involves a comparison of the procedures of\n                        different legal systems.Arguably, it sits more naturally\n                            as a Stage Two factor– a juridical advantage of trial\n                        in a particular forum. However,the benefit of\n                            considering this as a Stage One factor is that compellability of the\n                            defendant’s witnesses in the foreign court will be weighed in the\n                            equation as well, whereas as a Stage Two factor, the\n                        defendant would have to prove that non-compellability in Singapore is a\n                        denial of substantial justice, a very difficult case to make out. This\n                        point, while illustrating the different objectives of the two stages, also\n                        demonstrates the need to take a holistic view. [emphasis added]64     Given the differences between the two factors,\n                    we considered them separately.(1)   The Witness Convenience Factor65     In so far as the Witness Convenience Factor\n                    was concerned, our view was that the Judge had, with respect, erred for two\n                    reasons in holding that the Appellants had not shown that the evidence of the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses is material.66     First, as this court inGood Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd[2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 has held (at [21]), the court hearing an\n                    application for a stay should not predetermine the witnesses that the parties\n                    should call. In fairness to the Judge, he did not hold that the evidence of the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses was not necessary for the Appellants’ defence.\n                    Rather, the Judge indicated thatthe Appellants had failed to\n                        demonstratethat the evidence of the Indonesian Witnesses’\n                    would be material. However, we were of the view that the Judge had, in\n                    substance, predetermined that the Appellants did not need testimony from the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses to advance their defence.67     Second, the Appellants have endeavoured to\n                    explain the reasons why they require the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses.\n                    It would not be appropriate to require the Appellants to demonstrateexactlyhow they would use the testimony of the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses at this interlocutory stage. The Appellants have not yet\n                    prepared their Defence. We acknowledge, on the other hand, that a defendant\n                    applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation,\n                    that it requires foreign witnesses because that would make it easy for\n                    defendants to manufacture a connecting factor. Our view was that a defendant\n                    should at least show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably\n                    relevant to its defence. The Appellants have, in our view, met that\n                    threshold.68     Since the Appellants require the testimony of\n                    the Indonesian Witnesses, it appears that this factor points to Indonesia as the\n                    natural forum. However, our analysis did not end there. It was necessary for us\n                    to consider whether (i) the possibility of obtaining evidence from the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses through video-link and (ii) the fact that Indonesia is\n                    relatively close to Singapore suggest that this factor should not be given\n                    substantial weight. Our view was that both considerations were persuasive and\n                    hence operated against the Appellants on this particular\n                sub-issue.69     With regard to the first consideration, this\n                    court has endorsed the views of the High Court inPeters\n                        Rogers May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 381 (at [26]) on how the possibility of obtaining video-link\n                    evidence should impact the stage one analysis of theSpiliadatest (seeGood Earthat\n                    [21]). The Appellants have not explained why the evidence of the Indonesian\n                    Witnesses cannot be given via video-link.70     As for the second consideration, we note that\n                    this court inChan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung[2010] 1 SLR(R) 1206 held (at [35]) that the availability of witnesses\n                    should not be a significant factor if the witnesses are from Malaysia because of\n                    the proximity of Singapore to Malaysia. This consideration applies with equal\n                    force to Indonesia, which (as the Respondent has argued) is also relatively near\n                    to Singapore.(2)   The Witness Compellability Factor71     In so far as the Witness Compellability Factor\n                    is concerned, a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in a\n                    Singapore court (see Order 38, rule 18(2) of the Rules of Court\n                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)). Therefore, the fact that the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses cannot be compelled by a Singapore court to either testify\n                    in person in Singapore or to give evidence via video-link is a factor that\n                    points to Indonesia as being the natural forum. The Appellants have argued that\n                    the Indonesian Witnesses may need to be compelled to testify.72     A countervailing consideration is, as the\n                    Respondent has argued, that the Appellants have not shown that the Indonesian\n                    Witnesses would be compellable in an Indonesian court if this dispute were heard\n                    in Indonesia. The Respondent cited the recent Singapore High Court decision ofSun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo[2010] SGHC 111 (“Sun Jin\n                        Engineering”) in support of the argument that the\n                    Appellants should have led evidence on the compellability of the Indonesian\n                    Witnesses in the Indonesian courts. InSun Jin\n                        Engineering, the court had the benefit of expert evidence on\n                    whether foreign witnesses were compellable in the alternative forum (the\n                    Maldives).73     With respect, the Respondent has misunderstood\n                    this particular aspect of the decision inSun Jin\n                        Engineering. The Appellants have correctly explained that inSun Jin Engineering, the court considered that\n                    the expert evidence on whether witnesses were compellable in the Maldives was\n                    unclear. Notwithstanding this, the court considered that it wasmore likelythat the Maldivian witnesses would testify\n                    if the case were heard in the Maldives (seeSun Jin\n                        Engineeringat [40]).74     We took a similar view in this appeal.\n                    Although it would have been preferable to have had expert evidence on whether\n                    the Indonesian Witnesses are compellable to testify in an Indonesian court, it\n                    is more likely that the Indonesian Witnesses would testify if the dispute were\n                    heard in an Indonesian court.The governing law of the claims75     As this court has observed (inRickshaw Investmentsat [42]), the governing law of the\n                    claims raised by the parties is a significant factor in stage one of theSpiliadatest.(1)   Characterising the issues76     Before determining the governing law of the\n                    claims, it is necessary for us to characterise the issues raised by the claims.\n                    The first stage of any choice of law analysis is to characterise the issues that\n                    the parties have raised (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision\n                    ofMacmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investments plc\n                        (No 3)[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 407).77     The Respondent has made claims (see also above\n                    at[34]) for the following: (i) a\n                    declaration that the contract was validly rescinded; (ii) restitution of\n                    the remainder of the Investment Funds; (iii) damages for misrepresentation\n                    in contract; (iv) damages for misrepresentation in tort; and\n                    (v) damages for misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation\n                Act.78     The first and the third claims are claims in\n                    contract. The second claim is a claim in restitution. However, the choice of law\n                    analysis for the restitutionary claim is the same as the choice of law analysis\n                    for the contract claims because the restitutionary claim is consequential on the\n                    failure of the Investment Agreement (seeCIMB Bankat [41]). The fourth claim is a claim in tort and the fifth claim is a statutory\n                    claim.(2)   The governing law for the contractual and restitutionary\n                claims(a)   The choice of law rule79     It is well established that a three stage\n                    approach is applied to determine the governing law of a contract (see, for\n                    example, the decision of this court inPacific Recreation Pte\n                        Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal[2008]\n                    2 SLR(R) 491 (“Pacific\n                    Recreation”) at [36]). At the first stage, the court considers\n                    if the contract expressly states its governing law (“the Express\n                    Law”). If the contract is silent, the court proceeds to the second stage\n                    and considers whether it can infer the governing law from the intentions of the\n                    parties (“the Implied Law”). If the court is unable to infer the\n                    parties’ intentions, it moves to the third stage and determines the law\n                    which has the closest and most real connection with the contract (“the\n                    Objective Law”).(b)   analysis80     It is clear that there was no Express Law. We\n                    were of the view, however, that it is possible to determine the Implied Law. It\n                    is reasonable to infer that the parties intended that UAE law govern the\n                    Investment Agreement given the choice of that law in a closely related contract,viz, the Exclusive Mining Agreement. The\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement was, in fact, sent to the Respondent. The Letter of\n                    Offer also refers to the Exclusive Mining Agreement three times. Furthermore,\n                    the Exclusive Mining Agreement was essential to the Investment Agreement.\n                    Without it, the First Appellant would have had nothing of value to offer the\n                    Respondent in exchange for its provision of expertise.81     As the editors of the 11th Edition ofDicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws(Stevens & Sons, 11th Ed, 1987) (“Dicey and Morris (11th Ed)”) note, it is possible to\n                    infer that the parties intended that a contract be governed by the same law that\n                    governs a closely related contract (at 1185):… The legal or commercial connection between one contract and\n                        another may enable a court to say that the parties must be held implicitly\n                        to have submitted both contracts to the same law. …The editors of the 11th Edition ofChesire and\n                        North’s Private International Law(Butterworths,\n                    11th Ed, 1987) make a similar assertion (at 459–460).82     The editors ofDicey and\n                        Morris (11th Ed)cite a number of cases for this\n                    proposition, including the English Court of Appeal decision inRe United Railways of Havana[1960] Ch 52\n                        (“Re United Railways of\n                    Havana”).Re United Railways of\n                        Havanainvolved two related contracts that were part of a\n                    transaction for an English railway company to obtain finance to purchase rolling\n                    stock. The English railway company incorporated a subsidiary in Pennsylvania and\n                    sold the rolling stock to that subsidiary. The subsidiary then leased the\n                    rolling stock to the English railway company (“the First\n                    Contract”). Under the terms of the First Contract, the English railway\n                    company was to pay rentals to the subsidiary. The subsidiary entered into a\n                    contemporaneous contract with a trust company (“the Second\n                    Contract”). Under the terms of the Second Contract, the subsidiary\n                    assigned its rights under the First Contract to the trust company. In effect,\n                    this arrangement meant that the English railway company would pay the rentals to\n                    the trust company which would in turn pay the rentals to holders of trust\n                    certificates.83     One of the issues inRe United Railways of Havanawas the governing law of the\n                    First Contract. Having held that the Second Contract was governed byPennsylvanianlaw, the English Court of Appeal proceeded\n                    to hold that the First Contract was also governed by Pennsylvanian law because\n                    that was both the Implied Law and the Objective Law. The following portion of\n                    the court’s judgment is instructive (Re United\n                        Railways of Havanaat 94):It has been material to consider the agreement in this connection because\n                        it was held by the judge, and argued before us by counsel for the\n                        respondents, thatthe proper law of the agreement and of\n                            the lease was intended to be the same.This is probably, though not, we think, inevitably, true. In\n                        the words of the judge: \"The lease is expressly recited in the agreement,\n                        and in the lease there is a recital of the intention immediately to assign\n                        the benefit of the lease to the trustee.The two\n                            documents are essential parts of the same transaction,\n                        namely, the Philadelphia Plan. In those circumstances one would expect that\n                        they would each have the same proper law, and I hold that they have.\" One\n                        certainly cannot ignore the fact thateach of the two\n                            documents constituted essential parts of one entire transaction and it\n                            would, we think, be unusual if the parties concerned in that transaction\n                            should desire one part to be governed by the law of Cuba (which is in\n                            many relevant respects totally different from American law) and the\n                            other part to be governed by the law of Pennsylvania.\n                        [emphasis added]It should be noted thatRe United Railways of\n                        Havanaproceeded on appeal to the House of Lords (seeIn re United Railways of Havana and Regla Warehouses Ltd[1961] AC 1007 (“Re United Railways of\n                        Havana (HL)”)). On this particular point, the House of\n                    Lords considered that the Objective Law was Pennsylvanian law (seeRe United Railways of Havana (HL)at 1068\n                        (perLord Denning) and 1081 (perLord Morris)). The judgment at the House of\n                    Lords did not consider whether the Implied Law was Pennsylvanian law (and was,\n                    incidentally, one of the rare decisions that was overruled (pursuant to the\n                    House of Lords Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966]\n                    1 WLR 1234) by the House of Lords inMiliangos v\n                        George Frank (Textiles) Ltd[1976] AC 443 (albeit with\n                    Lord Simon of Glaisdale dissenting (on the issue as to whether or not the\n                    “breach date conversion” rule inRe United\n                        Railways of Havana (HL)ought to be departed from and be\n                    substituted with the rule that an English court was entitled to give judgment\n                    for a sum of money expressed in a foreign currency in the case of obligations of\n                    a money character to pay foreign currency under a contract, the proper law of\n                    which was that of a foreign country and when the money of account was that of\n                    that country or possibly some country other than the United\n                Kingdom))).84     We also considered decisions such as the\n                    English High Court decisions inThe Njegos[1936]\n                    1 P 90 (“The Njegos”) andThe Adriatic[1931] P 241 to be\n                    relevant because they consider that it is possible to infer that the parties\n                    concerned intended that a contract be governed by the same law as the governing\n                    law of a related contract. InThe Njegos, for\n                    example, a bill of lading incorporated the terms of a charterparty. The\n                    charterparty contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration in\n                    England. The parties agreed that the proper law of the charterparty was English\n                    law. The issue related to the governing law of the bills of lading. The court\n                    found that the bills of lading did not incorporate the arbitration clause and\n                    hence the governing law could not be inferred from the arbitration clause.\n                    However, the court nevertheless held that English law governed the bills of\n                    lading because the parties should be presumed to have intended that the bills of\n                    lading be governed by the same law as the law governing the charterparty\n                        (The Njegosat 107). It might also be noted\n                    that the Singapore High Court inLas Vegas Hilton Corp\n                        (trading as Las Vegas Hilton) v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny[1996]\n                    2 SLR(R) 589 referred (at [39]) toThe\n                        Njegoswhen discussing the circumstances in which an inference\n                    may be drawn in relation to the governing law of a contract.85     Returning to the relevant facts of the present\n                    appeal, we considered that it was possible to infer that the parties intended\n                    that the Investment Agreement be governed by the same law that governs the\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement (UAE law) because of the close relation between the\n                    contracts. We did not consider it to be material that the Exclusive Mining\n                    Agreement and the Investment Agreement were not between the same parties. The\n                    related contracts in the decisions referred to above (at[83]and[84])\n                    were also between different parties. The crucial point is that the two contracts\n                    in each of those decisions were so closely related that the parties could not\n                    reasonably be considered as having intended that different laws govern the\n                    related contracts.86     This raises the issue as to whether the Judge\n                    was entitled to suggest that the applicable law was UAE law when the parties\n                    proceeded on the basis that the applicable law was either Singapore law or\n                    Indonesian law. The Appellants argued that the Judge should not have suggested\n                    that the applicable law was UAE law without inviting the parties to make\n                    submissions on the potential applicability of UAE law. The Appellants relied on\n                    the decision of this court inPacific Recreationas support for this argument.87     It is indeed true that the Judge should have\n                    allowed the parties to submit on the potential applicability of UAE law.\n                    However, it is open to us to reach a provisional view that the governing law of\n                    the Investment Agreement is UAE law because both parties had the opportunity to\n                    submit, in this appeal, on the potential applicability of UAE law – which\n                    opportunity they in fact availed themselves of.(3)   The governing law for the alternative tort claim(a)   The choice of law rule88     The choice of law rule that Singapore courts\n                    apply for torts is the double actionability rule (seeRickshaw Investmentsat [53]). The double actionability rule\n                    provides that the tort must be actionable under both thelex\n                        foriand thelex loci delicti.\n                    Exceptionally, the double actionability rule may be displaced such that the tort\n                    may be actionable in Singapore even though it is not actionable under either thelex loci delictior thelex\n                        fori. The exception may even be applied to provide that the law\n                    of a third country is the applicable law for the tort (seeRickshaw Investmentsat [56]).(b)   analysis89     We have to first determine the place of the\n                    tort in order to ascertain thelex loci delicti.\n                    This posed some difficulty in the present appeal because the elements\n                    constituting the tort of misrepresentation did not occur in a single\n                    jurisdiction. The alleged misrepresentations were made in Indonesia. But at\n                    least some of the misrepresentations were received in India.90     The test that is commonly applied for\n                    determining the place of the tort is that which looks at the events constituting\n                    the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose (“the\n                    Substance Test”) (see, for example, the House of Lords decision ofDistillers Co. (Biochemicals) Ltd v Thompson[1971] AC 458 at 468 and the English Court of Appeal decision ofMetal und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson\n                        Lufkin & Jenrette Inc & Anor[1990]\n                    1 QB 391 at 443). The Singapore courts have also applied the Substance\n                    Test (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions ofWing Hak Man and another v Bio-Treat Technology Ltd and others[2009] 1 SLR(R) 446 at [26] andFocus Energy Ltd v\n                        Aye Aye Soe[2009] 1 SLR(R) 1086 at\n                [14]).91     The English courts have crystallised the\n                    Substance Test into a more certain rule in cases of misrepresentations made in\n                    one jurisdiction and received in another jurisdiction. In the context of\n                    determining the place of tort for the purpose of leave to serve out of\n                    jurisdiction, the English Court of Appeal has held that the place of the tort is\n                    the place where the representation is “received and acted upon”\n                    (see the English Court of Appeal decisions ofCordoba\n                        Shipping Co Ltd v National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey (The\n                        “Albaforth”)[1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 at\n                    92 (“The Albaforth”) andDiamond v Bank of London and Montreal[1979] QB 333 at 345–346). A different approach, however, was\n                    taken in a case where the misrepresentation occurred in one jurisdiction to anunspecified classof persons and was received\n                    and relied upon in a second jurisdiction. The court found that the tort occurred\n                    in the first jurisdiction (see the English Court of Appeal decision ofCordova Land Co v Victor Bros Inc[1966]\n                    1 WLR 793 at 801). Prof Yeo, inHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore, concisely states the\n                    approach taken in these misrepresentation cases thus (at\n                    para 75.378):The tort of misrepresentation is generally committed in the country where\n                        the representation isreceived and acted upon,\n                        at least where the representation is directed specifically at the plaintiff,unless the place is fortuitous in the\n                            circumstances, or if the receipt and reliance occur in\n                        different countries. If the representation is madeat\n                            large, then the tort may have occurred in theplace where the representation is made. [emphasis\n                        added]92     It should be noted, in passing, that the\n                    English courtsnowapply adifferenttest for determining the place of the tort. For cases\n                    arising before the date when the Rome II Regulation came into force\n                    (11 January 2009), the test for the place of the tort is found in\n                    s 11(2) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act\n                    1995 (c 42) (UK) (“the PILMPA”) (which is, of course, not\n                    applicable in Singapore). That provision defines the place of the tort\n                    differently for personal injury cases (see s 11(2)(a) of the PILMPA),\n                    property damage cases (see s 11(2)(b) of the PILMPA) and all other cases\n                    (see s 11(2)(c) of the PILMPA). The present case would have come within the\n                    scope of s 11(2)(c) of the PILMPA, under which the place of the tort would\n                    be the place where “the most significant element or elements” of\n                    the events constituting the tort in question occurred (seeDicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws(Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) at\n                    para 35-088–35-089 (“Dicey, Morris and\n                        Collins”)). For cases coming within the purview of the\n                    Rome II Regulation, there is no longer a need to consider the place of the tort\n                    because other connecting factors, such as the place where the damage occurs and\n                    the place of habitual residence, are utilised instead (see generallyDicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws, Third\n                    Cumulative Supplement to the Fourteenth Edition at\n                    paras S35-194–S35-200).93     We were of the view that the approach adopted\n                    by the English courts (as discussed above at[91]) has some merit. The Substance Test is itself rather broad\n                    and open-ended. There is, for example, room for debate as to whether the place\n                    where the representation was made is more significant than the place where the\n                    representation was received – andvice\n                    versa. More importantly, both would, theoretically at least, satisfy\n                    the Substance Test. It would therefore help to have more concrete rules, with\n                    appropriate exceptions, for particular torts. For misrepresentations, it is\n                    suggested that, if the representation was received and acted upon in a single\n                    jurisdiction, that place should be the place of the tort unless that place was\n                    fortuitous or if the receipt and reliance occur in different countries. The\n                    Substance Test (in its more general form and possible\n                    “incarnations”) may nevertheless still be resorted to in cases not\n                    falling comfortably within this suggested (and more specific) rule. However, for\n                    reasons which we will elaborate upon in a moment, there is no need to rule\n                    definitively on this point in the present appeal. In particular, the\n                    circumstances are such that the suggested rule cannot (as we shall see) be\n                    applied.94     As just mentioned, the present appeal is, in\n                    fact, a case that does not fit comfortably within the suggested rule. The actual\n                    misrepresentation wasreceivedin India because\n                    that was the place where the First Appellant sent the Letter of Offer and the\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement. Both those documents contained a representation that\n                    the First Appellant had mining concessions with one million tonnes of iron ore.\n                    However, the Appellants contend that other representations were also made during\n                    meetings in Indonesia as to the mining concessions that the First Appellant\n                    could rely on to make up a total of one million tonnes of iron ore. The\n                    representations were alsoacted uponintwojurisdictions. The Respondent acted on the\n                    representation by remitting funds from India. The Respondent also acted on the\n                    representation in Indonesia by conducting drilling works at the Pelaihari\n                    Concession. Accordingly, it is not possible to apply the suggested rule.\n                    Instead, we applied the general Substance Test.95     Applying the general Substance Test, we were\n                    of the view that the place of the tort was Indonesia. Indonesia was the place\n                    where most of the negotiations took place. The Respondent also took steps in\n                    reliance of the representations in Indonesia. The only reason why the\n                    representations in the Letter of Offer and the Exclusive Mining Agreement were\n                    received in India was because the Respondent was based in India. Accordingly, we\n                    were of the view that thelex loci delictiis\n                    Indonesian law.96     It remained for us to consider the\n                    Respondent’s contention that Indonesian law has not been shown to be\n                    different from Singapore law. In this regard, we noted that strict proof of the\n                    differences between Indonesian and Singapore law was not necessary. As this\n                    court observed inRickshaw Investments, we may\n                    take notice that the laws of other jurisdictions are likely to be different (at\n                    [43]):Choice of law questions raise a related issue regarding a party's\n                        evidential burden to plead foreign law. InGoh Chok Tong\n                            v Tang Liang Hong[1997] 1 SLR(R) 811, Lai Kew\n                        Chai J pointed pertinently tothe need for foreign\n                            law to be pleaded, and held that if foreign law was not in\n                        fact pleaded, it would be presumed to be the same as the relevant position\n                        under Singapore law (see generally at [77]-[84], and especially at [79]):\n                        see alsoErtel Bieber and Company v Rio Tinto Company,\n                            Limited[1918] AC 260 at 294-295. Where this\n                        evidentiary presumption can be invoked, the applicability of a foreignlex causaeunder choice of law rules may\n                        therefore be reduced in significance since the forum is unlikely to have\n                        difficulty applying a foreign law which is (assumed to be) identical to thelex fori. In this regard, however, a\n                        number of cases suggest that a court may, despite a party's failure to\n                        adduce proof of foreign law, have regard to the fact that the principles in\n                        the foreign jurisdiction concerned will, in all likelihood, differ from thelex foriin some respects (see, for\n                        example, the Singapore High Court decision ofPT Jaya\n                            Putra Kundur Indah v Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd[1996] SGHC 285 at [44] (\"PT\n                        Jaya\")). Hence, in the present case, the mere factum of a foreignlex causae,ie, German law, may be accorded due weightdespitethe respondent's failure to adduce evidence\n                        regarding the content of this law. [emphasis in original](4)   The statutory claim97     Contrary to the Respondent’s submissions\n                    (see above at [58(g)]), whether the Misrepresentation Act potentially applies is\n                    a relevant consideration under stage one of theSpiliadatest because it is relevant for this court to consider\n                    the law governing the claims raised by the Respondent. For example, if the scope\n                    of the Misrepresentation Act is such that it potentially applies to the present\n                    case, then that would be a factor against Indonesia being the natural forum\n                    because greater expense and inconvenience would result in having the application\n                    of a Singapore statute heard in an Indonesian court. This isnotto state that we are determining thesubstantiveissue as to whether the Respondent’s claim\n                    under the Misrepresentation Act is sustainable on the facts, as we cannot,ex hypothesi, make this determination in the\n                    context of the present proceedings. Rather, we are determining whether thescopeof the Misrepresentation Act is such\n                    that itpotentiallyapplies in the present\n                    case.98     Before considering the scope of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act, we should elucidate the approach that we took in our\n                    analysis. The Appellants approached the issue of the scope of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act from the perspective of the presumption against\n                    extraterritoriality. It is useful to clarify that there are in fact two aspects\n                    to this presumption in the conflict of laws context. Prof Yeo notes as\n                    follows (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat\n                    para 75.292):Where the conflictual scope of legislation is not spelt out, it has often\n                        been said that there is a presumption that legislation of the forum is\n                        intended only to have territorial effect. There are two overlapping aspects\n                        to this presumption.Firstly, as a matter ofprivate international law, the presumption\n                        is that the statutory provisiononly applies if the\n                            relevant connecting factor points to the law of the forum as the law\n                            governing the issue.Secondly,whatever the basis that the statute\n                            applies(whether as forum mandatory law, or as the\n                        substantive law governing the issue by reason of the forum’s choice of\n                        law rule, or as forum procedural law), it is presumablyonly intended to affect activities occurring within the territory of\n                            the forum, or toactivities abroad of\n                            nationals of the forum. [emphasis added]99Dicey, Morris and\n                        Collinsnote that there are two approaches to determining the\n                    scope of a statute in the conflict of laws context. However, the editors do not\n                    consider the two approaches to be part of a common exercise of deriving\n                    parliamentary intention. The following remarks by the editors, in the context of\n                    a discussion on the scope of s 2 of the Marriage Act 1949 (c 76) (UK),\n                    are instructive (at para 1-040):A court, when confronted by a statute of its own law or of foreign law\n                        which is expressed in general terms like this, could use one of the two\n                        methods to determine its scope. Thefirstis\n                        tointerpret the statute in the light of its purpose and\n                            backgroundso as to read into it the limitations which the\n                        legislature would have expressed if it had given thought to the matter. This\n                        is an artificial method, and perhaps a dangerous one, becauseex hypothesithe legislature gave no thought to the\n                        matter – if it had done so it would have expressed the limitations.\n                        Thesecond methodis toapply general principles derived from the conflict of laws– i.e.first characterise the questionas relating to capacity to marry [as noted above, this quotation is from a\n                        discussion on the scope of s 2 of the Marriage Act 1949 (c 76)\n                        (UK), which provides that “[a] marriage between persons either of\n                        whom is under the age of sixteen shall be void”], and then apply the\n                        relevant conflict rule to the question so characterised. [emphasis\n                        added]100    Our view was that, conceptually, it is\n                    better to consider the two approaches as part of a common exercise of discerning\n                    parliamentary intention. If Parliament clearly intended for a statute to apply\n                    even where the choice of law rules suggest that Singapore law does not apply,\n                    the courts must not disregard Parliamentary intention and refuse to apply the\n                    statute. Parliament has the power to legislate extraterritorially (see the\n                    decision of this court inPublic Prosecutor v Taw Cheng\n                        Kong[1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 at [37]). The choice of law\n                    rules are simply useful tools in ascertaining Parliamentary intention on the\n                    geographical scope of our laws.101    On the first aspect of the presumption, the\n                    starting point is to characterise the issue that the Respondent has raised with\n                    its claim that the Appellants have induced it to enter into a contract through a\n                    misrepresentation. The competing characterisations are a tort and a contract\n                    characterisation. It is not necessary to reach a firm conclusion on the proper\n                    characterisation because, on either characterisation, the applicable law is not\n                    Singapore law. As considered above, the applicable law on a contract\n                    characterisation is UAE law (see above at[85]) and the applicable law based on a tort characterisation is\n                    Indonesian law (see above at[95]).\n                    Therefore, on the first aspect of the presumption, we may presume that\n                    Parliament did not intend that the Misrepresentation Act apply to the present\n                    case because Singapore law does not govern the issue that the Respondent has\n                    raised.102    The second aspect of the presumption does\n                    not rely on choice of law rules. Parliament isgenerallypresumed to have intended for its laws to only apply\n                    to activity in Singapore (see the decision of this court inParno v SC Marine Pte Ltd[1999] 3 SLR(R) 377 at\n                    [38]–[39] (“Parno”)). This\n                    presumption may be displaced by clear indication of Parliamentary intention that\n                    the statute concerned is intended to apply extraterritorially (seeParnoat [39]). This intention need not be stated\n                    expressly (seeParnoat [38]). As an illustration,\n                    the Singapore High Court recently held that the presumption against\n                    extraterritoriality was rebutted in the Traditional Chinese Medicine\n                    Practitioners Act (Cap 333A, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Traditional\n                    Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act”) on the basis that extraterritorial\n                    application of that statute would serve Parliamentary intention and would not\n                    cause any difficulty with international comity and enforcement of the statute\n                    (seeHuang Danmin v Traditional Chinese Medicine\n                        Practitioners Board[2010] SGHC 152 at\n                        [36]-[38]).103    Applying this general presumption, the\n                    Misrepresentation Act is presumed to apply only to misrepresentations within\n                    Singapore territory. Unlike, for example, s 37 of the Prevention of\n                    Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“the Prevention of\n                    Corruption Act”), the Misrepresentation Act is silent as to its\n                    geographical scope. It is clear, therefore, that the Singapore Parliament has\n                    notexpresslystipulated that it intended that the\n                    Misrepresentation Act apply extraterritorially. However, it seems that the\n                    intention underlying the Misrepresentation Act would be furthered if the\n                    Misrepresentation Act were applied to misrepresentations occurring outside\n                    Singapore territory butonly ifthe applicable law\n                    of the relevant contract were Singapore law. The purpose of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act, which is based on the Misrepresentation Act 1967\n                    (c 7) (UK), is well known and is concisely stated by the editors ofChitty on Contracts(30th Ed,\n                    Sweet & Maxwell, 2008) in the following manner (at\n                    para 6-001):… Prior to the enactment of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the\n                        position broadly speaking was that a misrepresentation which induced a\n                        person to enter into a contract gave the representee the right to rescind\n                        the contract, subject to certain conditions, butgenerally gave him no right to damages unless the misrepresentation had\n                            contractual force. Since the coming into force of the\n                        Misrepresentation Act the representeewill always be able\n                            to claim damages for negligent misrepresentationin\n                        circumstances in which he could have recovered damages had the\n                        misrepresentation been fraudulent. In addition the Actgives the court a discretion to refuse to permit a representee to\n                            rescind a contract, but to award him damages in lieu of\n                            rescission, if the misrepresentation is negligent or wholly\n                        innocent; but it leaves the representee with an absolute right to rescind\n                        where the misrepresentation is fraudulent. The Act of 1967does not, however, alter the rules as to what constitutes an\n                            effective misrepresentation… [emphasis added]104    It appears, therefore, that the purposes\n                    underlying the Misrepresentation Act are two-fold: (i) to supplement the\n                    remedies available to a representee under common law (more accurately, under the\n                    then common law as the seminal House of Lords decision inHedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners\n                        Ltd[1964] AC 465 had been decided by the time the\n                    Misrepresentation Act had been enacted and had filled the then existing gap,\n                    albeit in different manner than that provided for pursuant to s 2(1) of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act (see, for example,Cheshire, Fifoot and\n                        Furmston’s Law of Contract – Second Singapore and Malaysian\n                        Edition(Butterworths Asia, 1998) (“Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston”) at\n                    pp 468–471)); and (ii) to confer the courts with flexibility in\n                    remedial matters by allowing courts to award damages in lieu of rescission,\n                    which flexibility was not available under the common law (pursuant to\n                    s 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act (see alsoCheshire,\n                        Fifoot and Furmstonat pp 482–484)). These purposes\n                    would not appear to be enhanced if the Misrepresentation Act were applicable to\n                    misrepresentations occurring outside Singapore territory in relation to\n                    contracts governed by foreign law. Unlike, for example, the Prevention of\n                    Corruption Act or the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act, the\n                    Misrepresentation Act is not intended to regulate conduct or protect classes of\n                    persons. The purposes of such conduct regulating and protective statutes would,\n                    perhaps, be advanced if they are applied without strict regard to territorial\n                    links. A statute that merely supplements existing common law remedies with\n                    respect to theSingaporecommon law of contract,\n                    without serving a conduct regulating or protective function, on the other hand,\n                    does not appear to requiregeneralextraterritorial application to have its purposes advanced. If, however, the\n                    relevant contract were governed by Singapore law (whether by express choice or\n                    otherwise), it would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act to say that it applies even to misrepresentations\n                    occurring outside Singapore territory. In fact, we would suggest that it would\n                    be highly artificial if a choice of Singapore law in a contract only brings into\n                    operation Singaporecommon lawfor\n                    misrepresentations occurring outside Singapore territory without the\n                    supplementary or facilitative provisions of the Misrepresentation\n                Act.105    As we have held, the Investment Agreement\n                    might be governed by UAE law (see above at[85]). It follows, therefore, that the Misrepresentation Act\n                    does not apply because the misrepresentation occurred outside the territory of\n                    Singapore and the Investment Agreement was not governed by Singapore law.\n                    Therefore, the fact that the Respondent has raised a claim based on the\n                    Misrepresentation Act should not be a relevant factor in stage one of theSpiliadatest.Other connecting factors(1)   The place of the tort106    As this court accepted inRickshaw(at [39]), for tort claims, the place of the tort isprima faciethe natural forum. This principle\n                    is derived fromThe Albaforth(at 96) and was\n                    accepted by the House of Lords inBerezovsky v\n                        Michaels[2000] 1 WLR 1004 (at 1014). However, as was\n                    observed inRickshaw(at [40]),The Albaforthprinciple is only aprima\n                        facieposition. As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal recently noted,\n                    the place of the tort may, in some cases, be fortuitous (seeThe Peng Yan[2009] 1 HKLRD 144 at [28],perMa CJHC (with whom Cheung J agreed)):It is therefore important when applyingThe\n                            Albaforthprinciple in the context offorum non conveniensapplications, to examine just how close\n                        a connection there really exists with any givenforum. In some cases, the place of the commission of the\n                        tort may be decisive; in others, perhaps not weighty at all. The underlying\n                        principle to be firmly borne in mind is the basic test inThe SpiliadaandThe Adhiguna\n                            Meranti. The place of the commission of the tort may in some\n                        cases be quite fortuitous and may provide no more than a convenient starting\n                        point orprima facieposition. The court is\n                        required to look into more substantial factors in the application of the\n                        basic test. The present case involved a collision where, quite often, there\n                        is no obvious or natural forum: seeThe\n                            Spiliadaat p.477C-D.107    As we held earlier (see above at[95]), the place of the tort was Indonesia.\n                    Applying theAlbaforthprinciple, Indonesia would,prima facie, be the natural forum, at least\n                    for the alternative tort claim. We were of the view that there was nothing on\n                    the facts of this case to displace theprima facieposition. The place of the tort was not fortuitous. Indonesia was the place from\n                    which the misrepresentations were made. Indonesia was also the place where\n                    substantial acts in reliance of the misrepresentation took place: the Respondent\n                    conducted drilling at the Pelaihari Concession because of the Appellants’\n                    alleged misrepresentations. This is not to say that theAlbaforthprinciple, whilst applicable in the context of the\n                    present proceedings, is decisive in the present appeal. We were aware that the\n                    Respondent’s claim in tort was framed as analternativecause of action.(2)   General connections with Singapore and the payment of the\n                Investment Funds in Singapore108    The Respondent placed considerable emphasis\n                    on certain general connections that the parties have or have had with Singapore.\n                    The Respondent also relied on the fact that the Investment Funds were paid into\n                    Singapore bank accounts.109    We did not consider these connections to be\n                    relevant in stage one of theSpiliadatest. The\n                    general connections to Singapore and the payment of the Investment Funds into\n                    Singapore bank accounts have no relevance to the claims that the Respondent has\n                    framed. Only connections that are relevant to the disputes should be considered\n                    in theforum non conveniensanalysis (see, for\n                    example, the decision of this court inThe Rainbow\n                        Joy[2005] 3 SLR(R) 719 at [52] and the English High\n                    Court decision ofVetco Gray UK Ltd v FMC Technologies\n                        Inc, [2007] EWHC 540 (Pat) at [26]). The underlying\n                    purpose of theforum non conveniensanalysis is to\n                    determine whether there is a more appropriate forum,viz, one “in which the case may be tried more suitably\n                    for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice” (seeSpiliadaat 476), and the core inquiry is to\n                    determine the place which has the “most real and substantial\n                    connection” with the case (seeSpiliadaat\n                    478). This purpose and core inquiry will not be advanced by considering\n                    connecting factors that are not relevant to the dispute because those factors\n                    are not really and substantially connected with the case at hand.Conclusion on stage one of theSpiliadatest110    On the whole, we were satisfied that\n                    Indonesia was clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum than Singapore for\n                    the trial of the claims concerned. Indonesia is the place where all the parties\n                    have some connection that is relevant to the dispute. Although not a significant\n                    factor in so far as the proximity of Indonesia to Singapore and the possibility\n                    of obtaining evidence via video-link are concerned, we gave some weight to the\n                    fact that the Appellants intend to call witnesses based in Indonesia. The\n                    Appellants have also argued that they need to rely on Indonesian Witnesses who\n                    may have to be compelled, and the Appellants will more likely be able to compel\n                    these witnesses if the case was heard in Indonesia. In relation to the\n                    alternative claim in tort, it was relevant that Indonesian law was thelex loci delictiand that the place of the tort was\n                    Indonesia.111    Although (as noted above) we considered that\n                    UAE law might govern the Investment Agreement, this was not a factor in favour\n                    of Singapore’s candidacy as the natural forum. It should be recalled that\n                    theforum non conveniensanalysis is a relative\n                    one (see above at[53]). The choice in the\n                    present proceedings was between Indonesia and Singapore. Between Indonesia and\n                    Singapore, it would not be logical for us to consider that Singapore was the\n                    natural forum simply because a third forum, the UAE, had a better or as strong a\n                    claim as Indonesia as the natural forum. In this regard, we found the English\n                    Court of Appeal decision ofMacsteel Commercial Holdings\n                        (Pty) Ltd & Anor v Thermasteel V (Canada)\n                        Inc & Anor[1996] CLC 1403\n                        (“Macsteel”), which the\n                    Appellants discussed at length in their Appellants’ Case, to be a useful\n                    illustration (incidentally,Macsteelwas recently\n                    considered by this court inSiemens AG(at [15])).Macsteelwas a case where the dispute had\n                    links to Ontario and South Africa. The only link with England was that English\n                    law was expressed to be the governing law of the contract. On those facts, the\n                    court held that the action should be stayed even though both South Africa and\n                    Ontario hadequallystrong links with the dispute.\n                    The court considered it relevant that the parties were not arguing that the case\n                    should be heard in South Africa. The only comparison was between England and\n                    Ontario. As between England and Ontario, Ontario was the clearly more\n                    appropriate forum.112    In fact, the Singapore High Court case\n                    adopted a similar approach to the English Court of Appeal inMacsteel. InLehman Brothers Special\n                        Financing Inc v Hartadi Angkosubroto[1998]\n                    3 SLR(R) 664, the court considered that the natural forum was either\n                    New York or Indonesia and not Singapore (at [35]). The High Court accordingly\n                    granted the stay.113    Reference in this regard may also be made to\n                    the following views of Prof Yeo, which were also reproduced above (see\n                    above at[53]) (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat para 75.089):Fourthly, if the parties have chosen not to have their dispute decided in\n                        the foreign forum with the strongest connections with the case, and this\n                        alternative forum is not put forward to the court for consideration, the\n                        court is still obliged to consider whether any other forum put forward by\n                        the defendant is a clearly more appropriate forum than Singapore. A more\n                        difficult situation arises where the defendant applies to stay Singapore\n                        proceedings on the basis that forum X is clearly more appropriate than\n                        Singapore, while the plaintiff presents evidence that forum Y is clearly\n                        more appropriate than either X or Singapore (but neither the plaintiff nor\n                        the defendant is interested in litigating in Y). In principle, this does not\n                        affect the proposition that the court shouldprima\n                            faciestay the proceedings when the defendant has\n                        demonstrated that there is a clearly more appropriate and available forum\n                        elsewhere.114    We were satisfied that, on a relative\n                    analysis, Indonesia was clearly a more appropriate forum than Singapore.\n                    Accordingly, stage one of theSpiliadaanalysis\n                    pointed firmly in favour of granting a stay of proceedings.Stage two of theSpiliadatest115    It should be noted that no arguments were\n                    proffered with respect to this particular limb of the test in theSpiliada. This was not surprising, in our view, having\n                    regard to the relevant facts before us, and we therefore need say no more about\n                    this particular limb.Conclusion116    For the reasons set out above, it was clear\n                    that Indonesia was clearly and more distinctly the appropriate forum for the\n                    trial of the claims concerned. We therefore allowed the appeal with costs, and\n                    with the usual consequential orders.117    We would also like to take this opportunity\n                    to commend both Mr Bull and Ms Gan for their clear arguments. In\n                    particular, neither sought to either exaggerate or even embellish their\n                    respective client’s cases but simply presented their arguments to this\n                    court in as cogent and as persuasive a fashion as possible.",

        "Australian approach not followed": "45     Before proceeding to apply the principles just\n                    stated, it might be appropriate to emphasise, once again, that the approach\n                    adopted in the Singapore context may becontrasted\n                        withthat adopted in theAustraliancontext (consisting in what has been termed the “clearly inappropriate\n                    forum test”, which is elaborated upon below). In so far as the present\n                    Australian approach is concerned, it may, in fact, be traced back to the seminal\n                    High Court of Australia decisions ofOceanic Sun Line Special\n                        Shipping Co v Fay(1988) 165 CLR 197 (“Oceanic Sun”) andVoth v\n                        Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited(1990)\n                    171 CLR 538 (“Voth”).\n                    However, it should be noted that the Singapore courtsrejectedthe Australian approach (in favour of the approach inSpiliada) fairly early on. In the Singapore\n                    Court of Appeal decision ofEng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak\n                        Hern[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851, for example,\n                    L P Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the court, observed thus\n                    (at [24]–[25]): 24    Counsel for the appellant sought to set out the\n                            basis for theSpiliadatest and submitted\n                            that it was formulated at the time to prevent “forum\n                            shopping” when the parties had little or no connection with the\n                            forum in which the case was brought. On the strength of the Australian\n                            authorities counsel submitted that the test inOceanic Sunand approved inVothshould apply and urged this court to depart from\n                            the principles enunciated inSpiliada Maritime Corp v\n                                Cansulex Ltd. 25    On authority and on principle we cannot agree.The Spiliadahas been considered and\n                            approved inBrinkerhoffand we can see no\n                            reason for departing from that authority. The underlying basis in this\n                            test is whether the local court is clearly an appropriate forum or not\n                            and whether there is another forum which is distinctly and clearly more\n                            appropriate. It has a more liberal approach which cut down local\n                            parochialism as regards judicial adjudication and attaches greater\n                            importance to consideration of international comity. 46     It is notable that, whilst it was decided\n                    first,Oceanic Sunwas only a bare majority\n                    decision of 3 to 2 in so far as the general approach to be adopted was\n                    concerned (unlike the majority, both Wilson and Toohey JJ preferred the\n                    test inSpiliadaand (not surprisingly) arrived at\n                    a different decision on the facts). However, the judgments of the majority also\n                    raised a number of uncertainties inasmuch as it could not be said that there was\n                    a clear majority (amongst the majority judges inOceanic\n                        Sun) in favour of what is presently known as the “clearly\n                    inappropriate forum test” in the Australian context. Indeed, this\n                    last-mentioned test was clearly set out in the judgment by Deane J (at\n                    247–248). However, only Gaudron J (albeit not Brennan J) agreed\n                    with Deane J in this particular regard (at 266). 47     The “clearly inappropriate forum\n                    test” was, however, clearly endorsed inVoth(with only one judge (Toohey J (who was also in the\n                    minority inOceanic Sun)) being in the minority,\n                    the learned judge stating (at 590) that he was “impenitent in adhering to\n                    the view which Wilson J. and [he] expressed inOceanic\n                        Sun”). Significantly, Brennan J, who adopted a\n                    narrower approach than “the clearly inappropriate forum test” inOceanic Sun(see above at[45]), endorsed this particular test inVoth; as the learned judge put it (at 572): As I think it is more important that a test be authoritatively settled\n                        than that I adhere to the test I prefer, and as any such test is judge-made\n                        law, I add my acceptance of the test proposed by the majority. It is\n                        unnecessary to consider whether the performance of the institutional duty of\n                        enunciating the law authoritatively should prevail when Justices’\n                        individual views diverge on questions of the true construction of the\n                        Constitution or perhaps on questions of the true construction of a statute,\n                        for that is not the present case. I therefore join in the decision that the\n                        “clearly inappropriate” test be adopted for the determination\n                        of applications of the three classes mentioned. However, although Brennan J agreed with the majority of the court\n                    inVothas to the particular test to be applied,\n                    he did “respectfully dissent from the result of its application”\n                        (id). In contrast, Toohey J, who (as we\n                    have just seen) adopted the approach inSpiliadainstead, nevertheless arrived at thesameconclusion as the majority (who applied “the clearly inappropriate forum\n                    test” instead) – thus illustrating the following observation made\n                    by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment in\n                    the same decision (at 558) (see also below at[54]): The “clearly inappropriate forum” test is similar to and,\n                        for that reason, is likely to yield the same result as the “more\n                        appropriate forum” test in the majority of cases. The difference\n                        between the two tests will be of critical significance only in those cases\n                        – probably rare – in which it is held that an available foreign\n                        tribunal is the natural or more appropriate forum but in which it cannot be\n                        said that the local tribunal is a clearly inappropriate one. Reference may, in this regard, also be made to the following\n                    observations by Prof Yeo (seeHalsbury’s Laws of\n                        Singaporeat para 75.083): A notable variation is found in Australian jurisprudence, where the courts\n                        have struck a different balance. The Australian court will refuse to\n                        exercise its jurisdiction only if it is demonstrated that it is a clearly\n                        inappropriate forum. In many cases, the result will be the same as the\n                        approach inThe Spiliada, but there may be a\n                        marginal case where it may be demonstrated that there is a clearly more\n                        appropriate forum available elsewhere yet the forum is not a clearly\n                        inappropriate forum, in which case stay of proceedings wouldprima faciebe granted under theSpiliadaapproach but denied under the Australian approach.\n                        The Singapore courts apply theSpiliadaapproach because it is thought to be more consistent with international\n                        comity. 48Voththerefore\n                    marks the clear establishment of the “clearly inappropriate forum\n                    test” (see also Martin Davies, Andrew Bell and Paul Le Gay Bereton,Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia(LexisNexis, 8th ed, 2010) (“Nygh’s\n                        Conflict of Laws in Australia”) at\n                    paras 8.13-8.24). 49     And, in the decision of this court inMurukami Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi\n                        Murukami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others[2009] 1 SLR(R) 508, the current Australian position was summarised\n                    thus (at [32]–[35]): 32    In so far as those\n                            of the disputed foreign properties situated in Australia (“the\n                            Australian properties”) are concerned, the appellant also\n                            previously brought claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\n                            Gzell J, inMurakami v Wiryadi[2006] NSWSC 1354 (“Murakami”), stayed those proceedings on the\n                            ground offorum non conveniens. The\n                            learned judge applied the Australian approach toforum non conveniensas set out in the Australian High\n                            Court decisions ofOceanic Sun Line Special Shipping\n                                Co Inc v Fay(1988) 165 CLR 197\n                                (“Oceanic Sun Line”),Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary\n                                Limited(1990) 171 CLR 538 (“Voth”),Henry v\n                                Henry(1996) 185 CLR 571 andCSR Limited v Cigna Insurance Australia Limited(1997)\n                            189 CLR 345 to the effect that the court may stay or dismiss\n                            proceedings if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the\n                            availability of the foreign tribunal, the forum is clearly inappropriate\n                            for the determination of the dispute (reference may similarly be made to\n                            the (also) Australian High Court decision ofRegie\n                                Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang(2002)\n                            210 CLR 491). 33    Although\n                            the test applied in the Australian context to the issue offorum non conveniensis quite different from\n                            that set out inSpiliada([26] supra),\n                            there would (on most occasions) be no difference in the actual result\n                            arrived at by the court (see, for example,Oceanic\n                                Sun Lineat 251-252 (perDeane J) and 265-266 (perGaudron J),Vothat 558 (perMason CJ and Deane, Dawson and\n                            Gaudron JJ),Eng Liat Kiang([9]\n                            supra) at [23] and Peter Brereton, “Forum Non\n                                Conveniensin Australia: A Case Note onVothvManildra Flour\n                                Mills” (1991) 40 ICLQ 895 at 897-898;cf, however,Civil\n                                Jurisdiction and Judgments([6]supra) at para 4.20 (reference may also be made to\n                            Richard Garnett, “Stay of Proceedings in Australia: A ‘Clearly\n                            Inappropriate’ Test?” (1999) 23 Melb Univ L Rev 30)). That having been\n                            said, it is important to guard against simply equating the two tests\n                            because (if nothing else) their respective points of emphasis are quite\n                            different (see, for example,Vothat 558perMason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; the\n                            learned judges, however, also observed that, in applying the test under\n                            Australian law, “the discussion by Lord Goff inSpiliadaof relevant ‘connecting factors’ and ‘a\n                            legitimate personal or juridical advantage’ provide[d] valuable\n                            assistance” (idat 564-565) - observations which\n                            were also cited and applied by Gzell J inMurakamiat ([39]). 34    While we have\n                            previously rejected the Australian approach toforum\n                                non conveniensin favour of the test inSpiliada, which calls for a determination of\n                            whether there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more\n                            appropriate than Singapore (see, for example, the decision of this court\n                            inEng Liat Kiangat [26]), Gzell J's\n                            observations inMurakami([32] supra) are\n                            nevertheless helpful. This is because the factors which the learned\n                            judge considered would apply with equal force in the context of the\n                            doctrine offorum non conveniensas set\n                            out inSpiliada. In particular,\n                            Gzell J noted that (seeMurakamiat\n                            [45]): The connecting factors ... do not favour New South Wales against\n                            Indonesia. [The appellant] is not resident in New South Wales and [the\n                            first respondent] and [the fourth respondent] do not live in Australia.\n                            The events [which are] the subject of complaint are just as much centred\n                            in Indonesia where the non-disclosure of the New South Wales assets is\n                            alleged to have occurred as in New South Wales where the assets were\n                            acquired. The learned judge also noted (idat [46]), just as we have (see[29]above), that thelex\n                            causaewas Indonesian law. He further commented (at [47] ofMurakami) that: If matters are to be determined in the New South Wales court expert\n                            evidence will be required. If the issues are to be determined in the\n                            Indonesian courts there is no need for experts. Indeed, Gzell J was of the view (idat\n                        [52]) that “it [was] in the interests of the parties that a proper\n                        resolution of the issues be made in proceedings to be commenced in\n                        Indonesia”. 35    The factors and the arguments considered by\n                            Gzell J in the preceding paragraph, although analysed in the\n                            context of the Australian approach toforum non\n                                conveniens, apply equally in the context of the approach\n                            of this court as embodied inSpiliada([26]supra). Indeed, there is a\n                            considerable overlap between the factors and the arguments considered by\n                            Gzell J inMurakamiand those\n                            discussed above in the context of the present proceedings. There is, in\n                            fact, good reason to believe that this is one instance where there would\n                            be no difference in result regardless of whether the Australian approach\n                            or the approach inSpiliadais adopted\n                            (see also above at [33]). 50     It should be noted that the decision of\n                    Gzell J inMurakami v Wiryadi[2006] NSWSC 1354 was in fact reversed on appeal in the decision of\n                    the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision ofMurakami v\n                        Wiryadi & Ors[2010] NSWCA 7. However, the\n                    general principles as well as observations set out in the quotation in the\n                    preceding paragraph continue to represent the Australian approach towards the\n                    issue offorum non conveniens, notwithstanding the\n                    following observations by Kirby J in the High Court of Australia decision\n                    ofRegie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang(2002) 210 CLR 491 (“Zhang”) (at 525): Like the Pilgrim I have not lost faith. One dayVothmay be overruled and a principle of the common law may\n                        be established more appropriate to contemporary circumstances of global and\n                        regional disputes in which Australian courts, like those of every country,\n                        must now operate. But until overruled by this Court or replaced by valid\n                        legislation,Vothmust be applied. 51     Indeed, a challenge mounted recently against\n                    the present Australian approach in the subsequent (also) High Court of Australia\n                    decision ofPuttick v Tenon(2008)\n                    238 CLR 265 was rejected, in no uncertain, terms by the majority. The\n                    challenge (which was mounted by the Respondent) was, in fact, framed by way of\n                    an invitation to the court to either overrule the “clearly inappropriate\n                    forum test” inVoth ortorestatethe test inVothin amodifiedform by also permitting a stay when\n                    there was a more appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute. The latter\n                    was, in effect, an invitation to introduce theSpiliadatestin addition tothe\n                    “clearly inappropriate forum test”. Not surprisingly, perhaps,\n                    French CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Kiefel JJrejectedthis invitation and reaffirmed the “clearly\n                    inappropriate forum test” inVoth. Heydon\n                    and Crennan JJ, however, whilst clearly of the view thatVothcould not be overruled in that particular case, did\n                    (perhaps somewhat curiously) add thus (at [38]): Voth’scase should simply be followed\n                        until the time comes, if it ever comes, for full argument to be developed\n                        about its correctness, and for an argument that it is wrong to be\n                        accepted. The learned judges proceeded to give reasons as to why the test inVothcould not be challenged in that\n                    particular case. These included, first, that there was no “satisfactory\n                    forensic background against which to explore the correctness ofVoth’scase” (at [39]); that it was not\n                    satisfactorily explained in detail how the considerations relevant to overruling\n                    prior authorities (here,Voth) had been satisfied\n                    (at [40]); that the written submissions advanced by the Respondent in relation\n                    to the correctness ofVoth“were not\n                    developed in the detail which is desirable when a question of this important\n                    kind is presented” (at [41]); that “it was not demonstrated that\n                    even if theVothtest were overruled or modified,\n                    there would be any difference in the result of the appeal”; and that\n                    “[i]n the absence of that demonstration, any observations making a change\n                    to theVothtest would in one sense be dicta\n                    only”, which was “not in general a satisfactory method of\n                    developing the law” (at [42]). 52     The observations of both Heydon and\n                    Crennan JJ are, on one reading at least, ambiguous although it might, on\n                    another reading, be open to the interpretation that they were at least open to\n                    the “clearly inappropriate forum test” inVothbeing revisted on an appropriate occasion in the\n                    foreseeable future. Looked at in this light, the following observations by the\n                    authors of a leading Australian textbook may appear a little too strong (seeNygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australiaat\n                    para 8.24): [Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary\n                            Limited(1990) 171 CLR 538] has been part of\n                        Australian law for twenty years. In [Puttick v Tenon\n                            Ltd(2008) 250 ALR 482], a new generation of High Court\n                        justices, none of whom participated inVoth,\n                        showed no inclination to reconsider the ‘clearly inappropriate\n                        forum’ test. Despite all the academic lamentation and complaint,\n                        judicial reform of theVothtest appears to be\n                        past praying for. Without legislative change, the test is entrenched in\n                        Australian law and critics must just grin and bear it.",
        "A final point – relativity of natural forum": "53     A final point might be noted. Counsel for the\n                    Appellant, Mr Cavinder Bull, laid great emphasis upon the fact that there\n                    were, in effect, no substantive connecting factors in relation toSingapore. He argued that this was a relevant factor as\n                    stage one of theSpiliadatest wascomparativein nature. There is some force in this\n                    argument inasmuch as the defendant must, under the first limb of the test in theSpiliada, establish that there isanotheravailable forum which is clearly or distinctly\n                    more appropriate than Singapore. Tothatend, the\n                    number as well as quality of connecting factors in theSingaporecontextisrelevant from\n                    a comparative (or relational) perspective. And, to the extent that there arenosubstantive connecting factors in relation\n                    to Singapore, that must surely weigh in favour of the defendant. However, as\n                    this court pointed out inCIMB Bank(at [26]; also\n                    reproduced above at[38]), “it is not\n                    enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate\n                    forum” – which would, of course, be the situation if there were, in\n                    the case concerned,nosubstantive connecting\n                    factors in relation toSingapore. The defendant\n                    must, as we have already noted, gofurtherand\n                    establish that there isanotheravailable forum\n                    which isclearly or distinctly more appropriate than\n                        Singapore(see also the decision of this court inSiemens AG v Holdrich Investment Ltd[2010] 3 SLR\n                    1007 at [4] (“Siemens AG”)). Hence,\n                    notwithstanding the fact that there might be few – or evenno– substantive connecting factors in relation toSingapore, this doesnot\n                        necessarilymean that the defendant would have discharged the\n                    burden that is placed upon it under the first limb of the test in theSpiliada. This is, in fact, an excellent example of the\n                    moregeneralprinciple thateveryperspective in a given legal testmustbe considered. Indeed, in so far as this particular issue\n                    is concerned, the following summary by Prof Yeo is particularly helpful\n                    (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore(at\n                    para 75.089), appropriately entitled “Relativity of Natural\n                    Forum”): The principle of the natural forum does not seek to identifythemost clearly appropriate forum in the absolute\n                        sense. The search is foranatural forum, notthenatural forum. Four implications\n                        follow. Firstly, there may be cases where no forum can be said to be comparatively\n                        more appropriate than any other. In such a case, stay will not be granted\n                        because it cannot be shown that there is another forum that is clearly more\n                        appropriate. Similarly, in a service out of jurisdiction case, it cannot be\n                        rebutted that Singapore is the proper forum to hear the case. The Singapore\n                        court will exercise its jurisdiction in such cases, even if it means\n                        multiplicity of proceedings. Secondly, although the formulation inThe\n                            Spiliadais that the defendant seeking a stay of proceedings\n                        must not only show that Singapore is not an appropriate forum, but that\n                        there is clearly another more appropriate forum elsewhere, it should be\n                        borne in mind that the inappropriateness of Singapore as a forum is relative\n                        to the existence of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere. It is not\n                        necessary to show that Singapore is a clearly inappropriate forum. Thirdly, the defendant may show that two (or more) fora are clearly more\n                        appropriate than Singapore, without having to identify one of them\n                        specifically asthemost appropriate\n                        forum. Fourthly, if the parties have chosen not to have their dispute decided in\n                        the foreign forum with the strongest connections with the case, and this\n                        alternative forum is not put forward to the court for consideration, the\n                        court is still obliged to consider whether any other forum put forward by\n                        the defendant is a clearly more appropriate forum than Singapore. A more\n                        difficult situation arises where the defendant applies to stay Singapore\n                        proceedings on the basis that forum X is clearly more appropriate than\n                        Singapore, while the plaintiff presents evidence that forum Y is clearly\n                        more appropriate than either X or Singapore (but neither the plaintiff nor\n                        the defendant is interested in litigating in Y). In principle, this does not\n                        affect the proposition that the court shouldprima\n                            faciestay the proceedings when the defendant has\n                        demonstrated that there is a clearly more appropriate and available forum\n                        elsewhere. [emphasis in original] 54     We should note – parenthetically –\n                    that, incontrastto theSingaporeposition, theAustralianposition (see above at[47]–[48]) tends, by its very nature, to be focused,\n                    instead, on (as Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ put it inVoth(at 565)) “the inappropriateness\n                    of the local court and not the appropriateness or comparative appropriateness of\n                    the suggested foreign forum”. And, in the same decision, the learned\n                    judges also observed, in a similar vein (at 558), that: ...the question which the [“clearly inappropriate forum”]\n                        test presents is slightly different [from the approach inSpiliada] in that it focuses on the advantages and\n                        disadvantages arising from a continuation of the proceedings in the selected\n                        forum rather than on the need to make a comparative judgment between the two\n                        forums. Likewise, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ\n                    observed inZhang(at 503) that “it should\n                    at once be noted that a court is not an inappropriate forum merely because\n                    another is more appropriate”. However, we would think that, on a\n                    practical level at least, some comparative analysis is probably inevitable in\n                    most cases. Indeed, inVoth, Mason CJ, Deane,\n                    Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed (at 558) that: [The focus on the inappropriateness of the local forum] is not to deny\n                        that considerations relating to the suitability of the alternative forum are\n                        relevant to the examination of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of\n                        the selected forum. (See alsoVothat 564-565 and[47]above). 55     Let us turn now to apply both the first limb\n                    as well as the second limb of the test in theSpiliadato the facts of the present appeal. Before proceeding\n                    to do so, it would be appropriate to review – in summary form – the\n                    main arguments proffered on behalf of both parties.",
        "The parties’ arguments": "",
        "The Appellants’ arguments": "56     The Appellants argued that, as between\n                    Singapore and Indonesia, Indonesia was the more appropriate forum for hearing\n                    the dispute between the parties. The Appellants emphasised that the following\n                    connecting factors pointed towards Indonesia as the natural forum: (a)     Events relevant to the dispute\n                        occurred in Indonesia. For example, Indonesia was the place where Cyriac\n                        first met the Second and Third Appellants. Indonesia is also the location of\n                        the mining concessions that are the subject of the\n                    dispute. (b)     The\n                        parties have connections with Indonesia. The First Appellant is a UAE\n                        company but it has a registered office in Indonesia. Both the Second and\n                        Third Appellants are resident in Indonesia. The Respondent carries out\n                        projects in Indonesia and its representative, Cyriac, spends a significant\n                        amount of time there. (c)     The Appellants will have to rely on non-party witnesses who are\n                        resident in Indonesia (“the Indonesian Witnesses”). Some of\n                        these witnesses may have to be compelled to testify. In this regard, the\n                        Judge erred in predetermining the witnesses that the Appellants wished to\n                        call for the trial on the merits. (d)     Documentary evidence relevant to the dispute is presently\n                        located in Indonesia. (e)     In so far, at least, as the Respondent’s alternative claim for\n                        misrepresentation in tort is concerned, the natural forum is Indonesia\n                        because that is the place where the tort occurred. (f)     The Respondent’s claims are\n                        governed by Indonesian law. The claim for misrepresentation is governed by\n                        Indonesian law because Indonesian law is thelex loci\n                            delicti. Indonesian law is also the law governing the\n                        Investment Agreement because that is the law which has the closest and most\n                        real connection with the Investment Agreement. In relation to the governing\n                        law of the Investment Agreement, the Judge erred in suggesting that UAE law\n                        might govern the Investment Agreement even though neither party raised the\n                        applicability of UAE law in the hearing below. (g)     The Appellants sought leave to raise a new\n                        argument on the Respondent’s claim under the Misrepresentation Act.\n                        The Appellants argued that the Respondent has no claim under the\n                        Misrepresentation Act because the Misrepresentation Act does not have\n                        extraterritorial effect,ie, that this Act\n                        does not apply to misrepresentations occurring outside the territory of\n                        Singapore. 57     On the whole, the Appellants submitted that,\n                    as between Singapore and Indonesia, Indonesia is the more appropriate forum for\n                    hearing the dispute. The Appellants further argued that, even if the Investment\n                    Agreement was governed by UAE law, the connecting factors were still\n                    overwhelmingly in favour of Indonesia. In any case, the Appellants urged us to\n                    only consider whether Singapore was a more appropriate forum than Indonesia\n                    since neither party was contending that the dispute should be heard in any forum\n                    apart from Singapore or Indonesia.",
        "The Respondent’s arguments": "58     The Respondent submitted that the following\n                    connecting factors pointed towards Singapore as the more appropriate forum for\n                    hearing the dispute: (a)     The Appellants chose to receive the\n                        Investment Funds in Singapore. (b)     Both the Second and Third Appellants have connections\n                        with Singapore. The Second Appellant studied in Singapore. He also has a\n                        Singapore bank account and he previously owned an apartment in Singapore.\n                        The Second Appellant also previously held shares and directorships in\n                        Singapore companies. The Third Appellant also holds shares and directorships\n                        in Singapore companies. The Respondent also has connections with Singapore\n                        in the form of a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in\n                    Singapore. (c)     As for\n                        the location of witnesses, the dispute is in relation to the discussions\n                        between the Appellants and the Respondent. Therefore, the party witnesses\n                            (ie, the Second and Third Appellants and\n                        the Respondent’s representatives) are the most relevant witnesses. In\n                        any case, the Appellants have not shown that adducing evidence via\n                        video-link would be unsuitable. Furthermore, the travel time between\n                        Indonesia and Singapore is not long and so the inconvenience occasioned by\n                        having the case heard in Singapore is not significant. As for the need to\n                        compel the witnesses, the Appellants have not adduced evidence on whether\n                        the witnesses are compellable in Indonesia. (d)     The location of documents should not be given\n                        any weight. The expense of transporting the documents to Singapore may be\n                        compensated with an appropriate costs order. (e)     Indonesian law is not the governing law of the\n                        Investment Agreement. Rather, the Investment Agreement is governed by\n                        Singapore law because the Singapore JVA was abandoned only because of the\n                        more advantageous tax benefits of using a UAE entity. The parties always\n                        intended for Singapore law to govern the Investment Agreement.\n                        Alternatively, the governing law is UAE law. As for the misrepresentation\n                        claim, the Judge did not err in considering that the application of\n                        Indonesian law was not an insurmountable obstacle. The Judge was merely\n                        ascribing the weight that he was giving to the governing law as a connecting\n                        factor. In any event, the Indonesian law issues for the tort claim are not\n                        complex. (f)     The\n                        place of the tort is indeed theprima facienatural forum for the misrepresentation claim. However, this is just one of\n                        the factors that the court should consider. Furthermore, this factor should\n                        be given less weight because Indonesian tort law has not been shown to be\n                        different from Singapore law. (g)     As for the Respondent’s claim under the\n                        Misrepresentation Act, the Respondent took issue with the Appellants’\n                        raising of a new point that was not canvassed before the Judge. On the\n                        merits, the Respondent argued that the applicability of the\n                        Misrepresentation Act has no bearing on theforum non\n                            conveniensanalysis because it is not a connecting\n                        factor. (h)     On\n                        balance, the connecting factors do not point clearly and distinctly away\n                        from Singapore to Indonesia. The connecting factors in favour of Indonesia\n                        should be given little weight.",
        "Our decision": "",
        "Introduction": "59     It is perhaps important to state an obvious\n                    point right at the outset. Notwithstanding the principles stated above, thefactsof each case are of equal importance.\n                    Put simply, there is no mechanistic method that can be utilised in this –\n                    indeed, any – legal context. To adopt such an approach would be a sure\n                    recipe for legal disaster, producing (in the majority of cases at least) great\n                    injustice. Hence, a close attention to the factual matrix of the present appeal\n                    is imperative.",
        "The Judge’s discretion": "60     As we noted earlier (at[40]), a decision to grant, or to refuse to grant,\n                    a stay of proceedings is discretionary. We were of the view that the appeal\n                    could not be allowed merely because we disagreed with the Judge’s exercise\n                    of his discretion inasmuch as we might have arrived at a different conclusion on\n                    the facts. To reiterate, the guiding principles in this regard were, as this\n                    court stated inCIMB Bank(at [84] reproduced\n                    above at[40]), that: ...an exercise of discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate\n                        court unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or\n                        he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into\n                        account or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have\n                        taken into account, or his decision is plainly wrong. In this regard, the Appellants’ arguments suggested that the\n                    Judge might have misapplied certain principles. For example, the Appellants\n                    submitted that the Judge failed to correctly apply theAlbaforthprinciple, which, as will be seen below (at[106]), is a principle that, in a dispute\n                    involving a tort, the place where the tort occurred isprima\n                        faciethe natural forum. It was, therefore, necessary for us to\n                    apply theSpiliadatest afresh to the facts in\n                    order to ascertain whether or not the Judge had misapplied the principles just\n                    stated. We pause to observe – parenthetically – that the relevant\n                    factors in the context of the facts of the present appeal fall (as we shall see)\n                    principally within the purview of the first three categories of connections\n                    identified by Prof Yeo (above at[42]).",
        "Stage one of theSpiliadatest": "The residence and place of business of the parties 61     The First Appellant is a UAE corporation.\n                    However, it has a representative office in Jakarta. The First Appellant appears\n                    to have conducted most of its business from that office, as evidenced by the\n                    following facts: (i) it sent the Letter of Offer to the Respondent from\n                    Indonesia; (ii) it conducted its meeting of its board of directors to\n                    increase its share capital at the representative office; and (iiii) it sent\n                    the Respondent a copy of the Exclusive Mining Agreement from\n                Indonesia. 62     As for the other parties, the Second and Third\n                    Appellants are resident in Indonesia. The Respondent is an Indian company with\n                    operations in Indonesia. The availability of non-party witnesses 63     We were of the view that the parties were\n                    conflating two factors: (i) theconveniencein having the case decided in the forum where the witnesses are ordinarily\n                    resident (“the Witness Convenience Factor”); and (ii) thecompellabilityof those witnesses (“the\n                    Witness Compellability Factor”). We should analyse these factors\n                    separately because each may suggest that different forums are the natural forum.\n                    In addition, the Witness Compellability Factor could also be a relevant factor\n                    under the second stage of theSpiliadatest, as\n                    was the argument of counsel inRickshaw Investments Ltd and\n                        another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377\n                    at [91]–[92] (“Rickshaw\n                    Investments”). In this regard, we agreed with the following\n                    observations of Prof Yeo (Halsbury’s Laws of\n                        Singaporeat para 75.091): The connections of relevant witnesses can be important too. The physical\n                        locations of witnesses are generally of less significance today given the\n                        ease of travel and the possible use of information and communication\n                        technology.A more important consideration is the\n                            compellability of the witnesses. This has been considered as\n                        a Stage One factor although it involves a comparison of the procedures of\n                        different legal systems.Arguably, it sits more naturally\n                            as a Stage Two factor– a juridical advantage of trial\n                        in a particular forum. However,the benefit of\n                            considering this as a Stage One factor is that compellability of the\n                            defendant’s witnesses in the foreign court will be weighed in the\n                            equation as well, whereas as a Stage Two factor, the\n                        defendant would have to prove that non-compellability in Singapore is a\n                        denial of substantial justice, a very difficult case to make out. This\n                        point, while illustrating the different objectives of the two stages, also\n                        demonstrates the need to take a holistic view. [emphasis added] 64     Given the differences between the two factors,\n                    we considered them separately. (1)   The Witness Convenience Factor 65     In so far as the Witness Convenience Factor\n                    was concerned, our view was that the Judge had, with respect, erred for two\n                    reasons in holding that the Appellants had not shown that the evidence of the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses is material. 66     First, as this court inGood Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd[2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 has held (at [21]), the court hearing an\n                    application for a stay should not predetermine the witnesses that the parties\n                    should call. In fairness to the Judge, he did not hold that the evidence of the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses was not necessary for the Appellants’ defence.\n                    Rather, the Judge indicated thatthe Appellants had failed to\n                        demonstratethat the evidence of the Indonesian Witnesses’\n                    would be material. However, we were of the view that the Judge had, in\n                    substance, predetermined that the Appellants did not need testimony from the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses to advance their defence. 67     Second, the Appellants have endeavoured to\n                    explain the reasons why they require the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses.\n                    It would not be appropriate to require the Appellants to demonstrateexactlyhow they would use the testimony of the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses at this interlocutory stage. The Appellants have not yet\n                    prepared their Defence. We acknowledge, on the other hand, that a defendant\n                    applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation,\n                    that it requires foreign witnesses because that would make it easy for\n                    defendants to manufacture a connecting factor. Our view was that a defendant\n                    should at least show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably\n                    relevant to its defence. The Appellants have, in our view, met that\n                    threshold. 68     Since the Appellants require the testimony of\n                    the Indonesian Witnesses, it appears that this factor points to Indonesia as the\n                    natural forum. However, our analysis did not end there. It was necessary for us\n                    to consider whether (i) the possibility of obtaining evidence from the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses through video-link and (ii) the fact that Indonesia is\n                    relatively close to Singapore suggest that this factor should not be given\n                    substantial weight. Our view was that both considerations were persuasive and\n                    hence operated against the Appellants on this particular\n                sub-issue. 69     With regard to the first consideration, this\n                    court has endorsed the views of the High Court inPeters\n                        Rogers May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 381 (at [26]) on how the possibility of obtaining video-link\n                    evidence should impact the stage one analysis of theSpiliadatest (seeGood Earthat\n                    [21]). The Appellants have not explained why the evidence of the Indonesian\n                    Witnesses cannot be given via video-link. 70     As for the second consideration, we note that\n                    this court inChan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung[2010] 1 SLR(R) 1206 held (at [35]) that the availability of witnesses\n                    should not be a significant factor if the witnesses are from Malaysia because of\n                    the proximity of Singapore to Malaysia. This consideration applies with equal\n                    force to Indonesia, which (as the Respondent has argued) is also relatively near\n                    to Singapore. (2)   The Witness Compellability Factor 71     In so far as the Witness Compellability Factor\n                    is concerned, a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in a\n                    Singapore court (see Order 38, rule 18(2) of the Rules of Court\n                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)). Therefore, the fact that the\n                    Indonesian Witnesses cannot be compelled by a Singapore court to either testify\n                    in person in Singapore or to give evidence via video-link is a factor that\n                    points to Indonesia as being the natural forum. The Appellants have argued that\n                    the Indonesian Witnesses may need to be compelled to testify. 72     A countervailing consideration is, as the\n                    Respondent has argued, that the Appellants have not shown that the Indonesian\n                    Witnesses would be compellable in an Indonesian court if this dispute were heard\n                    in Indonesia. The Respondent cited the recent Singapore High Court decision ofSun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo[2010] SGHC 111 (“Sun Jin\n                        Engineering”) in support of the argument that the\n                    Appellants should have led evidence on the compellability of the Indonesian\n                    Witnesses in the Indonesian courts. InSun Jin\n                        Engineering, the court had the benefit of expert evidence on\n                    whether foreign witnesses were compellable in the alternative forum (the\n                    Maldives). 73     With respect, the Respondent has misunderstood\n                    this particular aspect of the decision inSun Jin\n                        Engineering. The Appellants have correctly explained that inSun Jin Engineering, the court considered that\n                    the expert evidence on whether witnesses were compellable in the Maldives was\n                    unclear. Notwithstanding this, the court considered that it wasmore likelythat the Maldivian witnesses would testify\n                    if the case were heard in the Maldives (seeSun Jin\n                        Engineeringat [40]). 74     We took a similar view in this appeal.\n                    Although it would have been preferable to have had expert evidence on whether\n                    the Indonesian Witnesses are compellable to testify in an Indonesian court, it\n                    is more likely that the Indonesian Witnesses would testify if the dispute were\n                    heard in an Indonesian court. The governing law of the claims 75     As this court has observed (inRickshaw Investmentsat [42]), the governing law of the\n                    claims raised by the parties is a significant factor in stage one of theSpiliadatest. (1)   Characterising the issues 76     Before determining the governing law of the\n                    claims, it is necessary for us to characterise the issues raised by the claims.\n                    The first stage of any choice of law analysis is to characterise the issues that\n                    the parties have raised (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision\n                    ofMacmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investments plc\n                        (No 3)[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 407). 77     The Respondent has made claims (see also above\n                    at[34]) for the following: (i) a\n                    declaration that the contract was validly rescinded; (ii) restitution of\n                    the remainder of the Investment Funds; (iii) damages for misrepresentation\n                    in contract; (iv) damages for misrepresentation in tort; and\n                    (v) damages for misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation\n                Act. 78     The first and the third claims are claims in\n                    contract. The second claim is a claim in restitution. However, the choice of law\n                    analysis for the restitutionary claim is the same as the choice of law analysis\n                    for the contract claims because the restitutionary claim is consequential on the\n                    failure of the Investment Agreement (seeCIMB Bankat [41]). The fourth claim is a claim in tort and the fifth claim is a statutory\n                    claim. (2)   The governing law for the contractual and restitutionary\n                claims (a)   The choice of law rule 79     It is well established that a three stage\n                    approach is applied to determine the governing law of a contract (see, for\n                    example, the decision of this court inPacific Recreation Pte\n                        Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal[2008]\n                    2 SLR(R) 491 (“Pacific\n                    Recreation”) at [36]). At the first stage, the court considers\n                    if the contract expressly states its governing law (“the Express\n                    Law”). If the contract is silent, the court proceeds to the second stage\n                    and considers whether it can infer the governing law from the intentions of the\n                    parties (“the Implied Law”). If the court is unable to infer the\n                    parties’ intentions, it moves to the third stage and determines the law\n                    which has the closest and most real connection with the contract (“the\n                    Objective Law”). (b)   analysis 80     It is clear that there was no Express Law. We\n                    were of the view, however, that it is possible to determine the Implied Law. It\n                    is reasonable to infer that the parties intended that UAE law govern the\n                    Investment Agreement given the choice of that law in a closely related contract,viz, the Exclusive Mining Agreement. The\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement was, in fact, sent to the Respondent. The Letter of\n                    Offer also refers to the Exclusive Mining Agreement three times. Furthermore,\n                    the Exclusive Mining Agreement was essential to the Investment Agreement.\n                    Without it, the First Appellant would have had nothing of value to offer the\n                    Respondent in exchange for its provision of expertise. 81     As the editors of the 11th Edition ofDicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws(Stevens & Sons, 11th Ed, 1987) (“Dicey and Morris (11th Ed)”) note, it is possible to\n                    infer that the parties intended that a contract be governed by the same law that\n                    governs a closely related contract (at 1185): … The legal or commercial connection between one contract and\n                        another may enable a court to say that the parties must be held implicitly\n                        to have submitted both contracts to the same law. … The editors of the 11th Edition ofChesire and\n                        North’s Private International Law(Butterworths,\n                    11th Ed, 1987) make a similar assertion (at 459–460). 82     The editors ofDicey and\n                        Morris (11th Ed)cite a number of cases for this\n                    proposition, including the English Court of Appeal decision inRe United Railways of Havana[1960] Ch 52\n                        (“Re United Railways of\n                    Havana”).Re United Railways of\n                        Havanainvolved two related contracts that were part of a\n                    transaction for an English railway company to obtain finance to purchase rolling\n                    stock. The English railway company incorporated a subsidiary in Pennsylvania and\n                    sold the rolling stock to that subsidiary. The subsidiary then leased the\n                    rolling stock to the English railway company (“the First\n                    Contract”). Under the terms of the First Contract, the English railway\n                    company was to pay rentals to the subsidiary. The subsidiary entered into a\n                    contemporaneous contract with a trust company (“the Second\n                    Contract”). Under the terms of the Second Contract, the subsidiary\n                    assigned its rights under the First Contract to the trust company. In effect,\n                    this arrangement meant that the English railway company would pay the rentals to\n                    the trust company which would in turn pay the rentals to holders of trust\n                    certificates. 83     One of the issues inRe United Railways of Havanawas the governing law of the\n                    First Contract. Having held that the Second Contract was governed byPennsylvanianlaw, the English Court of Appeal proceeded\n                    to hold that the First Contract was also governed by Pennsylvanian law because\n                    that was both the Implied Law and the Objective Law. The following portion of\n                    the court’s judgment is instructive (Re United\n                        Railways of Havanaat 94): It has been material to consider the agreement in this connection because\n                        it was held by the judge, and argued before us by counsel for the\n                        respondents, thatthe proper law of the agreement and of\n                            the lease was intended to be the same.This is probably, though not, we think, inevitably, true. In\n                        the words of the judge: \"The lease is expressly recited in the agreement,\n                        and in the lease there is a recital of the intention immediately to assign\n                        the benefit of the lease to the trustee.The two\n                            documents are essential parts of the same transaction,\n                        namely, the Philadelphia Plan. In those circumstances one would expect that\n                        they would each have the same proper law, and I hold that they have.\" One\n                        certainly cannot ignore the fact thateach of the two\n                            documents constituted essential parts of one entire transaction and it\n                            would, we think, be unusual if the parties concerned in that transaction\n                            should desire one part to be governed by the law of Cuba (which is in\n                            many relevant respects totally different from American law) and the\n                            other part to be governed by the law of Pennsylvania.\n                        [emphasis added] It should be noted thatRe United Railways of\n                        Havanaproceeded on appeal to the House of Lords (seeIn re United Railways of Havana and Regla Warehouses Ltd[1961] AC 1007 (“Re United Railways of\n                        Havana (HL)”)). On this particular point, the House of\n                    Lords considered that the Objective Law was Pennsylvanian law (seeRe United Railways of Havana (HL)at 1068\n                        (perLord Denning) and 1081 (perLord Morris)). The judgment at the House of\n                    Lords did not consider whether the Implied Law was Pennsylvanian law (and was,\n                    incidentally, one of the rare decisions that was overruled (pursuant to the\n                    House of Lords Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966]\n                    1 WLR 1234) by the House of Lords inMiliangos v\n                        George Frank (Textiles) Ltd[1976] AC 443 (albeit with\n                    Lord Simon of Glaisdale dissenting (on the issue as to whether or not the\n                    “breach date conversion” rule inRe United\n                        Railways of Havana (HL)ought to be departed from and be\n                    substituted with the rule that an English court was entitled to give judgment\n                    for a sum of money expressed in a foreign currency in the case of obligations of\n                    a money character to pay foreign currency under a contract, the proper law of\n                    which was that of a foreign country and when the money of account was that of\n                    that country or possibly some country other than the United\n                Kingdom))). 84     We also considered decisions such as the\n                    English High Court decisions inThe Njegos[1936]\n                    1 P 90 (“The Njegos”) andThe Adriatic[1931] P 241 to be\n                    relevant because they consider that it is possible to infer that the parties\n                    concerned intended that a contract be governed by the same law as the governing\n                    law of a related contract. InThe Njegos, for\n                    example, a bill of lading incorporated the terms of a charterparty. The\n                    charterparty contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration in\n                    England. The parties agreed that the proper law of the charterparty was English\n                    law. The issue related to the governing law of the bills of lading. The court\n                    found that the bills of lading did not incorporate the arbitration clause and\n                    hence the governing law could not be inferred from the arbitration clause.\n                    However, the court nevertheless held that English law governed the bills of\n                    lading because the parties should be presumed to have intended that the bills of\n                    lading be governed by the same law as the law governing the charterparty\n                        (The Njegosat 107). It might also be noted\n                    that the Singapore High Court inLas Vegas Hilton Corp\n                        (trading as Las Vegas Hilton) v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny[1996]\n                    2 SLR(R) 589 referred (at [39]) toThe\n                        Njegoswhen discussing the circumstances in which an inference\n                    may be drawn in relation to the governing law of a contract. 85     Returning to the relevant facts of the present\n                    appeal, we considered that it was possible to infer that the parties intended\n                    that the Investment Agreement be governed by the same law that governs the\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement (UAE law) because of the close relation between the\n                    contracts. We did not consider it to be material that the Exclusive Mining\n                    Agreement and the Investment Agreement were not between the same parties. The\n                    related contracts in the decisions referred to above (at[83]and[84])\n                    were also between different parties. The crucial point is that the two contracts\n                    in each of those decisions were so closely related that the parties could not\n                    reasonably be considered as having intended that different laws govern the\n                    related contracts. 86     This raises the issue as to whether the Judge\n                    was entitled to suggest that the applicable law was UAE law when the parties\n                    proceeded on the basis that the applicable law was either Singapore law or\n                    Indonesian law. The Appellants argued that the Judge should not have suggested\n                    that the applicable law was UAE law without inviting the parties to make\n                    submissions on the potential applicability of UAE law. The Appellants relied on\n                    the decision of this court inPacific Recreationas support for this argument. 87     It is indeed true that the Judge should have\n                    allowed the parties to submit on the potential applicability of UAE law.\n                    However, it is open to us to reach a provisional view that the governing law of\n                    the Investment Agreement is UAE law because both parties had the opportunity to\n                    submit, in this appeal, on the potential applicability of UAE law – which\n                    opportunity they in fact availed themselves of. (3)   The governing law for the alternative tort claim (a)   The choice of law rule 88     The choice of law rule that Singapore courts\n                    apply for torts is the double actionability rule (seeRickshaw Investmentsat [53]). The double actionability rule\n                    provides that the tort must be actionable under both thelex\n                        foriand thelex loci delicti.\n                    Exceptionally, the double actionability rule may be displaced such that the tort\n                    may be actionable in Singapore even though it is not actionable under either thelex loci delictior thelex\n                        fori. The exception may even be applied to provide that the law\n                    of a third country is the applicable law for the tort (seeRickshaw Investmentsat [56]). (b)   analysis 89     We have to first determine the place of the\n                    tort in order to ascertain thelex loci delicti.\n                    This posed some difficulty in the present appeal because the elements\n                    constituting the tort of misrepresentation did not occur in a single\n                    jurisdiction. The alleged misrepresentations were made in Indonesia. But at\n                    least some of the misrepresentations were received in India. 90     The test that is commonly applied for\n                    determining the place of the tort is that which looks at the events constituting\n                    the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose (“the\n                    Substance Test”) (see, for example, the House of Lords decision ofDistillers Co. (Biochemicals) Ltd v Thompson[1971] AC 458 at 468 and the English Court of Appeal decision ofMetal und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson\n                        Lufkin & Jenrette Inc & Anor[1990]\n                    1 QB 391 at 443). The Singapore courts have also applied the Substance\n                    Test (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions ofWing Hak Man and another v Bio-Treat Technology Ltd and others[2009] 1 SLR(R) 446 at [26] andFocus Energy Ltd v\n                        Aye Aye Soe[2009] 1 SLR(R) 1086 at\n                [14]). 91     The English courts have crystallised the\n                    Substance Test into a more certain rule in cases of misrepresentations made in\n                    one jurisdiction and received in another jurisdiction. In the context of\n                    determining the place of tort for the purpose of leave to serve out of\n                    jurisdiction, the English Court of Appeal has held that the place of the tort is\n                    the place where the representation is “received and acted upon”\n                    (see the English Court of Appeal decisions ofCordoba\n                        Shipping Co Ltd v National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey (The\n                        “Albaforth”)[1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 at\n                    92 (“The Albaforth”) andDiamond v Bank of London and Montreal[1979] QB 333 at 345–346). A different approach, however, was\n                    taken in a case where the misrepresentation occurred in one jurisdiction to anunspecified classof persons and was received\n                    and relied upon in a second jurisdiction. The court found that the tort occurred\n                    in the first jurisdiction (see the English Court of Appeal decision ofCordova Land Co v Victor Bros Inc[1966]\n                    1 WLR 793 at 801). Prof Yeo, inHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore, concisely states the\n                    approach taken in these misrepresentation cases thus (at\n                    para 75.378): The tort of misrepresentation is generally committed in the country where\n                        the representation isreceived and acted upon,\n                        at least where the representation is directed specifically at the plaintiff,unless the place is fortuitous in the\n                            circumstances, or if the receipt and reliance occur in\n                        different countries. If the representation is madeat\n                            large, then the tort may have occurred in theplace where the representation is made. [emphasis\n                        added] 92     It should be noted, in passing, that the\n                    English courtsnowapply adifferenttest for determining the place of the tort. For cases\n                    arising before the date when the Rome II Regulation came into force\n                    (11 January 2009), the test for the place of the tort is found in\n                    s 11(2) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act\n                    1995 (c 42) (UK) (“the PILMPA”) (which is, of course, not\n                    applicable in Singapore). That provision defines the place of the tort\n                    differently for personal injury cases (see s 11(2)(a) of the PILMPA),\n                    property damage cases (see s 11(2)(b) of the PILMPA) and all other cases\n                    (see s 11(2)(c) of the PILMPA). The present case would have come within the\n                    scope of s 11(2)(c) of the PILMPA, under which the place of the tort would\n                    be the place where “the most significant element or elements” of\n                    the events constituting the tort in question occurred (seeDicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws(Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) at\n                    para 35-088–35-089 (“Dicey, Morris and\n                        Collins”)). For cases coming within the purview of the\n                    Rome II Regulation, there is no longer a need to consider the place of the tort\n                    because other connecting factors, such as the place where the damage occurs and\n                    the place of habitual residence, are utilised instead (see generallyDicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws, Third\n                    Cumulative Supplement to the Fourteenth Edition at\n                    paras S35-194–S35-200). 93     We were of the view that the approach adopted\n                    by the English courts (as discussed above at[91]) has some merit. The Substance Test is itself rather broad\n                    and open-ended. There is, for example, room for debate as to whether the place\n                    where the representation was made is more significant than the place where the\n                    representation was received – andvice\n                    versa. More importantly, both would, theoretically at least, satisfy\n                    the Substance Test. It would therefore help to have more concrete rules, with\n                    appropriate exceptions, for particular torts. For misrepresentations, it is\n                    suggested that, if the representation was received and acted upon in a single\n                    jurisdiction, that place should be the place of the tort unless that place was\n                    fortuitous or if the receipt and reliance occur in different countries. The\n                    Substance Test (in its more general form and possible\n                    “incarnations”) may nevertheless still be resorted to in cases not\n                    falling comfortably within this suggested (and more specific) rule. However, for\n                    reasons which we will elaborate upon in a moment, there is no need to rule\n                    definitively on this point in the present appeal. In particular, the\n                    circumstances are such that the suggested rule cannot (as we shall see) be\n                    applied. 94     As just mentioned, the present appeal is, in\n                    fact, a case that does not fit comfortably within the suggested rule. The actual\n                    misrepresentation wasreceivedin India because\n                    that was the place where the First Appellant sent the Letter of Offer and the\n                    Exclusive Mining Agreement. Both those documents contained a representation that\n                    the First Appellant had mining concessions with one million tonnes of iron ore.\n                    However, the Appellants contend that other representations were also made during\n                    meetings in Indonesia as to the mining concessions that the First Appellant\n                    could rely on to make up a total of one million tonnes of iron ore. The\n                    representations were alsoacted uponintwojurisdictions. The Respondent acted on the\n                    representation by remitting funds from India. The Respondent also acted on the\n                    representation in Indonesia by conducting drilling works at the Pelaihari\n                    Concession. Accordingly, it is not possible to apply the suggested rule.\n                    Instead, we applied the general Substance Test. 95     Applying the general Substance Test, we were\n                    of the view that the place of the tort was Indonesia. Indonesia was the place\n                    where most of the negotiations took place. The Respondent also took steps in\n                    reliance of the representations in Indonesia. The only reason why the\n                    representations in the Letter of Offer and the Exclusive Mining Agreement were\n                    received in India was because the Respondent was based in India. Accordingly, we\n                    were of the view that thelex loci delictiis\n                    Indonesian law. 96     It remained for us to consider the\n                    Respondent’s contention that Indonesian law has not been shown to be\n                    different from Singapore law. In this regard, we noted that strict proof of the\n                    differences between Indonesian and Singapore law was not necessary. As this\n                    court observed inRickshaw Investments, we may\n                    take notice that the laws of other jurisdictions are likely to be different (at\n                    [43]): Choice of law questions raise a related issue regarding a party's\n                        evidential burden to plead foreign law. InGoh Chok Tong\n                            v Tang Liang Hong[1997] 1 SLR(R) 811, Lai Kew\n                        Chai J pointed pertinently tothe need for foreign\n                            law to be pleaded, and held that if foreign law was not in\n                        fact pleaded, it would be presumed to be the same as the relevant position\n                        under Singapore law (see generally at [77]-[84], and especially at [79]):\n                        see alsoErtel Bieber and Company v Rio Tinto Company,\n                            Limited[1918] AC 260 at 294-295. Where this\n                        evidentiary presumption can be invoked, the applicability of a foreignlex causaeunder choice of law rules may\n                        therefore be reduced in significance since the forum is unlikely to have\n                        difficulty applying a foreign law which is (assumed to be) identical to thelex fori. In this regard, however, a\n                        number of cases suggest that a court may, despite a party's failure to\n                        adduce proof of foreign law, have regard to the fact that the principles in\n                        the foreign jurisdiction concerned will, in all likelihood, differ from thelex foriin some respects (see, for\n                        example, the Singapore High Court decision ofPT Jaya\n                            Putra Kundur Indah v Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd[1996] SGHC 285 at [44] (\"PT\n                        Jaya\")). Hence, in the present case, the mere factum of a foreignlex causae,ie, German law, may be accorded due weightdespitethe respondent's failure to adduce evidence\n                        regarding the content of this law. [emphasis in original] (4)   The statutory claim 97     Contrary to the Respondent’s submissions\n                    (see above at [58(g)]), whether the Misrepresentation Act potentially applies is\n                    a relevant consideration under stage one of theSpiliadatest because it is relevant for this court to consider\n                    the law governing the claims raised by the Respondent. For example, if the scope\n                    of the Misrepresentation Act is such that it potentially applies to the present\n                    case, then that would be a factor against Indonesia being the natural forum\n                    because greater expense and inconvenience would result in having the application\n                    of a Singapore statute heard in an Indonesian court. This isnotto state that we are determining thesubstantiveissue as to whether the Respondent’s claim\n                    under the Misrepresentation Act is sustainable on the facts, as we cannot,ex hypothesi, make this determination in the\n                    context of the present proceedings. Rather, we are determining whether thescopeof the Misrepresentation Act is such\n                    that itpotentiallyapplies in the present\n                    case. 98     Before considering the scope of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act, we should elucidate the approach that we took in our\n                    analysis. The Appellants approached the issue of the scope of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act from the perspective of the presumption against\n                    extraterritoriality. It is useful to clarify that there are in fact two aspects\n                    to this presumption in the conflict of laws context. Prof Yeo notes as\n                    follows (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat\n                    para 75.292): Where the conflictual scope of legislation is not spelt out, it has often\n                        been said that there is a presumption that legislation of the forum is\n                        intended only to have territorial effect. There are two overlapping aspects\n                        to this presumption.Firstly, as a matter ofprivate international law, the presumption\n                        is that the statutory provisiononly applies if the\n                            relevant connecting factor points to the law of the forum as the law\n                            governing the issue.Secondly,whatever the basis that the statute\n                            applies(whether as forum mandatory law, or as the\n                        substantive law governing the issue by reason of the forum’s choice of\n                        law rule, or as forum procedural law), it is presumablyonly intended to affect activities occurring within the territory of\n                            the forum, or toactivities abroad of\n                            nationals of the forum. [emphasis added] 99Dicey, Morris and\n                        Collinsnote that there are two approaches to determining the\n                    scope of a statute in the conflict of laws context. However, the editors do not\n                    consider the two approaches to be part of a common exercise of deriving\n                    parliamentary intention. The following remarks by the editors, in the context of\n                    a discussion on the scope of s 2 of the Marriage Act 1949 (c 76) (UK),\n                    are instructive (at para 1-040): A court, when confronted by a statute of its own law or of foreign law\n                        which is expressed in general terms like this, could use one of the two\n                        methods to determine its scope. Thefirstis\n                        tointerpret the statute in the light of its purpose and\n                            backgroundso as to read into it the limitations which the\n                        legislature would have expressed if it had given thought to the matter. This\n                        is an artificial method, and perhaps a dangerous one, becauseex hypothesithe legislature gave no thought to the\n                        matter – if it had done so it would have expressed the limitations.\n                        Thesecond methodis toapply general principles derived from the conflict of laws– i.e.first characterise the questionas relating to capacity to marry [as noted above, this quotation is from a\n                        discussion on the scope of s 2 of the Marriage Act 1949 (c 76)\n                        (UK), which provides that “[a] marriage between persons either of\n                        whom is under the age of sixteen shall be void”], and then apply the\n                        relevant conflict rule to the question so characterised. [emphasis\n                        added] 100    Our view was that, conceptually, it is\n                    better to consider the two approaches as part of a common exercise of discerning\n                    parliamentary intention. If Parliament clearly intended for a statute to apply\n                    even where the choice of law rules suggest that Singapore law does not apply,\n                    the courts must not disregard Parliamentary intention and refuse to apply the\n                    statute. Parliament has the power to legislate extraterritorially (see the\n                    decision of this court inPublic Prosecutor v Taw Cheng\n                        Kong[1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 at [37]). The choice of law\n                    rules are simply useful tools in ascertaining Parliamentary intention on the\n                    geographical scope of our laws. 101    On the first aspect of the presumption, the\n                    starting point is to characterise the issue that the Respondent has raised with\n                    its claim that the Appellants have induced it to enter into a contract through a\n                    misrepresentation. The competing characterisations are a tort and a contract\n                    characterisation. It is not necessary to reach a firm conclusion on the proper\n                    characterisation because, on either characterisation, the applicable law is not\n                    Singapore law. As considered above, the applicable law on a contract\n                    characterisation is UAE law (see above at[85]) and the applicable law based on a tort characterisation is\n                    Indonesian law (see above at[95]).\n                    Therefore, on the first aspect of the presumption, we may presume that\n                    Parliament did not intend that the Misrepresentation Act apply to the present\n                    case because Singapore law does not govern the issue that the Respondent has\n                    raised. 102    The second aspect of the presumption does\n                    not rely on choice of law rules. Parliament isgenerallypresumed to have intended for its laws to only apply\n                    to activity in Singapore (see the decision of this court inParno v SC Marine Pte Ltd[1999] 3 SLR(R) 377 at\n                    [38]–[39] (“Parno”)). This\n                    presumption may be displaced by clear indication of Parliamentary intention that\n                    the statute concerned is intended to apply extraterritorially (seeParnoat [39]). This intention need not be stated\n                    expressly (seeParnoat [38]). As an illustration,\n                    the Singapore High Court recently held that the presumption against\n                    extraterritoriality was rebutted in the Traditional Chinese Medicine\n                    Practitioners Act (Cap 333A, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Traditional\n                    Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act”) on the basis that extraterritorial\n                    application of that statute would serve Parliamentary intention and would not\n                    cause any difficulty with international comity and enforcement of the statute\n                    (seeHuang Danmin v Traditional Chinese Medicine\n                        Practitioners Board[2010] SGHC 152 at\n                        [36]-[38]). 103    Applying this general presumption, the\n                    Misrepresentation Act is presumed to apply only to misrepresentations within\n                    Singapore territory. Unlike, for example, s 37 of the Prevention of\n                    Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“the Prevention of\n                    Corruption Act”), the Misrepresentation Act is silent as to its\n                    geographical scope. It is clear, therefore, that the Singapore Parliament has\n                    notexpresslystipulated that it intended that the\n                    Misrepresentation Act apply extraterritorially. However, it seems that the\n                    intention underlying the Misrepresentation Act would be furthered if the\n                    Misrepresentation Act were applied to misrepresentations occurring outside\n                    Singapore territory butonly ifthe applicable law\n                    of the relevant contract were Singapore law. The purpose of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act, which is based on the Misrepresentation Act 1967\n                    (c 7) (UK), is well known and is concisely stated by the editors ofChitty on Contracts(30th Ed,\n                    Sweet & Maxwell, 2008) in the following manner (at\n                    para 6-001): … Prior to the enactment of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the\n                        position broadly speaking was that a misrepresentation which induced a\n                        person to enter into a contract gave the representee the right to rescind\n                        the contract, subject to certain conditions, butgenerally gave him no right to damages unless the misrepresentation had\n                            contractual force. Since the coming into force of the\n                        Misrepresentation Act the representeewill always be able\n                            to claim damages for negligent misrepresentationin\n                        circumstances in which he could have recovered damages had the\n                        misrepresentation been fraudulent. In addition the Actgives the court a discretion to refuse to permit a representee to\n                            rescind a contract, but to award him damages in lieu of\n                            rescission, if the misrepresentation is negligent or wholly\n                        innocent; but it leaves the representee with an absolute right to rescind\n                        where the misrepresentation is fraudulent. The Act of 1967does not, however, alter the rules as to what constitutes an\n                            effective misrepresentation… [emphasis added] 104    It appears, therefore, that the purposes\n                    underlying the Misrepresentation Act are two-fold: (i) to supplement the\n                    remedies available to a representee under common law (more accurately, under the\n                    then common law as the seminal House of Lords decision inHedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners\n                        Ltd[1964] AC 465 had been decided by the time the\n                    Misrepresentation Act had been enacted and had filled the then existing gap,\n                    albeit in different manner than that provided for pursuant to s 2(1) of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act (see, for example,Cheshire, Fifoot and\n                        Furmston’s Law of Contract – Second Singapore and Malaysian\n                        Edition(Butterworths Asia, 1998) (“Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston”) at\n                    pp 468–471)); and (ii) to confer the courts with flexibility in\n                    remedial matters by allowing courts to award damages in lieu of rescission,\n                    which flexibility was not available under the common law (pursuant to\n                    s 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act (see alsoCheshire,\n                        Fifoot and Furmstonat pp 482–484)). These purposes\n                    would not appear to be enhanced if the Misrepresentation Act were applicable to\n                    misrepresentations occurring outside Singapore territory in relation to\n                    contracts governed by foreign law. Unlike, for example, the Prevention of\n                    Corruption Act or the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act, the\n                    Misrepresentation Act is not intended to regulate conduct or protect classes of\n                    persons. The purposes of such conduct regulating and protective statutes would,\n                    perhaps, be advanced if they are applied without strict regard to territorial\n                    links. A statute that merely supplements existing common law remedies with\n                    respect to theSingaporecommon law of contract,\n                    without serving a conduct regulating or protective function, on the other hand,\n                    does not appear to requiregeneralextraterritorial application to have its purposes advanced. If, however, the\n                    relevant contract were governed by Singapore law (whether by express choice or\n                    otherwise), it would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the\n                    Misrepresentation Act to say that it applies even to misrepresentations\n                    occurring outside Singapore territory. In fact, we would suggest that it would\n                    be highly artificial if a choice of Singapore law in a contract only brings into\n                    operation Singaporecommon lawfor\n                    misrepresentations occurring outside Singapore territory without the\n                    supplementary or facilitative provisions of the Misrepresentation\n                Act. 105    As we have held, the Investment Agreement\n                    might be governed by UAE law (see above at[85]). It follows, therefore, that the Misrepresentation Act\n                    does not apply because the misrepresentation occurred outside the territory of\n                    Singapore and the Investment Agreement was not governed by Singapore law.\n                    Therefore, the fact that the Respondent has raised a claim based on the\n                    Misrepresentation Act should not be a relevant factor in stage one of theSpiliadatest. Other connecting factors (1)   The place of the tort 106    As this court accepted inRickshaw(at [39]), for tort claims, the place of the tort isprima faciethe natural forum. This principle\n                    is derived fromThe Albaforth(at 96) and was\n                    accepted by the House of Lords inBerezovsky v\n                        Michaels[2000] 1 WLR 1004 (at 1014). However, as was\n                    observed inRickshaw(at [40]),The Albaforthprinciple is only aprima\n                        facieposition. As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal recently noted,\n                    the place of the tort may, in some cases, be fortuitous (seeThe Peng Yan[2009] 1 HKLRD 144 at [28],perMa CJHC (with whom Cheung J agreed)): It is therefore important when applyingThe\n                            Albaforthprinciple in the context offorum non conveniensapplications, to examine just how close\n                        a connection there really exists with any givenforum. In some cases, the place of the commission of the\n                        tort may be decisive; in others, perhaps not weighty at all. The underlying\n                        principle to be firmly borne in mind is the basic test inThe SpiliadaandThe Adhiguna\n                            Meranti. The place of the commission of the tort may in some\n                        cases be quite fortuitous and may provide no more than a convenient starting\n                        point orprima facieposition. The court is\n                        required to look into more substantial factors in the application of the\n                        basic test. The present case involved a collision where, quite often, there\n                        is no obvious or natural forum: seeThe\n                            Spiliadaat p.477C-D. 107    As we held earlier (see above at[95]), the place of the tort was Indonesia.\n                    Applying theAlbaforthprinciple, Indonesia would,prima facie, be the natural forum, at least\n                    for the alternative tort claim. We were of the view that there was nothing on\n                    the facts of this case to displace theprima facieposition. The place of the tort was not fortuitous. Indonesia was the place from\n                    which the misrepresentations were made. Indonesia was also the place where\n                    substantial acts in reliance of the misrepresentation took place: the Respondent\n                    conducted drilling at the Pelaihari Concession because of the Appellants’\n                    alleged misrepresentations. This is not to say that theAlbaforthprinciple, whilst applicable in the context of the\n                    present proceedings, is decisive in the present appeal. We were aware that the\n                    Respondent’s claim in tort was framed as analternativecause of action. (2)   General connections with Singapore and the payment of the\n                Investment Funds in Singapore 108    The Respondent placed considerable emphasis\n                    on certain general connections that the parties have or have had with Singapore.\n                    The Respondent also relied on the fact that the Investment Funds were paid into\n                    Singapore bank accounts. 109    We did not consider these connections to be\n                    relevant in stage one of theSpiliadatest. The\n                    general connections to Singapore and the payment of the Investment Funds into\n                    Singapore bank accounts have no relevance to the claims that the Respondent has\n                    framed. Only connections that are relevant to the disputes should be considered\n                    in theforum non conveniensanalysis (see, for\n                    example, the decision of this court inThe Rainbow\n                        Joy[2005] 3 SLR(R) 719 at [52] and the English High\n                    Court decision ofVetco Gray UK Ltd v FMC Technologies\n                        Inc, [2007] EWHC 540 (Pat) at [26]). The underlying\n                    purpose of theforum non conveniensanalysis is to\n                    determine whether there is a more appropriate forum,viz, one “in which the case may be tried more suitably\n                    for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice” (seeSpiliadaat 476), and the core inquiry is to\n                    determine the place which has the “most real and substantial\n                    connection” with the case (seeSpiliadaat\n                    478). This purpose and core inquiry will not be advanced by considering\n                    connecting factors that are not relevant to the dispute because those factors\n                    are not really and substantially connected with the case at hand. Conclusion on stage one of theSpiliadatest 110    On the whole, we were satisfied that\n                    Indonesia was clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum than Singapore for\n                    the trial of the claims concerned. Indonesia is the place where all the parties\n                    have some connection that is relevant to the dispute. Although not a significant\n                    factor in so far as the proximity of Indonesia to Singapore and the possibility\n                    of obtaining evidence via video-link are concerned, we gave some weight to the\n                    fact that the Appellants intend to call witnesses based in Indonesia. The\n                    Appellants have also argued that they need to rely on Indonesian Witnesses who\n                    may have to be compelled, and the Appellants will more likely be able to compel\n                    these witnesses if the case was heard in Indonesia. In relation to the\n                    alternative claim in tort, it was relevant that Indonesian law was thelex loci delictiand that the place of the tort was\n                    Indonesia. 111    Although (as noted above) we considered that\n                    UAE law might govern the Investment Agreement, this was not a factor in favour\n                    of Singapore’s candidacy as the natural forum. It should be recalled that\n                    theforum non conveniensanalysis is a relative\n                    one (see above at[53]). The choice in the\n                    present proceedings was between Indonesia and Singapore. Between Indonesia and\n                    Singapore, it would not be logical for us to consider that Singapore was the\n                    natural forum simply because a third forum, the UAE, had a better or as strong a\n                    claim as Indonesia as the natural forum. In this regard, we found the English\n                    Court of Appeal decision ofMacsteel Commercial Holdings\n                        (Pty) Ltd & Anor v Thermasteel V (Canada)\n                        Inc & Anor[1996] CLC 1403\n                        (“Macsteel”), which the\n                    Appellants discussed at length in their Appellants’ Case, to be a useful\n                    illustration (incidentally,Macsteelwas recently\n                    considered by this court inSiemens AG(at [15])).Macsteelwas a case where the dispute had\n                    links to Ontario and South Africa. The only link with England was that English\n                    law was expressed to be the governing law of the contract. On those facts, the\n                    court held that the action should be stayed even though both South Africa and\n                    Ontario hadequallystrong links with the dispute.\n                    The court considered it relevant that the parties were not arguing that the case\n                    should be heard in South Africa. The only comparison was between England and\n                    Ontario. As between England and Ontario, Ontario was the clearly more\n                    appropriate forum. 112    In fact, the Singapore High Court case\n                    adopted a similar approach to the English Court of Appeal inMacsteel. InLehman Brothers Special\n                        Financing Inc v Hartadi Angkosubroto[1998]\n                    3 SLR(R) 664, the court considered that the natural forum was either\n                    New York or Indonesia and not Singapore (at [35]). The High Court accordingly\n                    granted the stay. 113    Reference in this regard may also be made to\n                    the following views of Prof Yeo, which were also reproduced above (see\n                    above at[53]) (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat para 75.089): Fourthly, if the parties have chosen not to have their dispute decided in\n                        the foreign forum with the strongest connections with the case, and this\n                        alternative forum is not put forward to the court for consideration, the\n                        court is still obliged to consider whether any other forum put forward by\n                        the defendant is a clearly more appropriate forum than Singapore. A more\n                        difficult situation arises where the defendant applies to stay Singapore\n                        proceedings on the basis that forum X is clearly more appropriate than\n                        Singapore, while the plaintiff presents evidence that forum Y is clearly\n                        more appropriate than either X or Singapore (but neither the plaintiff nor\n                        the defendant is interested in litigating in Y). In principle, this does not\n                        affect the proposition that the court shouldprima\n                            faciestay the proceedings when the defendant has\n                        demonstrated that there is a clearly more appropriate and available forum\n                        elsewhere. 114    We were satisfied that, on a relative\n                    analysis, Indonesia was clearly a more appropriate forum than Singapore.\n                    Accordingly, stage one of theSpiliadaanalysis\n                    pointed firmly in favour of granting a stay of proceedings.",
        "Conclusion": "116    For the reasons set out above, it was clear\n                    that Indonesia was clearly and more distinctly the appropriate forum for the\n                    trial of the claims concerned. We therefore allowed the appeal with costs, and\n                    with the usual consequential orders. 117    We would also like to take this opportunity\n                    to commend both Mr Bull and Ms Gan for their clear arguments. In\n                    particular, neither sought to either exaggerate or even embellish their\n                    respective client’s cases but simply presented their arguments to this\n                    court in as cogent and as persuasive a fashion as possible."
