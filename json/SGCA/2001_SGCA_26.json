        "Essential facts": "3.    In order to better appreciate the issues in the present\n\nproceeding, there is a need to set out in brief the essential facts relating to the earlier\n\nconsolidated action. The story began at the end of the nineteen century when three brothers, Lee Wee\n\nKheng (Kheng), Lee Wee Nam (Nam) and Lee Wee Kiat (Kiat) left their village in Canton, China to seek\n\ntheir fortune here. Their father, Lee Hum Chye, came to Singapore in 1917 and in the following year\n\nhe gave his savings to the three sons and also set up a family fund called \"Sze Teck Tng Chye\n\nKee\" (STTCK). Lee Hum Chye died shortly thereafter. The businesses of the three sons prospered.\n\nIn 1927, Kheng, Nam and Kiat decided to pool their resources and established a partnership, Wee Kee\n\nKongsi (the Kongsi). STTCK was given a share in the Kongsi. Later in the same year, Kiat died. The\n\nbusiness of the Kongsi continued to prosper. In October 1940, the estate of Kiat relinguished its\n\ninterest in the Kongsi by way of a deed of release. After the death of Kiat, the shares in the\n\nKongsi were redistributed in the following proportions:-Kheng 9/21Nam 8/21STTCK 4/21We should add that even after the deed of release, his estate was treated as\n\nhaving an equal share in STTCK, as the deed did not relate to anything due to Kiat under STTCK.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of the present proceeding, nothing on that is pertinent.4.    In February 1950, Kheng and Nam incorporated a company, Lee\n\nBrothers (Wee Kee) Ltd (Lee Brothers). All the immovable properties of the Kongsi and STTCK were\n\ntransferred to Lee Brothers.5.    In July 1962, Kheng died. In his Will, he appointed his two\n\nsons, Lee Hiok Kher (Kher) and Lee Hiok Hwee (Hwee) as his executors. We should add that long before\n\nhe died, Kheng spent much of his time in Bangkok. The businesses in Singapore of the Kongsi, as well\n\nas those of Lee Brothers, were managed by Nam.6.    After the death of Kheng, the businesses of the Kongsi and\n\nLee Brothers continued as before. In January 1964, Nam died, having appointed his two sons, Lee Hiok\n\nTng (Tng) and Lee Hiok Woon (Woon) as his executors.7.    Neither Nam, before his death, nor his executors, after his\n\ndeath, rendered any account to the executors and trustees of Kheng in relation to the assets of the\n\nKongsi. However, it is clear that in law, upon the death of Kheng, the partnership in the Kongsi was\n\ndissolved. The surviving partner or partners should wind up the affairs of the partnership and\n\ndistribute its assets to those who were entitled thereto. Indeed, the records would show that Nams\n\nexecutors and trustees were not even helpful towards Khengs executors and trustees, who were then\n\nseeking to ascertain the assets of the Kongsi.8.    As a result, two actions (S 1401/73 and S 2457/81) were\n\ncommenced by some of the beneficiaries of the Kheng estate (sons and grandsons of Kheng hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the \"S & G of Kheng\") against the executors and trustees of the Kheng\n\nestate as well as of the Nam estate. Eventually, both the actions were consolidated and tried\n\ntogether.9.    In the consolidated action, the S & G of Kheng sued Tng\n\nand Woon as the executors and trustees of the estate of Nam for breaches of trust committed by Nam\n\nafter the death of Kheng in, inter alia, failing to wind up the partnership business, and in failing\n\nto give an account of the partnership business to the estate of Kheng. The S & G of Kheng also\n\nsued Kwee and Kher as the executors and trustees of the Kheng estate for failing to get in the\n\nassets belonging to the Kheng estate. During the course of the trial of the consolidated action, the\n\nplaintiffs and the executors and trustees of the estate of Kheng reached a settlement and,\n\naccordingly, no further reliefs were sought against the executors and trustees of Kheng. So what\n\nremained of the consolidated action for which the High Court had to decide were, in the main,(i) whether Nam had acted in breach of trust upon the death of Kheng, in\n\n  respect of the partnership assets; and whether upon the death of Nam, the latters executors and\n\n  trustees had similarly acted in breach of trust;(ii) whether the executors and trustees of the Nam estate were liable to\n\n  restore to the Kongsi certain specified shares, including 12,240 OCBC shares, three lots of 125,\n\n  27 and 125 shares in OUB (at $100 par value each) and 378,000 UOB shares (hereinafter referred to\n\n  collectively as the \"undisclosed shares\").10.    We should add that in the consolidated action, the estate\n\nof Kheng had also made a counterclaim against the estate of Nam relating to the undisclosed shares.11.    In the course of the trial of the consolidated action, the\n\nestate of Nam conceded that the 378,000 UOB shares and one of the two 125 lots of OUB shares\n\nbelonged to the Kongsi. As regards the other three lots of undisclosed shares, the High Court in a\n\njudgment delivered in January 1992 (the 1992 judgment) held that they belonged to the Kongsi and the\n\nestate of Nam must account for the same. The court also held that Nam, as well as his executors and\n\ntrustees, had committed breaches of trust and ordered that an account be taken of the assets of the\n\nKongsi in respect of the period after the death of Kheng.",
        "Issues in the present action": "12.    The issues in the present OS concerns only the one lot of\n\n27 OUB shares. At the trial of the consolidated action, it was established, and also not disputed,\n\nthat all the movable properties (including stocks and shares) in Singapore belonging to the Kongsi\n\nwere registered in the name of Nam. It would appear that on 30 April 1962, Nam purported to give the\n\n27 shares to Tng as a gift by way of transfer. However, by virtue of the 1992 judgment, the\n\nexecutors and trustees of Nam had to restore those 27 shares to the Kongsi. Nevertheless, based on\n\nthe intention on the part of Nam to give Tng the 27 shares, Tng advanced the argument that the\n\nappropriate portion of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam (by virtue of his 8/21\n\nshareholding in the Kongsi and a share in STTCK) should be treated as having been given to Tng.\n\nTherefore, in April 1999, Tng and Woon, in their capacity as the executors/trustees of Nam,\n\ninstituted the present OS to seek the court's determination of the following two questions:-1. The determination of the rights of the parties with respect to the gift of\n\n  the 27 Overseas Union Bank (\"OUB\") shares from Lee Wee Nam to Lee Hiok Tng on or about\n\n  30thApril 1962 and more particularly the portion of the gift that Lee Wee Nam held a\n\n  beneficial interest through Wee Kee Kongsi and Sze Teck Tng Chye Kee.2. That it may be determined whether Lee Hiok Tng is entitled to an indemnity\n\n  and/or contribution in respect of all costs and expenses incurred by him pertaining to the said 27\n\n  OUB shares from the Estate of Lee Wee Nam.The defendant to the OS is Tng, in his personal capacity. For ease of reference,\n\nprayer 1 will be referred to as \"the gift question\" and prayer 2 \"the reimbursement\n\nquestion\".13.    Subsequently, in February 2000, Lee Siew Choon (Choon), Lee\n\nSiew Hong (Hong) and Lee Siew Ngung (Ngung), three beneficiaries of the Nam estate (hereinafter\n\ncollectively referred to as CHN) applied to intervene in the proceeding. They objected to the\n\napplication made by Nams executors and trustees on the ground that the application amounts to an\n\nabuse of the process of court as the issues had already been decided upon by the High Court in the\n\nconsolidated action.14.    As presented by counsel for Tng to the court below, the\n\ncourt needed to address and decide on the following issues on the gift question:-(i) whether the gift from Nam to Tng of the 27 shares, which belonged to the\n\n  Kongsi, were effective to convey to Tng the portion of those 27 shares owned by Nam through his\n\n  interest in the Kongsi.(ii) whether the transfer of the 27 shares by Nam to Tng raises the presumption\n\n  of advancement.15.    In an affidavit, filed in his personal capacity, Tng\n\ndeposed that his father, Nam, transferred the 27 shares to him as a gift and that his offer to pay\n\nhis father for the 27 shares was declined. He said he believed his father gave him those shares as\n\nan expression of his appreciation for all the assistance rendered by Tng to his fathers business\n\nin the previous thirty years. Following the transfer to him of those shares, Tng had taken up and\n\npaid for the rights issues originating from the 27 shares. OUB had also issued bonus shares. It\n\nwould appear that the original 27 shares, through the splitting of the par value of each share from\n\n$100 to $1, and through the declaration of bonus shares and rights issue over the years, had become\n\n125,564 shares, each of $1 par value.16.    On the other hand, CHN argued, inter alia, that by virtue\n\nof the High Court decision in the consolidated action declaring that the 27 shares belonged to the\n\nKongsi, Nam was holding those shares in trust for the Kongsi. CHN also pointed out that while in the\n\nconsolidated action, Tng did file a defence, he failed to turn up and testify to claim for the 27\n\nshares. Similarly, Woon too, did not elect to testify at that trial. In any event, any purported\n\ntransfer of the 27 shares would have been in breach of trust. In the light of the courts order\n\nthat the executors and trustees of the Nam estate restore, inter alia, the 27 shares back to the\n\nKongsi, CHN submitted that the principle ofres judicataor estoppel should apply to restrain\n\nthis re-litigation.",
        "Decision below": "17.    The judge below agreed with CHN and ruled that Tng was\n\nprecluded from re-litigating the issues sought in the OS. He said (though at times without clearly\n\nseparating Tngs personal capacity from his representative capacity):-\"Having considered the Affidavit evidence and all the submissions and the\n\n  Counsel of the 1stand 2ndPlaintiffs having conceded by agreeing that the\n\n  27 OUB shares formed part of the assets of Wee Kee Kongsi and the 1stand 2ndPlaintiffs having accepted the decision of Chao J on the issue of the ownership of the 27 OUB\n\n  shares, there was no doubt in my mind that the Defendant (in his personal capacity but the alter\n\n  ego of the 1stPlaintiff) was attempting to re-litigate the matter to the entitlement\n\n  of the 27 OUB shares. The Defendant had failed to pursue his claim in the trial before Chao J\n\n  after filing his defence by testifying and subjecting himself to cross-examination concerning his\n\n  claim or claims which Plaintiffs Counsel was now articulating.\"18.    After referring to the reasons given by the High Court, the\n\nCourt of Appeal and the Privy Council in the consolidated action on why the 27 shares belonged to\n\nthe Kongsi, the judge below concluded (at 18):-\"In my opinion therefore, the Defendant could not reassert his claim to\n\n  the 27 OUB shares to say that the several issues defined by the 1stand 2ndPlaintiffs Counsel as set out earlier had not arisen in the Consolidated Suit and claim that\n\n  there was as such no re-litigation of the issues here. The truth is the 1stPlaintiff\n\n  (the Defendant) and the 2ndPlaintiff could and should have raised the issue there as\n\n  they were Defendants to the Suit. They chose not to. The judgment of Chao J upheld by the Court of\n\n  Appeal and the Privy Council touching on the issue of the 27 OUB shares therefore operated both as\n\n  an estoppel by record and as an issue estoppel against the Defendant. Such judgment prevented both\n\n  the 1stPlaintiff who is also the Defendant and the 2ndPlaintiff from\n\n  denying or re-agitating the facts on which it is based. The only exception when a judgment does\n\n  not operate as such is when it is obtained by fraud or collusion which is plainly not the case\n\n  here. The proceeding by the 1stand 2ndPlaintiffs and the claim by the\n\n  Defendant was an abuse of the process of court.\"19.    The judge held that as the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi\n\nas a composite whole, there was no question of the lot of shares being split up although Nams\n\nestate would, in accordance with the partnership agreement, get 8/21 share of the 27 shares and Tngs\n\ninterest in the said share was only in his capacity as one of the beneficiaries of Nams estate.20.    As for the alternative remedy which Tng sought for\n\nreimbursement on the ground that he had expended money to take up rights issues in the belief that\n\nthe 27 shares were a gift to him and with no knowledge that the gift was in breach of trust, the\n\ncourt nevertheless held that that application must also fail. The judge felt that Tng and Woon,\n\nhaving failed to explain the position in the consolidated action, were bound by the decision in that\n\naction.Res judicata21.    The main question that arises for consideration in this\n\nappeal is whether the doctrine ofres judicatain the wider sense applied in the\n\ncircumstances of this case.22.    Thelocus classicusonres judicatain the\n\nwider sense may be found in the speech of Wigram V-C inHenderson v Henderson[1843] All ER\n\n378 where he expounded the following principles:-where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication\n\n  by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation tobring\n\n  forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same\n\n  parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matters whichmight have been\n\n  brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward,only\n\n  because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case.\n\n  The plea ofres judicataapplies, except in special cases,not only to points upon which\n\n  the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to\n\n  every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties,\n\n  exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time. (Emphasis added).23.    InTalbot v Berkshire County Council[1994] QB 290\n\nat 296 Stuart-Smith LJ clarified the two situations whereres judicataarises as follows:-The first relates to those points which were actually decided by the court;\n\n  this isres judicatain the strict sense. Secondly, those which might have been brought\n\n  forward at the time, but were not. The second is not a true case ofres judicatabut rather\n\n  is founded upon the principle of public policy in preventing multiplicity of actions, it being in\n\n  the public interest that there should be an end to litigation; the court will stay or strike out\n\n  the subsequent action as an abuse of process.24.    The two senses ofres judicataexpounded by Wigram\n\nV-C was accepted by the Privy Council in the Hong Kong caseYat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng\n\nBank Ltd & Anor[1975] AC 581 and by this court inNg Chee Chong v Toh Kouw[1999] 4 SLR 45andChing Mun Fong v Liu Cho Chit[2000] 1 SLR 51. InYat Tung Investment, Lord\n\nKilbrandon in referring to the extended sense ofres judicata, adopted very much the same\n\nlanguage as that of Wigram V-C:-where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of\n\n  adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that\n\n  litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances)\n\n  permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might\n\n  have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest .\"25.    It is clear that the true basis for the extended sense of\n\nthe doctrine ofres judicatais to be found in the concept of abuse of process of the court.\n\nIt is not in the public interest that in relation to a single matter there could be multiplicity of\n\nproceedings. InChing Mun Fong, this Court endorsed the following passage of Somervell LJ inGreenhalgh\n\nv Mallard[1947] 2 All ER 255 at 257:-res judicatafor this purpose is not confined\n\n  to the issues which the court is actually asked to decide, but  it covers issues or facts which\n\n  are so clearly part of the subject matter of the litigation and so clearly could have been raised\n\n  that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new proceeding to be started in\n\n  respect of them.26.    But in determining whether a case falls within the scope ofres judicatain the extended sense, this Court inNg Chee Chongnoted that great care\n\nshould be exercised as it would amount to shutting out a subject of litigation. There, this court\n\nrelied in particular, the following sentiments of Gibson J inLawlor v Gray[1984] 3 All ER\n\n345 at 352.The words of the Vice Chancellor (inHenderson v Henderson) ought not to\n\n  be treated like the words of a statute and no doubt it is right to construe them in a\n\n  non-technical common sense way. But it should always be borne in mind that what is sought by the\n\n  party claiming the estoppel is the shutting out of a matter not previously pronounced on expressly\n\n  in the earlier litigation from the determination of the court.27.    Before us, Tng made it clear at the outset that by raising\n\nthe gift question in the OS he is not seeking to go behind the 1992 judgment, which was upheld by\n\nthis Court and the Privy Council. He emphasised that what was basically decided in the 1992 judgment\n\nrelated to certain assets of the Kongsi, and, in the process, the court had to determine whether\n\nNam, and later his executors and trustees, had committed breaches of trust. The true object of the\n\nconsolidated action was to determine the extent of the assets of the Kongsi. Having decided that,\n\nthe court had to make a number of consequential orders.28.    One of the essential conditions, which must be satisfied\n\nbeforeres judicatacan arise is that there should be identity of parties. It would be clear\n\nfrom the background given above that there were three sets of parties in the consolidated action.\n\nFirst, there were the S & G of Kheng, beneficiaries under the Kheng estate, who instituted the\n\ntwo actions which were consolidated. Second, there were Tng and Woon, both being sued in their\n\nrepresentatives, as well as in their personal, capacities. Third, there were Kwee and Kher also\n\nbeing sued in both their representative and personal capacities. Though originally the S & G of\n\nKheng had sued Kwee and Kher for failing in their duties as executors/trustees of the Kheng estate,\n\nby the time the trial of the consolidated action came on, the two sides had resolved their\n\ndifferences and the S & G of Kheng had abandoned their claim against Kwee and Kher. Thereafter,\n\nthey stood on the same side as Kwee and Kher, who were parties to the action, both in their\n\nrepresentative as well as their personal capacities. The battle lines drawn was between the Kheng\n\nestate on the one side and the Nam estate on the other.29.    In the instant OS, the plaintiffs are Tng and Woon in their\n\ncapacity as executors and trustees of the Nam estate. The defendant is Tng in his personal capacity.\n\nThe interveners, CHN, are the beneficiaries under the Nam estate. While CHN were not parties to the\n\nconsolidated action, Tng and Woon, in their representative capacity, were. As CHN claim their\n\ninterest through Tng and Woon in their representative capacity, CHN will be deemed to be privy to\n\nthe consolidated action. Thus, the condition of identity of parties is fulfilled.30.    We now turn to consider whether the condition relating to\n\nthe identity of subject matter is satisfied in this case. There can be no doubt thatres judicatain the strict sense cannot apply. The question is whetherres judicatain the extended sense\n\ncould. The issues which Tng now in his personal capacity wishes to put before the court were clearly\n\nnot before the court in the consolidated action. The only question that remains is whether these\n\nissues can be considered to be issues which \"belonged to the subject of litigation\" in the\n\nconsolidated action. We would reiterate that the primary issue in the consolidated action was in\n\ndetermining whether certain shares, including the 27 shares, belonged to the Kongsi or to Nam\n\npersonally. In passing, we would add that the court there had also decided the question relating to\n\nthe scope of a particular settlement reached between the S & P of Kheng and the Nam estate.\n\nHowever, this aspect of the decision has no bearing whatsoever to the present OS.31.    To determine whetherres judicatain the extended\n\nsense applies to this OS, there is a need to consider the two questions raised therein, the gift\n\nquestion and the reimbursement question, separately, as the answers to both may not be the same. We\n\nshall first deal only with the gift question. Does that question, as now formulated by Tng, falls\n\nwithin \"the subject of litigation\" in the consolidated action? In our opinion, the answer\n\nis a clear negative. The gift question would concern only the beneficiaries of the Nam estate. It\n\nwould not be appropriate to raise it in the consolidated action. Indeed the gift question would only\n\narise if the court, as it did, ruled that the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi rather than to Nam\n\npersonally. In our judgment, it would not facilitate the orderly disposal of the consolidated action\n\nif the gift question was raised then. It would be premature. There is no question of multiplicity of\n\naction by allowing Tng to raise the gift question at this stage.32.    In the result we hold thatres judicatain the wider\n\nsense has no application to estop Tng from raising the gift question.",
        "Gift question on merits": "33.    We now turn to consider the gift question on its merits.\n\nThis can be disposed of fairly briefly. Tng contends that when his father Nam transferred the 27\n\nshares to him, Nam intended that transfer as a gift. Nam refused his payment for those shares. Tng\n\nsaid that although there was no written document under the hand of Nam evidencing that intention, it\n\nwas clear from all the background circumstances.34.    Even if we assume that what Tng now asserts is true, that\n\nNam intended the transfer as a gift, we still do not see how it could help Tngs claim. Obviously\n\nwhen Nam transferred the 27 shares to Tng, Nam was under the impression that the 27 shares were his\n\nbeneficially. With the 1992 judgment declaring that the 27 shares did not belong to Nam but to the\n\nKongsi, and that Nam acted in breach of trust when he transferred the 27 shares to Tng, the 27\n\nshares were not Nams to give. Indeed, the 1992 judgment declared that the 27 shares should be\n\nrestored to the Kongsi. The purported gift to Tng accordingly failed. In a portion of Tngs Case,\n\nhe seemed to be asking this Court to uphold his claim that the whole of 27 shares were a valid gift\n\nto him. We are unable to see how that contention could be made when the 27 shares did not even\n\nbelong to Nam.35.    It seems to us that what Tng now seeks to argue is that\n\nalthough Nam could not give to Tng all the 27 shares, but as Nam was the beneficial owner of some of\n\nthe 27 shares (by virtue of 8/21 share in the Kongsi and indirectly through STTCK), Nam must have\n\nalso intended to give to Tng that portion of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam in\n\nline with Nams share in the Kongsi. What Tng wants us to rule is that even though Nam was in no\n\nposition to give away the 27 shares to Tng as they belonged to the Kongsi, we could construe from\n\nsuch a purported gift of the 27 shares that there must have been an intention on the part of Nam to\n\ngive to Tng that part of the 27 shares which beneficially belonged to Nam. We do not think it would\n\nbe justified at all to make such an inference. As we view it, the two intentions are not consistent.\n\nAs it was Nams intention to give away all the 27 shares, one cannot infer from that that Nam\n\nwould also have the intention to give away only that part which beneficially belonged to Nam. This\n\nsecond scenario could not have entered into Nams mind. For there to be a gift, two elements must\n\nbe present: the intent to give and the precise subject matter to be given, to be followed by proper\n\nconveyance (e.g., land by deed and chattels by delivery). Here, both the elements are missing.",
        "Presumption of Advancement": "36.    We ought to mention that Tng has also made an argument\n\nbased on the presumption of advancement in view of the fact that there is no documentary proof of a\n\ngift. This presumption is essentially an evidential rule, based on relationship (e.g., husband and\n\nwife, father and son), to rebut the opposing presumption of a resulting trust where a transfer of\n\nproperty is made by one person to another without consideration. InTeo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew[1999] 4 SLR 560, this Court, after consideringPettitt v Pettitt[1970] AC 777, observed\n\nthat, in the context of husband and wife, the application of this presumption has diminished in\n\nrecent years in line with changing social norms. It also noted that the current approach is to treat\n\nthe presumption \"as an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence\n\nas to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of the thumb\".37.    An interesting question is whether the current approach\n\ntowards the presumption in the context of husband and wife should also be applied to the context of\n\nfather and son. We note that inShephard v Cartwright[1955] AC 431, a case where shares\n\nacquired by a father was registered in the name of a child, Viscount Simonds said that:-Where a man purchases shares and they are registered in the name of a stranger\n\n  there is a resulting trust in favour of the purchaser; on the other hand, if they are registered\n\n  in the name of a child or one to whom the purchaser then stood in loco parentis, there is no such\n\n  resulting trust but a presumption of advancement. Equally it is clear that the presumption may be\n\n  rebutted but should not, as Lord Eldon said, give way to slight circumstances:Finch v Finch.38.    But inMcGrath v Wallis[1995] 2 FLR 114, the Court\n\nof Appeal extended the views of Lord Upjohn inPettitt v Pettitt (supra),namely, that the\n\npresumption of advancement in the context of husband and wife was readily rebutted by comparatively\n\nslight evidence, and applied it to the context of father and son. This could be viewed as a further\n\nshift in judicial attitude in the light of changing social conditions. However, for the purposes of\n\nthis case, there is no need for us to go further into that as we are of the view that whichever way\n\nthe presumption is applied, it will not be of any assistance to Tng, as the problems here are not\n\nthose related to the question of resulting trust but to problems of identification of the intention\n\nof the giver (Nam) and the objects which are the subject of that intention.39.    In the result, prayer 1 of the OS must fail.",
        "Reimbursement Question": "40.    We now turn to consider the second issue raised in the OS,\n\nnamely, that Tng should be entitled to be reimbursed by the Nam estate in respect of \"all costs\n\nand expenses incurred by him\" pertaining to the 27 shares or that the Nam estate should make a\n\ncontribution in relation thereto. The judge below ruled that Tng was barred from seeking\n\nreimbursement or contribution by reason ofres judicatain the extended sense.41.    In this regard, Tng relied uponRowley v Ginnever[1897] 2 Ch 503 where it was held that a constructive trustee of property who expended money in\n\nimproving what hebona fidelybelieved to be his own property, was held to be entitled to be\n\nrecouped of his expenditure, to the extent of the improved value.42.    On this reimbursement question we need to go back to the\n\n1992 judgment. There, the court besides declaring that the 27 shares belonged to the Kongsi, also\n\nmade an order in these terms:-\"6. An account of all bonus and rights issues which had been declared in\n\n  respect of the shares specified in paragraph 5 (which includes the 27 OUB shares) and all moneys\n\n  expended to take up the shares.\"43.    This order was made obviously in recognition of the fact\n\nthat moneys had been expended to take up additional OUB shares pursuant to rights issues (based on\n\nthe 27 shares). The matter had been decided upon and that was really it. If Tng, who was a party to\n\nthe consolidated action in his personal as well as his representative capacities, had complied with\n\nthat order he would have been reimbursed. But he did not, though he was bound by that order. In our\n\njudgment, res judicatain the strict sense applied to estop Tng from pursuing the matter\n\nagainst the Nam estate of which he is an executor and trustee. In any event, there is no basis upon\n\nwhich he may make a claim against the Nam estate on account of expenditures incurred on behalf of\n\nthe Kongsi.44.    In passing we would like to observe that there is one\n\nfurther difficulty in the way of this claim by Tng. There is no evidence that Tng had expended his\n\nown personal resources to take up the OUB rights issues.",
        "Judgment and costs": "45.    In the result, the appeal of Tng is dismissed with costs to\n\nthe 3rdto 5threspondents. However, as CHN have raised the defence ofres\n\njudicatain relation to prayer 1 of the OS and that has been held by us to be inapplicable, CHN\n\nshould not be awarded costs for work done in relation thereto. Taking a broad view, we hold that CHN\n\nshould only be given  costs.46.    With regard to the costs of Tng and Woon in their\n\nrepresentative capacity (1stand 2ndrespondents), we note that the court\n\nbelow did not grant them any costs. No appeal on that was lodged by Tng and Woon. However, CHN, in\n\ntheir Case, challenged the correctness of that order. They argued that the costs of Tng and Woon in\n\ntheir representative capacity should be paid by Tng personally, as the whole proceeding was brought\n\nabout by Tng pursuant to his personal interest. While there are some merits in this point, as the\n\npersonal interest of Tng is different from that of Tng and Woon in their representative capacity,\n\nand as the effect of the order that there be no order on costs in favour of Tng and Woon in their\n\nrepresentative capacity would mean that such costs would have to be borne ultimately by the\n\nbeneficiaries, we are nevertheless unable to consider this argument because CHN have not filed any\n\nnotice of appeal, preceded by an application for leave as required by s 34(2)(b) of the Supreme\n\nCourt of Judicature Act, against that order on costs.47.    However, for this appeal, Tng and Woon, as executors and\n\ntrustees of the Nam estate shall be entitled to the costs thereof, to be paid by Tng personally. Of\n\ncourse, the actual quantum of the costs to be allowed to Tng and Woon in this capacity would have to\n\nbe assessed by the Registrar, taking into account the work done in relation thereto."
