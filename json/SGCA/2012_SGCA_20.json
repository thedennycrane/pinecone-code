        "Introduction": "1       This\nwas an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”)\nin Originating Summons No 118 of 2011 (“the Singapore Action”): seeSetClear Pte Ltd and others v Ashlock William Grover[2011] SGHC 130 (“the\nGD”) where he ruled in favour of the plaintiffs on the construction\nof an agreement and in consequence thereof he issued an anti-suit\ninjunction against the defendant. In the Singapore Action, William\nGrover Ashlock (“the Appellant”) was the defendant while SetClear\nPte Ltd, CLSA Limited, SetClear Inc, Credit Agricole Securities\n(USA) Inc (Formerly known as Caylon Securities (USA) Inc) and IX\nNet Holding Limited (individually the “1stRespondent”,\n“2ndRespondent”, “3rdRespondent”,\n“4thRespondent” and the “5thRespondent”\nrespectively, and collectively “the Respondents”) were the plaintiffs. 2       The\nappeal was heard on 24 October 2011. After hearing submissions of\nthe parties, we dismissed the appeal with costs. We now give the\ngrounds for our decision.",
        "The background to the dispute": "3       In\nAugust 2005, the Appellant, together with one Jonathan Slone (“Slone”),\nwere  the co-founders of a start-up business operated in New York\nby the 5thRespondent. Although Slone\nand the Appellant each initially held 50% of the equity shares in\nthe 5thRespondent, their equity shareholding\nwas, for reasons which were immaterial to this appeal, subsequently\ndiluted and agreed to be not less than 4% each (“the Founder’s Equity”\nor, interchangeably, “the founder benefits”).[note: 1]The 2ndRespondent subsequently\ninvested in the 5thRespondent’s business\non terms that Slone would be in the 2ndRespondent’s\nemployment while at the same time retaining his equity shares in\nthe 5thRespondent. 4       In\nMarch 2006, the Appellant was designated as Chief Operating Officer\nof the 5thRespondent and concurrently\nseconded to the 4thRespondent in New\nYork.[note: 2]In a letter from\nthe 1stRespondent dated 10 May 2007,\nthe Appellant was offered to come under the employment of the 1stRespondent.[note: 3]The Appellant accepted the\noffer, as a result of which the Appellant re-located to Singapore\nbut continued to shuttle between Singapore and New York from time\nto time. One of the provisions in the said letter stated: Founder Status:In\nlight of your [ie, the Appellant’s]\neffort and contribution to the initial set up and establishment of\nthe [1stRespondent], you will be recognised\nas one of its founders and be eligible for consideration for additional\n“founder” benefits, if any, subject to negotiation with Bloomberg\nTradebook. and on terms to be mutually agreed between you and the [1stRespondent].   5       In\nhis first affidavit filed in the Singapore Action, the Appellant averred\nthat the provision for “Founder Status” in the letter served to reiterate\nhis original entitlement to the Founder’s Equity.[note: 4]The Respondents,\nhowever, claimed that no agreement was reached or even alleged to\nbe reached between the Appellant and the 1stRespondent\nas to the founder benefits.[note: 5] 6       In\nor around late June 2008, the Appellant was put on a few weeks’ “leave”\nafter a disagreement arose between him and Slone on certain plans regarding\nthe 1stRespondent’s business. On 17 July\n2008, while the Appellant was on “leave”, he was asked to meet one\nMr Laurie James Young (“Young”) who was then Acting on behalf of\nthe 1stRespondent. At the meeting, the\nAppellant and Young signed an agreement providing for the cessation\nof the Appellant’s employment with the 1stRespondent\n(“the 17 July 2008 Agreement”).[note: 6]Clause 14\nof the 17 July 2008 Agreement (“cl 14”) provided as follows: 14. Final\nSettlement By signing this letter and accepting the abovementioned payments,\nthis represents full and final settlement of all and any claims\nagainst [the 1stRespondent] and its\naffiliated companies. Additionally, it confirms that you [ie, the Appellant] agree not to pursue\nany future claim against [the 1stRespondent]\nand its affiliated companies. 7       Subsequent\nto the signing of the 17 July 2008 Agreement, the Appellant sent\nan email to Young on the same date stating:[note: 7] Laurie, I want to go on record with you that it\nis my understanding that by signing the resignation agreement today\nthat I am Acting in good faith that a subsequent agreement will\nbe reached in terms of my resignation with CLSA and insurance for\n2009 as well as my founder status. I signed the agreement believing\nthat Section 14 does not preclude an agreement or possible Actions should\nwe not be able to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this understanding\ndiffers from yours. Regards, Bill To which Young replied:[note: 8] Bill, Sorry for the delay in responding; I was\ntravelling back to Hong Kong. I believe our conversations over the last\nfew days have been conducted in a very constructive and cordial\nmanner. I will continue to search for a mutually acceptable agreement\ncovering a future relationship with CLSA and medical coverage in\nthe US Clause 14 of the separation agreement must\nstand on its merits Bill as was the intention of the document you\nsigned. Have a good weekend Bill; I’ll be in touch\nwith you in the coming weeks. Laurie 8       The\nAppellant subsequently reaffirmed the terms and conditions set out\nin the 17 July 2008 Agreement by signing two letters (dated 9 October 2008\nand 28 February 2009) sent by the 1stRespondent.[note: 9]The letter dated 9 October\n2008 stated:[note: 10] Dear Bill, Further to our letter dated 17 July 2008,\nI am writing to confirm the following: •You\nwill remain on the SetClear Pte. Ltd. payroll through until 30 June 2009; •The Company will continue to reimburse\nyou the cost of maintaining your Cobra medical insurance up to and\nincluding 30 June 2009 as per Cobra Scheme rules. These additional arrangements are provided\nto you in good faith by the Company to assist you as you work through\nthis difficult period. We are proposing this strictly on condition\nthat you confirm that the terms and conditions which have been previously\nagreed by you, per your separation agreement dated 17 July 2008,\nremain in full force and effect and are re-confirmed by you. Yours sincerely, [signature] Toni Carroll For and on behalf of SetClear Pte. Ltd.  I hereby agree and accept the terms and\nconditions as set out above: [signature] Name: Mr. Bill Ashlock Date: 9       The\nletter dated 28 February 2009 stated:[note: 11] Dear Bill, Following your recent conversation with\nLaurie Young I am writing to confirm that your final day of employment\nwith SetClear Pte Ltd will be 28 February 2009. As agreed, your salary and benefits have\nbeen calculated and paid up to 31 December 2008 and you have been\non unpaid leave up to and including 28 February 2009. All other terms agreed with you and confirmed\nin our letters dated 17 July 2008 and 9 October 2008 remain unchanged. Yours sincerely, [signature] Toni Carroll For and on behalf of SetClear Pte Ltd   I hereby understand and agree to the terms\nand conditions that are set out above. Signed: [signature]    Date: 28/02/09 Bill Ashlock 10     On\n20 January 2010, the Appellant commenced proceedings (“the American\nAction”) against the Respondents and Slone in the United States District\nCourt, Southern District of New York (“the New York court”) claiming\n“violations of New York State Labor Laws, breach of contract, breach\nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment,\nquantum meruit, breach of fiduciary duty, promissory estoppel, constructive\ntrust, and for an Accounting”.[note: 12]Essentially,\nthe American Action was brought to seek relief in respect of the\nfounder benefits. 11     On\n17 February 2011, the Respondents commenced the Singapore Action\nwith the following prayers:[note: 13] 1.A\ndeclaration that the [Appellant] is not entitled, under a severance agreement\ndated 17 July 2008 entered into between the [1stRespondent]\nand the [Appellant] and reaffirmed by way of two letters from the\n[1stRespondent] to the [Appellant] dated\n9 October 2008 and 28 February 2009 (collectively the “Severance\nAgreement”), to bring any claim against the[1stRespondent\nand/or its affiliated companies, including but not limited to the\n2ndto 5thRespondents],\nin connection with and/or in relation to the [Appellant’s] employment\nand/or association with the [1stRespondent]\nand its affiliated companies, such claims including but not limited\nto a claim for “founder” benefits which the [Appellant] alleges\nwere conferred upon him by the [1stRespondent]\nand/or its affiliated companies; 2.A declaration that the [Appellant]\nbreached the Severance Agreement by commencing and maintaining Civil\nAction No. 10-CV-0453(GBD) against the [Respondents] in the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York (“US Proceedings”)\nin respect of the [Appellant’s] alleged “founder” benefits; 3.An order that the [Appellant] do pay\nthe [Respondents] damages to be assessed in respect of all costs,\nexpenses and losses incurred by the [Respondents] arising out of\nor in connection with the [Appellant’s] breach of the Severance\nAgreement; 4.An order restraining the [Appellant]\nfrom continuing the US Proceedings or commencing any further or\nother proceedings in the United States of America or elsewhere against\nthe [Respondents] in respect of his alleged “founder” benefits; 5.An order that the costs of and incidental\nto the application be paid by the [Appellant] to the [Respondents];\nand 6.Such further reliefs that [the High\nCourt] deems fit. 12     The\nJudge who heard the Singapore Action ordered prayers 1, 2 and 4 in\nterms and with costs fixed at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements.[note: 14]As regards prayer 4, the\nJudge further clarified that “[f]or the avoidance of doubt, nothing\nin these orders prohibits the [Appellant] from commencing or continuing\nany Action against Jonathan Slone”.[note: 15]As\na result of the Judge’s decision, the Appellant was restrained from\ncontinuing the American Action or commencing any further or other\nproceedings in the United States of America or elsewhere against\nthe Respondents in respect of the founder benefits. Dissatisfied\nwith the Judge’s decision, the Appellant appealed.",
        "The decision below": "13     In\nthe GD, the Judge dealt mainly with the issue of whether cl 14 should\nbe construed to mean that the Appellant had agreed thereunder not to\npursue any  claims in the future against the Respondents, including\nthe Appellant’s claim for the founder benefits in the American Action.\nThe Judge held that the terms of cl 14 were simple and clear and\nthat under it the parties had effected a full and final settlement\nof all claims by the Appellant against the Respondents. As such,\nthe former was not entitled to commence or continue with the American\nAction against the latter (see[36]of\nthe GD). Following from the construction which the Judge had placed\non cl 14, and as the Appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction\nof the Singapore courts, the Judge held that in those circumstances\nan anti-suit injunction should, generally speaking, be granted to\nenforce cl 14.",
        "The issues on appeal": "14     The\nAppellant relied on two main grounds in his appeal. First, the Appellant\ncontended that the Judge erred in his construction of cl 14. In particular,\nthe Appellant argued that:[note: 16] Readin the context of the [17 July 2008\nAgreement] as a whole, the reference in clause 14 is obviously only\nto claims arising from the employment relationship between the Appellant\nand the 1stRespondent. Where clause\n14 was intended to benefit more than just the 1stRespondent,\nthis was made clear by the express reference to the 1stRespondent’s\naffiliated companies. If it was intended by the parties that clause\n14 should have effect in respect of all claims, whether arising\nfrom the Appellant’s employment relationship or not, the parties\nwould have so provided in clear terms, as they did in respect of\nthe parties who are entitled to rely on clause 14. 15     Second,\nthe Appellant argued that given that the ultimate relief sought by\nthe Respondents in the Singapore Action was Actually an anti-suit injunction,\nthe Judge was wrong to begin his analysis of the matter with a determination\non thesubstantivereliefs prayed\nfor by the Respondents in the Singapore Action (see[11]above). Instead, the Judge\nin his analysis ought to have first directed his mind to the private\ninternational law principles applicable in respect of interlocutory\nanti-suit injunctions in the present case. This, the Appellant contended,\nwould lead to a result that is different from that arrived at by\nthe Judge in his decision. He also asserted that besides cl 14,\nthe Judge should also have considered other relevant factors,eg, the New York court was the natural\nforum for the dispute; while the Appellant’s employment contract\nprovided for jurisdiction before the Singapore courts, it was expressly\nstated to be non-exclusive; the 3rdand\n4thRespondents had submitted to the\njurisdiction of the New York court; and the delay in the institution\nof the Singapore Action and the failure of the Respondents to apply\nfor a stay of the American Action, was contrary to international\ncomity. 16     In\nlight of the arguments raised by the Appellant, the issues in the appeal\nwere essentially twofold: (a)     Whether\nthe Judge erred in his construction of cl 14; and (b)     Whether\nthe Judge was wrong to determine the case before him on its merits\nfirst before concluding as a matter of consequence that an anti-suit\ninjunction was justified.",
        "The decision": "",
        "Interpretation of cl 14": "17     Mr Kelvin\nTan (“Mr Tan”), Acting for the Appellant, raised a preliminary point\nin his written submissions that cl 14 was not apt for summary determination.\nIn particular, he contended that cl 14:[note: 17] ... cannot be properly interpreted summarily\nin an originating summons and needs to be interpreted at a full\ntrial having regard to the full evidence surrounding the making\nof the Agreement and the parties’ conduct. Given that the Agreement\nhas been long pleaded as a defence in the [American Action], the\ninterpretation of clause 14 ought to be tried in the [American Action]. 18     He\nfurther argued that cl 14 was not free of ambiguity such that it\nwas apt for summary determination in the Singapore Action which\nwas commenced by way of an originating summons. In that vein, Mr Tan\nalso pointed out that the preamble of the 17 July 2008 Agreement\nreferred to the cessation of the Appellant’s employment without\nany reference to the founder benefits. The preamble read:[note: 18] … Dear Bill, We write following recent discussions regarding\nyour resignation from employment with SetClear Pte Ltd … In consideration of your acceptance of\nthe terms within this letter,detailed below\nare the arrangements for your cessation of employment as mutually agreed: … [emphasis added] 19     Mr Tan\nthen drew our attention to the closing words of the 17 July 2008\nAgreement which only referred to the termination of the Appellant’s employment\nand payments associated thereof, without reference to the founder\nbenefits. This, he claimed, further demonstrated that the parties\nin signing the 17 July 2008 Agreement had not intended the scope\nof cl 14 to be as wide as the Respondents contended it to be. He\nunderscored the following closing words:[note: 19] In acknowledgement of the abovetermination and associated payments, please\nsign the duplicate of this letter and return to me. … [emphasis added] 20     Mr Tan\nalso alluded to the factual matrix leading up to, and subsequent\nto, the signing of the 17 July 2008 Agreement which he claimed rendered\na summary determination of the construction of cl 14 in the Singapore\nAction inapt. Accordingly, he argued that cl 14 ought to be determined\nat a full trial in the American Action instead. In his written submissions\nhe stated:[note: 20] 68.In the present case, it is submitted that this Honourable\nCourt should give due consideration to the matrix of facts leading\nup to and subsequent to the signing of the termination agreement. 69.The first set of relevant facts relates\nto the circumstances in which the Appellant became involved in the\nbusiness. In particular, the Appellant had only agreed to establish\nthe start-up with Slone if he was given equal equity participation\nby way of the Founder’s Equity. Subsequently, even when the Appellant\nentered into an employment relationship with the 5thRespondent,\nthe Appellant continued to maintain an equity interest in the business. 70.Despite the Appellant’s subsequent\nentry into contracts of employment, the Appellant’s Founder’s Equity\nremained separate and distinct from his employment relationships\nwith the 5thRespondent and subsequently\nthe 4thand 1stRespondents. 71.Secondly, it is important to consider\nthe circumstances leading to the 17 July 2008 meeting when the Agreement\nwas entered into. The Appellant was on “leave” since his disagreement\nwith Slone and received a call from Young, who works for the Human\nResources Department of the 2ndRespondent,\nrequesting for the meeting. It was only natural for the Appellant\nto assume that this meeting concerned his employment with the 1stRespondent.\nTherefore, the Appellant signed the Agreement, believing that it\nwas applied to the termination of his employment, and not his Founder’s\nEquity. 72.Thirdly, consideration should be given\nto the fact that the discussions between the Appellant and Young,\nduring the time of the signing of the Agreement itself or over the\ncourse of the 6-month long e-mail, did not indicate that the Appellant’s\nclaim for his Founder’s Equity was to be subsumed within the ambit\nof clause 14. … 73.For the above reasons, it is respectfully submitted that there\nare real and substantial questions of law and fact in respect of\nwhether clause 14 of the Agreement provides a defence to the Appellant’s\nclaim or whether the Agreement only pertains to the Appellant’s\nemployment relationship with the 1stRespondent. 21     On\nthe other hand, counsel for the Respondents, Mr Alvin Yeo SC, argued\nthat the Judge was correct in interpreting cl 14 in the way he did\nand in holding that it precluded the Appellant from continuing the\nAmerican Action and/or commencing any further or other proceedings\nin the United States of America or elsewhere against the Respondents.\nThe primary basis for Mr Yeo’s case for the Respondents lay in the\nwords “full and final settlement ofall and\nany claims” and “not to pursueany\nfuture claimagainst SetClear Pte Ltd and its affiliated\ncompanies” [emphasis added] in cl 14 which undoubtedly indicated\nthat the Appellant’s alleged entitlement to the founder benefits\nwas within the knowledge of the 1stRespondent[note: 21]when setting out cl 14. This, among\nother things, Mr Yeo reasoned, demonstrated that the parties had\nunambiguously contemplated and intended cl 14 of to “achieve finality\nin settling all claims which the Appellant had or may have against\nthe Respondents” which would naturally include the Appellant’s claim\nfor the founder benefits.[note: 22] 22     We\ndo not propose to belabour what is very much a straightforward point.\nContrary to the Appellant’s submission, we agreed with the Respondents\nthat cl 14 was not ambiguous. On a plain reading of cl 14, it could\nnot have been clearer that it provided for the full and final settlement of\nall and any of the Appellant’s claims, future or existing, against\nthe Respondents. This would include whatever claims the Appellant\nmight have against each of the Respondents, irrespective of their\nnature. Another significant factor which was incompatible with the\nsubmission of the Appellant was that if it was indeed the case that\ncl 14 was concerned only with his entitlement or benefits in relation\nto his employment – and here we would note that his employment was\nwith the 1stRespondent – why would it\nalso cover “all and any claims” he might have against the other Respondents? 23     It\nseemed to us clear that the “matrix of facts” which Mr Tan had sought\nto rely in support of the Appellant’s case principally pertained\nto the Appellant’s subjective belief as to the Actual ambit of cl 14\n(see[20]above). As rightly\npointed out by Mr Yeo, a court in undertaking a contextual approach\nin the construction of a contract “does not inquire into the parties’\nsubjective states of mind but makes an objective judgment based\non the materials already identified”:[note: 23]seeBank\nof Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali and others[2002]\n1 AC 251 at 258. The “matrix of facts” brought up by Mr Tan were,\ntherefore, for the most part irrelevant. In the result, we did not\nsee any merit in the Appellant’s contention that a summary determination\non the ambit of cl 14 in the Singapore Action was inapt. 24     Accordingly,\nwe agreed with the Judge that this was a proper case for summary\ndetermination and that there was really nothing to go for trial.\nIn passing, we would only add that, while generally subsequent conduct should\nnot be relied upon to construe a document, in this case the Appellant’s\nacceptance of the two letters (see[8]-[9]above) certainly confirmed what,\nin our view, was the correct construction of cl 14. The propriety of the Judge’s\napproach in deciding the Singapore Action 25     We\nnow turn to consider the second issue. It was true that the Judge first\ndetermined the case before him on its merits before holding that,\nin consequence, an anti-suit injunction should be granted. To better appreciate\nthe approach of the Judge, we set out his reasoning below (see [41]-[42]\nof the GD): 41    In\nthe present case, [the Appellant] had agreed under cl 14 not to pursue\nany future claim against the [1stRespondent]\nand its affiliated companies. This was a consequence of the full\nand final settlement of all his claims... Moreover, the cases which\n[counsel for the Appellant] relied on were cases in which the court\nwas asked to grant an interlocutory anti-suit injunction to restrain\na party from proceeding with a foreign Action pending the outcome\nof the proceedings in the jurisdiction from which the injunction was\nsought. In the case before me, the plaintiffs [ie,\nthe Respondents] were not seeking an interlocutory anti-suit injunction\nbut a permanent one on the premise that the court would be able\nto and would make a finding in their favour on the interpretation\nof cl 14. 42    I agreed with [counsel for the Respondents]\nthat if I were to interpret cl 14 in the [Respondents’] favour,\nthen an anti-suit injunction ought, generally speaking, to be granted\nto enforce my ruling since [the Appellant] had submitted to the\njurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Indeed he is currently working\nin Singapore. The general rule is subject to [the Appellant] showing\na special or exceptional reason why the injunction should not be granted.\nNo such reason was shown. All [counsel for the Appellant] could\nsay was that the American Action was at an advanced stage but that\nwas no reason to allow [the Appellant] to continue with it once\na final ruling was given by a competent court whose jurisdiction\nhe had submitted to. In the light of my ruling on the interpretation\nof cl 14, the American Action against the [Respondents] was both\nin breach of cl 14 and vexatious and oppressive. 26     Clearly,\nthe Appellant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore\ncourts. The Appellant could have, but did not make any application\nfor a stay of the Singapore Action. Instead, he was content to enter\nhis appearance unconditionally and defend the Singapore Action in the\nhearing before the Judge. Coupled with the fact that the Respondents did\nnot make any application for aninterlocutoryanti-suit\ninjunction pending the final determination of the substantive matters\nengendered by the Singapore Action, this showed that the Judge was\nmerely dealing with the Singapore Action as per the manner it was\npleaded and contended by the Respondents. 27     Indeed,\nthere would have been little difficulty for this court to accept the\nAppellant’s complaint if the Respondents had Actually applied for\naninterlocutoryanti-suit injunction\nwhile the determination on the merits of the Singapore Action was\nstill pending. This is illustrated by the Australian case ofCSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd(1997)\n71 ALJR 1143 (HCA) (“CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance\nAustralia Ltd”), where the appellants had sued their\ninsurers, the respondents, in the United States of America claiming\nindemnity in respect of certain third-party asbestos claims brought\nagainst the appellants in the United States of America. In response, the\nrespondents commenced proceedings in New South Wales against the appellants\nseeking,inter alia, (a) negative\nsubstantive declarations to the effect that the respondents were\nnot liable to indemnify the appellants, and (b) permanent anti-suit\ninjunctions restraining the appellants from taking further steps\nin the American proceedings. However, the respondents later sought\nan interlocutory anti-suit injunction when the appellants applied\nfor a stay of the New South Wales proceedings subsequently. It was\nagainst such a backdrop that the High Court of Australia decided\nthe appeal applying the legal principles governing the grant of\ninterlocutory anti-suit injunctions. However, in the present case,\nthe Respondents had not applied for an interlocutory anti-suit injunction\npending the determination of the Singapore Action. 28     In\nthis regard, we would cite the following two passages from Steven Gee\nQC,Commercial Injunctions(Sweet\n& Maxwell, 5thEd,\n2004) at p 416 to show that the approach taken by the Judge is correct: The English [ie, domestic]\ncourt may grant an injunction to prevent a party bound by the res\njudicata or issue estoppel effect of an English judgment relitigating\nthe underlying dispute or issue abroad.This extends\nto litigating abroad matters which could and should have been litigated\nas part of the original Action.Granting an\nanti-suit injunction for this purpose both forwards an important\nEnglish public policy of preventing collateral attack on a final\njudgment by a disappointed litigant, and gives effect to a substantive right\nnot to be sued which has been created by the relevant judgment.\nThis is very different from an alternative forum case where the\nEnglish court has not yet rendered a judgment on the merits.On\nthe other hand inE.D. & F Man (Sugar)\nLtd v Haryanto (No. 2)the public policy was not so strong\nas to justify an injunction against a party relying in any court\nworldwide upon a foreign judgment which was inconsistent with an\nEnglish one. The granting of a declaration established the position\nin English law, whereas a worldwide injunction would have been an\nillegitimate intrusion on the processes of courts throughout the\nworld. The application can be made by application\nnotice issued in the original proceedings. This is becausethe purpose of the anti-suit injunction is in effect to\nuphold and enforce the judgment given in the Action. Proceedings\nto do this are within the scope of the original Action for which\nboth parties have submitted to the English jurisdiction.\nA Mareva injunction in aid of execution would be a matter within\nthe scope of the proceedings in which a final judgment had been\nobtained and this can be sought by application in those proceedings.\nIt is not necessary to bring separate proceedings for the purpose of\nenforcing the judgment or obtaining relief in aid of execution.Likewise where the purpose of the injunction is to\nprevent litigation abroad of a point covered by that judgment. [emphasis added; footnotes omitted] 29     It\nis also apposite to note that there is nothing irregular or improper in\nthe Respondents commencing the Singapore Action seeking (as an alternative\nstrategy to an outright anti-suit injunction application) a negative\ndeclaration of non-liability which in turn could lead to the grant\nof an anti-suit injunction in accordance with the views expressed\nin the passages quoted above. InHalsbury’s\nLaws of Singapore vol6(2) (Butterworths Asia, 2009)\nat para 75.140, it is stated: … Another alternative strategy is to pre-empt\nthe foreign judgment by obtaining a judgment (usually a declaration\nof non-liability) in another forum which will be recognised under\nthe law of the enforcing forum as creating ares\njudicataeffect between the parties. 30     In\nthe present case, the Respondents commenced the Singapore Actionafterthe Appellant instituted proceedings\nin the American Action which was still pending final determination\nin the United States (see[10]-[11]above). Despite this, not only\ndid the Appellant fail to take steps to challenge the local court’s\njurisdiction in the Singapore Action, he had made a conscious decision\nto participate in the hearing of the Singapore Action before the\nJudge. As observed earlier, the Appellant had chosen to resist the\nSingapore Action on the substantive and not the jurisdictional front\ndespite the fact that he could have pursued the latter course (see[26]above). It was not in dispute\nthat the Appellant had not taken out any stay of proceedings application\nin relation to the Singapore Action. 31     In\nour judgment, parties to a dispute who have entered into parallel proceedings\nin more than one national court take the risk of being bound by\nthe decision of the court which first renders its decision and,\nsubject to the rules on the doctrine ofres\njudicata, being barred by way of a permanent anti-suit\ninjunction from prosecuting further any pending proceedings in the\nother national courts once that decision is rendered. This is so\nregardless of whether the decision of the deciding court is appealable\nunder the laws of that country. In such a situation, the parties can\nonly either seek recourse via appellate review of the deciding court’s decision\nin that country or continue to be bound by the deciding court’s ruling\non the dispute. It would be highly unsatisfactory if the position\nwere to be otherwise as that would effectively spell no conclusive\nend to the resolution of disputes between parties embroiled in parallel\nproceedings in more than one national court. The grant of the anti-suit injunction\nfollowing the Judge’s construction of cl 14 32     Following\nfrom the above, it seemed to us entirely logical for the Judge,\nafter holding that cl 14 did preclude the Appellant from claiming against\nthe Respondents for the founder benefits, to proceed to grant the anti-suit\ninjunction in the present case. 33     At\n[40] of the GD, the Judge applied his mind to the principles applicable\nto the grant of anti-suit injunctions, having regard to the case\nofJohn Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v\nTrane US Inc and others[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 (“John Reginald Stott Kirkham”) and other\ncases cited therein. The fact that the Judge was conscious of those\nprinciples can be found in [42] of the GD where some considerations,\nreminiscent of those highlighted in what may be considered thelocus classicuson anti-suit injunctions\n(ie,Société\nNationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v Lee Kui Jak[1987] AC 871), could\nbe detected: 42    I\nagreed with [counsel for the Respondents] that if I were to interpret cl 14\nin the [Respondents’] favour, then an anti-suit injunction ought, generally\nspeaking, to be granted to enforce my ruling since [the Appellant] had\nsubmitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Indeed he\nis currently working in Singapore. The general rule is subject to\n[the Appellant] showing a special or exceptional reason why the\ninjunction should not be granted. No such reason was shown. All\n[counsel for the Appellant] could say was thatthe\nAmerican Action was at an advanced stagebut that was\nno reason to allow [the Appellant] to continue with it once a final\nruling was given by a competent court whose jurisdiction he had\nsubmitted to. In the light of my ruling on the interpretation of\ncl 14, the American Action against the [Respondents] was both in\nbreach of cl 14 andvexatious and oppressive. [emphasis added] 34     The\nquestion that remained was therefore whether there were any other\nreasons or grounds upon which the Judge should, nevertheless, not have\nexercised his discretion to grant the anti-suit injunction after\ndeciding on the merits in respect of cl 14. 35     One\nof the trite principles as regardsinterlocutoryanti-suit\ninjunction is that the court’s jurisdiction in respect of such remedies\nshould only be exercised sparingly and with great caution: seeHalsbury’s Laws of England vol2 (LexisNexis,\n5thEd, 2008) p 938 at para 1224;Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws\nvol1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 14thEd,\n2006) at pp 502-7. However, the principles governinginterlocutoryanti-suit injunctions do not\napply unmodified to cases where a permanent injunction is sought\nafter a judgment on the merits. InNational\nWestminster Bank plc v Utrecht-America Finance Co[2001]\nCLC 1372, the plaintiff in an Action in England complained,inter alia, that the defendant had initiated\nproceedings in California in breach of a contract (ie,\nthere was no alleged breach of an arbitration agreement or any jurisdiction\nclause). The judge at first instance made an order restraining the\nproceedings brought by the defendant in California. The defendant’s\nappeal to the English Court of Appeal was dismissed. In dismissing\nthe appeal, Clarke LJ (with whom Laws and Aldous LJJ agreed) stated\n(at[29]-[35]) the following which is necessary\nto be quoted at length: [After setting out the principles that\napply to the grant ofinterlocutoryanti-suit\ninjunctions] 29.    I\naccept that those are among the considerations which are relevant\nto the question whether an injunction should be granted at an interlocutory stage.\nI am also conscious of the principle stated by the Supreme Court\nof Canada inAmchem Products Inc v British\nColumbia (Workers Compensation Board)[1993] 1 SCR 897,\nwhich was quoted with approval by Lord Goff in the Airbus Industrie\ncase at p. 713; 139: ‘… the domestic court as a matter of comity\nmust take cognisance of the fact that the foreign court has assumed\njurisdiction. If, applying the principles relating to forum non\nconveniens … the foreign court could reasonably have concluded that\nthere was no alternative forum that was clearly more appropriate,\nthe domestic court should respect that decision and the application\nshould be dismissed.’ 30.It is common ground that those principles require\nsignificant modification where the foreign proceedings are brought\nin breach of an English jurisdiction clause because the English\ncourt will readily grant an injunction restraining a party from\ncommencing or continuing foreign proceedings which are in breach\nof contract: see e.g.Continental\nBank NA v Aeakos Compania Naviera SA[1994] 1 WLR 588,The Angelic Grace[1995] 1 Ll Rep 87 andDonohue v Armco Inc[2000] CLC 1090. Mr Brindle\nsubmitted that those principles have no application here because\nthe TOA does not contain an exclusive jurisdiction clause. 31.Equally, in my\nopinion, the principles identified above require significant modification\nin a case where a permanent injunction is sought after a judgment\non the merits. If the English court gives judgment for the claimant on\nthe merits and the judgment includes a declaration that the defendant\nhas brought foreign proceedings in breach of contract, and it is\nasked to exercise its equitable jurisdiction to grant a permanent\ninjunction to restrain a continued breach of contract by further\npursuing such foreign proceedings, different considerations arise\nfrom those which arise at an interlocutory stage. 32.Indeed it seems\nto me that the principles which then become applicable are very\nsimilar to those which apply in the case where an interlocutory judgment\nis sought on the ground that the foreign proceedings are in breach\nof contract. The relevant principles in that class of case can be\nseen from the judgments in The Angelic Grace [1995] 1 Ll Rep 87.\nAlthough that was a case in which the clause provided for arbitration\nin London and not for the exclusive jurisdiction of the English\ncourts, it is plain that the same principles apply to both classes\nof case.Thus inThe Angelic GraceLeggatt\nLJ (at p. 94) followed this statement of principle from the judgment\nof Steyn LJ inContinental Bank NA v Aeakos\nCompania Naviera SA(as reported in [1994] 1 Ll Rep 505 at\np. 512 — where the report is more accurate than in the WLR): ‘In our view the decisive matter is that\nthe bank applied for the injunction to restrain the defendants'\nclear breach of contract. In the circumstances, a claim for damages\nfor breach of contract would be a relatively ineffective remedy\nfor the defendants' breach of contract. If the injunction is set\naside, the defendants will persist in their breach of contract,\nand the bank's legal rights as enshrined in the jurisdiction agreements\nwill prove to be valueless. Given the total absence of special countervailing\nfactors, this is the paradigm case for the grant of an injunction\nrestraining a party from Acting in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction\nagreement. In our judgment the continuance of the Greek proceedings\namounts to vexatious and oppressive conduct on the part of the defendants.\nThe judge exercised his discretion properly.’ 33.    InThe Angelic Gracethis court rejected\nin robust terms the argument that the grant of an injunction to\nrestrain foreign proceedings which were in clear breach of contract\nwould offend against comity. It did so on the basis that it is vexatious\nand oppressive for a party to maintain proceedings in breach of\nits agreement not to do so: see e.g. per Leggatt LJ at p. 96. Millett\nLJ expressed his views in the following passages (at p. 86) which\nhave been much quoted since: ‘In my judgment, the\ntime has come to lay aside the ritual incantation that this is a\njurisdiction which should only be exercised sparingly and with great\ncaution. There have been many statements of great authority warning\nof the danger of giving an appearance of undue interference with\nthe proceedings of a foreign Court. Such sensitivity to the feelings\nof a foreign Court has much to commend it where the injunction is\nsought on the ground of forum non conveniens or on the general ground\nthat the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive but where\nno breach of contract is involved.In\nthe former case, great care may be needed to avoid casting doubt\non the fairness or adequacy of the procedures of the foreign Court.\nIn the later case, the question whether proceedings are vexatious\nor oppressive is primarily a matter for the Court before which they\nare pending. But in my judgment there is no good reason for diffidence\nin granting an injunction to restrain foreign proceedings on the\nclear and simple ground that the defendant has promised not to being[sic]them. … I cannot accept the\nproposition that any Court would be offended by the grant of an\ninjunction to restrain a party from invoking a jurisdiction which\nhe had promised not to invoke and which it was its own duty to decline. … In my judgment, where an injunction is\nsought to restrain a party from proceeding in a foreign Court in\nbreach of an arbitration agreement governed by English law, the English\nCourt need feel no diffidence in granting the injunction, provided\nthat it is sought promptly and before the foreign proceedings are\ntoo far advanced. I see no difference in principle between an injunction\nto restrain proceedings in breach of an arbitration clause and one\nto restrain proceedings in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause\nas inContinental Bank NA v Aeakos Compania\nNaviera SA, [1994] 1 WLR 588. The justification for the grant\nof the injunction in either case is that without it the plaintiff\nwill be deprived of its contractual rights in a situation in which\ndamages are manifestly an inadequate remedy. The jurisdiction is,\nof course, discretionary and is not exercised as a matter of course,\nbut good reason needs to be shown why it should not be exercised\nin any given case.’ 34.    InDonohue v Armco[2000] CLC 1090 Stuart-Smith\nLJ adopted those principles, although he said that he thought that\nwe should adhere to the expressions ‘strong cause’ or ‘strong reason’\nrather than good reason.I should add that\nit seems to me that the English court should not feel diffidence\nin granting such an injunction in order to restrain a breach of\ncontract whether or not it would be the duty of the foreign court\nto decline jurisdiction. 35.    Those principles apply to the granting\nof an interlocutory injunction to restrain foreign proceedings which\nare brought in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Mr Brindle\ncorrectly submitted that in this case cl. 8.2(d) is not an exclusive\njurisdiction clause. However, once it is held that Utrecht were\nin breach of the TOA in commencing the Californian proceedings and that\nthey remain in breach of the TOA in continuing to pursue them, as\nheld by the judge, it seems to me that essentially the same principles\napply. Thus it would be vexatious to allow Utrecht to continue its\nbreach in circumstances where damages would not be an adequate remedy.\nAs Millett LJ put it, there is no good reason for diffidence on\nthe clear and simple ground that Utrecht promised not to do what\nit is now doing. I can see no reason in principle why comity should\nstand in the way of the granting of an injunction. [emphasis added] 36     Having\nregard to the foregoing and the reasons given by the Judge at [41]-[42]\nof the GD, we did not see anything to suggest that the Judge had erred\nin his decision to grant the anti-suit injunction after deciding\non the underlying merits of the Singapore Action. 37     For\ncompleteness, we wish to add that even assuming that the principles\ngoverning the grant ofinterlocutoryanti-suit\ninjunctions were to be appliedunmodifiedin\nthe present case, the grant of the anti-suit injunction would be\njustified. The general principles governing the grant ofinterlocutoryanti-suit injunctions are\nset out at[35]above and\nwill not be repeated here. As far as local authorities are concerned,\nthe position has been established by this Court inJohn\nReginald Stott Kirkhamat[28]-[29]where the approach taken by\nthe High Court inEvergreen International SA v\nVolkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457\nat[16](“Evergreen\nInternational SA”) was approved: 28    InEvergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore\nPte Ltd[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457 (\"Evergreen\nInternational SA\"), Belinda Ang Saw Ean J (\"Ang J\") stated\nthat she had to consider the following elements in determining whether\nan anti-suit injunction ought to be granted in the case (at [16]): (a)    whether\nthe defendants are amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore\ncourt; (b)    the natural forum for resolution of\nthe dispute between the parties; (c)    the alleged vexation or oppression\nto the plaintiffs if the foreign proceedings are to continue; and (d)    the alleged injustice to the defendants\nas an injunction would deprive the defendants of the advantages\nsought in the foreign proceedings. 29    In\nour view, this is as good a list as any with only one qualification, which\nwould constitute a fifth element - whether the institution of the\nforeign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties\n(seeSouth Carolina Insurance Co v Assurantie\nMaatschappij \"De Zeven Provincien\" NV[1987] AC 24).\nWhere there is such an agreement, the court may not feel diffident\nabout granting an anti-suit injunction as it would only be enforcing a\ncontractual promise and the question of international comity is\nnot as relevant (seeThe Angelic Grace[1995]\n1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 96 andWSG Nimbus Pte Ltd\nv Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1088 at\n[91]). However, as far as the present case was concerned, this element\ndid not come into play as there was no such agreement between the\nparties. That said, we will now examined each of these elements\nin relation to the facts and circumstances of the present case,\nalthough one could say that the third and fourth elements are really\nquite closely related, being two sides of the same coin. 38     In\nline with the approach elaborated inJohn Reginald\nStott Kirkhamquoted above, we also saw a preponderance\nof factors which weighed in favour of granting an anti-suit injunction\nin our present case. These factors were: (a)     The\nAppellant was at the material time amenable[note: 24]to\nthe jurisdiction of the local courts because he was working in Singapore\nat the time the Singapore Action was commenced. Further, the Appellant\nhad submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts by not\nmaking any application for a stay of that Action; (b)     There\nwere strong reasons to believe that the natural forum for the resolution\nof the underlying dispute between the Appellant and the Respondents\nwas Singapore given that (i) the 1stRespondent\nwas a company incorporated in Singapore and the Appellant was stationed in\nSingapore while he was employed by the 1stRespondent;[note: 25](ii) the 17 July 2008 Agreement was\ndiscussed and signed in Singapore;[note: 26](iii) the\nAppellant was residing in Singapore;[note: 27](iv) there\nwas a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Singapore\ncourts under the letter from the 1stRespondent\ndated 10 May 2007 which was linked to the 17 July 2008 Agreement;\nand (v) the governing law in respect of the matters covered in the\nletter dated 10 May 2007 was expressed to be Singapore law (see[33]of the GD); (c)     There\nwould be vexation or oppression to the Respondents if the American\nAction were to continue because the American Action would, for the\nreasons stated at[17]-[24]above indicating that the Appellant\nhad breached cl 14 by commencing the American Action, likely be\n“bound to fail”: seeDicey, Morris and Collins\non the Conflict of Laws vol1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 14thEd,\n2006) at pp 504-5; (d)     The\nAppellant had not pointed out any potential advantage sought in\nthe American Action which he would be deprived of if the anti-suit\ninjunction were to be granted; (e)     Contrary\nto what the Appellant submitted, the American Action was not at\nan advanced stage. No doubt certain interlocutory motions arising\nfrom the American Action had already been argued before in the United\nStates of America and discovery was already underway in the American\nAction,[note: 28]the trial had yet commenced.\nFurthermore, the Appellant had, so far, still not effected service\nof the legal documents on the 1stand\n5thRespondent in respect of the American Action;\nand (f)     An\nanti-suit injunction in the present case would not, strictly-speaking,\noffend against the notion of international comity because the injunction\nwould effectively be no more than anin personamorder\nmade against the Appellant following his breach of a specific contractual\npromise encapsulated in cl 14: seeBank of\nAmerica National Trust and Savings Association v Djoni Widjaja[1994] 2 SLR(R) 898\nat[11]and[24]andThe\nAngelic Grace[1995] 1 Ll Rep 87 quoted in[35]above.",
