        "The prosecution’s case": "2.    The evidence adduced by the prosecution was this.\n\nOn 22 December 1999, at about 9.30 am, SSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah binte Rahim of\n\nthe Central Narcotics Bureau (‘CNB’) were keeping observation at the vicinity of\n\nBlock 137 Yishun Ring Road. At about 12.25 pm, Salam was spotted by the officers at the\n\nvoid deck of Block 137, and was seen leaving and taking a taxi. The officers trailed the\n\ntaxi to Jurong West Street 41, where he alighted. He was then seen walking to a shop at\n\nthe void deck of Block 486, where he bought something, and thereafter he was seen walking\n\nto Block 489. There, he took the lift to the sixth floor and upon coming out he was seen\n\nwalking along the corridor and taking the staircase to the third floor. In Block 489, the\n\nlift does not stop at the floors, from the second to the fifth, but at the sixth floor. At\n\nthe third floor, Salam was seen entering a flat, which subsequently was ascertained to be\n\n#03-37 of Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1.3.    At about 2.05 pm, Suboh was seen by the CNB\n\nofficers arriving at the vicinity of Block 489 in a taxi. He was later seen walking along\n\nthe corridor on the sixth floor and taking the staircase down to the third floor and\n\nentering the flat #03-37.4.    At about 2.15 pm, a Malaysian vehicle bearing the\n\nnumber plate JDF 755 was seen entering the car park and parking in front of Block 489. The\n\ndriver was seen alighting from the car, and he was Wong. He went to the void deck and was\n\nseen using his handphone and thereafter returning to his car for a short while. He was\n\nnext spotted carrying a blue plastic bag, waiting at the lift landing of Block 489 and\n\ntaking the lift up. A short while later the officers saw a person walking along the common\n\ncorridor on the sixth floor to the left staircase and going to the third floor and then\n\nstanding outside the flat #03-37 for a few minutes. Thereafter, that person was seen\n\ntaking the same route back to the sixth floor. Subsequently, Wong was seen coming out of\n\nthe lift on the ground floor, and this time he was empty-handed. He then moved his car to\n\nanother parking lot. A short while later, he drove off. He was trailed by CNB officers and\n\nat the junction of Upper Thomson Road and Marymount Lane he was stopped and arrested.5.    At about 3.15 pm, Salam and Suboh were seen\n\nleaving the flat. As they emerged from the lift on the ground floor of Block 489, they\n\nwere arrested. A body search was conducted on both of them. There were found on Suboh,\n\namong other things, ten sachets of heroin, a bunch of three keys, a Motorola pager and a\n\nPanasonic handphone. Nothing incriminating was found on Salam. Both of them were brought\n\nup to the flat and two of the keys found on Suboh were used to open the padlock to the\n\ngate and the main door of the flat respectively. The flat was searched and in the front\n\nbedroom behind a cupboard, the CNB officers found a green plastic bag, and inside it was a\n\nblue plastic bag which contained the following:(a) five bundles of granular substance in a plastic bag which were\n\n  wrapped in cellophane;(b) a digital weighing scale;(c) a red plastic bag containing: (i) five plastic spoons, (ii)\n\n  numerous empty plastic sachets, (iii) a pencil and a roll of scotch tape, and (v) twelve\n\n  sachets of heroin.Upon analysis, the ten sachets found on Suboh were proved to contain\n\nnot less than 6.16 grams of diamorphine, and the five bundles and twelve sachets seized\n\nfrom the flat to contain not less than 165.67 grams of diamorphine. The diamorphine\n\ncontents of the sachets and bundles were not in issue.6.    At about 7.20 pm, on the same day, urine samples\n\nwere taken from both Salam and Suboh, and sent to Department of Scientific Services for\n\nanalysis. Salam’s sample tested positive for heroin.7.    A search was also carried out by the CNB officers\n\nat the respective addresses where Salam and Suboh lived, namely, Block 137 Yishun Ring\n\nRoad, #04-176, and Block 407 Clementi Avenue 1 #02-50. But nothing incriminating was found\n\nin either of the flats.8.    After Wong was arrested a search was carried out\n\non him and among the things found were: his passport, a yellow Ericson GF 768 handphone, a\n\ngrey Nokia 3210 handphone, cash of S$170 and MR840. His car was also searched. A brown\n\nenvelope containing S$9,500 and another brown envelope containing S$24,950 were found\n\nunderneath the front passenger seat. Between the driver’s seat and passenger seat\n\nwere found, among other things, a Nokia handphone battery, S$103.65 and MR63.20. Wong\n\nadmitted ownership of all these items.9.    Statements were recorded from three of them under\n\ns 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 ed), and as there was no challenge\n\nto these statements, they were admitted in evidence. In their respective statements, they\n\nsaid as follows. Salam said:The thing is not mine. I have nothing to do with the house.Suboh said:I have nothing to say right now.And Wong said as follows:I did not give the heroin to the two Malay men. I only collected money\n\n  from a Malay man whom I do not know.There were also statements recorded from Salam and Suboh under s 121 of\n\nthe Criminal Procedure Code, and these statements were also admitted in evidence, as there\n\nwas no challenge as to the voluntariness of these statements. In these statements each of\n\nthem exonerated himself and implicated the other, and the learned judge did not take into\n\nconsideration those portions of these statements. For our purpose, nothing turns on these\n\nstatements.10.    There were also recorded from Wong statements\n\nunder s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘s 121 statements’). The\n\nadmissibility of these statements was challenged by Wong on the ground that the recording\n\nofficer threatened to assault him and at the same time offered him an inducement. The\n\nlearned judge held a voire dire to determine the admissibility of these statements, and at\n\nthe conclusion held that the prosecution had proved that the statements were made by Wong\n\nvoluntarily. Accordingly, these statements were admitted in evidence. Parts of these\n\nstatements are relevant in this appeal, and we shall refer to them in a moment.Block 489 Jurong West Avenue 1, #03-3711.    Neither Salam nor Suboh was the owner or tenant\n\nof the flat, Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1, #03-37. The registered owners are Hazlie bin\n\nDolwahab (‘Hazlie’) and his wife, Sarimah binte Rahmat. At the material time,\n\nthey were not residing at the flat. They had moved out to Hazlie’s parents’\n\nflat, Block 517A Jurong West Street 52, #13-555. Prior to their move, Hazlie’s three\n\nbrothers were also staying at the flat #03-37 of Block 489, and they had also moved to\n\ntheir parents’ flat at Jurong West Street 52. Hazlie said that since he and his\n\nfamily had moved out, he had never been back to the flat at Jurong West Avenue 1, except\n\nthat occasionally he went back to collect his personal items. The last time he visited the\n\nflat was in October 1999.12.    Hazlie’s youngest brother is Hazafi bin\n\nDolwahab (‘Hazafi’). Hazafi knew Suboh, having met him at the Reformative\n\nTraining Centre in 1995 and in Changi Prison in 1996. After Hazafi had been released from\n\nthe prison, Suboh met up with him and they had a drink together at a coffee shop in Haig\n\nRoad. Suboh had also visited Hazafi on three occasions at the flat at Block 489, Jurong\n\nWest Avenue 1, #03-37, while he and his family were staying there, before they moved to\n\nhis parents’ flat at Block 517A, Jurong West Street 52, #13-555. Initially, in his\n\nevidence, Hazafi said that he did not give Suboh the key to the flat; nor had he lost or\n\nduplicated it. Later, while the trial was in progress, the learned judge directed the\n\nprosecution and defence to test the three keys recovered from Suboh, and it was found that\n\none of the keys could open the front gate of Hazafi’s father’s flat. On account\n\nof this fresh evidence, Hazafi was recalled, and on being confronted with this evidence,\n\nhe admitted that he gave the keys to Suboh, as the latter wanted a place to stay. However,\n\nthroughout his evidence, Hazafi maintained that he did not know Salam at all. On this the\n\nlearned judge found that Hazafi had never vacillated.",
        "Salam’s evidence": "13.    Salam gave evidence in his defence. He denied any\n\nknowledge of the drugs found in the flat and denied that he had the keys to the flat. It\n\nis not necessary to deal with his evidence, as nothing in this appeal turns on it.",
        "Suboh’s evidence": "14.    Suboh in his defence testified as follows. At\n\nabout 1 pm on 22 December 1999, Suboh received a call from Salam, asking him if he would\n\nlike to sell VCDs (Video Compact Discs). Suboh said he would, and Salam told Suboh to go\n\nto the flat, Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1, #03-37, and to whistle when he arrived\n\nthere.15.    Suboh went there by taxi. Upon his arrival, he\n\nwhistled and Salam opened the door and invited him in. Salam produced a plastic bag with\n\nabout twenty samples of VCDs inside. The only title Suboh could remember during the trial\n\nwas ‘Kama Sutra’. Suboh also saw small sachets of drugs in the plastic bag. When\n\nhe asked to whom the drugs belonged, Salam said that he did not know and that the plastic\n\nbag was given to him by someone earlier. Suboh asked for some of the drugs for himself but\n\nSalam refused this request. Suboh nonetheless persisted in asking for them and took some\n\nfor his own use.16.    Thereafter, Suboh felt the need to move his\n\nbowels and he went to the toilet. He smoked two cigarettes inside the toilet. After\n\nleaving the toilet, Suboh spent some time talking in the hall with Salam. He did not\n\nnotice the plastic bag containing the VCDs and the drugs then.17.    As they were leaving the flat, Salam opened the\n\npadlock of the gate with a key he had with him. Salam then went ahead and told Suboh to\n\nlock up after him. Suboh did so and followed Salam, who by that time had ascended the\n\nstairs. Suboh put the keys into his pocket, intending to return them to Salam later. Suboh\n\nonly managed to catch up with Salam at the lift landing on the sixth floor. Before Suboh\n\ncould return the keys to Salam, they were arrested as they emerged from the lift at the\n\nground floor.18.    Suboh denied any knowledge of the drugs. He\n\ndenied that Hazafi had ever given him the keys to the flat #03-37 of Block 489.",
        "Wong’s case": "19.    At the trial, when he was called upon to enter on\n\nhis defence, Wong elected to remain silent. However, witnesses were called to testify on\n\nhis behalf. Wong’s main line of defence pertained to the identification evidence. His\n\nstand was that he handed over the blue plastic bag to a male Malay on the sixth floor of\n\nBlock 489 and that he never delivered any blue plastic bag to any person at the flat on\n\nthe third floor. Witnesses were called to cast doubt on the evidence of the CNB officers\n\nwho saw Wong walking along the sixth floor corridor and descending to the third floor,\n\nwhere he stood outside the flat #03-37 of Block 489 for a few minutes.",
        "Wong’s appeal": "20.    As a matter of convenience, we consider first\n\nWong’s appeal. Wong was not apprehended while carrying the bag containing the drugs,\n\nand his fingerprints were not found on the bag containing the drugs. Neither Salam nor\n\nSuboh implicated Wong in any way. He was convicted mainly on the surveillance evidence of\n\nthe CNB officers and his s 121 statements.21.    Before us counsel for Wong seeks to impugn the\n\nsurveillance evidence adduced by the prosecution. He submits that there were serious gaps\n\nin the evidence of the CNB officers engaged in the surveillance, and none of the officers\n\ntestified that they actually saw Wong coming out of the lift on the sixth floor of Block\n\n489, walking along the common corridor and down the staircase to the flat #03-37 and\n\nstanding in front of the flat for a short while. He does not seriously dispute that the\n\nofficers saw a person walking along the common corridor on the sixth floor and going down\n\nto the third floor. His submission is that none of the officers had truly identified that\n\nthat person was Wong. In the circumstances, the surveillance evidence was highly\n\nunsatisfactory and unsafe, and the learned judge was in error in relying on such evidence\n\nto convict Wong.22.    There was no dispute that Wong went to Block 489,\n\nJurong West Avenue 1 at about 2.15 pm on 22 December 1999. At that time, there were\n\nseveral officers stationed in the vicinity keeping an observation of Block 489. We turn to\n\nexamine their evidence as to what they actually saw and also what they heard from each\n\nother over the radio set they carried. We take as the starting point the evidence of the\n\nofficer who actually saw the Malaysian car No. JDF 755 arriving at the car park of Block\n\n489. That evidence came from Cpl Peter Loong Tean Huat. He testified that he was\n\ninstructed to look out for a Malaysian car coming to the car park of Block 489 and that at\n\nabout 2.15 pm he saw a Malaysian car No. JDF 755 driven by a male Chinese arriving at the\n\ncar park of Block 489. He later heard on the radio set that the driver was taking the lift\n\nand carrying a blue plastic bag, and shortly thereafter he heard that the driver was\n\nstanding outside the flat #03-37. He later heard another radio message that the driver was\n\nwalking back to his car empty handed. At about 2.55 pm he saw the car No. JDF 755 leaving\n\nthe car park of Block 489 Jurong West Avenue 1.23.    Next, there was the evidence of Sgt Tony Ng and\n\nSSgt Goh Teck Hock who arrived at the scene at about 1.30 pm. Sgt Tony Ng was stationed at\n\nthe edge of the void deck of Block 487 facing Block 489. At about 2.15 pm he heard over\n\nthe radio that a Malaysian car had arrived and entered the car park. He saw a car No. JDF\n\n755 parking in front of Block 489 Jurong West Street 41. He saw the driver alighting from\n\nthe car and going to the void deck where he was seen using his handphone. The driver was\n\nwearing a grey-like T-shirt. The sergeant later saw the driver going back to his car. He\n\nnext saw the driver entering the lift at the ground floor of Block 489. However, he failed\n\nto see if the driver was carrying any thing in his hand. Shortly thereafter, he heard a\n\nradio message that the driver was at the sixth floor and going down to the third floor.\n\nLater, he saw the driver coming out of the lift on the ground floor of Block 489. This\n\ntime Sgt Tony Ng was positive that the driver was not carrying anything. The driver got\n\ninto his car, stayed there for a short while and then reversed his car and moved to\n\nanother parking lot, where again he remained for some time before he drove off.24.    SSgt Goh Teck Hock was with Sgt Tony Ng at the\n\ntime. SSgt Goh testified that he also stationed himself at the void deck of Block 487 to\n\nkeep observation. At about 2.15 pm he heard on the radio set that a Malaysian car No. JDF\n\n755 had arrived at the car park of Block 489. He saw the driver alighting from the car and\n\nproceeding to the void deck and there using his handphone. A short while later, the driver\n\nreturned to the car and opened the door at the driver’s side. SSgt Goh then saw the\n\ndriver carrying a blue plastic bag, rectangular in shape and of a size slightly bigger\n\nthan the A4 paper size, with a string handle attached to it. He then instructed Sgt Tony\n\nNg to relay the message to the others that the driver was carrying a blue plastic bag. He\n\nsaw the driver going to the lift landing and entering the lift. About one or two minutes\n\nlater, he heard the radio message that the driver was standing outside the flat #03-37.\n\nThe next time SSgt Goh saw the driver was when he came out of the lift on the ground floor\n\nof Block 489. The driver then was empty handed; he went to the car, reversed it and parked\n\nat a different lot before he eventually drove off.25.    On the same day, at about 4.20 pm, after the\n\narrest of Salam and Suboh, ASP Ang Choe Seng asked SSgt Goh to identify a blue plastic bag\n\nrecovered from the flat #03-37. SSgt Goh identified the blue plastic bag that was seized\n\nfrom Block 489 as the bag which the driver of the car No. JDF 755 was seen carrying from\n\nhis car.26.    We now come to the evidence of W/Sgt Rahizah\n\nbinte Rahim and SSgt M Subramaniam. Both of them, on that day, 22 December 1999, since\n\n9.30 am had been keeping observation of Block 137, Yishun Ring Road. At about 12.25 pm\n\nthey saw Salam coming out of the void deck of that block and boarding a taxi. They\n\nfollowed in their vehicle and trailed the taxi to Jurong West Street 41 where Salam\n\nalighted. Rahizah saw Salam going to the lift landing of Block 489 and taking the lift,\n\nand thereafter saw him walking along the common corridor on the sixth floor to the\n\nstaircase going down to the third floor and entering the flat #03-37.27.    In the afternoon, Rahizah and Subramaniam were\n\nstill at the vicinity of Block 489. At about 2.15 pm, Rahizah heard on the radio set that\n\na Malaysian car No. JDF 755 had entered the car park. Later she spotted a person walking\n\nalong the sixth floor corridor towards the left staircase and there was no other person\n\nwalking there at that time. She immediately radioed a message that someone was walking\n\nalong the sixth floor corridor. That person walked down the staircase to the third floor\n\nand then turned towards the flat #03-37. She saw this person standing in front of the flat\n\nfor a few minutes. That person later left, took the staircase up to the sixth floor and\n\nwalked along the common corridor to the lift landing on the right. She then lost sight of\n\nthe person. Later, she heard that the person was on the ground floor.28.    SSgt Subramaniam corroborated substantially what\n\nRahizah said. At the time when the Malaysian car arrived at the car park he had already\n\nrepositioned his car at the car park facing Block 489 and his view was unobstructed. At\n\nabout 2.15 pm, he heard on the radio set that a Malaysian car No. JDF 755 had arrived at\n\nthe vicinity of Block 489 and subsequently that a male Chinese had alighted from the car\n\ncarrying a blue plastic bag and walking towards the lift landing of Block 489. He next\n\nheard that the male Chinese was taking the lift. A short while later, he saw a male\n\nChinese walking along the sixth floor common corridor towards the left staircase, and\n\nwalking down the staircase and later standing outside the flat #03-37 for about two\n\nminutes. He then saw this person leaving, taking the same staircase up and walking along\n\nthe common corridor on the sixth floor. Later, he heard on the radio set that the male\n\nChinese was spotted coming out of the lift on the ground floor, and this time he was\n\nempty-handed. At about 2.55 pm, he heard that the Malaysian car left the car park of\n\nBlock 489.29.    As the Malaysian car left the car park of Block\n\n489, it was trailed all the way by the CNB officers until the junction of Upper Thomson\n\nRoad and Marymount Lane, where it was stopped and the driver of the car was arrested. The\n\ndriver was none other than Wong himself.30.    In our view, the sum total of the surveillance\n\nevidence is this. Wong was seen driving the car No. JDF 755 to the car park of Block 489\n\nat about 2.15 pm and alighting from the car. He was seen carrying a blue plastic bag and\n\nwalking to the lift landing of Block 489 and taking the lift. A short while later, a\n\nperson was seen walking along the common corridor on the sixth floor to the staircase on\n\nthe left and going down to the third floor and walking to the flat, #03-37. And the person\n\nstood outside the flat for a few minutes. This person then returned to the sixth floor,\n\ntaking the same route to the lift landing on the sixth floor. Very soon thereafter, Wong\n\nwas seen emerging from the lift, and this time he was empty-handed. He went to the car No.\n\nJDF 755 and remained there for a short while. He was seen moving the car to another\n\nparking lot and remaining there again for a short while. After that he drove off. He was\n\ntrailed by the CNB officers and was subsequently arrested.31.    It is true that none of the CNB officers involved\n\nin the surveillance could say that the person seen walking along the common corridor on\n\nthe sixth floor, taking the staircase to the third floor, going to the flat #03-37 and\n\nstanding in front there for a few minutes was Wong. However, at that time, no other person\n\nwas seen walking along the common corridor on the sixth floor or the third floor. The\n\ninference is that Wong was the person they saw. We find irresistible the following\n\nconclusion of the learned judge at  237 of his grounds of judgment:237. There was ample credible evidence from SSgt Subramaniam and W/SGT\n\n  Rahizah and the surveillance team, supported by evidence of contemporaneous radio message\n\n  communications, that the driver of JDF 755 had indeed gone up to the 6thfloor\n\n  of the Blk 489 via the lift, walked along the common corridor, walked down the stairs to\n\n  the 3rdfloor, stood outside the said flat and later leaving the way he came\n\n  from. He was seen carrying a blue plastic bag when he went up the lift and later, he was\n\n  no longer seen with the blue plastic bag when he returned to his car. The totality of the\n\n  surveillance evidence led me to the inexorable conclusion that the 3rdaccused\n\n  had delivered a blue plastic bag to a person at the said flat on the 3rdfloor.",
        "Wong’s s 121 statements": "32.    The surveillance evidence was not the only\n\nevidence adduced by the prosecution. Wong made two s 121 statements to the CNB officers in\n\nthe course of their investigation, one on 23 December and the other on 27 December 1999.\n\nClearly these statements may be used in evidence at the trial below. The material part of\n\nthe first statement was as follows:2. On 22.12.99, the day when I was arrested, I arrived in Singapore at\n\n  about 12.00 p.m. via Woodlands checkpoint. I drove ..… A short while later, I left\n\n  for Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1.3. At about 1.00 p.m. plus, I reached the carpark of Blk 489 Jurong\n\n  West Ave 1. I then parked my car at one of the parking lots nearer to Blk 489. I got out\n\n  from the car and called a number and spoke to the person in Malay. I said to him\n\n  \"Saya suda sambai\". The person then asked me to go to the 6thstorey\n\n  in Malay. I then removed a blue plastic bag from the floorboard at the rear passenger\n\n  seat. After which, I took the blue plastic bag and went up to the 6thstorey\n\n  corridor using the centre lift. After coming out from the lift, I turned right and saw a\n\n  male Malay. Without speaking to him, I handed over the blue plastic bag to him and he in\n\n  turn gave me a brown envelope in which I knew contained money. I took the lift back to the\n\n  ground floor and went back to my car. In the car, I opened the large brown envelope which\n\n  I got from my friend earlier on and counted the money which amounted to S$24,950. They\n\n  were in denominations of S$1,000, S$50, and S$10. After counting the money, I placed both\n\n  the brown envelopes underneath the front passenger seat…..4. …..5. I am now shown a blue plastic bag and I recognise it as the blue\n\n  plastic bag that I had mentioned earlier in my statement (Recorder’s note: - Accused\n\n  is shown a blue plastic bag labelled as ‘A1a’ which was recovered in a raid on\n\n  Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37)…..The material part of the second statement was as follows:12. On the eve of my arrest, ‘Ah Bear’ called me at about\n\n  11.00 p.m. to inform me that I have got to work and at about midnight, he asked me to meet\n\n  him at the same ‘7-11’ store. He then handed over a blue plastic bag to me and\n\n  like the previous times, told me that he would call me again when I am in Singapore. He\n\n  also told me then to enter Singapore by 12.00 p.m. I then took the plastic bag and left it\n\n  in the car boot…..13. On the day of my arrest, I woke up at about 11.00 a.m. After\n\n  washing up, I went to my car and hid the plastic bag which ‘Ah Bear’ gave to me\n\n  under the spare tyre in the car boot. After which, I left for Singapore in my car. At\n\n  about 12.00 p.m., I entered into Singapore via Woodlands checkpoint. I used the green lane\n\n  and was not checked by the police. As ‘Ah Bear’ did not call me, I went to look\n\n  for a friend of mine to borrow money for my business. I had arranged with my friend to\n\n  borrow money and therefore, I forked out time to collect it from him. At the carpark at\n\n  Ang Mo Kio, I took out the blue plastic bag and transferred to the floorboard of the rear\n\n  passenger seat. While removing it from the car boot, I saw about one to two packets of\n\n  yellow substance inside the bag. I wish to say that I do not know what was the yellow\n\n  substance. After I had collected the money from my friend, ‘Ah Bear’ called me\n\n  and gave me the contact number for a male Malay. I keyed in the number into my handphone.\n\n  Although I had planned to collect a handphone sent for repairs, I went straight to Jurong\n\n  West as ‘Ah Bear’ told me that the person is already waiting. I immediately\n\n  called the number which ‘Ah Bear’ gave me and the male Malay answered the call.\n\n  I asked him where he was and he told me that he was at Blk 489 Jurong West. He also told\n\n  me to call him again when I had reached there. Upon reaching Blk 489 Jurong West at about\n\n  1 plus p.m., I called the male Malay and he told me to go to the 6thstorey\n\n  where I handed the plastic bag to him. I also collected some money…..33.    In quoting his statements, we have set out what\n\ncounsel contends are the exculpatory parts as well as the inculpatory parts of the\n\nstatements. Both parts of the statements were considered by the trial judge and he found\n\nthat the statements corroborated the surveillance evidence of the CNB officers. The trial\n\njudge said at  238 and 239:238. I must emphasize that the prosecution’s case against the 3rdaccused was not entirely based on this surveillance evidence alone but was corroborated by\n\n  the inculpatory parts of the 3rdaccused’s s 121 statement.239. The 3rdaccused had confessed in substance to the\n\n  following:(a) ‘Ah Bear’ had previously asked him to carry packets of\n\n    items into Singapore. He had done so and was paid. He made these deliveries because he was\n\n    short of money.(b) On the eve of his arrest ‘Ah Bear’ asked him again to\n\n    make delivery of items into Singapore. Ah Bear handed ablue plastic bagto him. He\n\n    did not know thenumber of packetsinside. ‘Ah Bear’ told him tocollect\n\n    moneyfrom the person he was handing the blue plastic bag over.(c) On the day of his arrest, he hid the plastic bag under the spare\n\n    tyre in the boot of his car JDF 755. He believed that the things he carried wereillegalas \"Ah Bear’ had previously told him to hide them well. But he never thought\n\n    that he would face the death penalty if arrested.(d) When he was at Ang Mo Kio, he removed the blue plastic bag and\n\n    transferred it to the floorboard of the rear passenger seat. He saw about one to two\n\n    packets ofyellow substanceinside the bag. He called a number provided\n\n    subsequently by ‘Ah Bear’ and the male Malay told him that he was at Blk 489\n\n    Jurong West.(e) Upon reaching Blk 489, he called the male Malay again and was told\n\n    to go to the 6thstorey. He went to the 6thstorey where hemet a\n\n    male Malay, andhanded the blue plastic bag to himand collected a brown\n\n    envelope containing money from him.(f) He was shown the blue plastic bag seized and he recognised andidentified\n\n    it as the blue plastic bagmentioned in his statement which he said he was carrying\n\n    when he went up the lift of Blk 489.We agree entirely with these findings of the learned judge.34.    It should be noted that Wong admitted that on the\n\nday and at the time in question he drove his car No. JDF 755 to the car park of Block 489\n\nat Jurong West Avenue 1, parked his car there, brought out a blue plastic bag and went up\n\nto the sixth floor, and there he delivered the bag to a Malay and collected moneys from\n\nhim. What is very damning was that, in the first s 121 statement, he identified the blue\n\nbag, which the CNB officers had recovered from flat #03-37 Block 489 after the arrest of\n\nSalam and Suboh, as the bag he handed to the Malay on the sixth floor. That bag was found\n\nto contain the quantity of drugs, which formed the subject of the charge.35.    It should also not be forgotten that upon his\n\narrest, there were found in his car, under the front passenger’s seat, two brown\n\nenvelopes: one containing S$9,500 and the other containing S$24,950. One of these brown\n\nenvelopes must have come from the Malay to whom he handed the blue bag. In his s 121\n\nstatements, he admitted that upon handing the blue bag to the Malay he collected from him\n\na brown envelope containing moneys.36.    Purely on his own admissions, Wong had delivered\n\na blue bag to a Malay on the sixth floor of Block 489 and collected moneys from him and\n\nthat bag was found to contain the drugs. The drugs therefore were in the bag, and the bag\n\nwas clearly in his possession. That being so, under s 18(1) of the Act, he was presumed\n\n(until the contrary is proved) to have the drugs in his possession, and under s 18(2), he\n\nwas further presumed (until the contrary is proved) to have known the nature of the drugs.\n\nHence, by delivering the drugs to the Malay on the sixth floor (assuming that what he said\n\nwas true), he committed the offence of trafficking by delivering that quantity of drugs.\n\nIn this respect, whether he delivered the drugs to Suboh or to any other person is\n\nimmaterial. By merely delivering the drugs to a person, known or unknown, he committed the\n\noffence of trafficking in those drugs.37.    There is no merit in the appeal by Wong. We agree\n\nentirely with the trial judge’s finding that the prosecution had proved the charge\n\nagainst Wong beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal brought by Wong.",
        "Suboh’s appeal": "38.    We now turn to Suboh’s appeal. The main\n\nargument advanced by counsel for Suboh is that the learned judge misdirected himself when\n\nhe relied on the testimony of Salam, who was shown to be untruthful and unreliable. Salam\n\nhad lied on material aspects of the evidence, and because of these lies and\n\ninconsistencies, the learned judge should have placed little or no weight on Salam’s\n\nevidence. Counsel draws our attention to some parts of Salam’s evidence which were\n\nclearly lies, namely his evidence: (a) that Suboh arrived at the flat first; (b) that he\n\nnever entered the flat; (c) that he did not consume any heroin; and (d) that he thought\n\nhis urine tested positive because of some cough mixture that he had taken.39.    It is true that in his evidence Salam sought to\n\ndistance himself from the drugs found in the flat #03-37, Block 489 and in so doing lied\n\non various aspects. However, the learned judge was fully alive to the lies in his evidence\n\nand took them into account in evaluating the prosecution’s case against him. The\n\nlearned judge said at  217 and 218 of his grounds of judgment:217. Although Salam retracted a number of his statements to the CNB\n\n  officers after his arrest which showed him to be a self-confessed liar, nevertheless I was\n\n  prepared to accept his evidence given at the trial proper after I had carefully\n\n  scrutinised his evidence. He appeared fairly forthright and candid. I was to some extent\n\n  impressed by the consistency of his evidence not only on a general level but also in the\n\n  details despite being tested quite severely in cross-examination by counsel for Suboh and\n\n  by the DPP. He came out surprisingly well. I was surprised at his candour about his past\n\n  which he revealed without hesitation during cross-examination by counsel for Suboh…..218. I tested his evidence against the objective evidence. I was fully\n\n  conscious of the fact that an accused person might want to tailor his evidence to fit the\n\n  objective facts as closely as possible to give it a veneer of believability, sufficient to\n\n  raise at least a reasonable doubt. Much as I would like to think that there was a lurking\n\n  suspicion that he might well be involved based on the circumstantial evidence, I did not\n\n  think that it was sufficient for me to convict Salam on the criminal charge based on a\n\n  high standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence did not\n\n  point irresistibly to the conclusion that he had a common intention to traffick in the\n\n  said drugs together with Suboh…..On the evidence before him, the learned judge was entitled to come to\n\nthis conclusion.40.    At any rate, even if the learned judge had\n\nrejected Salam’s evidence on the ground that Salam was untruthful and unreliable, and\n\nconvicted Salam of the charge, we do not see how such a result would or could have any\n\neffect or impact on the defence of Suboh. It certainly would not exonerate him from the\n\ncharge. Salam’s lies, which were relied on heavily in the argument by Suboh’s\n\ncounsel, concerned only Salam himself and does not impinge on Suboh’s defence or\n\nguilt. The learned judge certainly did not rely on Salam’s lies to convict Suboh. The\n\nevidence of Salam on which the learned judge relied in acquitting him has no bearing on\n\nthe defence of Suboh in relation to the charge.41.    Counsel for Suboh seeks to impugn also the\n\nevidence of Hazafi on the ground that there were lies and inconsistencies in the\n\nlatter’s evidence. Hazafi in his evidence initially said that he had never given\n\nSuboh the keys to the flat, but later on being recalled he reversed his evidence and\n\nadmitted that he had given the keys to the flat to Suboh, because Suboh wanted a place to\n\nstay. In so doing he had lied in his earlier evidence and his statement given at the\n\nPreliminary Inquiry. This was noted by the learned judge. However, what was material was\n\nthe fact that Hazafi knew Suboh and not Salam. Hazafi testified that Suboh visited him on\n\nthree occasions in 1998, while he and his family were staying at the flat #03-37 of Block\n\n489, and this was not disputed by Suboh. The fact that Suboh had visited the flat on three\n\nprevious occasions indicated that Hazafi and Suboh must have been on fairly good terms. On\n\nthe other hand, Hazafi was quite insistent in his evidence that he did not know Salam, and\n\non this the learned judge found that he ‘never vacillated’ at all. Salam also\n\nconsistently maintained that he did not know Hazafi. We do not find any error on the part\n\nof the learned judge in accepting the evidence of Hazafi that he did not know Salam and\n\nthat he gave Suboh the keys to the flat #03-37.",
        "Evidence of the charge against Suboh": "42.    In this appeal it is essential to bear in mind\n\nwhat the charge was that was brought against Suboh. The charge against him was that he had\n\npossession of the drugs in questionfor the purpose of trafficking,and\n\nunder s 5(2) of the Act he thereby committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs. To\n\nmake good this charge the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Suboh had\n\npossession of the drugs at the material time:Low Kok Wai v Public Prosecutor[1994] 1 SLR 676,Public Prosecutor v Wan Yue Kong and ors[1995] 1 SLR 417andLim\n\nLye Huat Benny v Public Prosecutor[1996] 1 SLR 253. Once this burden is discharged,\n\nthe presumption under s 17(2) that he had possession of the drugsfor the purpose of\n\ntraffickingis triggered, and the burden is then on Suboh to show on the balance of\n\nprobabilities that drugs were for purposes other than trafficking.43.    We now turn to consider whether the prosecution\n\nhas proved that Suboh had possession of the drugs. In discharging this burden, the\n\nprosecution has to prove (i) that Suboh had physical custody of the quantity of substance,\n\nand (ii) that he knew that the quantity of substance contained drugs:Fun Seong Cheng v\n\nPublic Prosecutor[1997] 3 SLR 523,Su Chee Kiong v Public Prosecutor[1999] 1 SLR 782andGulam bin Notam Mohd Shariff Jamalddin and anor v Public Prosecutor[1999] 2 SLR 181.44.    First, the evidence. At about 2.30 pm on 22\n\nDecember 1999, Wong was seen going to Block 489 with a blue bag and taking the lift up. On\n\nWong’s own admission he went up to the sixth floor and delivered the blue bag to a\n\nmale Malay, and the bag was subsequently found to contain the drugs. As we have found,\n\nWong’s evidence that he delivered the bag to a Malay on the sixth floor is\n\nunbelievable, and we reject it. Purely based on what the CNB officers actually saw, the\n\ninference is inescapable that Wong delivered the blue bag, which contained the drugs, to\n\nsomeone at the flat #03-37 of Block 489. There were in the flat, at the time, only two\n\npersons, Salam and Suboh. Upon their arrest by the CNB officers, there were found on\n\nSuboh, among other things, the keys to the flat, and ten sachets of heroin. With the help\n\nof the keys, the CNB officers gained access to the flat, and a search was conducted in the\n\npresence of Salam and Suboh. They found a blue bag which contained the drugs, the subject\n\nof the charge. That, however, was not all. On his own admission, the ten sachets of drugs\n\nfound on Suboh at the time of arrest came from a plastic bag in the flat, and on the basis\n\nof the search conducted by the CNB officers immediately after his arrest, the only plastic\n\nbag that contained the drugs was the blue bag which was the very bag delivered by Wong.45.    In a statement recorded under s 122(6) of the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code, he said: ‘I have nothing to say right now’. He declined\n\nto say what his defence was to the charge, although he was given an opportunity to do so.\n\nThe learned judge drew an inference that he was involved in the drugs, and, in our view,\n\nthe learned judge was entitled to draw such an inference. At the time of his arrest, he\n\nhad with him a pager and a handphone. The trial judge also drew the following inference:He was clearly going on his drug trafficking rounds when he was caught\n\n  with the 10 sachets.It is clear to us that the learned judge did not draw this inference\n\nmerely because he had with him a pager and a handphone. He drew this inference on the\n\nbasis of this and all the other evidence before him.46.    The learned judge then said at  228 and 229:228. He could not give a reasonable account of what he did in the flat\n\n    from 2.05 pm to 3.20 pm. By his own evidence, he saw the sachets of drugs before he went\n\n    inside the toilet for some 20 minutes. He testified that apart from the time spent in the\n\n    toilet, he was in the hall of the flat. If the drugs were delivered at the time he was in\n\n    the toilet, then he would not have seen any drugs prior to his going to the toilet. By\n\n    that evidence, it suggested that he was present in the hall at the time the 3rdaccused delivered the drugs. The irresistible conclusion was that he and not Salam took\n\n    delivery of the blue plastic bag with the drugs. It was he who had, whilst Salam was\n\n    resting in the master bedroom, repacked some of the drugs into the sachets, which\n\n    accounted for the empty torn plastic bag (stained with heroin) and the cellophane wrapper\n\n    found in the kitchen (which was similar to that used for wrapping the other packets of\n\n    drugs). After repacking, he then placed 10 sachets in his pockets to get ready for his\n\n    trafficking rounds. Thereafter, he hid the blue plastic bag containing the drugs and the\n\n    other drug trafficking paraphernalia behind the cupboard in the flat. There was no\n\n    reliable evidence to show that Salam knew about this hidden blue plastic bag.229. In my judgment, Suboh had physical possession of the drugs in the\n\n  flat as well as the requisite mens rea for trafficking.…..47.    For the reasons we have given, we agree with the\n\nfindings of the learned judge that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that\n\nSuboh, at the material time, had physical custody of the drugs as well as the requisite\n\nmens rea, i.e. that he knew that the blue bag found in the flat contained the drugs. The\n\nprosecution therefore had proved that Suboh had possession of the drugs, and as the\n\nquantity of the drugs in his possession exceeded 2 grams of diamorphine, there arose the\n\npresumption under s 17(1) of the Act that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose\n\nof trafficking, and no evidence had been adduced by Suboh to rebut this presumption.\n\nConsequently, by reason of s 5(2) of the Act, he committed the offence of trafficking.\n\nAccordingly, Suboh’s appeal is also dismissed.L P TheanChao Hick TinM P H RubinJudge of AppealJudge of AppealJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
