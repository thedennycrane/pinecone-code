        "The facts": "2        BCS was a private limited company with two\n\nshareholders, Mr Peh Chee Chuan (Peh) and Mr Phua Ah Pok (Phua), who were also its\n\ndirectors. On 22 February 1997, BCS opened a current account (the account) with the Eunos\n\nStation Branch of DBS and furnished the latter with the following documents indicating how\n\nthe account was to be operated:-(i) a document of resolutions of the board of directors of BCS dated 7\n\n  January 1997, in DBS standard form, signed by Peh, its Chairman, and one Ms The Mui Ngo,\n\n  its Secretary.(ii) a copy of the minutes of the board dated 27 January 1991 wherein\n\n  it was recorded that a resolution was passed empowering the bank to honour all cheques\n\n  signed on behalf of BCS by its directors, Peh and Phua, jointly.These documents will be referred to as the \"original\n\n  mandate\".3        In the resolution document of 7 January\n\n1997, there were several resolutions of the board of BCS and two of them, resolutions (F)\n\nand (G), which were more pertinent to the action read as follows:-(F) That the Secretary of the Company be, and hereby is, authorised to\n\n  certify to the Bank the name of the present officers of the Company and other persons\n\n  authorised in terms of this resolution and offices respectively held by them, together\n\n  with specimens of their signatures. In the event of the Company appointing another\n\n  person/s in place of authorised person/s the Company shall notify the Bank that a\n\n  Resolution has been passed to that effect, whereupon the said contents of this Resolution\n\n  shall apply to such substituted signatories.(G) And that a copy of any resolution of the Board if purporting to be\n\n  certified as correct by the Chairman of the meeting and by the Company Secretary or\n\n  another Director shall as between the Bank and the Company be conclusive evidence of the\n\n  passing of the resolution so certified.4        On or about 23 July 1997, DBS received an\n\nundated notification of a resolution of BCS, in DBS standard form for a change in\n\nauthorised signatories, signed by Phua as Chairman of the board of directors’ meeting\n\nand one Chua Thong Jiang Andrew (Andrew Chua), as Company Secretary, rescinding the\n\noriginal mandate set out in the resolution of 27 January 1997, and in its place,\n\nauthorised Phua to operate the account by his sole signature. At the same time DBS also\n\nreceived from BCS:-(i) a copy of Form 49 (under the Companies Act) dated 22 July 1997,\n\n  showing that Andrew Chua had, on 22 July 1997, taken over as the Company Secretary of BCS\n\n  in place of The Mui Ngo, who had resigned;(ii) a copy of BCS’s extraction of resolution passed by the board\n\n  of directors on 23 July 1997 altering the mandate to operate the account and which extract\n\n  was certified by Phua and Andrew Chua to be a true copy of the resolution passed.These documents will be referred to as the new mandate.5        Thereafter, DBS honoured all cheques drawn\n\non the account in accordance with the new mandate. Some two months later, on 3 October\n\n1997, M/s Ng Yap & Partners (NYP), as solicitors for Peh, wrote a letter to DBS\n\ninforming the latter that a dispute (without identifying nature) had arisen between the\n\ndirectors of BCS, namely, Peh and Phua, and asking DBS to freeze the account. On 6 October\n\n1997, Ramdas & Wong, acting for BCS, asked DBS not to act as requested by Peh. On 7\n\nOctober 1997 Peh wrote, referring to his solicitors’ letter of 3 October 1997 and\n\nasking for certain statements of account. On 13 October 1997, DBS informed NYP that the\n\nbank were unable to freeze the account without a directors’ resolution or a court\n\norder. No court order was forthcoming from Peh.6        On 17 October 1997, NYP wrote asking for\n\ncopies of the statements of account as well as informing DBS that Phua \"has purported\n\nto remove\" Peh as a cheque signatory and replace him by another person.7        On 5 November 1997, Andrew Chua, writing in\n\nhis capacity as Company Secretary, told DBS that the resolution of 23 July 1997, effecting\n\na change in signatories for the account, was made pursuant to Article 100 of the Articles\n\nof Association by all the directors present in Singapore. Andrew Chua also stated that the\n\ncompany had no objection to DBS releasing the statements of account requested by Peh.8        It was about a year later that Peh\n\ninstituted Originating Summons No. 1306/1998 under s 216 of the Companies Act on the\n\nground of oppression. On 11 December 1998 the court granted him the reliefs prayed for\n\nincluding a declaration that,inter alia, the resolution of 23 July 1997 was null\n\nand void. This order was only served on DBS on 5 January 1999.9        The present action was instituted by BCS in\n\nthe District Court to recover the sum of $186,938.38, being the sum total of the cheques\n\ndrawn on the account with Phua as the sole signatory, which Peh complained DBS should not\n\nhave honoured.10        In their Defence filed, DBS raised two\n\ndefences. First, that they acted in accordance with the new mandate. Second, that the\n\norder of court of 11 December 1998 (December 1998 order) could not have\n\n\"retroactively or otherwise\" rendered void the 23 July 1997 resolution as far as\n\nDBS were concerned.",
        "Decision below": "11        The district judge found that the December\n\n1998 order declaring the 23 July resolution \"null and void\" had retrospective\n\neffect. However she held that that order determined only the rights of the parties to that\n\nproceeding (OS 1306/1998) and it did not follow that a third party would be bound by that\n\norder in the same way, and to the same extent, as the parties thereto. The new mandate\n\nreceived by DBS from BCS complied with the terms of the contract between DBS and BCS, and\n\nthat DBS had acted properly in reliance on the new mandate. She also held that by virtue\n\nof the rule inThe Royal British Bank vTurquand5 EL & BL 248, BCS were\n\nbound by the cheques which DBS had honoured.12        On appeal to the High Court, the Judge\n\ntook the view that a conclusive evidence clause like resolution (G) must be interpreted\n\nstrictly because the effect of such a clause was to oust the court’s jurisdiction to\n\nconsider all relevant facts before coming to a conclusion. To invoke this clause it must\n\nbe shown that the certification came from a director and a person who was properly\n\nappointed the Company Secretary. In this case, there was no proper appointment of Andrew\n\nChua as the new Company Secretary.13        However, the main basis upon which the\n\nJudge below held that BCS were entitled to recover the sum claimed was one of pleading.\n\nShe pointed out that the pleaded defence was that DBS acted in accordance with the new\n\nmandate and had not breached any terms of the contractual arrangements between them. DBS\n\ndid not plead that if the new mandate was not valid, they were still entitled to rely on\n\nit because of the rule inTurquand’scase. That being the position, once it\n\nwas shown that the new mandate was not valid, the defence failed. She recognised that\n\nalthough the new mandate was established to be invalid, it did not follow that a third\n\nparty who had acted on it was automatically liable but that the third party should plead\n\nthe further ground(s) upon which it relied to contend it was not liable. In this case, DBS\n\nhad not so pleaded. Accordingly, this additional defence was not an issue in the action.\n\nNeither did BCS have the opportunity to address it. While appreciating that theTurquand’srule is a rule of law, she nevertheless felt that, to invoke that rule, facts had to be\n\npleaded and established, and this was not done in the instant case.",
        "Issues": "14        Before us three broad issues were raised\n\nby DBS. First, what was the nature, effect and ambit of the December 1998 order? Second,\n\nwhether by reason of theTurquandrule and/or resolution (G), DBS were entitled to\n\nrely on the new mandate, regardless of whether the new mandate was valid or otherwise.\n\nThirdly, whether the judge below was correct to have found that on account of the\n\ninadequate pleadings, DBS were not entitled to rely on resolution (G) and theTurquandrule. Of these three issues, the emphasis of DBS was on the second and third issues.",
        "December 1998 Order": "15        In OS 1306/1998, Peh commenced action\n\nagainst Phua and another, Chew Boon Cheng, for oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act\n\nand sought various reliefs, including a declaration that the resolution passed on 23 July\n\n1997 was null and void. BCS was not a party to that proceeding and neither did Peh sue for\n\nand on behalf of BCS. Peh did not allege that Phua’s action had caused any loss or\n\ndamage to the company. Peh only alleged prejudice suffered by himself. On the basis of the\n\nprayers formulated by Peh in the OS, the court granted the reliefs in terms, one of which\n\nwas that the 23 July 1997 resolution was \"null and void and/or rescinded.\"16        However, nothing in that order decided\n\nanything as between BCS and DBS; neither did it decide that DBS had acted in breach of the\n\nmandate given to them when they honoured the cheques. For reasons which would become\n\napparent later, we do not think it would be meaningful for us to dwell on this point\n\nfurther.",
        "Were the pleadings adequate?": "17        We shall consider the third issue before\n\nthe second. DBS contended that they had sufficiently pleaded the facts to enable them to\n\nrely on the defence that the change of mandate made by BCS on 23 July 1997 was effective\n\nand valid as between DBS and BCS by reason of the rule inTurquand’scase and\n\nresolution (G) of 7 January. Furthermore, BCS never took this pleading point during the\n\ntrial. Neither did they do so in their closing submissions, nor in their Case in the\n\nDistrict Court Appeal. BCS only raised it for the first time at the hearing of the\n\nDistrict Court appeal before the Judge.18        It is necessary for us, at this juncture,\n\nto set out the relevant paragraphs of the defence filed by DBS to see what were the facts\n\npleaded:-\"4. The Defendants aver that from 23 July 1997 onwards, the\n\n  Plaintiffs’ only authorised signatory was Phua Ah Pok, and in this regard, the\n\n  Defendants shall rely on two documents signed and executed by Phua Ah Pok as the\n\n  Plaintiffs’ director and chairman of a Board of Directorsmeeting on 23 July 1997, and by Chua Thong Jiang Andrew as the\n\n  Plaintiffs’ company secretary, and given to the Defendants ;..8. In respect of paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim, it is denied\n\n  that by the matters as pleaded in the Statement of Claim or at all, the mandate evidenced\n\n  by the Mandate Document is invalid and/or null and/or void and/or of no effect. It is\n\n  averred that at all material times, the Defendants acted with authority and in accordance\n\n  with the terms of the relevant mandate as evidenced by the Mandate Documents.9. … The Mandate Documents reveal that the relevant mandate as\n\n  evidenced by the same was lawfully complied with by the Defendants when the Defendants\n\n  duly honoured the cheques signed by Phua Ah Pok, who was the duly authorised sole\n\n  signatory at the material times. The defendants further aver that the service of the Order\n\n  of Court dated 11 December 1998 on them by Messrs Tan Cheng Yew & Partners by their\n\n  letter dated 5 January 1999 does not retrospectively or otherwise render the acts of the\n\n  Defendants in honouring the said cheques issued in the aforesaid period unauthorised\n\n  and/or in breach of the relevant mandate as aforesaid.19        DBS had pleaded the pertinent facts.\n\nParagraph 8 where DBS averred that \"at all material times, (DBS) acted with authority\n\nand in accordance with the terms of the relevant mandate as evidenced by the Mandate\n\nDocuments\" and paragraph 9 where it was stated that the December 1998 order\n\n\"does not retrospectively or otherwise render the acts of (DBS) in honouring the said\n\ncheques … unauthorised and/or in breach of the relevant mandate\" were\n\nparticularly relevant to the question of the applicability of theTurquandrule.\n\nWhile it was true that DBS, in their defence, did not expressly refer to theTurquandrule, or the terms of resolution (G), as will be shown later, whether on those facts theTurquandrule or resolution (G) would apply was a question of law and it was not necessary that\n\npropositions or inferences of law be expressly pleaded. We accept that it could be\n\npleaded. But it is altogether another thing to say that failure to do so would be fatal.20        It is important to note that in BCS’\n\nReply, BCS alleged facts to show that DBS were not entitled to the benefit of theTurquandrule.(i) on 3 October 1997 NYP, writing on behalf of Peh, had asked DBS to\n\n  freeze the account but DBS refused;(ii) on 7 October 1997 Peh wrote referring to the letter of 3 October\n\n  1997 from his solicitors, NYP and asked for copies of certain statements relating to the\n\n  account;(iii) on 17 October 1997 NYP informed DBS of the dispute between Peh\n\n  and Phua and asked DBS not to honour cheques signed by Phua solely. DBS did not respond to\n\n  this letter and continued to honour cheques signed by Phua alone;(iv) in spite of the above notices, DBS negligently or otherwise\n\n  continued to honour cheques signed by Phua alone.All these allegations were made to demonstrate that DBS had notice of\n\nthe irregularities and thus the rule inTurquandshould not be held to apply in the\n\ncircumstances.21        With respect, we were of the opinion that\n\nthe Judge below had erred when she held that DBS had not pleaded facts giving rise to the\n\nrule inTurquand. She had similarly erred in holding that BCS did not, as a result,\n\nplead the steps taken by Peh to notify DBS of the irregularities, which would disentitle\n\nDBS from invoking the protection accorded under theTurquandrule.22        DBS had clearly pleaded that they acted on\n\nthe basis of the documents evidencing the new mandate. It might well be, as declared in\n\nthe December 1998 order, that as between Peh and Phua, all the resolutions were invalid\n\nand of no effect. Peh could, as a result, claim against Phua for all the losses he\n\nsuffered. But as between BCS and their bankers, the issue was whether the new mandate\n\nnevertheless binds BCS. It is in this connection, that theTurquandrule comes in\n\nand determines whether, as between BCS and DBS, the new mandate was nevertheless valid and\n\neffective, as far as transactions effected prior to the December 1998 order were\n\nconcerned.23        The caseCounty ofGloucester\n\nBank v Rudry Merthyr Steam & House Coal Colliery Co[1895] 1 Ch 629 illustrates\n\nthe distinct position of a third party succinctly. There the directors of a joint stock\n\ncompany, pursuant to powers conferred under the Articles, by resolution fixed the quorum\n\nof the board of directors at three. At the meeting where only two directors were present,\n\na resolution was passed authorising the secretary to affix the company’s seal to a\n\nmortgage. The English Court of Appeal, applying theTurquandrule, held that as\n\nbetween the company and the mortgagee bank, who was a third party, the execution of the\n\nmortgage deed was valid and that it was a valid mortgage. The court effectively treated\n\nthe resolution as valid which a third party like the bank could rely upon.24        It is settled law that only material facts\n\nneed be pleaded, not propositions or inferences of law. This is illustrated and enunciated\n\neloquently in three cases decided by Lord Denning. InKarsales (Harrow) Ltd v Wallis(1956)\n\n2 All ER 866, Denning LJ stated:-\"The only real difficulty that I have felt in the case is whether\n\n  this point is put with sufficient clarity in the pleadings. Nevertheless, I have always\n\n  understood in modern times that it is sufficient for a pleader to plead the material\n\n  facts.He need not plead the legal consequences which flow from them.Even\n\n  although he has stated the legal consequences inaccurately or incompletely, that does not\n\n  shut him out from arguing points of law which arise on the facts pleaded. Looking at\n\n  this defence, it is quite plain that the defence pleaded all the material facts which I\n\n  have mentioned, and it is, I think, sufficient.\"25        InRe Vandervall’s Trust (No. 2)[1974] 3 All ER 205, Lord Denning MR gave short shrift to such a technical argument when\n\nhe said:-\"Counsel for the executors stressed that the points taken by\n\n  counsel for the trustee were not covered by the pleadings. He said time and again:\n\n  ‘This way of putting the case was not pleaded’; ‘No such trust was\n\n  pleaded’. And so forth. The more he argued, the more technical he became. I began to\n\n  think we were back in the bad old days before the Common Law Procedure Acts when pleadings\n\n  had to state the legal result; and a case could be lost by the omission of a single\n\n  averment … All that has been swept away. It is sufficient for the pleader to state\n\n  the material facts …\"26        The third instructive case isDrane v\n\nEvangelou[1978] 2 All ER 437, where a tenant sued a landlord for breach of covenant\n\non quiet enjoyment. The County Court judge, in his own volition, held that the facts were\n\nsufficient to found a claim in trespass, even though that was not the pleaded claim, and\n\nawarded exemplary damages of 1,000 to the tenant-plaintiff. The defendants appealed\n\ncontending that the plaintiff was not entitled to exemplary damages as he did not plead a\n\nclaim in trespass. Lord Denning said (at p.440):-The first point taken on behalf of the landlord was a pleading point.\n\n  The particulars of claim alleged that the landlord ‘had interfered with the right of\n\n  the [tenant] and his de facto wife Ann Watts to quiet enjoyment of the said premises by\n\n  unlawfully evicting them from the said premises on Tuesday 14thOctober\n\n  1975’. Counsel for the landlord submitted that that claim was for breach of a\n\n  covenant for quiet enjoyment. He cited a passage from Woodfall: ‘Since the claim is\n\n  in contract, punitive or exemplary damages cannot be awarded.’ The judge at once\n\n  said: ‘What about trespass? Does the claim not be in trespass? Counsel for the\n\n  landlord urged that trespass was not pleaded. The judge then said: ‘The facts are\n\n  alleged sufficiently so it does not matter what label you put on it.’ The judge was\n\n  right. The tenant in the particulars of claim gave details saying that three men broke the\n\n  door, removed the tenant’s belongings, bolted the door from the inside; and so forth.\n\n  Those facts were clearly sufficient to warrant a claim for trespass. As we said inRe\n\n  Vandervells Trusts:‘It is sufficient for the pleader to state material facts. He need\n\n    not state the legal result. If, for convenience, he does so, he is not bound by, or\n\n    limited to, what he has stated. He can present, in argument, any legal consequence of\n\n    which the facts permit.’27        Reverting to the pleadings in the present\n\ncase, there was no doubt that all pertinent facts relating to the account had been\n\npleaded. DBS averred that they had relied on and acted in accordance with the new mandate.\n\nFurthermore, paragraph 9 of their defence clearly stated that the December 1998 order did\n\nnot render DBS’ honouring of the cheques unauthorised. This statement necessarily\n\nraised the question of the applicability of theTurquandrule. It flowed naturally.\n\nThe Reply filed by BCS unequivocally indicated that BCS knew the direction DBS were coming\n\nfrom. BCS had pleaded all the pertinent facts to show that DBS should not be allowed to\n\nrely on theTurquandrule. BCS were not at all taken by surprise. They were not\n\nprejudiced because they did place everything before the trial court to show why theTurquandrule should not apply: seeJohn G Stein & Co Ltd v O’Hanlon[1965] AC 890\n\nat 900 and 901. No objection was taken by BCS at any stage of the trial. Neither was this\n\ntechnical point taken in BCS’ Case, which was filed in the District Court appeal.28        We were reminded that inBanner\n\nInvestments Pte Ltd v Hoe Seng Metal Fabrication & Engineers (S) Pte Ltd[1997] SLR 461 at 468 this Court did point out that \"it was not open for the trial judge to\n\ndecide the case on the basis of a defence that was not pleaded.\" But it is important\n\nto note that the issue in question there was whether a liquidated damages clause was in\n\nfact a penalty clause. The court agreed with the appellants’ argument that as the\n\nrespondents had not pleaded this, the court was precluded from entertaining that point.\n\nRajendran J held that the question whether a liquidated damages clause was valid because\n\nit was a genuine pre-estimate of damages and not a penalty clause, was a question of fact\n\nand law. There was a need for the party who made such a plea to aver to facts to\n\ndemonstrate that the amount was fixed in the clause in terrorem. Thus,Banner\n\nInvestmentswas clearly distinguishable, unlike here where all the pertinent facts\n\nwere pleaded and led in evidence.29        In any event, what was enunciated inTurquandwas a presumption of regularity.Walter Woon in Company Law (2ndEdn)at\n\np. 90 stated:-The rule inTurquand’scase is a presumption of regularity.\n\n  In other words, a person who deals with a company is entitled to assume that all\n\n  procedural matters have been taken care of by the company.We were unable to see why a presumption of law needed to be pleaded.\n\nThe pertinent facts giving rise to the presumption were pleaded by DBS. The burden was on\n\nthe company, and those who claimed under it, to show why in the particular circumstances\n\nthe presumption should not apply. As mentioned before, BCS had so pleaded. With respect,\n\nwe think that the Judge below fell into error when she held that on account of the\n\nDecember 1998 order, the burden was on third parties, like DBS, to \"establish why\n\nthey should not be held liable\" for acting in accordance with the new mandate.",
        "Were DBS entitled to rely on theTurquandrule?": "30        Turning to the second issue, the Judge\n\nbelow did not rule that DBS were not entitled, in all the circumstances, to rely on theTurquandrule. She allowed the appeal on the technical ground that the pleadings were inadequate.31        InTurquanda company borrowed\n\nmoney from a bank and when sued, it pleaded that a proper resolution of the company had\n\nnot been passed to enable the company to obtain the loan. The Court held that the company\n\nwas nevertheless bound by the loan as the bank, a third party, having only seen the\n\ncompany’s deed which authorized it to borrow, was entitled to infer that when the\n\ncompany sought to borrow, all matters of internal management had been complied with.32        The circumstances in which the rule inTurquandhad been applied are illustrated in numerous cases. InWilliam Augustus Mahony v The\n\nLiquidator of the East Holyford Mining Co (Ltd)(1875) LR 7 HL 869, it was held that\n\nbankers could lawfully honour the cheques issued by the directors of the company, signed\n\naccording to a form sent by them to the bank, without being bound previously to inquire\n\nwhether the persons pretending to sign as directors had been duly appointed to office, in\n\nconformity with the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association. There, one\n\nWedge, started a company with some friends and invited subscription from others to become\n\nshareholders. Subscription moneys received were paid into an account at National Bank,\n\nDublin. The bank received a formal notice from a person, signed as the secretary of the\n\ncompany, stating that, in accordance with a resolution passed, the bank should honour\n\ncheques signed by \"either two of the following three directors\" and\n\ncountersigned by the secretary. The moneys in the account were eventually drawn out\n\ncompletely and the company was ordered to be wound up. The liquidator of the company sued\n\nthe bank. It would appear that there had never been a meeting of shareholders and no\n\nappointment as directors or secretary was ever made. The claim of the liquidator failed.33        InDuck v Tower Galvanising Co Ltd[1901] 2 KB 314, the subject of dispute related to a debenture issued in proper form but, unknown\n\nto the claimant debenture holder, had been issued without proper authority. The contest\n\nwas between the holder and the execution creditors of the company. The debenture, if\n\nvalid, would create a charge on the assets of the company. Lord Alverstone CJ held that no\n\ninformality would alter the rights possessed by abona fideholder for value upon a\n\ndocument that purported to be in order.34        We have earlier (in paragraph 23) referred\n\nto the caseCounty of Gloucester Bankand we do not need to narrate it again.35        What remained to be considered was whether\n\nhad anything been shown by BCS which disentitled DBS from relying on theTurquandrule. As mentioned before, BCS had sought to do that. BCS relied essentially on NYP’s\n\nnotification of 17 October 1997 to DBS of the dispute between Peh and Phua and on DBS\n\nfailure to act in accordance therewith. The district judge, after reviewing the evidence\n\ndid not think that the conduct of DBS had, in any way, fallen short of the required\n\nstandard of care. Some of the circumstances which she took into account were, first, that\n\nthe documents tendered in relation to the new mandate were, on the face of it, in order.\n\nSecond, the witness for BCS conceded that at the time no firm grounds were presented to\n\nDBS to enable the latter to freeze the account, other than stating that there was a\n\ndispute between Peh and Phua. Third, Peh was told what he should do before DBS could\n\nfreeze the account and yet no such action was taken by Peh. He should have acted\n\nexpeditiously to pursue the matter. The conclusion of the district judge was that, in all\n\nthe circumstances, DBS were not in breach of their duty to take reasonable care and were\n\nentitled to rely on the conclusive evidence clause (resolution G), as well as theTurquandrule. She felt DBS acted according to \"what they probably thought was best for BCS at\n\nthe time.\"36        In the grounds of decision of the Judge\n\nbelow, she pointed out that a resolution of the board must be certified by either two\n\ndirectors or one director and the company secretary. In this case, the certification was\n\ndone by one director and Andrew Chua, but the latter was never properly appointed Company\n\nSecretary. Thus, the certified resolution was bad and could not be conclusive.37        We do not propose to deal with the effect\n\nof resolution (G) but will confine ourselves only to theTurquandrule. It is\n\nprecisely for such a situation that theTurquandrule comes to the aid of third\n\nparties who had relied in good faith on such a document from the company. DBS had no\n\nnotice of any irregularity or impropriety in the appointment of Andrew Chua as the new\n\nCompany Secretary. Neither did DBS know that only one director passed the resolution to\n\nappoint Andrew Chua as the Company Secretary. The letter of 17 October 1997 from NYP did\n\nnot even mention the irregularity in the appointment of the Company Secretary. In\n\naddition, a copy of Form 49 was furnished to DBS.38        In this regard, the following observations\n\nof this Court inYogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank[1997] 1 SLR 258,\n\ndelivered by Lai Kew Chai J, are on point (at 273 and 275):-The relationship between the bank and the deposit account holder is\n\n  premised on the debtor-creditor relationship. It carries with it the obligation on the\n\n  part of the bank to honour the customer’s mandate as regards the payment of money\n\n  from that account. The bank’s duty to pay on the demand of an account holder however\n\n  coexists with a duty to take reasonable care in all the circumstances as agent of the\n\n  account holder. The duty to take reasonable care in the discharge of its obligations under\n\n  the contract between banker and customer includes withholding payment where there has been\n\n  fraudulent conduct resulting in wrongful loss by a party. InBank of New South Wales v\n\n  Goulburn Valley Butter Co Pty Ltd[1902] AC 543, Lord Davey at p. 550 said: ‘The\n\n  law is well settled that in the absence of fraud or irregularity a banker is bound to\n\n  honour his customer’s cheque.’ Of course, where somebody cries\n\n  \"Fraud\", it is not always the case that the bank must withhold payment. The\n\n  question in every case, including the present, is whether the bank behaved reasonably in\n\n  view of all the circumstances and discharged its duty of care…..\"39        We should further add that in determining\n\nwhether a bank had exercised reasonable care, no reliance should be placed on hindsight.\n\nAll that DBS was told on 3 October 1997 was that there was a dispute between the two\n\ndirectors. It was on 17 October 1997 that NYP advised DBS that Phua had \"purported to\n\nremove Peh as a cheque signatory and to replace him with another person.\" But before\n\nthen, DBS had already advised Peh that to freeze the account a new resolution or a court\n\norder was necessary. Peh could have come to court to obtain an appropriate order, perhaps\n\neven on anex partebasis. He failed to do so and only acted some one year later. A\n\nbank cannot be expected to investigate the internal management or squabbles of a company.\n\nIt can only act on the basis of mandates issued in accordance with the terms of the\n\ncontract governing the account and the general law.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOW\n\n               \n\nCHAO HICK TIN\n\n               \n\nTAN LEE MENGCHIEF JUSTICE\n\n                     \n\nJUDGE OF APPEAL\n\n               \n\nJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
