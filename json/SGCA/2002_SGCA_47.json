        "Copyright infringement": "– Whether there was a valid section 37\n\nCopyright Act defence of fair dealing – Whether factual matters raised triable issues\n\n– Whether question of law was difficult and required mature considerationFACTSThe appellants appealed against a summary judgment given by the\n\nHigh Court which adjudged that the appellants had infringed the copyright of the\n\nrespondents in a certain artistic work when they published a notice containing the work\n\nand granted an injunction to restrain the appellants.The appellants raised the defences of honest practices under section\n\n27(6) of the Trademarks Act (‘s 26(6) TMA’) and fair dealing under section 37 of\n\nthe Copyright Act (‘s 37 CRA’).HELD, ALLOWING THE APPEAL:For the first defence, if any party wished to read more into or\n\nattribute a motive to the notice which contained the copyright work, then the alleged\n\ninfringer must be permitted to explain and to call his witnesses and be subject to\n\ncross-examination. It is not inconceivable that s 27(6) TMA could apply to the situation.\n\nMoreover, it could not be the intention of Parliament to authorise the doing of an act\n\nwhich would infringe a related right, so s 27(6) TMA could well apply to copyright\n\ninfringement actions. The issues surrounding the applicability of this section are of some\n\ncomplexity and require more mature consideration (See [16] – [19]).As for the second defence, s 37 CRA specifically provides for the\n\ndefence of fair dealing to apply to an \"artistic\" work. One of the events relied\n\nupon by the appellants to show that there was confusion occurred a month before the\n\nalleged infringement act, so the question of whether the event was a current one was not\n\nclear cut. The questions of whether there was confusion and whether the event reported was\n\ncurrent raised issues of fact and law which should not be determined summarily (See [25]\n\n– [26], [29]).CASE REFERRED TORA & A Bailey & Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd & Ors6\n\nIPR 279 (refd)British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd & Ors v Armstrong Patents Co\n\nLtd & Ors(1986) 6 IPR 102 (refd)Hubbard v Vosper[1972] 2 QB 84 (refd)Pro Sieben Media AG v Carlton UK Television Ltd[1998] FSR 43\n\n(refd)BBC v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd[1991] 21 IPR 503 (refd)Thompson v Marshall(1880) 41 LTR 720 (flld)European Asian Bank AG v Punjab and Sind Bank (No. 2)[1983] 1 WLR\n\n642 (flld)Home and Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (In\n\nLiquidation)[1990] 1 WLR 153 (flld)LEGISLATION REFERRED TOTradmarks Act (Cap 332), section 27(6)Copyright Act (Cap. 63), section 37[Delivered by\n\nChao Hick Tin JA]JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1        This\n\nwas an appeal against a summary judgment given by the High Court which adjudged that the\n\nappellants, Bee Cheng Hiang Hup Chong Foodstuff Pte Ltd (BCH), had infringed the copyright\n\nof the respondents, Fragrance Foodstuff Pte Ltd (Fragrance), in a certain artistic work\n\nand granted an injunction to restrain BCH. After hearing the parties on the appeal, we set\n\naside the summary judgment and gave BCH unconditional leave to defend the claim. We now\n\ngive our reasons.",
        "The facts": "2        BCH\n\nand Fragrance are both in the business of manufacturing and selling, among others, a type\n\nof sweet barbecue meat which is known here as \"Bakwa\". The business of BCH\n\nstarted earlier in 1930 while Fragrance were only incorporated in April 1990. BCH have\n\nbeen selling their products under a trade mark which consisted of the Chinese character\n\n\"Xiang\" written in a calligraphic form (hereinafter referred to as mark\n\n\"X\"). This mark appears on the left at Annex A.3        \n\nFragrance sell their products under a trade mark which also consists of the Chinese\n\ncharacter \"Xiang\" but represented in a graphical/stylized manner in an oval\n\nframe, with a flicking tongue coming out of a mouth and licking lips and with the English\n\nword \"FRAGRANCE\" set out below that frame (hereinafter referred to as mark\n\n\"Y\"). This mark appears on the right side of Annex A.4        Mark\n\n\"Y\" was created in late 1994 by one Chionh Cher Tin (Chionh) who was specially\n\ncommissioned by Fragrance to produce such a mark (the work). On 5 February 2002, shortly\n\nbefore the institution of the present action, Chionh formally assigned his copyright in\n\nthe work to Fragrance.5        In\n\nJuly 1995, Fragrance registered the work as a trade mark under class 30 covering biscuits,\n\ncakes, pastry and confectionery. At the same time, they also applied to register the work\n\nas a trade mark under class 29 for dried minced pork, pork floss, chicken floss, snack\n\nfoods, etc. However, this application is still pending because of opposition by BCH.6        The\n\nevent which gave rise to the action was an advertisement of a half-page dimension\n\nappearing over two days, on 2 and 3 February 2002, in the local English and Chinese\n\nnewspapers which set out the two marks and stated that BCH and Fragrance are not related\n\ncompanies (the notice). The advertisement is shown at Annex A.7        When\n\nthe advertisements first appeared in the newspapers, the Lunar New Year (LNY) of 2002 was\n\njust ten days away, falling on 12 February 2002. It was common ground that during the\n\nperiod before the LNY, demand by the public for Bakwa was extremely high, as it was an\n\nessential delicacy for the festivities.8        \n\nConcurrently with the publication of the advertisements, BCH also distributed to the\n\npublic pamphlets containing the same notice. Furthermore, on 3 February 2002 the Lianhe\n\nZaobao ran a news report on the notice where it was stated that BCH might continue to\n\npublish the notice to dispel confusion.9        BCH\n\nexplained that the move to issue the notice was prompted by the fact that there was\n\nevidence of confusion on the part of the public. BCH referred to two incidents to\n\nsubstantiate that. First, in 1998, Bloomdale (S) Pte Ltd, a gift and hamper company,\n\nmistakenly advertised in its LNY catalogue the pork and fish floss of Fragrance as those\n\nof BCH. On demand by BCH, Bloomdale had to apologise and make a correction. Secondly, in\n\nthe February 2002 issue ofSingapore Women’s Weeklywhere there was a write up\n\non Fragrance, BCH’s telephone number was given as the telephone number of Fragrance.\n\nThe publisher of the magazine apologised for the mistake stating that the intern who had\n\ndone the write-up had checked the telephone number of Fragrance using the Chinese\n\ncharacter \"Xiang\" not realizing that BCH used a similar logo. The intern wrongly\n\nassumed that BCH’s telephone number was that of Fragrance.10        \n\nFollowing the publication of the notice, correspondence ensued between the parties’\n\nsolicitors, with Fragrance seeking an apology and asking for damages for the infringement\n\nof the copyright in the work. BCH’s solicitors replied explaining why the notice was\n\npublished and rejected the claim of Fragrance. This led to the institution of the present\n\naction by Fragrance, both for copyright and trade mark infringements.11        At\n\nthe same time the suit was filed, Fragrance applied for anex parteinterim\n\ninjunction against BCH in respect of both the alleged copyright and trade mark\n\ninfringements. The application was adjourned to be heardinter-partes. In the\n\nmeantime, after BCH entered appearance to the action, Fragrance applied for summary\n\njudgment against BCH in respect of the alleged copyright infringement. Both applications\n\ncame before the judge-in-chambers who granted summary judgment in favour of Fragrance by\n\nthe issue of an injunction restraining BCH from infringing Fragrance’s copyright in\n\nthe work, with a caveat that until the trial of the action, Fragrance would not take any\n\nfurther steps or execution proceedings. In the light of BCH’s undertaking that they\n\nwould not further publish the notice until trial, no order for an interim injunction was\n\nmade by the court in respect of the alleged trade mark infringement.",
        "Issues": "12        It\n\nwas not disputed that BCH did, without the consent of Fragrance, reproduce and publish\n\nFragrance’s trade mark in the notice which BCH issued. By so publishing the trade\n\nmark of Fragrance, there wasprima facieinfringement of Fragrance’s copyright\n\nin the work. Before us, BCH raised two main defences, which were also raised in the court\n\nbelow.(i) Section 27(6) of the\n\n    Trademarks Act;(ii) Section 37 of the Copyright\n\n    Act",
        "Section 27(6)": "13        We\n\nshall deal with the two defences in turn. Section 27(6) of the Trade Marks Act provides:Nothing in subsections (1) to (5)\n\n    shall be construed as preventing the use of a registered trade mark by any person for the\n\n    purpose of identifying goods or services as those of the proprietor or a licensee, but any\n\n    such use otherwise than in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial\n\n    matters shall be treated as infringing the registered trade mark if the use without due\n\n    cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute\n\n    of the trade mark.14        BCH\n\nargued that the reproduction of mark Y in the notice was for the purpose of identifying\n\ngoods or services as those of Fragrance. However, this was not accepted by the judge below\n\nwho held that (at 37):-\"I accepted\n\n    (Fragrance’s) interpretation of the advertisements/notices as containing a subtle\n\n    suggestion that the defendants’ goods had been confused with those of the\n\n    plaintiffs’ which were inferior to the defendants’, that the plaintiffs were\n\n    responsible for such confusion and, that the plaintiffs copied the defendants’ logo.\n\n    The situation was aggravated by Wong’s subsequent press statements.\"15        The\n\njudge went on to remark that what was objectionable about the notice was the fact that BCH\n\ndid not disclose therein that in registering their trade mark they had disclaimed the\n\nexclusive use of the Chinese word \"Xiang\", except in the form in which that word\n\nappeared in their mark. The judge seemed to indicate that she was unable to accept the\n\nargument that s 27(6) applied because the motive of BCH was wrong.16        On\n\nour part, we would like to make three observations on the defence based on s 27(6).\n\nFirstly, and with respect, we thought the judge read more into the notice than is\n\nwarranted. As is clear from the notice which appeared at Annex A, the notice merely stated\n\nthat mark ‘X’ belonged to BCH and mark ‘Y’ belonged to Fragrance, and\n\nit also informed the public that the two marks are not the same and that the two companies\n\nare not related. If any party wished to read more into it or to attribute a motive to the\n\nnotice, then the alleged infringer must be permitted to explain and to call his witnesses\n\nand be subject to cross-examination. On a disputed question such as this, it should not be\n\nresolved on the basis of affidavit evidence, without the benefit of cross-examination.\n\nThis was where we found some difficulties with the approach of the judge.17        \n\nSecond, we did not think it was possible to contend, just from the manner in which mark\n\n‘Y’ was depicted in the notice, that s 27(6) could not conceivably apply to the\n\nsituation. On the face of it, it is certainly open to BCH to argue that mark ‘Y’\n\nwas reproduced to identify the goods of Fragrance. The two marks were given equal\n\nprominence. The purpose of it all was to inform the public that the two marks are\n\ndifferent and the two companies are not related. We would hasten to add that, at this\n\njuncture, it would not be appropriate for us to say more, as the entire case will be\n\nproceeding to trial and this question has to be determined by the trial judge in the light\n\nof the evidence adduced before him.18        \n\nThirdly, and assuming s 27(6) is applicable to the situation in hand, BCH contended that\n\ntheir act of reproducing mark ‘Y’ for the purposes approved under that section\n\ncould not conceivably be in infringement of the copyright in the work forming mark\n\n‘Y’. There must be an implied permission, in so far as copyright is concerned.\n\nIt could not be the intention of Parliament to authorize the doing of an act which would\n\ninfringe a related right. We should also add that BCH had also put the argument in this\n\nalternative way: in electing to use the work as a trade mark, Fragrance must be taken to\n\nhave granted an implied licence for other traders to deal with that work in a manner that\n\nis not inconsistent with its status as a trade mark.19        In\n\nour opinion, the issues surrounding the applicability of s 27(6) are certainly of some\n\ncomplexity and require more mature consideration. It is true that inRA & A Bailey\n\n& Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd & Ors6 IPR 279 (Bailey’s case), a\n\ncase which did not involve the consideration of a provision similar to that of s 27(6),\n\nYoung J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, said at 290:-\"Apart from theBritish\n\n    Leylandcase there has not been as far as I know any judicial indication of any policy\n\n    of the law that where a person has more than one industrial property right, it can only\n\n    avail it of the protection afforded to one of those rights and where there is a conflict\n\n    it is copyright which is disregarded.\"20        But\n\nit seems to us that these views may have to be confined to the material facts of that\n\ncase. There, the plaintiff, a manufacturer of the \"Bailey’s Original Irish\n\nCream\", made arrangement with third parties to import and distribute the product in\n\nAustralia in bottles with an elaborate pictorial label (Australian label), part of which\n\nwas registered as a trade mark. The defendant imported the same product bearing an almost\n\nidentical label which was distributed by the plaintiff in the Netherlands. It was admitted\n\nthat the Australian label was an artistic work which enjoyed copyright. Young J held that\n\nthe importation and sale of the Dutch bottle by the defendants did not infringe the\n\nAustralian trade mark but it constituted infringement of the plaintiff’s copyright.21        As\n\nindicated before, Young J declined to follow the House of Lords’ decision inBritish\n\nLeyland Motor Corporation Ltd & Ors v Armstrong Patents Co Ltd & Ors(1986) 6\n\nIPR 102, where the House held that it was not a breach of copyright for the defendants to\n\nproduce parts to repair vehicles by producing a copy of the relevant exhaust pipe. Some of\n\nthe judgments of their Lordships would appear to be based on the principle of\n\nnon-derogation from the grant rather than implied licence. In the words of Lord Templemen\n\n(at p. 129):-\"BL own the car and the\n\n    copyright in a drawing of an exhaust pipe fitted to the car. BL sell the car and retain\n\n    the copyright. The exercise by BL of their copyright in the drawing will render the car\n\n    unfit for the purpose for which the car is held. BL cannot exercise their copyright so as\n\n    to prevent the car being repaired by replacement of the exhaust pipe.A purchaser of a patented article\n\n    may carry out repairs to it without being held liable for infringement.\"22        Of\n\ncourse, the situation inBritish Leylandis quite different from that prevailing in\n\nthe present case which concerns the scope of s 27(6). The position inBailey’s\n\ncaseis also dissimilar. The general principles might well be as stated by Young J\n\nthat \"a person who has both a trade mark and copyright isgenerallyentitled\n\nto protection against both.\" But could it really be the intention of Parliament in\n\nenacting s 27(6) that while Parliament sanctioned the reproduction of a trade mark for the\n\npurposes of identifying the goods or services of the owner of the trade mark, it\n\nnevertheless leaves the defendant open to an action on a related ground of infringement of\n\ncopyright? No authority from any other jurisdictions was cited to us which touched on the\n\napplication or interpretation of an equivalent provision. Thus, in our opinion, the point\n\ndeserves fuller ventilation.",
        "Fair dealing": "23        We\n\nnow turn to consider the second defence of fair dealing, which is set out in section 37 of\n\nthe Copyright Act as follows:-\"A fair dealing with a\n\n    literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, or with an adaptation of a literary,\n\n    dramatic or musical work, shall not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the\n\n    work if it is for the purpose of, or is associated with, the reporting of current events\n\n    –(a)    in a\n\n      newspaper, magazine or similar periodical and a sufficient acknowledgment of the work is\n\n      made;or(b)    by means of\n\n      broadcasting or a cable programme service or in a cinematograph film.\"24        As\n\nis implicit from the wording of the provision, fair dealing can only apply where there is\n\nan element of public interest. On this, the judge held that, first, the matter was only of\n\ninterest to the parties and not to the general public. Second, she felt that the question\n\nof confusion between the two marks could not be qualified as current events, as the two\n\nincidents of confusion occurred some time ago. Third, in reliance on a passage of Lord\n\nDenning MR inHubbard v Vosper[1972] 2 QB 84 at 94-95, she said that this defence\n\nunder s 37 is not available to an artistic work.25        It\n\nseems to us that the third point made by the judge could hardly be sustained. Section 37\n\nspecifically provides for a \"fair dealing with a literary …artisticwork\". To say that there cannot be \"fair dealing\" with an artistic work\n\nwould be contrary to what is plainly provided for in the section itself. We should mention\n\nthat inHubbard v Vosper(at p.98),Megaw LJ even contemplated a case in\n\nwhich the quotation of an entire short work might be fair dealing.26        As\n\nregards the first and second points made by the judge relating to the questions of\n\nconfusion and whether it was a current event, we think these are questions which require\n\nmore in depth exploration, with evidence to be adduced before the court. Both parties\n\noperate numerous retail outlets throughout Singapore, with BCH having 22 outlets and\n\nFragrance, 16. If there was, in fact, confusion in the mind of some members of the public,\n\nthat could conceivably constitute a \"current event\". The fact that Lianhe Zaobao\n\ncarried a news report on 3 February 2002 on the alleged confusion is some evidence of the\n\nmatter being a \"current event\" and it being a matter of some public interest.\n\nThe judge also seemed to think that the events was dated. But one of the event relied upon\n\nby BCH to show that there was confusion occurred in January/February 2002, the February\n\n2002 issue ofSingapore Women’s Weekly. So the question, of whether the event\n\nwas dated, was not clear-cut. Besides, the Copyright Act does not define what is a\n\n\"current event\".27        InPro\n\nSieben Media AG v Carlton UK Television Ltd[1998] FSR 43 Laddie J said that the\n\ndefence was concerned with \"allowing fair use of copyright material for the purpose\n\nof reporting matters of current, as opposed to historical, interest or concern.\" This\n\ncase went on appeal where Walker LJ said (at [1999] FSR 610 at 620) that ‘reporting\n\ncurrent events’ was an expression of wide and indefinite scope. \"Any attempt to\n\nplot their precise boundaries is doomed to failure … (it) should be interpreted\n\nliberally.\"28        InBBC\n\nv British SkyBroadcasting Ltd[1991] 21 IPR 503, two points made by Scott J\n\nwere pertinent. First, there was no justification for limiting the defence so as to apply\n\nonly to reporting current events in a general news programme. Second, the fact that the\n\nalleged infringer was a commercial rival of the copyright owner did not,ipso facto,\n\ntake the case outside fair dealing.29        We\n\nmust stress that this court is not, at this stage, offering any definitive views on the\n\ndefence under s 37. What was uppermost in our mind was that both the points,\n\n‘confusion’ and ‘current event’, raised issues of fact and law which\n\nshould not be determined summarily.30        The\n\njudge below said that she did not believe that consumers were actually confused by the two\n\ntrade marks. She expressed scepticism on the instance of confusion cited by BCH where a\n\nFragrance’s customer attempted to exchange product at a BCH outlet as she could not\n\n\"imagine how customers of perishable products like barbecued pork would be allowed to\n\nexchange what they had purchased unless the packing contained expiry dates and their\n\npurchases had indeed expired at the time they bought the same\". It should be\n\nremembered that besides Bakwa, the parties also sold other products. Some of the products\n\nsold could well have been properly sealed. In the particular instance mentioned, it was\n\nvacuum packed sausage. It is possible that a customer may want to change what he has\n\nbought not because of any expiry date but because he has changed his mind as to what he\n\nwants. It seems to us these are matters which should be gone into. It is true that a mere\n\nassertion does not,ipso facto, give a party a right to defend an action. Much\n\nwould depend on the nature of the assertion and the circumstances relating thereto. But in\n\nrelation to this matter, we thought the judge should have heard the evidence before she\n\nmade the finding that the allegation of BCH that a customer who bought Fragrance’s\n\nproduct had come to make an exchange at a BCH outlet could not be true.",
        "Conclusion": "31        For\n\nthe above reasons, we came to the conclusion that it was not appropriate to grant summary\n\njudgment in this case. We agree that if the suggested defence in a case is on a point of\n\nlaw and the court can see that the point is misconceived or unsustainable, judgment should\n\nbe given. But this is not such a case. There are factual matters here which have to be\n\ngone into and difficult questions of law which require mature consideration.32        \n\nHowever, there is one other circumstance which we think also suggest that this is a case\n\nwhich ought to go for trial. The main object of summary judgment is to prevent delay and\n\nto enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment where there is plainly no defence to the\n\nclaim: seeThompson v Marshall(1880) 41 LTR 720,European Asian Bank AG v\n\nPubjab and Sind Bank (No.2)[1983] 1 WLR 642 at 654 per Robert Goff LJ andHome and\n\nOverseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (In Liquidation) [1990] 1 WLR\n\n153 at 158 per Parker LJ. Here, the summary judgment granted by the court below was only\n\nin respect of a part of the action. There will still have to be a trial in respect of the\n\ntrade mark infringement claim. As the claim in copyright is so closely linked with the\n\nclaim in trade mark, there is really little advantage in granting summary judgment for the\n\ncopyright claim alone. There will hardly be any saving in terms of time and effort. The\n\nfact that the judge below in granting the summary judgment added a rider that there be no\n\nexecution until trial and had refused to grant an order as to damages for the infringement\n\nis clear indication of the close connection between the two claims. Moreover, it also\n\nseems to us that the claim for copyright infringement was viewed very much by the judge\n\nbelow as incidental to the main claim for trade mark infringement, as she did not grant an\n\norder for an inquiry as to damages in respect of the copyright infringement.Sgd:CHAO HICK TINTAN LEE MENGJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGEAnnex A - pleaseclick\n\nhereto view.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
