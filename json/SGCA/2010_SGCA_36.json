        "Introduction": "1       The assessment of damages is almost always of the first importance to\n                    plaintiffs (including the plaintiff in the present proceedings). This is only\n                    natural given that a plaintiff who has been legally wronged would surely want to\n                    know how the wrong (or wrongs) is (or are) to be redressed (often, as is the\n                    case here, in monetary terms). It has also commonly been said – quite\n                    correctly, in our view – that the assessment of damages is not a\n                    mechanistic process. To be sure, there are legal rules and principles which\n                    guide the court. However, theirapplicationis\n                    often not an easy process. As we shall see, this is in fact precisely the\n                    situation in the present proceedings. There have been clear – and\n                    continuing – breaches on the part of the defendants (who are the\n                    appellants in both the appeals before us (“the Appellants”)).\n                    However, the Appellants have sought – most vigorously, in fact\n                        - to convince us that, notwithstanding their blatant\n                    breaches of contract (and see below at[13]–[17]), the\n                    plaintiff’s (who is the respondent in both appeals (“the\n                    Respondent”)) loss is unconnected with such breaches. Indeed, much of the\n                    argument before this court was spent on the issue of causation – or,\n                    rather, the absence of causation, in so far as the Appellants are\n                    concerned. 2       The Appellants also had a fallback argument: if, indeed, their breaches had\n                    caused loss to the Respondent, the Respondent (so the argument ran) was\n                    nevertheless the main author of its loss. In essence, the thrust of the\n                    Appellants’ argument is that the Respondent was already suffering from a\n                    decline in sales in any event and, hence, is not entitled to seek substantial\n                    monetary compensation (in the form of damages) from the Appellants. The\n                    Appellants say that the Respondent can (at best) claim only a relatively small\n                    amount of damages. 3       There is yet another – albeit more subsidiary – issue. However,\n                    even this issue sees the Appellants attempting to argue that damages should be\n                    denied to the Respondent. This relates to loss or damage that was allegedly\n                    caused to the Respondentafterthe breaches of\n                    contract,viz, thepost-breach situation. In particular, the Appellants have sought\n                    to argue that the loss inthisparticular\n                    situation istoo remote. Although, as just\n                    mentioned, this is not one of the main issues in the present appeal, it\n                    certainly raises the spectre of a recent House of Lords decision, at least part\n                    of which differs (quite radically) in legal orientation from a decision of this\n                    court. As thelegal principlesinvolved are of the\n                    first importance for future cases, and the legal conundrum emanates from the\n                    highest appellate court in England, we must deal with it in the present appeals\n                    – not least because if, in particular, one of the legal propositions made\n                    in the House of Lords decision is correct, then the law which has stood for a\n                    century and a half (and which has been endorsed by this court) will change (and\n                    rather radically at that). 4       The result of all this is a curious compendium of both difficult issues of\n                    application as well as a difficult issue of law. In short, both particulars and\n                    universals have raised rather thorny questions that we must resolve. What began\n                    as a deceptively simple set of legal proceedings has metamorphosed into a rather\n                    complex mixture of factual and legal conundrums impacting on the issue of\n                    justice and fairness not only for the parties to the present appeals but also\n                    (in relation to the legal rules and principles centring on remoteness of damage)\n                    for future litigants as well. 5       It is best, in the circumstances, to begin from the beginning – in\n                    particular, with the basic factual matrix which constitutes the backdrop against\n                    which the various legal issues have arisen.",
        "The factual background": "",
        "General": "40     We now come to the present appeals. The Appellants appealed on the ground that\n                    the Judge erred in establishing causation by inferences from the relevant\n                    evidence. First, they contended that the fact that Fish & Co was\n                    already making losses before the Breach Period shows that its alleged losses\n                    during the Breach Period were not caused by MFM. For this proposition, the\n                    Appellants highlighted the fact that, although the restaurant trade had improved\n                    by 4.6 per cent in 2004 relative to 2003, Glass House’s performance\n                    was worse by 5.76 per cent (see[44]below for the 2008 statistics published by the Department of Statistics for\n                    the restaurant industry in Singapore (“the 2008 Statistics”)).\n                    Therefore, Fish & Co had already been underperforming in relation\n                    to the industry average before the breaches, and, in fact, performed better\n                    during the Breach Period when its percentage of sales improved from\n                    -5.76 per cent to -4 per cent. Secondly, they contended that the fact\n                    that losses continued to be experienced by Fish & Co after the\n                    breaches had ceased indicated the lack of causation, since there had to be\n                    causes other than the Appellants’ breaches that were generating those\n                    losses. Thirdly, they contended that the Respondent had not proven its losses\n                    during the Breach Period. In particular, there was no independent survey or\n                    witnesses called by the Respondent to prove its claim for damages. Therefore,\n                    they contended that the Respondent had not discharged its burden of\n                    proof. 41     The Respondent, on the other hand, contended that assessment of damages is not\n                    an exact science and that the courts adopt a common sense approach. Therefore,\n                    there was no need for market surveys and the Judge had correctly inferred that\n                    Fish & Co had suffered losses due to the Appellants’\n                    breaches based on the factors which she had set out. In so far as the allegation\n                    that Fish & Co was already making losses before the Breach Period\n                    was concerned, the Respondent contended that the Appellants had misread the\n                    statistics, and that, in fact, Fish & Co’s management\n                    accounts showed that Glass House was reducing its losses during the Pre-Breach\n                    Period by 2.69 per cent annually. Thus, if this upward trend continued,\n                    Glass House would have performed with almost no losses by January 2006. However,\n                    this was derailed with the opening of MFM in May 2005. 42     In the alternative, the Appellants contended that the Judge had erred in her\n                    quantification of damages. The Appellants argued that the AR was correct to use\n                    the revised Method A (ie, Method C);\n                    that Method B was akin to an account of profits; and that even if\n                    Method B was correct, the Judge failed to take into account the fact that,\n                    prior to the Breach Period, Fish & Co was already performing below\n                    the industry average. 43     In response to the (alternative) arguments made by the Appellants in the\n                    preceding paragraph, the Respondent contended that the Judge had correctly\n                    rejected Method C on the basis that the new parameters distorted the\n                    calculations; that the Judge correctly applied the percentage of 16 per\n                    cent to Method B, which was a loss-based approach and not an account of\n                    profits; and that the 2008 Statistics ought not to be admitted into\n                    evidence, and, in any event, had been misapplied by the Appellants.",
        "The Appellants’ conduct": "13     Before we proceed further, we would like to note the Appellants’ conduct\n                    throughout the breach period. We agree with the Judge’s view that the\n                    breaches were “deliberate” and constituted “flagrant\n                    contravention of the [Appellants’] undertakings with a view to their own\n                    financial gain or reward” (see the Judgment at [37]). 14     The Respondent alleged that despite the fact that it had sent numerous\n                    reminders to the Appellants to remind them of their legal obligations pursuant\n                    to the Settlement Deed, the Appellants did not act on the matter. This left it\n                    with little choice but to commence legal proceedings against the Appellants on\n                    20 September 2005. Before us, the Appellants took pains to emphasise that\n                    the breaches of the undertakings were not deliberate. The Appellants contended\n                    that, having been notified by the Respondent through its solicitor’s\n                    letter dated 5 July 2005 of the breaches of the Slogans and Phrases\n                    undertakings, the Appellants promptly responded and stopped the breaches by the\n                    first week of November 2005. We question, however, if it was necessary to take\n                    four months for this to be done. 15     Even if we accept that the Appellants acted promptly with regard to the\n                    Slogans and Phrases undertakings, the breaches of the Sauces and Pans\n                    undertakings presented quite a different situation. In particular, we find that\n                    there was a deliberate attempt by the Appellants to disregard the Settlement\n                    Deed. The Appellants contended that, to comply with the Sauces undertaking, MFM\n                    varied its sauce, for example, by using margarine instead of butter, and by\n                    using freshly squeezed bottled lemon instead of lemon concentrate, as well as by\n                    varying the quantities of the various ingredients. The Appellants further\n                    contended that the reason for the delay in compliance with the relevant terms of\n                    the Settlement Deed was due to the parties’ inability to agree on who to\n                    appoint as a neutral third party taste expert. The Respondent claimed that, as a\n                    neutral third party could not be agreed upon, this option was no longer pursued\n                    upon the commencement of the suit. It is noted that, pursuant to cl 3(xiii)\n                    of the Settlement Deed, parties were at liberty to commence legal proceedings in\n                    the event that the identity of the neutral third party was not agreed upon. The\n                    Respondent also stated that joint attempts to appoint a court expert after the\n                    suit commenced likewise failed. In our view, the inability to jointly appoint a\n                    neutral third party (and subsequently a court expert) which both parties could\n                    agree upon is hardly a satisfactory reason for breaching the Sauces undertaking\n                    given that the Appellants could, if they were minded to do so, have easily\n                    lengthened the process by not agreeing to any of the experts proposed by the\n                    Respondent. 16     In so far as the Pans undertaking was concerned, the Appellants explained that\n                    the Respondent’s Fish & Co outlets in Singapore have ceased\n                    to use black pans and had changed to stainless steel pans. Therefore, the\n                    Appellants were under the impression that it would be able to retain the use of\n                    black pans in its restaurants. In fact, even in their submissions before this\n                    court, the Appellants sought to assert that, despite entering into the Consent\n                    Judgment, they were not admitting to liability for breaching the Pans\n                    undertaking, which we found to be odd given that they had agreed for damages to\n                    be assessed and did not refute their liabilities for breaching the other three\n                    undertakings. In any case, we find the Appellants’ explanations to be\n                    unconvincing. The issue of the pans had already been raised in the earlier\n                    proceedings taken out by the Respondent against Dickson for the alleged breach\n                    of his employment contract. Part of the reason for the grace period factored\n                    into the Settlement Deed was precisely to accord the Appellants adequate time to\n                    comply with the agreement. Further, we find that it was not sufficient that the\n                    Appellants used different coloured pans, given that what was more significant\n                    (and, indeed, that was what the undertakings in the Settlement Deed were\n                    targeted at) was the concept of serving food out of a pan. Indeed, it was not\n                    necessary for the Appellants to use identical serving pans before they could be\n                    in breach of cl 3(i) of the Settlement Deed, so long as the pans themselves\n                    were similar. 17     Further, we note that the Appellants waited till thefirst\n                        day of trialbefore consenting to judgment (and admitting\n                    liability). Considering the totality of the evidence, we find that the\n                    Appellants had deliberately ignored their undertakings in the Settlement Deed\n                    with the intention of profiteering from the breaches. The Appellants also sought\n                    to downplay the significance of the undertakings by contending that they were\n                    minor, and did not impact on the minds of the consumers. However, if this was\n                    so, we question the Appellants’ decision to contest the suit so vigorously\n                    only to concede liability on the first day of trial.",
        "The assessment of damages before the AR": "Introduction 18     Before the AR, the Respondent claimed damages for two time periods. The first\n                    was the period between August 2005 and January 2007 (“the Breach\n                    Period”),ie, when the breaches occurred.\n                    The second was the period thereafter (“the Post-Breach Period”),ie, when the breaches had ceased but its\n                    effects continued to result in losses to the Respondent. However, as noted\n                    above, the Slogans and Phrases undertakings were complied with by the first week\n                    of November 2005 (ie, before January 2007). In the\n                    circumstances, therefore, the terms “the Breach Period” and\n                    “the Post-Breach Period” are not, strictly speaking, accurate.\n                    However, given the way in which the arguments were made as well as for\n                    convenience of exposition, we will make reference to these two time\n                    periods. The issue of causation 19     The Respondent alleged that, as a result of the non-compliances with the\n                    Settlement Deed, there was no differentiation between MFM and\n                    Fish & Co restaurants, resulting in misrepresentation and\n                    confusion in the market. Therefore, Fish & Co’s sales were\n                    affected by the Appellants’ breaches. Further, as a result of the\n                    non-compliances, MFM had gained an accelerated entry into the market and could\n                    therefore gain market share quickly by stealing Fish & Co’s\n                    market share and sales, thereby diluting the Respondent’s goodwill in the\n                    Fish & Co concept. Essentially, the Respondent relied on empirical\n                    evidence that its profits had been reduced since the inception of MFM to\n                    demonstrate that the Appellants’ breaches had caused its losses. The\n                    Respondent further relied on the English decision ofDraper v\n                        Trist and Tristbestos Brake Linings, Ld(1939) 56 RPC 429, a\n                    case involving passing-off, to argue that the innocent party need not adduce\n                    evidence of confusion in order to recover substantial damages. 20     The Appellants argued that consenting to judgment did not amount to an\n                    admission that any damages were payable upon an assessment, and that, therefore,\n                    the burden of proof remained on the Respondent to prove its losses. The\n                    Appellants alleged that the Respondent had not discharged its burden of proof.\n                    First, the Respondent’s Fish & Co restaurants were already\n                    making losses before the Breach Period. Second, the Respondent had not adduced\n                    evidence, through (for example) a market survey to demonstrate the alleged\n                    effects of the Appellants’ breaches. Third, the losses suffered by the\n                    Respondent subsequent to the Breach Period (ie,\n                    during the Post-Breach Period) were too remote. The methodologies employed to estimate the Respondent’s loss of\n                profits 21     Each party also appointed its own expert witness to calculate the damages owed\n                    by the Appellants to the Respondent. The expert witness for the Respondent,\n                    Mr Tony Samuel (“Mr Samuel”), proposed two measures of\n                    calculations, which he termed as Methods A and B, respectively. Before\n                    describing the basis of both calculations, it must be noted that\n                    Mr Samuel’s quantification of damages was premised on the assumption\n                    that the Respondent did in fact suffer losses during the Breach and Post-Breach\n                    Periods as a result of the Appellants’ breaches of the Settlement Deed.\n                    Mr Samuel’s calculations cannot therefore be employed to determine\n                    the causation issue, although, to the extent that a trend of loss in profits can\n                    be observed, that would be part of the empirical evidence and therefore add\n                    credence to the allegation that the Respondent’s profits were affected by\n                    the Appellants’ breaches. For convenience of exposition, the explanation\n                    below of Methods A and B will assume that all of the Respondent’s\n                    lost profits may be attributed to the Appellants’ breaches. The actual\n                    extent of the Respondent’s loss of profits attributable to the\n                    Appellants’ breaches will be discussed further later. (1)   Method A 22     Method A involved a comparison of the sales figures for\n                    Fish & Co restaurants affected by the Appellants’ actions\n                    with the sales figures of Fish & Co restaurants which werenotaffected by the same actions.\n                    Method A assumed that, but for the Appellants’ actions, the relative\n                    performance of both sets of restaurants would have been consistent during the\n                    pre-breach period from February 2004 to August 2005 (“the Pre-Breach\n                    Period”), as well as the Breach and Post-Breach Periods. First,\n                    Mr Samuel assumed that four of the Respondent’s city-based\n                    Fish & Co outlets,viz, the outlets\n                    at Glass House, Bugis Junction, Centrepoint Shopping Centre\n                    (“Centrepoint”) and Suntec City Mall (“the Affected\n                    Restaurants”) were affected by the Appellants’ actions and that\n                    four of its suburban outlets,viz, Novena Square,\n                    Jurong Point Shopping Centre, Tampines Mall and Parkway Parade (“the\n                    Unaffected Restaurants”) were not affected. A fifth city outlet at\n                    Wheelock Place was not included in the calculations as it only commenced\n                    business during the Breach Period. The distances of the Affected Restaurants and\n                    Wheelock Place from the First Appellant’s MFM restaurant at Plaza\n                    Singapura are as follows:[note: 3] OutletDistance from Plaza Singapura (kilometres)Glass House0.28Centrepoint0.62Bugis Junction1.16Suntec City Mall1.67Wheelock Place1.69   23     Mr Samuel then compared the average monthly sales of the Affected\n                    Restaurants with the average monthly sales of the Unaffected Restaurants for a\n                    period before, and a period after, the MFM restaurant opened. Based on this\n                    data, he found that, during the Pre-Breach Period, the sales of the Affected\n                    Restaurant exceeded the sales of the Unaffected Restaurants by an average\n                    percentage difference of 14.9 per cent. He undertook the same exercise for\n                    the Breach Period and derived an average percentage of 3.8 per cent. Based\n                    on the assumptions made, Mr Samuel concluded that, but for the\n                    Appellants’ actions, the average sales of the Affected Restaurants would\n                    have continued to exceed the average sales of the Unaffected Restaurants by\n                    14.9 per cent. He then deducted an estimate of the additional costs and\n                    expenses that Fish & Co would have had to incur to earn the\n                    additional revenue in order to determine lost profits. 24     Employing this methodology, Mr Samuel found that\n                    Fish & Co’s loss of profits during the Breach Period\n                    amounted to $553,100.12. As for the quantification ofpost-breach losses, Method A was utilised by multiplying an\n                    estimated average loss per month by half the number of months it was assumed\n                    that MFM would have benefitted. The reason half the number of months were used\n                    in this last mentioned regard was to factor in a tapering decrease in influence\n                    of the breaches,ie, that the further removed from\n                    the time the breaches occurred, the less their influence on\n                    Fish & Co’s sales. (2)   Method B 25     Method B assumed that part of the revenue earned by MFM was a result of\n                    the Appellants’ breaches and sought to calculate\n                    Fish & Co’s loss of profits by multiplying the revenue\n                    earned by MFM as a result of the breaches by the profit margin that\n                    Fish & Co would have made on that revenue. Mr Samuel first\n                    calculated the variable profit margin of Fish & Co, that is, the\n                    proportion of its revenue which Fish & Co earns as profits (taking\n                    into account the cost of food and other variable expenses). He then made another\n                    assumption that a certain proportion of the revenue earned by MFM was\n                    attributable to the breaches. However, he was unable to determine the exact\n                    proportion of MFM’s revenue that was attributable to the breaches, and\n                    thus he assumed and utilised a range of 10–50 per cent. The profit\n                    margin was then applied to this range of percentages (of MFM’s revenue\n                    attributable to the breaches) to derive a range of loss of profits for\n                    Fish & Co. 26     Employing this methodology, Mr Samuel found that the variable profit\n                    margin was 52.38 per cent, excluding rent adjustments. In other words, if,\n                    as found by Mr Samuel, MFM’s actual sales during the Breach Period\n                    amounted to $3,007,500, this would have translated to $697,400 of lost profits\n                    for Fish & Co (with rent adjustments), assuming that 50 per\n                    cent of MFM’s revenue was attributable to the breaches and that all the\n                    revenue earned by MFM would have been earned by\n                        Fish & Co.[note: 4]In so far as the Post-Breach Period was concerned, this was again\n                    calculated by multiplying an estimated average loss per month by half the\n                    effective number of months it was assumed that MFM would benefit, and\n                    Fish & Co would (correspondingly) suffer from the breaches. (3)   Mr Sajjad Ahmad Akhtar’s report 27     The Appellants’ expert report was presented by Mr Sajjad Ahmad\n                    Akhtar (“Mr Akhtar”). He compared the sales for the month for\n                    each of the Respondent’s Fish & Co outlets with the\n                    corresponding sales for the month in the previous year. He opined that, if the\n                    Appellants’ breaches had affected Fish & Co’s sales, a\n                    pattern showing a steady growth trend in sales during the Pre-Breach Period, a\n                    decline during the Breach Period, followed by a rise after the Breach Period\n                    would have been seen. As this was not present, Mr Akhtar concluded that the\n                    breaches had no significant financial impact on Fish & Co’s\n                    sales performance. (4)   The AR’s decision on methodology 28     With respect to the issue of causation, the AR found, firstly, that the type\n                    of damages sought by the Respondent were not too remote, and were in the\n                    reasonable contemplation of the parties as constituting the result of the\n                    breaches at the time the Settlement Deed was entered into. Secondly, he found\n                    that the only outlet affected by the Appellants’ breaches was the Glass\n                    House outlet. This was based on the Respondent’s witnesses’ own\n                    evidence that cannibalisation was minimal as each outlet occupied a different\n                    market segment and that such factors were considered before the decision was\n                    taken to open a new outlet. Thus, the First Appellant’s MFM outlet at\n                    Plaza Singapura would only have affected the Respondent’s\n                    Fish & Co outlet within the same market segment,viz, the Glass House outlet. 29     In so far as the question of quantification of damages was concerned, the AR\n                    also found that it would be more appropriate to adoptMethod Aas it centred on the losses to\n                    Fish & Co, as opposed toMethod Bwhich centred on the profits of MFM. Secondly,\n                    taking a commonsense approach, and emphasising, in particular, the significance\n                    of Fish & Co’s “Seafood in a Pan” concept but\n                    taking into account MFM as genuine competition independent of the breaches, the\n                    AR held that it would be just to attribute 60 per cent of the losses caused\n                    to the Respondent by the breaches of the Appellants. Thirdly, the Respondent\n                    would also be entitled to damages based on a period of 12 months after the\n                    breaches had stopped as 12 months was a reasonable time for the public to\n                    realise that the breaches had ceased and that MFM restaurants were distinct from\n                    Fish & Co restaurants. 30     In the circumstances, the AR ordered that Method A be utilised,albeit using new parameters(this will be referred to asMethod Cin this judgment). In other\n                    words, Method C employed the methodology in Method A, but changed its\n                    assumptions. Under Method C, Glass House would be the only outlet affected,\n                    and its sales were to be compared with the other three city-based outlets,viz, the outlets at Bugis Junction,\n                    Centrepoint and Suntec City Mall, which were unaffected by the breaches\n                    (“the New Unaffected Restaurants”). (5)   Method C 31     Mr Samuel was of the view that Method C was unsafe. This was\n                    because, whereas in his earlier calculations (under Method A), the\n                    performance of the (original four) Unaffected Restaurants was fairly consistent,\n                    with the new parameters, the performance of one outlet (Centrepoint) was clearly\n                    not aligned with that of the (other) New Unaffected Restaurants. He was\n                    therefore of the view that the Centrepoint outlet appeared to be affected by\n                    events which did not affect the other two outlets and, therefore, its inclusion\n                    in the equation would distort the calculation of loss, unless it could be\n                    determined whether the unexplained event or events were equally relevant to\n                    Glass House. He also observed that the decline in the performances of the Suntec\n                    City Mall and Bugis Junction outlets in the five months up to January 2007\n                    needed to be explained, as they contributed substantially to the overall average\n                    results of the restaurants during the Breach Period. Therefore, he was of the\n                    view that it would be unsafe to use Method C. 32     Based on Mr Akhtar’s calculations, in eight of the 18 months\n                    during the Breach Period, Glass House in fact derived more revenue than the\n                    revenue it estimated that it would obtain had there been no breach. Offsetting\n                    the gains from the losses, Mr Akhtar was of the opinion that, on the basis\n                    that 60 per cent of Fish & Co’s loss of revenue was\n                    attributable to MFM, the Respondent should be awarded $14,060. 33     Mr Samuel, on the other hand, was of the view that Mr Akhtar’s\n                    calculations demonstrated precisely why Method C was unsafe, since it would\n                    be illogical that in eight of the 18 months, Glass House performed better\n                    than it was predicted to have performed without MFM’s presence, given the\n                    finding that the Appellants’ breaches had caused loss to\n                    Fish & Co. The AR’s final decision 34     The AR relied on Mr Akhtar’s calculations in arriving at his final\n                    decision in respect of the application of Method C to the fact situation\n                    before him. However, he was of the view that it was not necessary to set off the\n                    gains made from the losses, as, under contract law, the plaintiff was entitled\n                    to damages arising from a breach but need not pay over its profits. Therefore,\n                    the AR awarded a total sum of $72,688 to the Respondent. The AR further awarded\n                    costs on an indemnity basis based on the agreement between the parties under the\n                    Settlement Deed. As the Respondent reasonably supposed that damages awarded\n                    would be within the High Court’s jurisdiction, the AR awarded such costs\n                    based on the High Court scale.",
        "The appeals against the AR’s decision": "35     The Appellants appealed against the whole of the AR’s decision. Just as\n                    they had earlier contended before the AR, the Appellants argued that there was\n                    no evidence of loss suffered by the Respondent as a result of their breaches.\n                    They further submitted that the Respondent (and the AR) wrongly applied\n                    passing-off arguments to the present claim, which was based, instead, on a\n                    breach of contract. 36     The Respondent cross-appealed on the ground that the damages awarded by the AR\n                    were too low. It contended that the AR should have applied Method A with\n                    the original parameters unchanged; that the proportion of the Respondent’s\n                    loss of profits attributable to the Appellants’ breaches should be at\n                    least 80 per cent (as opposed to 60 per cent); and that the\n                    Post-Breach Period should be increased to between 18 and 24 months (as\n                    opposed to 12 months as held by the AR).",
        "The Judge’s decision": "37     The Judge agreed that passing-off principles should not be employed in a\n                    breach of contract case. Nevertheless, on the issue of causation, the Judge held\n                    that actual loss as a result of the Appellants’ breaches could properly be\n                    inferred from the evidence. First, the undertakings in the Settlement Deed were\n                    closely related to the business operations of Fish & Co, and,\n                    hence, the loss of business was the best evidence of loss. Secondly, the\n                    breaches continued for 18 months despite the Respondent’s demands\n                    that the Appellants desist. Thirdly, MFM’s performance as a new entrant in\n                    the market was exceedingly good. Fourthly, there had been no cannibalisation of\n                    Fish & Co’s profits by the opening of its outlets in close\n                    proximity to each other. Fifthly, Glass House was the only affected outlet.\n                    Sixthly, MFM’s arrival had a negative impact on the Glass House outlet.\n                    During the Breach Period, Fish & Co’s average monthly sales\n                    were 6.6 per cent below those during the prior 18 month period.\n                    Further, Glass House’s sales statistics were significantly underperforming\n                    in relation to the industry average, based on the Department of Statistics\n                    Catering Trade Index. Seventhly, losses during the Breach and Post-Breach\n                    Periods were reasonably contemplated to be the likely consequences of the\n                    breaches. 38     On the issue of quantum, the Judge agreed with Mr Samuel that\n                    Method C distorted the methodology of Method A. Therefore, she chose\n                    to base her quantification of damages onMethod B. She found that the most crucial and relevant\n                    information were the sales figures. She agreed that it would be unsafe to award\n                    Fish & Co’s loss of profits based on all of MFM’s\n                    sales during the Breach Period, but that it would be logical to infer that if\n                    the Appellants had not committed the breaches, Fish & Co’s\n                    sales would at least be in line with industry’s trend (which was\n                    12 per cent based on the monthly sales percentage year on year change at\n                    current prices during that period according to the Department of Statistics\n                    Press Releases (see below at[44])). In\n                    fact, Glass House’s monthly sales percentage during the Breach Period was\n                    -4 per cent. Therefore, there was a 16 per cent gap between Glass\n                    House’s sales and the industry average and, for Glass House’s sales\n                    to be in line with that industry, its sales would have to be increased by\n                    16 per cent. In the circumstances, she awarded damages based on 16 per\n                    cent of MFM’s sales during the Breach Period. As for the Post-Breach\n                    Period loss of profits, the Judge held that it was within the reasonable\n                    contemplation of the parties that the effect of the Appellants’ breaches\n                    would continue after the breaches had stopped. However, the Judge reduced the\n                    Post-Breach Period from 12 to 6 months. 39     Based on the above reasoning, the Judge awarded a total of $269,000 damages to\n                    the Respondent. The Appellants appealed against the Judge’s decision in\n                    both the Registrar’s Appeals.",
        "The parties’ arguments in the present appeals": "",
        "The 2008 Statistics": "44     In so far as the background to the 2008 Statistics was concerned, the\n                    Department of Statistics Press Releases for the months from October 2004 to\n                    January 2007 were admitted into evidence before the AR during the assessment of\n                    damages hearing. These Monthly Press Releases provided information on the\n                    monthly average sales performance of the restaurant industry in Singapore,\n                    relative to those during the same month in the year before. 45     Another trade index was published in August 2008,ie, the 2008 Statistics, during the course of the appeals before\n                    the High Court which took place over a number of hearings between 15 July\n                    2008 and 18 February 2009. This recorded the performance of the restaurant\n                    industry in Singapore based on average sales. For the period prior to August\n                    2007, the percentages were calculated based on changes in annual sales. On\n                    24 February 2009, the Appellants sought to admit this as evidence. The\n                    Appellants attempted to rely on it to demonstrate that for the year 2004\n                    relative to 2003 (ie, before the breaches),\n                    although the restaurant trade had improved by 4.6 per cent, the performance\n                    of Glass House was worse (by -5.76 per cent). The Appellants contended that\n                    the reason for the late submission of the 2008 Statistics was because the\n                    Respondent’s counsel had informed the Judge (during the hearing on\n                    19 February 2009) that such statistics were not available. What actually\n                    transpired, however, is unclear as it was not recorded in the relevant notes of\n                    evidence. 46     The Respondent contended that grave prejudice would be caused to it if the\n                    evidence was allowed to be adduced at that late stage. It argued that, as a\n                    consequence of the late submission, it did not have the opportunity to respond\n                    to it during the trial itself. Further, the Appellants did not file a summons\n                    and apply for leave to adduce fresh evidence. Even if they did, the Respondent\n                    would have argued that the Appellants had failed to prove that the evidence\n                    could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence. The Respondent contended\n                    that the onus fell on the Appellants to check if the 2008 Statistics were\n                    available if they had wanted to rely on it. 47     The Judge found that, in order to have an acceptable and meaningful comparison\n                    to demonstrate a real decline during the Pre-Breach Period, regard must be given\n                    to comparing like periods. However, the Judge felt that this was not possible\n                    because Fish & Co’s sales performances were measured in\n                    18 month tranches whereas the 2008 Statistics were based on calendar\n                    years. The Judge also took on board the Respondent’s objections to the\n                    late submission of fresh evidence. She thus disregarded the 2008\n                    Statistics. 48     We find that the industry averages provided limited assistance to either\n                    party, given the wide disparity in the types of restaurants which were accounted\n                    for in these trade statistics. We therefore find that it is not necessary to\n                    rely on either the 2008 Statistics or the Monthly Press Releases.",
        "The issue of causation": "49     The difficulty we faced in the present proceedings was establishing the extent\n                    to which the Appellants’ breaches caused loss to the Respondent, given the\n                    many factors, for example, legitimate competition from\n                    Fish & Co’s rivals such as MFM, cannibalisation of sales by\n                    other Fish & Co outlets (although this particular factor is\n                    somewhat negated by the finding that Glass House served a different market\n                    segment from the other Fish & Co outlets), and the quality of food\n                    and service – all of which could have affected\n                    Fish & Co’s sales apart from the Appellants’ breaches.\n                    Further, we agree with the Appellants that, for the purposes of establishing a\n                    link between the breaches and the damage, the Appellants’ conduct, the\n                    fact that loss of profits was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the\n                    breaches, as well as the fact that MFM made financial gains were not relevant.\n                    As noted earlier, we also did not find it safe to rely on industry-wide\n                    statistics. 50     Nevertheless, we accept that MFM’s entrance in the market (which was\n                    aided by the Appellants’ breaches) would have causedsomeloss to Fish & Co. We disagree with the\n                    Appellants’ submissions regarding the significance of\n                    Fish & Co’s performance during the Pre-Breach Period on the\n                    ground that, even if Fish & Co’s performance during the\n                    Pre-Breach Period was not optimal, this did not mean that it could not have done\n                    better during the Breach Period but for the Appellants’ failure to observe\n                    the terms of the Settlement Deed. 51     Further, given the close proximity between Glass House and the MFM outlet in\n                    Plaza Singapura, as well as the similarities between MFM and\n                    Fish & Co, it was reasonable that the business attracted by MFM\n                    was partly drawn from Fish & Co’s potential clientele.\n                    Indeed, before us, counsel for the Appellants accepted that some loss was caused\n                    to Fish & Co as a result of the opening of MFM. Although he\n                    qualified his opinion by stating that the loss of sales by\n                    Fish & Co had nothing to do with the breaches of the Settlement\n                    Deed, we find it difficult to distinguish strictly between the Appellants’\n                    breaches of the Settlement Deed and MFM’s entrance in the market as a\n                    legitimate competitor, given the fact that the former aided the latter. If the\n                    Appellants did not think that it stood to gain from the breaches, it would not\n                    have infringed the terms of the Settlement Deed in the first place. Clearly, the\n                    inference to be made is that the breaches resulted in a financial benefit to the\n                    Appellants. Although the fact that the Appellants made financial gains was\n                    irrelevant to establishing the issue of causation, in the context of the present\n                    proceedings, where there are two similar rivals in the same market, we find that\n                    the financial gains made by one could reasonably be translated as losses to the\n                    other. In the circumstances therefore, we find that the Respondent had\n                    discharged its burden of proving that the breaches of the Settlement Deed\n                    resulted in its losses. The more pertinent legal issue, in our view, is the\n                    quantum of damages that ought to be awarded to the Respondent – an issue\n                    to which our attention now turns.",
        "The issue of quantification": "",
        "Some preliminary observations": "52     It should be noted that the present appeals centre on the issue of damages to\n                    be awarded in a purely contractual context. No arguments were made in relation\n                    to the award of punitive damages or the award of damages pursuant to the\n                    principles laid down in the seminal House of Lords decision inAttorney-General v Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd Third Party)[2001] 1 AC 268 (“Blake”).\n                    This is perhaps understandable in light of the fact that both these areas of the\n                    law of damages are still – to put it mildly – in a state of\n                    flux. 53     The first, in particular, is especially controversial. Although there is an\n                    arguable case, in principle, for the award of punitive damages in contract law\n                    (see, for example, Ralph Cunnington, “Should punitive damages be part of\n                    the judicial arsenal in contract cases?” (2006) 26 Legal Studies 369\n                        (“Cunnington”) and Pey-Woan Lee,\n                    “Contract Damages, Corrective Justice and Punishment” (2007)\n                    70 MLR 887; thoughcfSolène Rowan,\n                    “Reflections on the Introduction of Punitive Damages for Breach of\n                    Contract” (2010) 30 OJLS 495), the case law is itself inconclusive\n                    (see, for example, Andrew Phang and Pey-Woan Lee, “Restitutionary and\n                    Exemplary Damages Revisited” (2003) 19 JCL 1 at\n                    pp 21–31 andCunningtonat\n                    pp 389-393). This is not surprising in view of the radical as well as\n                    draconian nature of punitive damages themselves. The position in Singapore is,\n                    not surprisingly, still an open one. In the Singapore High Court decision ofCHS CPO GmbH (in bankruptcy) and another v Vikas Goel and\n                        others[2005] 3 SLR(R) 202, it was observed thus (at\n                    [65]–[66]): 65    ... Indeed, the rather limited circumstances under which exemplary\n                            damages will be granted under English (and, presumably, Singapore) law\n                            appears to be in a state of transition, even flux (compare, for example,\n                            the House of Lords decisions ofRookes v Barnard[1964] AC 1129 andCassell & Co Ltd v\n                                Broome[1972] AC 1027 on the one hand with both\n                            the House of Lords decision ofKuddus v Chief Constable of\n                                Leicestershire Constabulary[2002] 2 AC 122 and\n                            the New Zealand Privy Council decision ofA v\n                                Bottrill[2003] 1 AC 449 on the other; further\n                            reference may be made to the English Law Commission'sReport\n                                on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages(Law\n                            Com No 247, 1997)). 66    There is the yet further issue as to whether or not exemplary damages\n                            could be awarded for cynical breaches of contract (see generally, for\n                            example, the Canadian Supreme Court decision ofWhiten v Pilot\n                                Insurance Company(2002) 209 DLR (4th) 257). All\n                            these issues raise important questions of great import but fall outside\n                            the purview of the present decision. 54     The second is less controversial, but no less problematic. Indeed,Blakeitself generated – not surprisingly, perhaps\n                    – a learned body of legal literature of a magnitude that has been\n                    witnessed only occasionally (in this regard, the account by Prof Graham\n                    Virgo in his book,The Principles of the Law of\n                        Restitution(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2006)\n                        (“Virgo”), ch 17 furnishes\n                    an exceptionally clear and succinct overview of both the relevant case law as\n                    well as legal literature). Put very simply, the principles set out inBlakepermit the court to award damages to the plaintiff\n                    (in a situation relating to the breach of a contract) on the basis of the gains\n                    or profits made by the defendant even though the plaintiff could not otherwise\n                    be awarded any damages based on traditional contractual principles (for example,\n                    because there has been no difference in value of the contractual subject matter\n                    and, hence, no justification for the award of expectation loss). Such damages\n                    would, however, be awarded only inexceptionalcases. This category of damages has sometimes been termed as\n                    “restitutionary damages”, although the House inBlakepreferred to classify such an award on the basis of an\n                    account of profits. 55     Apart from the various conceptual as well as (as referred to at the end of the\n                    preceding paragraph) terminological difficulties, there are (concurrent)\n                    practical difficulties as well in so far as the award of damages under the\n                    principles set out inBlakeare concerned. InBlake, for example, in the leading judgment of\n                    Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, the statement of principle (at 284–285)\n                    does not really furnish concrete guidance as to when the power to award such\n                    damages will arise. That the award of such damages is (as already noted in the\n                    preceding paragraph) exceptional still leaves the (very practical) issue as tothe criteriawhich will enable the court to\n                    ascertain whether or not a given fact situation is indeed exceptional. Case law\n                    developments sinceBlake(see, for example the\n                    English Court of Appeal decision ofExperience Hendrix LLC v\n                        PPX Enterprises Inc and another[2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 830\n                    (noted in Pey-Woan Lee, “Responses to A Breach of Contract”\n                    [2003] LMCLQ 301 (“Lee”);\n                    Martin Graham, “Restitutionary Damages: The Anvil Struck” (2004)\n                    120 LQR 26 (“Graham”); and\n                    David Campbell and Philip Wylie, “Ain’t No Telling (Which\n                    Circumstances are Exceptional)” (2003) 62 CLJ 605 (“Campbell and Wylie”)) have also suggested apossible alternativeapproach that is premised\n                    not on a restitutionary basis as such but, rather, on a compensatory one\n                    (centring on the much discussed decision by Brightman J in the English High\n                    Court decision ofWrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes\n                        Ltd and Others[1974] 1 WLR 798 (“Wrotham Park”) (see also\n                    Robert J Sharpe and S M Waddams, “Damages for lost\n                    opportunity to bargain” (1982) 2 OJLS 290); reference may also be\n                    made to the recent Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of\n                    Jersey) ofPell Frischmann Engineering Limited v Bow Valley\n                        Iran Limited[2010] BLR 73 (especially at [46]–[54])).\n                    However, it would appear that the precise contours of this particular head of\n                    compensatory loss (as well as its relationship with the established head of\n                    expectation loss) have yet to be worked out fully (see, for example,Virgo(at pp 490–492) as well asLee;Graham; andCampbell and Wylie). It might well be a difference of\n                    degree rather than kind, at least in so far as the former consists in an attempt\n                    to quantify compensatory damages by reference to the defendant’s gain (seeLee(at pp 302–303) and, by the\n                    same author, “A New Model of Contractual Compensation”\n                    [2006] LMCLQ 452 at p 453;cfalso\n                    Samuel Stoljar, “Restitutionary Relief for Breach of Contract”\n                    (1989) 2 JCL 1 at pp 3–4). To the extent, of course, that\n                    both heads are coincident, the head of damages will, in substance, be based on\n                    orthodox principles of the common law of contract (which centre on expectation\n                    loss). 56     It was probably the case that, in view of the flux demonstrably present in the\n                    alternative approaches briefly summarised above, these approaches were not (as\n                    already alluded to above at[52]) canvassed\n                    by the parties to the present appeals. In the circumstances, we therefore turn,\n                    now, to consider the arguments which were in fact canvassed before this court,\n                    and which centre on the specific issues relating to both the correct methodology\n                    to apply as well as the actual application of that methodology to the facts of\n                    the present appeals themselves. We pause to note – parenthetically,\n                    however – that the head of compensatory loss mentioned towards the end of\n                    the preceding paragraph (centring onWrotham Park)\n                    does bear some affinity to the established head of expectation loss under the\n                    law of contract inasmuch as both are compensatory in nature. However, as also\n                    noted in the preceding paragraph, the precise contours of the former are still\n                    in a state of flux. We also pause to note that even if we proceed on the premise\n                    that the quantum of damages to be awarded in the present proceedings is related\n                    to a breach of confidence, that breach would, in our view, be founded in an\n                    action for breach ofcontract(see alsoVirgo(at p 526)). The traditional remedies would\n                    take one of two forms,viz, an account of profits\n                    or restitutionary damages (see generallyVirgo(at\n                    pp 527–529)). That having been said, it has also been observed that\n                    “[s]ometimes compensatory damages may be awarded for breach of the\n                    equitable duty of confidence” (seeVirgo(at p 527)). Indeed, the parties proceeded very much – in substance\n                    at least – along these (compensatory) lines. This would therefore be an\n                    appropriate juncture to turn to the various methodologies concerned (in the\n                    context of the award of damages under orthodox principles of the common law of\n                    contract). However, before proceeding to do so, we pause to consider briefly a\n                    simple – yet fundamental – principle.",
        "The law on certainty of damages": "57     It will be apparent that the principal difficulty which we are faced with in\n                    the present appeals is the difficulty of quantifying the Respondent’s\n                    losses as a result of the Appellants’ breaches. This is because of the\n                    numerous factors which could potentially affect the reasons for MFM’s\n                    success, or the reasons for Fish & Co’s decline in sales.\n                    Given the difficulties in ascertaining with certainty the extent of the\n                    Respondent’s losses, this court can, as we observe below, only do the best\n                    that we can (based on the relevant evidence before us). In this regard, the\n                    following observations in the decision of this court inRobertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and\n                        another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“Robertson Quay”) (at [27]–[28] and [30]–[31])\n                    are instructive: 27    ... [I]t is fundamental and trite that a plaintiff claiming damages\n                            must prove his damage. ... The process of proving damage is an intensely\n                            factual one. ... In the circumstances, it is impossible to lay down anygeneralrules or principles as to what\n                            constitutes adequate proof of damage since theparticularfactual circumstances can take, literally, a\n                            myriad of forms. 28    The law, however, does not demand that the plaintiff prove with\n                            complete certainty the exact amount of damage that he has suffered.\n                            Thus, the learned author ofMcGregor on\n                                Damagescontinues as follows (at para 8-002): [W]here it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, the\n                            fact that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage\n                            is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages. As\n                            Vaughan Williams L.J. put it inChaplin v\n                                Hicks[[1911] 2 KB 786], the leading case on the\n                            issue of certainty: “The fact that damages cannot be assessed\n                            with certainty does not relieve the wrongdoer of the necessity of paying\n                            damages.”Indeed if absolute certainty were required as to the\n                                precise amount of loss that the claimant had suffered, no damages\n                                would be recovered at all in the great number of cases. This is\n                                particularly true since so much of damages claimed are in respect of\n                                prospective, and therefore necessarily contingent, loss.\n                            [emphasis added] … 30    Accordingly, a court has to adopt a flexible approach with regard to\n                            the proof of damage. Different occasions may call for different evidence\n                            with regard to certainty of proof, depending on the circumstances of the\n                            case and the nature of the damages claimed. … The correct\n                            approach that a court should adopt is perhaps best summarised by\n                            Devlin J in the English High Court decision ofBiggin & Co Ld v Permanite, Ld[1951] 1 KB 422\n                                (“Biggin”), where he\n                            held (at 438) that: [W]here precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to\n                            have it. Where it is not, the court must do the best it can. … 31    To summarise, a plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for damages\n                            without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it has\n                            suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover\n                            damages. On the other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level\n                            best to prove its lossandthe evidence is\n                            cogent, the court should allow it to recover the damages claimed.\n                            … [emphasis in original] 58     With these principles in mind, we will now proceed to assess the appropriate\n                    quantum of damages awardable to the Respondent as a result of the\n                    Appellants’ breaches.",
        "Our decision": "142    The Appellants contended that the post-breach losses (if at all) suffered by\n                    the Respondent were not recoverable at law. They contended that the issue of\n                    recovery of post-breach losses was not just about remoteness (which the Judge\n                    based her decision upon). Instead, they contended that the Respondent was\n                    claiming for damages arising from alleged continuing effects of their breaches\n                    and that there was no legal authority for such a claim. 143    In our view, the losses that the Respondent is claiming in this particular\n                    context are nothing more than losses incurred based on the effect of the\n                    Appellants’ breaches and it is quite illogical as well as unrealistic to\n                    expect losses to cease immediately after the breaches had stopped. We therefore\n                    agree with the Judge that the Appellants are liable for the post-breach losses,\n                    and that she correctly took into account the trailing-off effect when assessing\n                    damages to account for the fact that with the passage of time, more and more\n                    consumers would become aware of the changes, and that the after-effects of the\n                    breaches would (as a consequence) decrease accordingly. As for the period of six\n                    months which the Judge decided as constituting the duration for the Post-Breach\n                    Period, we are respectfully of the view (like the AR) that (given the nature of\n                    the breaches themselves) a period of 12 months would constitute a\n                    reasonable period of time given that it would take some time for the consumer to\n                    become aware of the changes. However, like the Judge, we are also of the view\n                    that the damages awardable for that particular period should be halved in order\n                    to reflect the fact that there ought to be some allowance made for a gradual\n                    decrease in the effect of the Appellants’ breaches. 144    We also note that the Judge applied the principles in the first limb ofHadley, with the result that the Respondent\n                    should receive damages as may be fairly and reasonably be considered to arise\n                    naturally according to the usual course of things as a result of the\n                    Appellants’ breaches of contract. 145    As already explained above, we are of the view that the applicable legal\n                    principles are those which have their source inHadley(and which were confirmed by this court inRobertson Quay). We also agree with the Judge (for the\n                    reasons set out above at[37]) that, having\n                    regard to the nature of the loss claimed by the Respondent during the\n                    Post-Breach Period, the damages which would be awardable would fall within thefirst limbinHadley. It now remains to ascertain thequantumof damages to be awarded. 146    Adopting the same methodology as that applied in ascertaining the quantum of\n                    damages which ought to be awarded to the Respondent during the Breach Period\n                    (see above at[68]–[70]), we note, first, that the predicted or\n                    projected percentage change in actual gross sales during the period between\n                    February 2007 and January 2008 can be estimated to be 2.31 per cent\n                    (-0.38 per cent + 2.69 per cent) – a figure which we find to be\n                    not unreasonable, having regard to the overall circumstances (including\n                    Fish & Co’s projections duringthe Breach\n                        Perioditself (see above at[41])) and which reflects (in thishigherprojected percentage change in actual gross sales\n                    compared to that with respect to the Breach Period) thecontinuationof the upward trend noted above (at[68]). We also note that the predicted or\n                    projected gross sales during the preceding period (viz, between February 2006 and January 2007), as calculated\n                    above, was $2,803,911.82 (see above at[68]). In the circumstances, therefore (and having regard to the\n                    predicted or projected percentage change of 2.31 per cent), thepredicted or projectedgross sales during the period\n                    between February 2007 and January 2008 would be $2,868,682.18. Having regard to\n                    the fact that theactualgross sales was\n                        $2,493,281.65,[note: 10]the difference between the predicted or projected gross sales and\n                    the actual gross sales is $375,400.53 (ie,\n                    $2,868,682.18 – $2,493,281.65). Taking into account the profit margin of\n                    52.38 per cent (see above at[26]and[68])as well\n                        asthe fact that the damages to be awarded during the Post-Breach\n                    Period are for a duration of12 months(which\n                    amount should, in our view, be adjusted by half in order to take into account\n                    (as did the Judge) the fact that there ought to be some allowance made for a\n                    gradual decrease in the effect of the Appellants’ breaches (see above at[143])), the amount of damages that\n                    ought to be awarded to the Respondent during this particular period is$98,317.40(ie,\n                    $375,400.53 ÷ 2 × 52.38 per\n                    cent).",
        "The issue of remoteness": "",
        "The law on remoteness of damage": "Introduction 72     The law relating to remoteness of damage in the law of contract was hitherto\n                    unique inasmuch as it had – with a few refinements over the years –\n                    remained as it was for approximately 150 years in both England as well as\n                    in Singapore. Indeed, such a situation of relative stability is rarely to be\n                    found, especially given the nature and development of the common law in general\n                    and the law of contract in particular. The principles of remoteness of damage,\n                    which find their seminal formulation in the statement of principle by\n                    Alderson B in the celebrated English decision ofHadley\n                        v Baxendale(1854) 9 Exch 341; 165 ER 145\n                        (“Hadley”) (at 354-355 and 151,\n                    respectively), were (as just mentioned) refined (albeit without any radical\n                    changes) over the next 150 years (see generally the decision of this court\n                    inRobertson Quay(at [52]-[61]), which also\n                    confirmed the applicability of the principles inHadleyin so far as Singapore is concerned). For the purposes of\n                    this judgment, all subsequent references toHadley(and, in particular, the two limbs set out by Alderson B in that decision)\n                    will be taken to include all later refinements as explained inRobertson Quay(see generallyid). The Achilleas 73     However, a mere four months after the decision of this court inRobertson Quaywas handed down, the House of Lords\n                    handed down its decision inTransfield Shipping Inc v\n                        Mercator Shipping Inc[2009] 1 AC 61 (“The Achilleas”). As we shall see,\n                    Lord Hoffmann introduced, in the latter case, an apparently new legal\n                    criterion to the existing law,viz, whether or not\n                    the defendant concerned hadassumed responsibilityfor the loss which had occurred as a result of its breach (and see the important\n                    essay (to the same effect) by Adam Kramer, “An Agreement-Centred Approach\n                    to Remoteness and Contract Damages” inComparative\n                        Remedies for Breach of Contract(Hart Publishing, 2005) (Nili\n                    Cohen & Ewan McKendrick eds) ch 12 at p 249\n                        (“Kramer”); reference may also\n                    be made to the case note onThe Achilleasby the\n                    same author, “The New Test of Remoteness in Contract” (2009)\n                    125 LQR 408 which, not surprisingly perhaps, endorses the approach\n                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe\n                    Achilleas). 74     This is the first occasion that this court has had to consider the approach\n                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas,\n                    although there have been two learned judgments in the Singapore High Court inChee Peng Kwan and Another v Toh Swee Hwee Thomas and\n                        Others[2009] SGHC 141 (“Chee\n                        Peng Kwan”) andThode Gerd Walter v\n                        Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd and others[2010] SGHC 33\n                        (“Thode Gerd Walter”), which\n                    have, in fact, consideredThe Achilleas, and which\n                    we will have occasion to refer to at appropriate points later in this judgment.\n                    Indeed, both these aforementioned judgments noted that this court had not\n                    hitherto had the opportunity to consider the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas(seeChee Peng Kwan(at [35]) andThode\n                        Gerd Walter(at [71])), and it is therefore appropriate, in our\n                    view, to consider this approach in the present proceedings to clarify what the\n                    legal position is precisely in the Singapore context. Let us turn now to the\n                    facts and holdings inThe Achilleasitself. 75     InThe Achilleas, the plaintiff shipowners\n                    (“the shipowners”) had chartered their vessel to the defendant\n                    charterers (“the charterers”) at a rate of US$16,750 per day.\n                    Redelivery of the vessel was scheduled for 2 May 2004. In April 2004, as\n                    the market hire rates had risen dramatically, the shipowners fixed a follow-on\n                    time charter with another company (“C”) at a rate of US$39,500 per\n                    day (with C having the right to cancel the charter if the vessel was not made\n                    available by 8 May 2004). As it turned out, the charterer’s final\n                    voyage was in fact delayed. By 5 May 2004, the shipowners realised that\n                    their vessel would not be returned by 8 May 2004. Unfortunately, the market\n                    hire rate at that particular point in time had fallen sharply. In order to\n                    persuade C to extend the latest delivery date from 8 May 2004 to\n                    11 May 2004, the shipowners had to agree to a reduced rate of hire of\n                    $31,500 per day. Significantly, the charterers had not been put on notice of the\n                    existence of the shipowners’ follow-on charter with C at any time prior to\n                    delivery of the vessel. 76     The shipowners claimed damages for breach of contract from the charterers for\n                    loss of the difference between the original rate agreed upon between the\n                    shipowners and C (of US$39,500 per day) and the reduced rate (of US$31,500 per\n                    day)over the period of the follow-on time charter\n                        itself(which period comprised 191 days). The total amount\n                    of damages claimed, therefore, amounted to US$1,364,584.37. 77     In contrast, the charterers argued that the shipowners were entitled only to\n                    the difference between the market rate and the charter rate for the period\n                    during which the latter were deprived of the use of the vessel (which period\n                    comprised 9 days). This amounted to only US$158,301.17. 78     The arbitrators held (by a majority) in favour of the shipowners, finding that\n                    the loss fell within the first limb inHadley.\n                    They arrived at this decisionnotwithstandingthe\n                    fact that the understanding ofthe shipping industry or\n                        marketdidnotconsider such loss\n                        (ie, loss based on the difference between the\n                    original and reduced rates as argued by the shipowners) to be recoverable, with\n                    liability restricted (as the charterers had argued) to the difference between\n                    the market rate and the charter rate for the overrun period. The English Court\n                    of Appeal affirmed that decision. However, on appeal, the House of Lords held,\n                    instead, in favour of the charterers and allowed the appeal. Nonetheless, thespecific reasonsgiven by the various law\n                    lords differed. It is nevertheless clear that the most significant – and\n                    radical – part of the decision lay (as already alluded to above) in the\n                    judgment of Lord Hoffmann. The learned law lord was not content with the\n                    traditional approach inHadley. He added (relying\n                    on his views in the House of Lords decision ofSouth\n                        Australia Asset Management Corporation v York Montague Ltd[1997] AC 191 (“South\n                    Australia”), which did not, however, deal directly with the\n                    issue of remoteness of damage in contract as such) anew\n                        legal criterionbased on the concept ofassumption of responsibilityby the defendant. Put simply, if\n                    this additional criterion was not satisfied, the loss concerned would be\n                    considered to be too remote and, hence, not recoverable by the plaintiff. In\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s words (at [12]): It seems to me logical to found liability for damages upon the intention\n                        of the parties (objectively ascertained)\n                        because all contractual liability isvoluntarily\n                            undertaken. It must be in principle wrong to hold someone\n                        liable for risks for which the people entering into such a contract in their\n                        particular market, would notreasonablybe\n                        considered to have undertaken. [emphasis added] 79     Earlier on in his judgment, though, Lord Hoffmann did frame the issue\n                    facing him, as follows (at [9]): The case therefore raises a fundamental point of principle in the law of\n                        contractual damages: is the rule that a party may recover losses which were\n                        foreseeable (“not unlikely”)an external\n                            rule of law, imposed upon the parties to every contract in default of\n                            express provision to the contrary,orisit a prima facie assumptionabout what the parties may be taken to have\n                            intended, no doubtapplicablein thegreat majorityof casesbut capable of rebuttalin cases in which the context, surrounding circumstances\n                            or general understanding in the relevant market shows that a party\n                            wouldnot reasonablyhave been regarded asassuming responsibilityfor such losses?[emphasis added in italics\n                        and bold italics] As we shall see below, the above framing of the issue is significant inasmuch\n                    as it raises,inter alia, the question as to what\n                    constitutes an external rule of law (see below at[108]) and (perhaps more importantly) whether or not, by\n                    phrasing his proposed legal proposition as only “a prima facie\n                    assumption”, Lord Hoffmann may well have adopted a “soft\n                    version” of his suggested principle which may turn out, in the final\n                    analysis, to be no different (in substance, at least) from the traditional rules\n                    as embodied inHadley– a point which we\n                    will consider below (at[101]). 80     One final point of note may be made with regard to Lord Hoffmann’s\n                    judgment. The learned law lord drew an analogy (at [11] and [26]) between his\n                    proposed principle of assumption of responsibility withthe\n                        implication of terms(both of which, in his view, are centred on\n                    theinterpretation or constructionof the contract\n                    concerned). This is also an important point which we will deal with in more\n                    detail below (at [97]–[100]). 81     The other judgments inThe Achilleasare also\n                    interesting because, as alluded to above, they demonstrate a variety of other\n                    approaches. 82     Lord Hope of Craighead appears to have endorsed the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann; in his view (at [30]–[31]): 30    ... The critical question however is whether the parties must be\n                            assumed to have contracted with each other on the basis that the\n                            charterers wereassuming responsibilityfor the consequences of that event. ... 31Assumption of responsibility, whichforms the basisof the law of\n                            remoteness of damage in contract, is determined bymore thanwhat at the time of the contract was\n                            reasonably foreseeable. [emphasis added] 83     The learned law lord also observed thus (at [32]): The fact that the loss was foreseeable – the kind of result that the\n                        parties would have had in mind, as the majority arbitrators put it –\n                        isnotthe test.Greater\n                            precision is needed than that. The question is whether the\n                        loss was a type of loss for which the party canreasonablybe assumed to haveassumed\n                            responsibility. [emphasis added] 84However, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry adopted\n                    aquite differentapproach. Put simply, the\n                    learned law lord endorsed and applied thetraditionalprinciples as embodied inHadley(see especially at [47]–[48] and [52]), and did\n                    “not [find] it necessary to explore the issues concerning [South Australia] ... and assumption of responsibility,\n                    which ... Lord Hoffmann ... has raised” (see at [63]). In the\n                    context of that case, the learned law lord was of the view (at [53]) that\n                    “the extent of the relevant rise and fall in the market within a short\n                    time was actuallyunusual” [emphasis added]\n                    and that “[t]he owners’ loss stemmed from thatunusual occurrence” [emphasis added]. In the\n                    circumstances, the loss was, in his view, too remote to fall within thefirst limbofHadley. However, Lord Rodger did point out (at [59]) that,\n                    if there had been the requisite knowledge pursuant to thesecond limbofHadley, the result\n                    might well have been different: [T]he position on damages might also be different, if, for example –\n                        when a charterparty was entered into – the owners drew the\n                        charterers’ attention to the existence of a forward charter of many\n                        months’ duration for which the vessel had to be delivered on a\n                        particular date. The charterers would know that a failure to redeliver the\n                        vessel in time to allow the owners to deliver it under that charter would be\n                        liable to result in the loss of that fixture. Then thesecond rule or limbinHadley v Baxendale\n                            might well come into play. But the point does not arise in this\n                            case. [emphasis added] Hindsight is, of course, “twenty-twenty vision”, bearing in mind\n                    the requirement that the requisite knowledge under the second limb ofHadleymust be communicatedat or\n                        prior to the formation of the contractitself. However, that\n                    means – on apracticallevel – that,\n                    if the parties (in particular, the plaintiff) desire such an eventuality to be\n                    covered, then they ought to do soviatheexpress termsof the contract itself (see also\n                    below at[119]). We also note that\n                    commentators have expressed the view that Lord Rodger’s approach,\n                    whilst taking into account the distinction that has hitherto been drawn by the\n                    courts (indeed, inThe Achilleasitself) between\n                    the type of loss and the extent of loss, ought to have arrived at theoppositeresult as what was not reasonably contemplated\n                    was theextentof the loss andnot(as Lord Rodger thought (at [60])) thetypeof loss (see below at[114]). 85     Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe referred to the principles laid down inHadley. However, it is not altogether clear\n                    whether the learned law lord based his decision (to allow the appeal, as did the\n                    rest of the House) on these principlesonly or\n                        alsoon Lord Hoffmann’s principle of assumption of\n                    responsibility. Indeed, Lord Walker concluded his judgment (with respect,\n                    somewhatambiguously) thus (at [87]): For these reasons,and for the further reasons given by\n                            my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of\n                            Craigheadand Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, whose opinions\n                        I have had the advantage of reading in draft, I would allow this appeal.\n                        [emphasis added] 86     Finally, Baroness Hale of Richmond preferred to base her decision on the\n                    (traditional) principles laid down inHadley.\n                    Indeed, in her view (at [90]), “[n]o one has suggested that it was at all\n                    unusual or unlikely for the owners to commit their ship to a new fixture to\n                    begin as soon as possible after the ship was free from the first” and\n                    that “[i]t was conceded before the arbitrators that missing dates for a\n                    subsequent fixture was a “not unlikely” result of late\n                    redelivery”; indeed, “[b]oth parties would have been well aware of\n                    that at the time when the contract was made” and that “[t]hey\n                    would also have been well aware that a new charter was likely to commit that\n                    particular ship rather than to allow the ship-owner to go into the market and\n                    find a substitute to fulfil his next commitment if his ship was late\n                    back”. Baroness Hale then proceeded to observe thus (seeid): Above all, if the parties wish to exclude liability for consequential loss\n                        of this kind then it will be very simple to insert such a clause into future\n                        charterparties. ... To rule out a whole class of loss, simply because the\n                        parties had not previously thought about it, risks as much uncertainty and\n                        injustice as letting it in. 87     In light of the views expressed in the preceding paragraph, the decision by\n                    Baroness Hale to allow the appeal as she did must have been taken with no small\n                    measure of reluctance. Whatisclear is that she\n                    thought (at [93]) that the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann added\n                    “an interestingbut noveldimension to the\n                    way in which the question of remoteness of damage in contract is to be answered,\n                    a dimensionwhich does not clearly emerge from the classic\n                        authorities” [emphasis added]. Baroness Hale was clearly\n                    not in favour of it and premised her decision (like Lord Rodger) on the\n                    more traditional approach; in her words, in so far as the principle of\n                    assumption of responsibility was concerned, it depended on a wider range of\n                    factors and value judgments and could thus introduce much room for argument in\n                    other contractual contexts (seeid): In an examination, this might well make the difference between a\n                        congratulatory and an ordinary first class answer to the question. But\n                        despite the excellence of counsels’ arguments it was not explored\n                        before us, although it is explored in academic textbooks and other writings,\n                        including those cited by Lord Hoffmann in para 11 of his opinion.\n                        I note, however, that the most recent of these, Professor Robertson’s\n                        article on “The basis of the remoteness rule in contract”\n                        (2008) 28 Legal Studies 172 argues strongly to the contrary.I am not immediately attracted to the idea of introducing into\n                            the law of contract the concept of the scope of duty which has perforce\n                            had to be developed in the law of negligence. The rule inHadley v Baxendaleasks what the parties\n                        must be taken to have had in their contemplation, rather than what they\n                        actually had in their contemplation, but the criterion by which this is\n                        judged is a factual one.Questions of assumption of risk\n                            depend upon a wider range of factors and value judgments.\n                        This type of reasoning is, as Lord Steyn put it inAneco Reinsurance Underwriting Ltd v Johnson & Higgins\n                            Ltd[2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 157, 186, a\n                        “deus ex machina”.Although its result in\n                            this case may be to bring about certainty and clarity in this particular\n                            market, such an imposed limit on liability could easily be at the\n                            expense of justice in some future case. It could also introduce much\n                            room for argument in other contractual contexts. Therefore, if this\n                            appeal is to be allowed, as to which I continue to have doubts, I would\n                            prefer it to be allowed on the narrower ground identified by Lord\n                            Rodger, leaving the wider ground to be fully explored in another case\n                            and another context. [emphasis added] 88     So much by way of a summary of the various judgments inThe\n                        Achilleasitself. We turn now to the very important issue as to\n                    whether or not the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in that case ought\n                    to be adopted in theSingaporecontext. The Achilleasconsidered (with special\n                reference to Singapore) 89     With respect, we donotthink that the approach\n                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleasought to be followed and that its appearance afterRobertson\n                        Quaytherefore has no effect on the latter decision. Put simply,\n                    the two limbs set out inHadley(as elaborated\n                    upon and explained inRobertson Quayitself)\n                    continue to be the governing principles in relation to the doctrine of\n                    remoteness of damage in contract law in the Singapore context. There are a\n                    number of reasons for adopting this position which we now proceed to elaborate\n                    upon. (1)The Achilleas– some\n                difficulties (a)   Problems with the ratio decidendi ofThe\n                    Achilleas 90     First, and from the most basic perspective, the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann was – arguably, at least -notadopted (either unanimously or by a majority)\n                    by the Houseandhence did not constitute theratio decidendiof the case itself (and see\n                    Harvey McGregor QC, in his leading textbook,McGregor on\n                        Damages(Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009)\n                        (“McGregor”) at para 6-173,\n                    who also cites Lord Walker’s view in the (subsequent) Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Court of\n                    Appeal of Bahamas) ofSentinel International Ltd v\n                        Cordes[2008] UKPC 60, where the learned law lord observed (at\n                    [50]) that “a contractual claim for damages for loss of a bargain isnotof course subject to the …\n                    principle [inSouth Australia]” [emphasis\n                    added]). This last-mentioned point is significant because it is, on one reading\n                    at least, unclear whether Lord Walker was, inThe\n                        Achilleas, adopting Lord Hoffmann’s approach or the\n                    more traditional approach as embodied in the principles inHadleyitself (see also above at [85] as well asThode Gerd Walter(at [70])). That having been said, the\n                    precise effect of Lord Walker’s (with respect) ambiguous statements\n                    inThe Achilleason the preciseratio decidendiin that particular case remain controversial,\n                    with some commentators being of the (contrary) view that, on balance, those\n                    statements are in line with Lord Hoffmann’s approach (see, for\n                    example, Paul C K Wee, “Contractual interpretation and\n                    remoteness” [2010] LMCLQ 150 (“Wee”) at pp 156-157, which, in our view, is one of\n                    the more perceptive of the (not surprisingly) many articles analysingThe Achilleas). Indeed, the only clear proposition that\n                    can be proffered in this particular regard is that there is probablyno clear ratio decidendias such that can be deduced\n                    from a perusal of the written judgments handed down by the various law lords inThe Achilleas(see also generally Greg Gordon,\n                        “Hadley v BaxendaleRevisited:Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping\n                        Inc” (2009) 13 Edinburgh L Rev 125). 91     In a related vein, it is also worth pointing to the fact that there is some\n                    (weighty) authority to thecontraryin an earlier\n                    (and leading) House of Lords decision ofKoufos v C Czarnikow\n                        Ltd[1969] 1 AC 350 (“The\n                        Heron II”) (at 422,perLord Upjohn (a point also noted by AR Teo Guan Siew\n                    (“AR Teo”) inChee Peng Kwan(at [36]) as well as by AR Peh Aik Hin (“AR Peh”) inThode Gerd Walter(at [70]); reference may\n                    also be made to the observation of Rix LJ at the Court of Appeal stage ofThe Achilleas(seeTransfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc (The\n                        “Achilleas”)[2007] 2 Lloyd’s\n                    Rep 555 at [115]) as well as M G Bridge,The\n                        Sale of Goods(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2009)\n                        (“Bridge”) at p 762)).\n                    However, leaving aside for the moment issues centring on what the preciseratio decidendiinThe\n                        Achilleasis (as well as the related issue as to the relevant\n                    prior (especially House of Lords) authority to the contrary), let us consider\n                    the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe\n                        Achilleason its own terms. Even here, there are, with the\n                    greatest of respect, a number of both theoretical as well as practical\n                    difficulties with his suggested approach. Let us elaborate. (B)   Theoretical and conceptual difficulties 92     There are, first, very fundamentaltheoretical or\n                        conceptualdifficulties with the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann. As a learned author perceptively observes (seeWeeat p 158): The view preferred here is that the agreement-centred approach as accepted\n                        inThe Achilleasis best understood not as an\n                        approach to remoteness, but as embodying an approach to interpretation.\n                        Remoteness is traditionally regarded as a doctrine which limits and cuts\n                        backprima facieliability. However, under the\n                        agreement-centred approach,prima facieliability is never cut back. If limits on the scope of contractual duties\n                        can be distilled through the ordinary process of interpretation, as\n                        Lord Hoffmann contends ... , then the claimant is always “to be\n                        placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract\n                        had been performed”, where the meaning of “the\n                        contract” is properly construed. There are no limits on the\n                        fulfilment of the claimant’s (properly construed) expectation\n                        interest. Consequently, under the agreement-centred approach, there is no\n                        independent role for remoteness. 93     Put simply, the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann is not only\n                    conceptually distinct from – but also appears to exclude the operation of\n                    – the very doctrine of remoteness of damage in contract law itself. In\n                    this regard, the observation made in the preceding paragraph is a perceptive\n                    one, although, as we will point out below (at [101]-[107]), it might in fact be\n                    possible to achieve abalancebetween both\n                    approaches inasmuch as the concept of assumption of responsibility by the\n                    defendant (which is the basis of Lord Hoffmann’s approach) might be\n                    considered ashaving already been embodied or incorporated\n                        within the existing doctrine of remoteness of damage in contract law (which,\n                        of course, comprises, in essence, the two limbs inHadley). (C)   Uncertainty in application 94     The approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann is also, with respect,\n                    unconvincing when viewed from apracticalperspective. As was perceptively (as well as succinctly) observed inMcGregor(at para 6-171): What Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope propose is full of difficulty,\n                        uncertainty and impracticality. How are we to tell what subjectively the\n                        contracting parties were thinking about assumption of responsibility? When\n                        contracting, assumption of responsibility was probably not in their minds at\n                        all, for it is well known that parties entering a contract are thinking of\n                        its performance rather than of its breach. Apart from this uncertainty there\n                        is the impracticality of allowing defendants to raise the issue, as they\n                        will surely do, in case after case as an extra argument, thereby taking up\n                        the time of the courts unnecessarily and making the arriving at settlements\n                        more difficult. 95     Prof Andrew Robertson also points, pertinently in our view, to the fact\n                    that “typically there is no factual basis for judging the intentions of\n                    the parties” (see Andrew Robertson, “The basis of the remoteness\n                    rule in contract” (2008) 28 Legal Studies 172 (“Robertson”) at p 185; reference may also be\n                    made to Edwin Peel, “Remoteness Revisited” (2009)\n                    125 LQR 6 (“Peel”) at\n                    p 11 andBridgeat pp 761–762)\n                    – a point which was also emphasised (in a judicial context) inChee Peng Kwan(at [36]). Indeed, in another perceptive\n                    observation, Steve McAuley observed thus (see “Transfield Shipping Inc v\n                    Mercator Shipping Inc” (2010) 38 ABLR 65 (“McAuley”) at p 66): While, in theTransfielddecision, Lords\n                        Hoffman[n] and Hope seemingly applied the “assumed responsibility\n                        test” with relative ease in finding that the charterers did not\n                        assume responsibility for the owners’ loss relating to the new\n                        charter, the reasons given as to why the charterers did not assume\n                        responsibility aresomewhat arbitrary. In this\n                        regard, Lord Hoffman[n] cites, first, the\n                        “unquantifiable” nature of the loss claimed and, secondly, the\n                        capacity of the owners to decide whether or not to enter into a new charter\n                        prior to the vessel being returned. Both reasons given by\n                        Lord Hoffman[n] donotinvolve a detailed\n                        examination of the parties’ assumed responsibilities at the time of\n                        entering the contract,but instead involve a degree of\n                            arbitrariness on the part of the fact-finder in determining what were\n                            the assumed responsibilities of the parties. This is not to say that the decision inTransfieldwas the wrong decision. What is being argued is\n                        thatthe “assumed responsibility test”\n                            could be a mechanism used by the courts to achieve what the courts\n                            consider a just outcome, rather than requiring the courts to engage in\n                            an analysis of what types of losses the parties actually assumed\n                            responsibility for. [emphasis added] 96     Indeed, in so far as Lord Hoffmann’s reason centring on the\n                    unquantifiable nature of the loss claimed is concerned, a learned author\n                    pertinently observes (seeWeeat p 165),\n                    “the courts have never before denied recovery for losses on the basis\n                    that they are unquantifiable or unpredictable” and that “[o]n the\n                    contrary, unpredictability or unquantifiability has repeatedly been no bar to\n                    recovery whatsoever”. In point of fact, the very nature of the concept of\n                    damages itself is premised on the fact that the monetary loss is,ex hypothesi, unliquidated to begin with. 97     Returning to the passage quoted fromMcGregor(above at[94]), as that particular passage\n                    pithily emphasises, the “assumption of responsibility” (ie, Lord Hoffmann’s phraseology inThe Achilleas) isnotsomething which the parties have,ex hypothesi,\n                    had the opportunity to think about, let alone discuss at the time they entered\n                    into the contract (see alsoThode Gerd Walter(at\n                    [68])). Hence, Lord Hoffmann’s analogy (inThe\n                        Achilleas) to the doctrine ofthe implied\n                        term(see above at[80]) is\n                    – looked at in this particular light – not inapposite. However, it\n                    should be emphasised that the doctrine of the implied term is itself one oflast resort. As was aptly and pithily observed\n                    by the late R E Megarry, an implied term is “so often the last\n                    desperate resort of counsel in distress” (see R E Megarry,Miscellany-at-Law(Stevens & Sons Limited, 1955) at p 210; and cited by this\n                    court inPanwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers\n                        Building & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd[2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at [8]). Herein, in fact, lies the difficulty with\n                    the adoption of the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas: The formulation of legal rules and\n                    principles governing remoteness of damage in contract law is (as we elaborate\n                    upon below at[107]) intended to furnish\n                    lawyers, courts and students alike withgeneral\n                        guidance. Put simply, these rules and principles arenotintended as mere ad hoc, gap-filling\n                    measures. 98     It is interesting to note, at this juncture, that the broad underlying thread\n                    ofinterpretationwhich Lord Hoffmann\n                    utilises in advocating his approach centring on assumption of responsibility by\n                    the defendant (a point perceptively made byWee(above at[92])) hasalsobeen utilised by the learned law lord in the area of\n                    implied terms as well (in particular, to terms impliedin\n                        fact) – hence, the analogy drawn by Lord Hoffmann\n                    between both these aforementioned areas. However, and with the greatest of\n                    respect, the uncertainty generated in the latter area would, in our view, apply\n                    equally to the former area. In the recent Privy Council decision (on appeal from\n                    the Court of Appeal of Belize) ofAttorney General of Belize\n                        and others v Belize Telecom Limited and another[2009]\n                    1 WLR 1988, for example, Lord Hoffmann, delivering the judgment\n                    of the Board, adopted an extremely broad approach towards the implication of\n                    terms in fact, effectivelyeffacingthe\n                    distinction between the time-honoured “business efficacy” and\n                    “officious bystander” tests (for a general account of these two\n                    tests (as well as their possible relationship), see the Singapore High Court\n                    decision ofForefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v\n                        Modern-Pak Private Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at\n                    [29]-[40]). This results, however, in a lack of concrete rules (and consequent\n                    normative guidance) as well as uncertainty in the practical sphere (a point\n                    which is also emphasised byWeeat\n                    pp 162-166; reference may also be made to Elizabeth Macdonald,\n                    “Casting Aside ‘Officious Bystanders’ and ‘Business\n                    Efficacy’?” (2009) 26 JCL 97). One should not, in fact,\n                    be surprised at such a result as the lack of guidance as well as uncertainty is\n                    likely to be the result when theumbrellaconcept\n                    ofinterpretation, which is pitched at anecessarily high level of abstraction, is utilised (in\n                    substance, if not form) as the legal basis fordifferent and\n                        disparate areas of law(cfalso the\n                    collected essays in Brian Coote,Contract as Assumption\n                        – Essays on a Theme(Hart Publishing, 2010) (Rick Bigwood\n                    ed); in so far asThe Achilleasitself is\n                    concerned, see the very recent comment by Brian Coote, “Contract as\n                    Assumption and Remoteness of Damage” (2010) 26 JCL 211\n                        (“Coote”)). The lack of guidance\n                    stems from the absence of a sufficiently specific set ofconcreterules and principles whilst the resultant uncertainty\n                    is the natural consequence when legal rules and principles lacking specific and\n                    concrete guidance are sought to be applied to the various sets of facts (which\n                    are themselves necessarily myriad in nature) (in this regard, see also generally\n                    this court’s observations inMühlbauer AG v\n                        Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd[2010]\n                    2 SLR 724 (“Mühlbauer”)\n                    (at [40]-[43]) about the danger of over-generalisation and over-abstraction in\n                    making legal arguments). Put simply, whilst it is desirable from a conceptual\n                    perspective to have umbrella doctrines that make fortheoretical“neatness”, there is a limit to which\n                    one can have “one-size-fits-all”doctrinesthat will not ultimately become legal\n                    procrustean beds (see alsoWeeat pp 166 and\n                    175-176). Indeed, the necessity forspecificrules\n                    and principles has always been the hallmark of the development of the common\n                    law. Such specificity has, in fact, been (perhaps paradoxically) one of the key\n                    strengths of the common law itself, which is why Prof S F C\n                    Milsom perceptively observed that the common law system developed in a\n                    strikingly systematic fashion, notwithstanding the apparent absence of a clear\n                    blueprint as such (see generally S F C Milsom, “Reason in\n                    the Development of the Common Law” (1965) 81 LQR 496; see alsoMühlbauer(at [42]) where it is observed that\n                    there is aninteractiveprocess between theuniversaland theparticularor thegeneraland thespecificin law and decision-making). 99     Whilst on the topic of implied terms, there is some commentary onThe Achilleaswhich suggests that the approach advocated\n                    by Lord Hoffmann in that decision is actually based, instead, on the\n                    concept of terms impliedin lawrather than terms\n                    implied in fact (see, for example, John Halladay, “Remoteness of\n                    Contractual Damages” (2009) 21 Denning LJ 173 at p 178). This\n                    does not, however, appear to be the tenor of Lord Hoffmann’s judgment\n                    inThe Achilleas(which appears, instead, to adopt\n                    the analogy of terms implied infact(seePeelat p 11)). However, even assuming\n                    that it is, this would merely serve to underscore the weakness in the analogy\n                    itself. In particular, as this court has pointed out inJet\n                        Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and\n                        other appeals[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 (at\n                    [90]-[91]): 90    The category of “terms implied in law” is not without\n                            its disadvantages. A certain measure of uncertainty will always be an\n                            integral part of the judicial process and, hence, of the law itself.\n                            This is inevitable because of the very nature of life itself, which is\n                            – often to a very large extent – unpredictable. Such\n                            unpredictability and consequent uncertainty is of course a double-edged\n                            sword. It engenders both the wonder and awe as well as the dangers and\n                            pitfalls in life. Given this reality, however, one of the key functions\n                            of the courts is not to add unnecessarily to the uncertainty that\n                            already exists. Looked at in this light, the category of “terms\n                            implied in law” does tend to generate some uncertainty –\n                            not least because of the broadness of the criteria utilised to imply\n                            such terms, which are grounded (in the final analysis) on reasons of\n                            public policy. 91    However, the category of “terms implied in law” has now\n                            been firmly woven into the tapestry of our local contract law. It also\n                            aids, on occasion at least, in achieving a just and fair result. Most\n                            importantly, perhaps, it has formed both the theoretical as well as\n                            practical basis forstatutoryimplied\n                            terms, such as those found in the UK Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c 54)\n                            (applicable in Singaporeviathe\n                            application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed) and\n                            reprinted as Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed). [emphasis in original] 100    As the issue of implied terms is only indirectly before us, we do not wish to\n                    make any further observations, save to note that (in addition to the\n                    difficulties arising from utilising an analogy with terms implied in fact as\n                    noted above) treating the analogy utilised by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleasas one referring to terms implied in law\n                    (as opposed to terms implied in fact) does not meet the problems of a lack of\n                    guidance as well as the generation of uncertainty and may, on one view at least,\n                    in fact exacerbate them. (2)   The merits of the existing approach inHadley (A)   Existing approach already embodies and encompasses the\n                concept of assumption of responsibility 101    More importantly, even if we accept Lord Hoffmann’s premise that\n                    the focus ought to be on the agreement between the parties, any solution\n                        (as in the case of implied terms) willnecessarilybe one that isimposed by the court(albeit based on the objective evidence).\n                    Looked at inthislight, it is our view that,even if(again) we accept\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach inThe\n                        Achilleas,both the limbsinHadleywouldnecessarily\n                        embody and encompass the necessary criteria for ascertaining (on an\n                        objective basis) whether or not there had been an assumption of\n                        responsibility or an implied undertaking on the part of the\n                        defendant(a similar point was also perceptively made by a\n                    learned author in his commentary onRobertson Quay(see Goh Yihan, “Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v\n                        Steen Consultants Pte Ltd” (2009) 9 OUCLJ 101\n                        (“Goh”) at p 107), though\n                    the author did not appear to go so far as to suggest that Lord Hoffmann’s\n                    assumption of responsibility could besubsumedunder the two limbs inHadley).\n                        If so, then, with the greatest of respect, Lord Hoffmann has not really\n                        added anything new to the existing law, which continues to operate based on\n                        the legal rules and principles laid down in the seminal decision\n                        ofHadley. Let us elaborate upon as well as explain the\n                    proposition just made by consideringbothof the\n                    limbs inHadley seriatim. However, before\n                    proceeding to do so, it is interesting to note that at least one commentator has\n                    characterised a part of Lord Hoffmann’s judgment inThe Achilleas(see above at[79]) as adopting what he terms “a “soft”\n                    version” of the agreement-centred approach” (seeWeeat p 168). We agree with him, however, that\n                    (seeWeeat pp 168-169): ... [t]he soft version of the agreement-centred approach is ...identical in substance and theoryto the traditional\n                        approach to remoteness [inHadley], though\n                        dressed up in different terminology: where the contract would be understood\n                        by a reasonable person in all the circumstances not to contain any terms,\n                        express or implied, limiting recovery for breach, recoverable losses are\n                        those which are foreseeable as a not unlikely consequence of breach.\n                        [emphasis added] (B)   The first limb ofHadleyand\n                the concept of assumption of responsibility 102    Turning, then, to thefirst limbinHadley, this court had described it (together withthesecond limb) inRobertson Quay, as follows (at [55] and\n                    [59]–[60]): 55    Turning to theSingaporecontext, there is no\n                            doubt that the rule inHadley, as restated by\n                            Asquith LJ in Victoria Laundry (as set out in the preceding\n                            paragraph), represents the law in relation to remoteness of damage in\n                            contract. In the Singapore High Court decision ofCHS CPO GmbH\n                                v Vikas Goel[2005] 3 SLR(R) 202 (“CHS CPO GmbH”), for example, a summary of\n                            the law in this particular area was furnished, as follows (at\n                            [81]–[83] and [85]): It is established law that remoteness of damage\n                                under contract law comprises two limbs- first, damage\n                            flowing “naturally” from the breach of contract and,\n                            secondly, “unusual” damage which (by its very definition)\n                            does not flow naturally from the breach of contract but, rather, is due\n                            to special circumstances.These two limbs are in\n                                fact to be found in the seminal decision of the (English) Court of\n                                Exchequer inHadley... as helpfully elaborated upon in the English\n                                Court of Appeal decision of Victoria Laundry ... Indeed,\n                            in the latter decision, Asquith LJ (who delivered the judgment of the\n                            court) perceptively and helpfully distinguished between two kinds of\n                            knowledge that must be brought home to the defendant in order that the\n                            damage might not be considered to be too remote. The first isimputedknowledge. Knowledge is\n                            imputed when it is the kind or type of knowledge that everyone, as\n                            reasonable people, must be taken to know. Everyone must, as reasonable\n                            people, be taken to know of damage which flows “naturally”\n                            from a breach of contract. In other words, this category of (imputed)\n                            knowledge is linked to thefirstlimb referred to\n                            in [81] above. What is of vital legal significance is that in so far as\n                            such “natural” or “ordinary” damage is\n                            concerned, there is no need for the plaintiff to prove actual knowledge\n                            on the part of the defendant: the defendant (in this particular case,\n                            the plaintiffs) must betaken to know(under the\n                            concept of imputed knowledge) that such damage wouldordinarilyensue as a result of the breach of contract\n                            concerned. The second type of knowledge isactualknowledge.\n                            Not surprisingly, this particular category of knowledge relates to thesecond limbreferred to in [81] above. It\n                            concerns “special” or “non-natural” damage\n                            that results from a breach of contract. A relatively more stringent\n                            criterion of knowledge is here required in order that the damage will\n                            not be found to be too remote in law. Put simply, the defendant must\n                            have hadactualknowledge of the special\n                            circumstances which are outside the usual course of things. These\n                            circumstances must be such that, in the event of a breach of contract\n                            occurring, loss or damage goingbeyondwhat would\n                            ordinarily result under the first limb (referred to in [81], above, and\n                            which,ex hypothesi, [is] within the usual course\n                            of things) would ensue. In fairness to the defendant, in order for him\n                            or her to be fixed with liability for such “special” or\n                            “non-natural” damage, he or she must have had actual\n                            knowledge of the aforementioned special circumstances. In order for suchactualknowledge to be brought home, as it\n                            were, to the defendant, an objective test is utilised. ... ... That the abovementioned principles are part of Singapore law can be\n                            seen, for example, from a local decision decided as far back as 1880:\n                            seeYeo Leng Tow & Co v Rautenberg, Schmidt &\n                                Co(1880) 1 Ky 491. There are of course more recent\n                            decisions, including the Singapore Court of Appeal decisions ofHong Fok Realty Pte Ltd v Bima Investment Pte\n                                Ltd[1992] 2 SLR(R) 834 andCity\n                                Securities Pte Ltd v Associated Management Services Pte\n                                Ltd[1996] 1 SLR(R) 410. [emphasis added in bold italics] The above statement of principle was, in fact, endorsed by this court inJet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte\n                            Ltd[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769, where it was held (at\n                        [106]) that “the Singapore High Court decision ofCHS CPO GmbH ... reaffirms the fact that the principles\n                        established inHadley... continue to be the\n                        law in the Singapore context.” … 59    We wish to add here that the criterion of “reasonable\n                            contemplation” applies to both limbs of the rule inHadley, although a difference exists between its\n                            application with respect to each of the two limbs. For the first limb of\n                            Hadley, the horizon of contemplation is confined to loss which arises\n                            naturally in the usual course of things and which is therefore presumed\n                            to have been within the contemplation of the parties. For the second\n                            limb of the rule inHadley(“the second limb\n                            ofHadley”), by reason of the special\n                            knowledge possessed by the party who breaches the contract (“the\n                            contract-breaker”), the horizon of contemplation is extended to\n                            loss that does not arise in the usual course of things (seeThe Heron IIat 415-416). We pause to observe,\n                            parenthetically, at this juncture, that there might, on occasion at\n                            least, be some haziness between these two limbs - a point which,\n                            however, does not arise for analysis or decision in the present appeal\n                            (for a discussion of this particular point, see the recent House of\n                            Lords decision ofSempra Metals Ltd v Inland Revenue\n                                Commissioners[2007] 3 WLR 354 (“Sempra Metals”) at [215] (per\n                            Lord Mance) as well as the (also) House of Lords decision ofJackson v Royal Bank of Scotland plc[2005]\n                            1 WLR 377 (“Jackson”) at\n                            [46]-[49] (perLord Walker of Gestingthorpe)).\n                            In relation to this point, there have also been some cases that have\n                            commented that the rule inHadleyshould be treated\n                            as a composite whole and viewed as stating a single principle (see, for\n                            instance, per Christopher Clarke J inThe\n                                Achilleas[2007] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 19 at [49]\n                            (whose decision was affirmed, but without any apparent discussion of\n                            this particular issue, by the English Court of Appeal (see [2007]\n                            2 Lloyd’s Rep 555)), as well as per Robert Goff J\n                            inThe Pegase[1981] 1 Lloyd’s\n                            Rep 175 at 182). These cases, however, recognise that the\n                            application of the rule inHadley dependson thedegree of knowledgeheld by the\n                            contract-breaker at the time of the contract (seeThe\n                                Achilleasat [51] andThe Pegaseat\n                            182). In the circumstances, it is clear, in our view, that these cases\n                            are not suggesting, in any way, anything that is different, insubstance, from our interpretation of the rule inHadley(as set out at [55] above). On a\n                            separate note, there is also the possible ramification of distinguishing\n                            between the type and the extent of loss arising from a breach of\n                            contract (see, in this regard, the perceptive case note by\n                            Demetrios H Hadjihambis, “Remoteness of Damage in\n                            Contract” (1978) 41 MLR 483 at 484-485, commenting on\n                            one of several issues raised by the somewhat controversial English Court\n                            of Appeal decision ofH Parsons (Livestock) Ltd v Uttley\n                                Ingham & Co Ltd[1978] QB 791, where\n                            Lord Denning MR also sought to apply the tortious rules on\n                            remoteness to a contractual claim for physical injury or damage (see\n                            also the Ontario Court of Appeal decision ofKienzle v\n                                Stringer(1981) 130 DLR (3d) 272 at 276 (per\n                            Zuber JA) as well as the English Court of Appeal decision ofBrown v KMR Services Ltd[1995] 4 All ER\n                            598)). 60    What is significant, however, is that the rule inHadleycontinues to be endorsed (in, inter alia,Sempra Metalsas well asJackson) as good law. We also wish to state that we do\n                            not see the point in embarking on an exegesis of the precise degree of\n                            probability required to satisfy the threshold of “reasonable\n                            contemplation” as to do so would be to engage in the\n                            “semantic hairsplitting” referred to inTang Kin\n                                Hwa(([57] supra) at [44]). Indeed, the assessment of\n                            damages is “not an exact science” to begin with (per\n                            Lord Upjohn in The Heron II at 425). We agree with\n                            Sellers LJ’s comments in the English Court of Appeal decision\n                            ofC Czarnikow v Koufos[1966] 2 QB 695\n                            (which was the immediate precursor toThe Heron II)\n                            at 722 that: The phrases and words ofHadley v. Baxendalehave\n                            been hallowed by long [use] and gain little advantage from the\n                            paraphrases or substitutes. The ideas and factors conveyed by the words\n                            are clear enough. [emphasis in original] 103    It is therefore clear – and thisalsoappears to be the view taken pursuant to the integrated approach (which is\n                    discussed below (at[121]–[125])) – that thefirst\n                        limbinHadley necessarily embodies an implied\n                        undertaking or assumption of responsibilityon the part of the\n                    defendant (albeit on animputedbasis). Thisimputationisjustifiedon the ground that, in so far asnatural or ordinaryloss is concerned, any reasonable person in\n                    the shoes of the defendant should (with the (imputed) knowledge that such loss would ensue) betaken to have assumed responsibility for such loss should it breach\n                        the contract concerned. Hence, even if we adopt\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach inThe\n                        Achilleas, the reasoning just referred to would provide the court\n                    withan objective basisfor finding that the\n                    defendant had (in the absence of an express undertaking to the contrary)assumed responsibilityfor the (natural or ordinary) loss which has occurred.Put simply, even if we accept Lord Hoffmann’s approach,\n                        it is, in fact, already an intrinsic part of the first limb inHadley. (C)   The second limb ofHadleyand\n                the concept of assumption of responsibility 104    Turning now to thesecond limbinHadley, this court had, in fact, described it inRobertson Quayin the passages already quoted\n                    above (at[102]). 105    It is clear that it will be the case that Lord Hoffmann’s approach\n                    inThe Achilleaswill be anadditionalelement with respect to thesecond\n                        limbinHadley only iftheactualknowledge of the defendant under this\n                    particular limb ofHadleyis thought to beinsufficientfrom a legal point of view\n                    – in so far as the establishment of an implied obligation or an assumption\n                    of responsibility on the part of the defendant is concerned. There is, in fact,\n                    some (older) authority (stretching backalmost five\n                        decades) to the effect that thesecondlimb inHadley isbased onan implied undertakingon the part of the\n                    defendant to the plaintiff that it would bear the (enhanced) loss. This is to be\n                    found in the judgment of Diplock LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision\n                    ofRobophone Facilities Ltd v Blank[1966]\n                    1 WLR 1428 (“Robophone\n                    Facilities”) at 1448. However, the learned judge did observe\n                    that the defendant’s “actual knowledge of the special circumstances\n                    is relevant asoneof the factors from which [its]\n                    undertaking can be implied” [emphasis in original] (id). Diplock LJ then proceeded to observe thus (id): The second factor is also necessary,viz.,\n                        that he should have acquired this knowledge from the plaintiff, or at least\n                        that [it] should know that the plaintiff knew that [it] was possessed of it\n                        at the time the contract was entered into and so could reasonably foresee at\n                        that time that an enhanced loss was liable to result from a breach. Where\n                        both these factors are present, the defendant’s conduct in entering\n                        into the contract without disclaiming liability for the enhanced loss which\n                        he can foreseegives rise to the implication that he\n                            undertakes to bear it. But such an undertaking need not be left to\n                            implication; it can be express. If the contract contained an\n                        express undertaking by the defendant to be responsible for all actual loss\n                        to the plaintiff occasioned by the defendant’s breach, whatever that\n                        loss might turn out to be, it would not affect the defendant’s\n                        liability for the loss actually sustained by the plaintiff that the\n                        defendant did not know of the special circumstances which were likely to\n                        cause any enhancement of the plaintiff’s loss. [emphasis added] 106    The key issue that arises at this juncture, in our view, centres on theroleof theactualknowledge of the defendant. Is it, as thesecond limbinHadleyassumes,sufficient – in and of itself – to be\n                        the basis for an implied obligation on the part of the defendant that it\n                        would assume responsibility for the (extraordinary) loss flowing from its\n                        breach? Orisactualknowledge\n                    merelya factor (and no more)in ascertaining\n                    whether or not there was such an obligation (a point which is implicit in\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach inThe\n                        Achilleas(especially given his classification of his approach as\n                    a “prima facie assumption” which is rebuttable if the context and\n                    surrounding circumstances so justify (see[79]above) but which is brought clearly to the fore by\n                    Diplock LJ inRobophone Facilities)?\n                    Notwithstanding the legendary abilities of both Lord Hoffmann and\n                    Lord Diplock (as he later became) in general and their considerable\n                    scholarship in the law of contract in particular (see, for example, Brice\n                    Dickson, “The Contribution of Lord Diplock to the General Law of\n                    Contract” (1989) 9 OJLS 441), it is our view, with the greatest of\n                    respect, that theformerproposition reflects the\n                    correct state of the law. Let us elaborate. Before proceeding to do so, however,\n                    we note that Prof Coote (despite his (not surprising) endorsement of the\n                    concept of assumption of responsibility (see also above at[98])) perceptively points out that\n                    Lord Diplock, whilst also adopting a similar approach to that inRobophone Facilitiesat the English Court of Appeal\n                    stage of theHeron II(seeC Czarnikow Ltd v Koufos[1966] 2 QB 695 at\n                    727–728), might well havemodified his viewsin the (subsequent) House of Lords decision ofPhoto\n                        Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd[1980] AC 827\n                    (at 848–849) (seeCooteat\n                    p 219). 107    It will be recalled that the obligation or assumption of responsibility with\n                    regard to thelossflowing as a result of abreach of contractis (in the absence of a\n                    relevantexpressterm)necessarilyanimpliedone (see\n                    also above at[97]). This proposition would,\n                    of course, apply toboth limbsinHadleyand is, in fact, also a premise underlying\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach inThe\n                        Achilleasas well (although it is significant to note that\n                    Lord Hope appeared, also inThe Achilleas(at\n                    [36]), to suggestotherwise). If so, then it isthe courtwhichimputessuch an obligation on the defendant, albeit on anobjectivebasis. Looked at in this light, it\n                    is our view thatthe criterion of knowledge furnishes a\n                        sufficiently objective basis on which to premise the existence (or\n                        otherwise) of an implied obligation or assumption of responsibility on the\n                        defendant. To leave the situation open to other factors would\n                    lead to unnecessary speculation as well as uncertainty. At this particular\n                    juncture, it is helpful to note that,unlikea\n                    situation relating to a term impliedin fact(which, it will be recalled, was an analogy which was utilised by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas), the court isnotconcerned with embarking on agap-fillingexercise. Put simply, the rules relating to\n                    remoteness of damage in contract law are (contrary to Lord Hoffmann’s\n                    view)universal and external rules of lawapplicable toallsituations where a breach of\n                    contract has occurred (what Kramer refers to as involving “the default\n                    rule theory” (seeKramerat p 251);\n                    thoughcfthe characterisation by\n                    Prof Robertson who refers to the remoteness rule as a “gap-filling\n                    device” (seeRobertsonat pp 172 and\n                    196), although the difference in view might be one of degree rather than kind,\n                    depending on the extent to which partiesexpresslyallocate risks for the loss resulting from a breach of contract). This is only\n                    just and fair toallparties toallcontracts. Indeed, as AR Teo points out inChee Peng Kwan(at [40]), “the law on remoteness\n                    can be said to be concerned not merely with protecting the contractual bargainbut also with the wider policy considerationof placing suitable limitations on contractual liabilities” [emphasis\n                    added]. Whilst all this is true, we pause to observe that the necessity of\n                    relying upon universal and external rules of law is one that cannot,in the nature of things, be avoided in any event since\n                    (as explained below at[111]), we are\n                    dealing with a situation where the parties,ex\n                        hypothesi, never had the issue of the breach of the contract (and\n                    the ensuing loss) in mind and, if they had, ought to have provided expressly for\n                    them. Indeed, and in this last-mentioned regard, AR Peh also points out, inThode Gerd Walter(at [69]; and see also\n                    [68]), that this is, in fact,yet another policyconsideration that must also be taken into account: From a policy perspective, it may be questionable why the courts should\n                        provide additional protection to defendants inallcases by imposing a higher threshold in insisting that a\n                        defendant should only be liable for losses that he could be said to have\n                        reasonable assumed responsibility ... As noted by Lord Reid inThe Heron II... (at 385-386) and Andrew\n                        Phang JA inRobertson Quay(at [71] and\n                        [75]-[76]), parties in a contract case, unlike those in tort, have the\n                        opportunity to direct each others’ attention to the unusual risks and\n                        either can take extra precautions to safeguard his position. [emphasis in\n                        original] (D)   The principles inHadleyand\n                their consistency with both logic and the idea of agreement 108    We would also reiterate the following observations made by this court inRobertson Quay(at [77]–[83]), which\n                    elaborate on why the principles laid down inHadleynot only constitute a set of universal and external rules\n                    of law (which are undergirded by sound logic) but are also consistent with the\n                    very essence of the law of contract itself (which gives effect to the idea of\n                    the contract as anagreement): 77    In this appeal, we are concerned with a claim for anunliquidatedamount of monetary loss. This is the pith\n                            and marrow of the concept ofdamages. In such a\n                            situation, given that the contracting parties have not fixed in advance\n                            in the contract itself the type as well as the amount of monetary loss\n                            recoverable (contracases involving liquidated\n                            damages clauses), the courts have to formulate rules as to, inter alia,\n                            what is recoverable and what is too remote to be recoverable. 78    Two important principles feature in this process. First, the courts\n                            have to formulategeneral rules and principles premised on\n                                justice and fairnesswhich wouldapply\n                                universally to all contracting parties(such rules and\n                            principles are commonly referred to as “default rules”).\n                            In this regard, acrucial factorto bear in mind is\n                            the fact that the parties concerned, ascontracting\n                                parties, would havehad an opportunity to\n                                communicate with each other in advance(see alsoThe Heron IIat 386perLord Reid (reproduced above at [71])). This factor is significant\n                            because, although the contracting parties may not have decided to fix in\n                            advance the type as well as the quantum of monetary loss recoverable\n                            should a breach of contract occur, the fact remains (as just mentioned)that they had an opportunity to communicate with each\n                                other in advanceon,inter alia,\n                            this particular issue. Second, whatever general rules and principles the\n                            court formulatesmust not have the result of rewriting the\n                                contract for the parties, asthatcontract constitutes the original bargain entered into by the parties\n                            and ought (from the perspective ofsanctity of\n                                contract) to be honoured as far as is possible. All this\n                            sets the legal backdrop against which we ought to view the two limbs of\n                            the rule inHadleyand, as importantly, furnishes\n                            us with the rationale as to why these two limbs are not arbitrary\n                            formulations, but are, rather, considered statements of law which take\n                            into account precisely the legal backdrop as well as the concomitant\n                            considerations delineated in this paragraph. 79    It is important to reiterate, by way ofsummary,\n                            the points made in the preceding paragraph:The task of the\n                                courts, in the context of remoteness of damage in contract, is to\n                                formulate rules and principles that would apply universally to all\n                                contracting parties in situations where the contracting parties have\n                                not expressly provided, in advance, for what is to happen in the\n                                event of a breach of their respective contracts. In doing so, the\n                                courts will bear in mind the fact that the contracting parties did\n                                have the opportunity to communicate with each other in\n                                advance.The courts must, however, also be\n                                careful to ensure that the rules and principles formulated do not\n                                result in a rewriting of the contract in question, which, being the\n                                original bargain entered into by the contracting parties, should be\n                                honoured so as to ensure that there is sanctity of\n                                contract. 80    Bearing these important considerations in mind, it is now clear why\n                            the two limbs set out inHadleyareconsistent withthe points set out in the preceding two\n                            paragraphs. 81    To elaborate, damage which falls under thefirst\n                                limbofHadley(which may be termed“ordinary” damage(seeCHS CPO GmbH([55]supra) at [82])\n                            ought to bewell withinthe reasonable\n                            contemplation of all of thecontracting partiesconcerned. Since everyone (including the contracting parties) must,as reasonable people, be taken to know of\n                            damage which flows “naturally” (ibid)\n                            from a breach of contract, the first limb ofHadleydoesnoviolence to the original bargain between\n                            the contracting parties who,ex hypothesi, have not\n                            expressly provided for what is to happen in the event of a breach of\n                            their contract.However,ifthe contracting parties had thought about this issue, theywould, in all likelihood, have agreedthat the\n                            contract-breaker should be liable in damages for all such“ordinary”damage. It is therefore neither unjust nor unfair toimputeknowledge of such damage to them (see\n                            above at [55]). Indeed, to argue otherwise would be unjust and absurd as\n                            the logical conclusion of such an argument would be that the\n                            contract-breaker would not be liable for any loss at all. 82    Damage which falls under thesecond limbofHadley(ie,“extraordinary” or “non-natural”\n                                damage(CHS CPO GmbHat [83])) isnot, by itsvery nature,\n                            within the reasonable contemplation of the contracting parties. In the\n                            circumstances, it would be bothunjust and unfairtoimputeto them knowledge that such damage or\n                            loss would arise upon a breach of contract.However,ifthe contracting parties,having had the opportunity to communicate with each other\n                                in advance, hadactual(as opposed\n                            to imputed) knowledge ofthe special circumstanceswhich resulted in the “extraordinary” or\n                            “non-natural” damage, then it isneitherunjustnorunfair to hold\n                            the contract-breaker liable in damages for such damage. If,armed withsuchactualknowledge,\n                            the contracting parties do not make express provision in their contract\n                            for what is to happen in the event of a breach of that contract\n                            resulting in “extraordinary” or\n                            “non-natural” damage,then they must be taken to\n                                have agreed that should such damage occur, the contract-breaker\n                                would be liable for such damage. As Lord Hope of\n                            Craighead put it inJackson([59]supra) at [26]: Where knowledge of special circumstances is relied on, the assumption\n                            is that the defendant [ie, the contract-breaker]\n                            undertook to bear any special loss which was referable to those special\n                            circumstances. It is assumed too that he had the opportunity to seek to\n                            limit his liability under the contract for ordinary losses in the event\n                            that he was in breach of it. 83    It will be seen, therefore, that the two limbs of the rule inHadleyare wholly consistent with - and, in\n                            fact, give effect to - the concept of contract as anagreement. And, in doing so, theysimultaneously distinguishthe rules and principles on\n                            remoteness in contract from those in tort. Above all, as we have seen,\n                            they are just and fair, and constitute the best legal regime available,\n                            given the fact that the contracting parties have not,ex\n                                hypothesi, expressly provided for what is to happen\n                            should a breach of their contract occur. It is also important to note,\n                            at this juncture, that in the absence of such express contractual\n                            provision, the only alternative the courts have is to formulateuniversalrules and principles; the other\n                            alternative - that of doing nothing - is clearly untenable and wholly\n                            impractical. This is, therefore, yet another - andfundamental- reason why the rules and principles\n                            enunciated inHadleyought to continue as the\n                            applicable law governing remoteness of damage in the law of contract in\n                            Singapore. [emphasis in original] 109    In the circumstances, therefore, the universal and external rules of law (as\n                    embodied inbothlimbs inHadley) are, in substance, thebest possible\n                        reflectionof what the partieswould have\n                        agreed to had they thought about a situation in which the contract was\n                        breached. Tothat (practical)extent, the “intentions of the parties”are, in fact, being given effect to (cfalsoperAR Peh inThode Gerd Walter(at [67]), where it is\n                    observed,inter alia, that “it would not be\n                    wrong to say that at the heart of both approaches [viz, the traditional approach and the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas] is still the\n                    ultimate desire to provide for the recoverability of damages for breach of\n                    contract in a way that gives thebesteffect to\n                    the concept of a contract as anagreement”\n                    [emphasis in original]). (E)Hadleyavoids the problems inThe Achilleas 110    The approach we have suggested also harks back to the theoretical difficulties\n                    referred to above (at [92]–[93]), where it had been pointed out that,\n                    although the approach from interpretation (embodied in the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas) appeared to\n                    furnish an ostensible external rule of guidance, it was clearly distinct from\n                    the doctrine of remoteness of damage and, instead, generated (in substance) muchuncertainty(as we have explained above).\n                    Neither can the approach from interpretation be justified on the basis of an\n                    analogy with terms impliedin law(a point which\n                    we have also dealt with above (at[99]–[100])). Whilst\n                    it might be argued that the principles of remoteness of damage embodied in the\n                    two limbs inHadleymight also give rise to\n                    different results (depending on the precise facts before the court), this isinevitableas every (even) universal and\n                    external rule of law must beappliedto thefactsat hand. However, what ought to beavoided, in our view, are approaches (such as\n                    that advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe\n                        Achilleas) which engenderexcessive and\n                        unnecessaryuncertainty. (f)Hadleyprovides the necessary\n                framework 111    Indeed, at this juncture, we would note that it isnot, generally speaking, possible toavoidlaying down a universal and external rule of law.Anyapproach isnecessarilyaclaimtouniversalapplicability. Looked at in this light,eventhe approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleasis,\n                    notwithstanding its focus on the actual intentions of the parties themselves,necessarily itselfa universal and external\n                    rule of law – albeit one (which we have explained above) that engenders\n                    excessive and unnecessary uncertainty. 112    If the rules relating to remoteness of damage in contract law are (as we have\n                    just explained) universal and external rules of law applicable to all situations\n                    and which (prima facieat least) ensure justice\n                    and fairness for all parties to all contracts, then, in the spirit of justice\n                    and fairness, theexisting distinctiondrawn\n                    betweenimputedknowledge (under thefirst limbinHadley) andactualknowledge (under thesecond limbinHadley) suffices,\n                    in our view, to provide the court with a sufficiently nuanced approach towards\n                    dealing (in apracticalmanner) with whether or\n                    not the defendant concerned has assumed responsibility with respect tonatural or ordinary lossandextraordinary loss, respectively. In particular, where the\n                    defendant is sought to be held liable forextraordinary\n                        loss, then merelyimputingknowledge on it is unfair.However, if the\n                    defendantdidpossessactualknowledge, then it is fair, in our view, that it be taken\n                    to have assumed the responsibility for that (extraordinary) loss. 113    As a matter of practical import, it might be observed, at this juncture, that,\n                    in so far as extraordinary loss under thesecondlimb inHadleyis concerned,muchwill depend on theprecise\n                        factsof the case before the court. This furnishessufficient flexibility, in our view, to deal with\n                    difficult situations in so far as thecharacterisationof theactual\n                        knowledgewhich the defendant ought to possess is concerned.\n                    However, it bears noting that the concept of characterisation is not an\n                    unbridled licence to lawyers or the courts to do as they please. Indeed, the\n                    very factual matrix itself – coupled with logic and commonsense –\n                    serve as natural constraints on all concerned. In any event, contrary to the\n                    rather fanciful theories of radical theorists, this is not what, in fact, takes\n                    place in practice. Indeed, theinteractionof law\n                    and fact (which necessarily takes place as the law cannot operate in an abstract\n                    vacuum) is not only a hallmark of the common law system but the flexibility\n                    contained therein is also one of the considerable strengths of that system as\n                    well. Such interaction also ensures that thequalitative as\n                        well as contextual contentsof the circumstances which the\n                    defendant must have actual knowledge of ensures a more nuanced approach that\n                    avoids the possible injustice that might result (cf, though, a learned author’s apprehension that this\n                    court’s “equation of special knowledge with liability in respect of\n                    the second limb [inHadley] might be\n                    over-inclusive in some instances, rendering defendants liable in circumstances\n                    of mere knowledge” (seeGohat\n                    p 108)). On one view at least, such flexibility is, simultaneously, a\n                    demonstration of how justice and fairness are achieved in a practical (and, by\n                    its very nature, imperfect) context. However, all this is not to state that\n                    different courts cannot come to the opposite conclusions based on the same facts\n                    (bearing in mind that there are also other factors that have to be considered,\n                    including the precise degree of probability required pursuant to the principles\n                    laid down inHadley(as to which, seeRobertson Quay(at [57])). The fact situation inThe Achilleasitself furnishes an excellent\n                    illustration in this regard. As we will show shortly (see[115]below), it might have beenpossibleto argue that the loss claimed by the\n                    (plaintiff) shipowners inThe Achilleasfell\n                    within thesecond limbofHadleyand that, in the circumstances, the charterers didnothaveactualknowledge of the relevant circumstances. (3)   Alternative analyses ofThe\n                    Achilleasbased on the principles inHadley 114    As we have seen, inThe Achilleas, the House of\n                    Lords unanimously held in favour of the (defendant) charterers (albeit on\n                    somewhat different grounds in so far as the individual law lords were\n                    concerned). At this juncture, we would observe that a furtheralternativeanalysis based on the principles inHadleycouldalso possiblybe applied to the facts ofThe Achilleas–\n                    to achieve thesameresult that was arrived at by\n                    the House itself. In particular, it is possible that in light of the evidence\n                    fromthe shipping industry(at least as it existed\n                    at that particular point in time) to the effect that thetype\n                        of losssuffered by the shipowners inThe\n                        Achilleaswas not recoverable (the (then)establishedunderstanding\n                    being that shipowners were entitled to only the difference between the market\n                    rate and the charter rate for the overrun period), the shipowners’ loss inThe Achilleaswas not natural or ordinary loss\n                    which fell within the first limb ofHadley(cfalso the approach by Lord Rodger (see\n                    above at[84]) and Baroness Hale (see above\n                    at[87]) inThe\n                        Achilleaswho both decided the case based on the first limb inHadley, albeit for different reasons). And, as\n                    already explained above, the concept of assumption of responsibility would be anintegral part ofthefirst\n                        limbinHadley. However, this is a\n                    merehypotheticalanalysis (bearing in mind the\n                    fact that the House didnotaccept the evidence\n                    just mentioned in arriving at its decision, as well as the fact that it was\n                    conceded right from the start by the charterers inThe\n                        Achilleasthat missing dates for a subsequent fixture was a not\n                    unlikely result of late redelivery (seeThe\n                        Achilleasat [53] and [90])). 115    It might have also been possible to argue (as we alluded to briefly above (at[113])) that applying the principles\n                    laid down inHadley, the loss claimed by the\n                    shipowners fell within thesecond limbofHadleyand that, in the circumstances, the\n                    charterers didnothaveactualknowledge of the relevant circumstances. This would have\n                    entailed thesameresult as that which was arrived\n                    at by the House of Lords, albeitwithouthaving to\n                    utilise the additional criterion (advocated by Lord Hoffmann) centring on\n                    the assumption of responsibility by the defendant (cfalsoBridge(at p 762)).\n                    Indeed, consistent with the analysis proffered above, an assumption of\n                    responsibility would already have been an integral part of not only the first\n                    limb inHadleybut also the second limb as well.\n                    However, this is, again,onlyahypotheticalexample (or, rather, analysis) as the same issues\n                    which arose inThe Achilleashave not, to the best\n                    of our knowledge, arisen for decision before the Singapore courts (or at least\n                    before this court). When, however, a situation akin toThe\n                        Achilleascomes before the Singapore courts, what is clear is\n                    that the principles inHadleywill have to be\n                    fully argued before this court as they apply to the fact situation itself. We\n                    pause – parenthetically – to note that some commentators would in\n                    factdisagreewith the argument (just considered)\n                    to the effect that the loss claimed inThe\n                        Achilleasfalls within thesecond\n                        limbofHadley, arguing that thetypeof loss was reasonably contemplated under\n                    thefirstlimb inHadleyalthough theextentwas not\n                        (cfalso our alternative analysis based on thefirstlimb inHadleyin the preceding paragraph), distinguishingThe Achilleasfrom the fact situation as well as the\n                    holding (with respect to the issue of extraordinary loss pursuant to thesecond limbofHadley) in the English Court of Appeal decision ofVictoria Laundry (Windsor) Ld v Newman Industries Ld[1949] 2 KB 528 (“Victoria\n                    Laundry”) (see, for example,Peelat p 8; Janet O’Sullivan, “Damages\n                    for Lost Profits for Late Redelivery: How Remote is Too Remote?” [2009]\n                    CLJ 34 (“O’Sullivan”) at\n                    p 37; Gary Richard Coveney, “Damages for Late Delivery Under Time\n                    Charters: Certainty at Last?” (2009) 23 Austl & NZ Mar\n                    LJ 205 (“Coveney”) at\n                    pp 208-209; andHalladayat p 177 (see\n                    also above at[84])). However, as already\n                    observed in the preceding paragraph, we think it is possible to find that thetypeof loss was not contemplated by the\n                    parties based on the first limb inHadley. Even on\n                    the facts ofThe Achilleas, it is clear that at\n                    least two law lords (viz, Lord Rodger and Baroness\n                    Hale) arrived at that particular conclusion. 116    Notwithstanding that our alternative analysis here onThe\n                        Achilleasbased on the principles inHadleyis a merehypotheticalanalysis, it does demonstrate thatthe principles\n                        inHadleymay well be sufficient to achieve\n                        justice in the case at hand without the need for a further (and artificial)\n                        construct of an assumption of responsibility. And, as we have\n                    also argued above, the element of assumption of responsibility would, looked at\n                    in this light,also be embodied or subsumed within the two\n                        limbs inHadleyin any event. This\n                    view also derives some support from the many views expressed to the effect that\n                    thesameresult is quite likely to resultregardlessof which approach is used (see, for\n                    example,Thode Gerd Walter(at [67]) as well asPeel(at p 12)). We should perhaps also\n                    note in passing here that it would always be open to parties, placed in a\n                    similar situation such as that inThe Achilleas,\n                    to exclude liability for consequential loss of this kind by inserting a suitable\n                    clause in their contract (as also pointed out by Baroness Hale inThe Achilleas(see above at [86])). 117    It is also significant, in our view, that the approach advocated by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleashas been\n                    subject to much criticism in the academic literature. This is, in itself, not\n                    necessarily conclusive by any means. However, theextentof the criticism is unusual. More importantly, thecontentof many of the various criticisms is,\n                    in many instances, very persuasive. Indeed, we have already referred to a number\n                    of the more significant criticisms during the course of our analysis in the\n                    preceding paragraphs of this judgment and will therefore not rehearse them again\n                    (reference may also be made, in this regard, toChitty on\n                        Contracts(H G Beale gen ed)\n                    (Sweet & Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) vol 1 at\n                    para 26-100G). Suffice it to state that few decisions – particularly\n                    of the highest appellate court in England – have been subject to so much\n                    criticism in both leading textbooks as well as articles and comments in a\n                    variety of international journals. In addition to the specific criticisms\n                    already canvassed above, it has also been argued that the actual decision inThe Achilleasis due, rather, to “wider\n                    policy considerations” which ought to be “openly explored”\n                    in “future decisions” (seeO’Sullivanat p 37; reference may also be made toCoveneyat p 209). In point of fact,\n                    however, we have in fact demonstrated above (at[107]) that thetraditionalrules\n                    of remoteness (as embodied inHadley) havealreadytaken into account the keypolicyconsiderations. (4)   An extreme hypothetical example explained 118    Before turning to English case law decidedafterthe decision inThe Achilleaswas handed down, it\n                    might be appropriate to consider briefly an oft-cited hypothetical example which\n                    has been utilised to demonstrate the utility as well as persuasiveness of\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach inThe\n                        Achilleas(see, for example,Kramerat pp 269–270). This is the example of a taxi driver who, before he\n                    or she accepts the fare, is informed by the passenger about a crucial meeting to\n                    which that passenger must get to on time. If the taxi driver fails, in breach of\n                    contract, to get the passenger to that meeting in a timely manner and, as a\n                    result, the passenger suffers an enormous business loss, is the taxi driver\n                    liable for that loss? Advocates of Lord Hoffmann’s approach would\n                    suggest not because the taxi driver had not assumed responsibility for such\n                    loss. Although this suggestion is attractive at first blush, having regard to\n                    the various weaknesses inherent in that particular approach, we would suggest\n                    that thesameresult could be arrived at by\n                    utilising the traditional principles embodied inHadley. A learned author put it well when he reasoned as follows\n                    (seePeelat p 10): The language of “accepting risk” is not entirely apt since\n                        it can convey the idea that liability for the losses which flow from one\n                        party’s breach is simply a question of discerning the intention of the\n                        parties, but that is a view that has hitherto been rejected (see, e.g.The Heron IIat 422, per\n                        Lord Upjohn).It is preferable to say of examples\n                            such as the taxi driver ... that it is not “reasonable” to\n                            impose liability (The Heron IIat\n                            422), or that it is not “proper” to do so (The\n                        Heron IIat 385, per Lord Reid), for, contrary\n                            to Lord Hoffmann, it is respectfully submitted that the rule of\n                            remoteness is an external rule of law. It is not, however, a\n                        completely inflexible rule. Without suggesting that the circumstances in\n                        which it might be appropriate to depart from the test of reasonable\n                        contemplation of the type of loss are closed ... ,one\n                            explanation for the likely result in the hypothetical [example]\n                            considered above is that the defendant was given no reasonable\n                            opportunity to limit his liability. [emphasis added] The above reasoning is consistent with many of the points we have canvassed\n                    above (including the presence of prior (and contrary) views from the House of\n                    Lords as well as the fact that the two limbs inHadleyconstitute external and independent rules of law). We\n                    would add that, in an extreme situation such as the present hypothetical, much\n                    would depend on the precise facts in question. This would also include, for\n                    example, how the alleged special circumstances were communicated by the customer\n                    to the taxi driver and what precisely was in fact communicated. All this would,\n                    of course, have to be assessed on an objective basis. One would imagine that, in\n                    an extreme situation such as this, there would have to be a clear and\n                    unequivocal communication. It would probably have taken the following\n                    form: I have to arrive at the airport on time for my flight and, if I miss my\n                        flight, I will lose a business deal worth $200,000. If so, I will truly hold\n                        you responsible for this loss. 119    Extreme hypothetical situations such as the one just mentioned are useful in\n                    law schools as they deliver the general legal propositions sought to be conveyed\n                    to the students concerned in no uncertain terms. However, what happens in the\n                    real world is quite different. Even allowing for the fact that truth is\n                    sometimes stranger than fiction, one can hardly imagine the taxi driver\n                    accepting responsibility on the terms set out in the preceding paragraph. Even\n                    if he or she did, this would have – in the nature of things – to be\n                    in the form ofan express assumption of responsibility which\n                        forms part of the contract between the parties in any event. In\n                    other words, in an extreme hypothetical situation, because the communication of\n                    the special circumstances would have to be so clear and unequivocal, it would\n                    follow that any assumption of responsibility would have to be equally clear and\n                    unequivocal and that it would thensimultaneouslyconstitute anexpress termof the contract itself.The resultant situation would be no different from the\n                        position that Lord Hoffmann is arguing in favour of. It is,\n                    of course,theoretically possiblefor there to be\n                    an assumption of responsibility without that assumption forming part of theexpressterms of the contract as such. In our\n                    view, however, this would be quite unrealistic as regard must (as just\n                    mentioned) be had to the entirecontextof the\n                    situation itself. Indeed, even from alegalstandpoint, it would be difficult to imagine that a court would find animpliedobligation that the taxi driver had\n                    undertaken to assume responsibility for thefullextent of the loss. Even if this were so, we would imagine that there wouldalsobe animplied\n                        termto the effect that, absent a deliberate act on the part of\n                    the taxi driver to ensure that the passenger did not arrive at the airport on\n                    time, the former would be excused from liability. Hence, for example, a delay\n                    that was due to a traffic jam would excuse the taxi driver from\n                    liability. 120    However, assume for the moment that the taxi driverdidundertake liability in anexpressmanner. As already explained above, this wouldnotdetract from (and is, on the contrary, entirely\n                    consistent with) the proposition (made above) to the effect that any assumption\n                    of responsibility on the part of the defendant would hinge on his or her\n                    knowledge of the special circumstances pursuant to thesecond\n                        limbinHadleyand that that\n                    assumption of responsibility would havealready been embodied\n                        or incorporated withinthat particular limb itself. In any event,\n                    this situation would (as we have already noted) be consistent with\n                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach as well. We also pointed out in the\n                    preceding paragraph that it might also be argued that there was animplied termthat the taxi driver would be excused for\n                    delays that were not the result of a deliberate act intended to ensure that the\n                    passenger in fact lost his business opportunity. If there was such a deliberate\n                    act, – and it would be bizarre in the extreme – the imposition of\n                    liability on the taxi driver might in fact be justified from both legal as well\n                    as extralegal points of view. However, as we have mentioned, such extreme\n                    hypothetical situations are likely to be rare and that, even if they do occur,\n                    the common law of contract itself contains the necessary doctrines to avoid an\n                    unjust and unfair result. Subsequent developments (1)   Subsequent English case law and the attempt at\n                integration 121    However, English case law followingThe\n                        Achilleashas sought tointegratethe two limbs inHadleywith the approach\n                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleasitself. It is obvious – perhaps for one or more of the reasons set out\n                    above – that the English courts were uncomfortable with endorsing,\n                    unconditionally, the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann, especially sinceHadleyhad stood as the established law for\n                    150 years (see, for example, the English High Court decisions ofASM Shipping Ltd of India v TTMI Ltd of England (The “Amer\n                        Energy”)[2009] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 293 at [19]\n                    andClassic Maritime Inc v Lion Diversified Holdings Berhad\n                        and Another[2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 59 at [71]). The\n                    approach from integration (hereafter “the integrated approach”) is\n                    a rather ingenious one. An early hint at such an approach may be found in the\n                    judgment of Toulson LJ (with whom Richards and Mummery LJJ agreed) in\n                    the English Court of Appeal decision ofSupershield Ltd v\n                        Siemens Building Technologies FE Ltd[2010] 1 Lloyd’s\n                    Rep 349, where the learned judge observed thus (at [43]): Hadley v Baxendaleremains a standard rule\n                        but it has been rationalised on the basis that it reflects the expectation\n                        to be imputed to the parties in the ordinary case, ie that a contract\n                        breaker should ordinarily be liable to the other party for damage resulting\n                        from his breach if, but only if, at the time of making the contract a\n                        reasonable person in his shoes would have had damage of that kind in mind as\n                        not unlikely to result from a breach. However,South\n                            AustraliaandTransfield\n                            Shippingare authority that there may be cases where the\n                        court, on examining the contract and the commercial background, decides that\n                        the standard approach would not reflect the expectation or intention\n                        reasonably to be imputed to the parties. In those two instances the effect\n                        was exclusionary; the contract breaker was held not to be liable for loss\n                        which resulted from its breach although some loss of the kind was not\n                        unlikely. But logically the same principle may have an inclusionary effect.\n                        If, on the proper analysis of the contract against its commercial\n                        background, the loss was within the scope of the duty, it cannot be regarded\n                        as too remote, even if it would not have occurred in ordinary\n                        circumstances. 122    However, the clearest statement of the integrated approach is perhaps best\n                    exemplified in the judgment of Hamblen J in the recent English High Court\n                    decision ofSylvia Shipping Co Ltd v Progress Bulk Carriers\n                        Ltd (The “Sylvia”)[2010] 2 Lloyd’s\n                    Rep 81 (“Sylvia Shipping”), who\n                    referred (at [40]) to the effect ofThe Achilleasas resulting “inan amalgamof the orthodox\n                    and the broader approach” [emphasis added]. The “orthodox\n                    approach”, in the learned judge’s view (at [27]), “reflects\n                    the generally accepted remoteness test based on [Hadley] and subsequent cases (what Lord Hoffmann described\n                    [inThe Achilleas] as “the ordinary\n                    foreseeabilty rule”)”. The “broader approach”, on\n                    the other hand is, in the view of Hamblen J, embodied in that proffered by\n                    Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas, and which is\n                    described (at [30]) as follows: Lord Hoffmann, whilst recognising that the orthodox approach will be\n                        applicable in the “great majority of cases”, nevertheless\n                        considered that it may not be sufficient in cases “in which the\n                        context, surrounding circumstances or general understanding in the relevant\n                        market shows that a party would not reasonably have been regarded as\n                        assuming responsibility for such losses” (para 9 [ofThe Achilleas]). 123    At this juncture, it is apposite to set out Hamblen J’s statement\n                    of the integrated approach in full (in order to capture both the relevant\n                    statement of principle as well as its context), as follows (at\n                    [40]–[51]): 40.    In my judgment, the decision inThe\n                                Achilleasresults in an amalgam of the orthodox and the\n                            broader approach. The orthodox approach remains the general test of\n                            remoteness applicable in the great majority of cases. However, there may\n                            be “unusual” cases, such asThe\n                                Achilleasitself, in which the context, surrounding\n                            circumstances or general understanding in the relevant market make it\n                            necessary specifically to consider whether there has been an assumption\n                            of responsibility. This is most likely to be in those relatively rare\n                            cases where the application of the general test leads or may lead to an\n                            unquantifiable, unpredictable, uncontrollable or disproportionate\n                            liability or where there is clear evidence that such a liability would\n                            be contrary to market understanding and expectations. 41.    In the great majority of cases it will not be necessary specifically\n                            to address the issue of assumption of responsibility. Usually the fact\n                            that the type of loss arises in the ordinary course of things or out of\n                            special known circumstances will carry with it the necessary assumption\n                            of responsibility. 42.    This is consistent with the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in which he\n                            makes it clear that the orthodox approach is the “prima facie” rule which will apply in the\n                            “great majority of cases” (para 9 [ofThe Achilleas]) and that “cases of\n                            departure from the ordinary foreseeability rule based on individual\n                            circumstances will be unusual” (para 11 [ofThe Achilleas]). 43.    It is also consistent with the judgment of Lord Hope in which he\n                            recognised that where the loss claimed reflects what happens in ordinary\n                            circumstances (ie is within the first limb of the so-called rule inHadley v Baxendale) then an assumption\n                            of responsibility can be presumed: “That is why the damages that\n                            are recoverable for breach of contract are limited to what happens in\n                            ordinary circumstances—in the great multitude of cases, as\n                            Alderson B put it inHadley v\n                                Baxendale—where an assumption of responsibility\n                            can be presumed” (para 36 [ofThe\n                                Achilleas]). 44.    It is also consistent with subsequent authorities which have\n                            considered the effect ofThe\n                            Achilleas. 45.    InASM Shipping Ltd of India v TTMI Ltd of England\n                                (The Amer Energy)[2009] 1 Lloyd's Rep 293, page\n                            295, paras 17 – 19 Flaux J summarised the effect ofThe Achilleasas follows: “17. ... First, I do not consider that the House of Lords (at\n                            least the majority of their Lordships) were intending to lay down some\n                            completely new test as to recoverability of damages in contract and\n                            remoteness different from the so-called rule inHadley v Baxendale(1854) 9 Exch 341 as refined in\n                            subsequent cases, above all the decision of the House of Lords itself inC Czarnikow Ltd v Koufos (The Heron\n                                II)[1967] 2 Lloyd's Rep 457; [1969]\n                            1 AC 350. See Lord Hope at paras 31 to 34,\n                            Lord Rodger at paras 47 to 52, Lord Walker at\n                            paras 66 to 78 and Baroness Hale at paras 89 to\n                            93… 18. … Lord Hoffmann acknowledges in paras 9 and 11 of\n                            his opinion that departure from the normal principles of foreseeability\n                            would be unusual. Although he refers to shipping as a market where\n                            limitations on the extent of liability arising out of general\n                            expectations in that market might be more common, I do not consider that\n                            he was intending to say that in all shipping cases (as opposed to the\n                            type of time charter case then under consideration) the rule inHadley v Baxendaleas subsequently\n                            refined, will no longer apply. If he was saying that, it was not a view\n                            shared by the majority and it would be heterodox to say the\n                            least.” 46.    InClassic Maritime v Lion Diversified Holdings\n                                Berhad[2010] 1 Lloyd's Rep 59 Cooke J stated\n                            (at page 71) that he would be “highly surprised” ifThe Achilleasestablished a new test\n                            for the recoverability of damages for breach of contract, and noted that\n                            Flaux J had been “wholly unpersuaded” that they had\n                            done so. 47.    Most importantly, inSupershield Ltd v Siemens\n                                Building Technologies FE Ltd[2010] 1 Lloyd's\n                            Rep349, the Court of Appeal summarised the position as follows: 43.Hadley v Baxendaleremains a\n                            standard rule but it has been rationalised on the basis that it reflects\n                            the expectation to be imputed to the parties in the ordinary case, ie\n                            that a contract breaker should ordinarily be liable to the other party\n                            for damage resulting from his breach if, but only if, at the time of\n                            making the contract a reasonable person in his shoes would have had\n                            damage of that kind in mind as not unlikely to result from a breach.\n                            However,South AustraliaandTransfield Shippingare authority that there may\n                            be cases where the court, on examining the contract and the commercial\n                            background, decides that the standard approach would not reflect the\n                            expectation or intention reasonably to be imputed to the parties. 48.    The orthodox approach therefore remains the “standard\n                            rule” and it is only in relatively unusual cases, such asThe Achilleasitself, where a\n                            consideration of assumption of responsibility may be required. 49.    In my judgment, it is important that it be made clear that there is no\n                            new generally applicable legal test of remoteness in damages. It appears\n                            that in a number of cases this is being argued and that decisions are\n                            being challenged for failing to recognize or apply the assumption of\n                            responsibility test. This results in confusion and uncertainty. 50.    In the vast majority of cases tribunals of fact can and should be able\n                            to apply the well established remoteness test with which they are\n                            familiar and which, in the vast majority of cases, works perfectly\n                            well. 51.    In this connection I note the conclusions ofChittyat para 26-100G: Contractual liability is of course based on express or implied\n                            agreement, and it is argued that the reason a party who has broken the\n                            contract should be held liable for losses that were not unusual, or\n                            which he had brought home to him might occur, is that (unless it is\n                            agreed otherwise) he can be taken to have agreed to compensate them. But\n                            it does not follow that liability for likely losses should be limited by\n                            a vague criterion such as “assumption of responsibility”.\n                            Rather it is submitted that it is better to have a simple rule that the\n                            party in breach is be liable for all losses that are sufficiently likely\n                            to occur in the usual case, or whose likelihood has been brought home to\n                            him when the contract was made, unless he has validly excluded or\n                            restricted his liability. It has been cogently argued that there are\n                            limits to the extent that it is feasible to determine all issues by\n                            reference to an assumption of responsibility. In relation to the extent\n                            of liability for losses suffered by the innocent party as the result of\n                            a breach, there will seldom be any “factual foundation for making\n                            a determination as to whether the defendant implicitly assumed\n                            responsibility for the risk in question”. It is thus to be hoped\n                            that the approach adopted by the majority inThe\n                                Achilleaswill be applied by the courts only in\n                            exceptional circumstances, such as those emphasised by\n                            Lord Hoffmann in that case. 124    As already mentioned, the integrated approach is an ingenious one in so far as\n                    it attempts to reconcile the approach inHadleyon\n                    the one hand and the new approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas(centring on the assumption of\n                    responsibility by the defendant) on the other. With the greatest respect,\n                    however, the result, whilst attractive at first blush, is – insubstanceat least – less than\n                    satisfactory. 125    Put simply, the integrated approach is, at bottom, an acceptance and\n                    endorsement of the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas. If so, this approach ought not to be\n                    followed for the various reasons already set out in detail above. 126    We pause to observe that one other possible method of\n                    “integration” (not hitherto considered) is, first, to\n                    “preserve” thefirst limbinHadleyin itsoriginal\n                        formbyexcludingthe assumption of\n                    responsibility test advocated by Lord Hoffmann (in so far as it ispresumedthat where the loss falls within the\n                    first limb inHadley, there would be an assumption\n                    of responsibility, and, accordingly, there would be no need to apply the\n                    assumption of responsibility test) and by applying it toonlythesecond limbinHadley. In other words,actualknowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition to\n                    satisfy what was hitherto thesecond limbinHadley;in\n                        addition, it must now be demonstrated that the defendant\n                    concerned hadassumed responsibilityfor the\n                    (extraordinary) loss which has occurred.However,\n                    for the detailed reasons set out earlier in this judgment (above at[101]and[104]–[107]), we are\n                    of the view that thesecond limbinHadley already incorporates or embodiesthe concept of\n                    assumption of responsibility,albeit in a more objective and\n                        limited fashionthan that advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe Achilleas. 127    We would observe further that the approach just mentioned is, in fact,consistentwith the approach which we have\n                    adopted (which is to endorse the principles laid down inHadley)to the extent thatit\n                    views (as we have seen) thefirst limbinHadleyas incorporating or embodying the\n                    concept of assumption of responsibility.However,\n                    it does not, with respect, take the logic inherent in its application to the\n                    first limb inHadleyto its logical conclusion. If\n                    it had, then it is (as explained above at[107]) clear that thesecond limbinHadleyoughtalsoto be treated as having incorporated or embodied the concept of assumption of\n                    responsibility as well and that there is therefore no need to introduce an\n                    additional criterion or test of assumption of responsibility which would not\n                    only be otiose but would also merely serve (as we have also sought to explain\n                    above) to introduce (in effect) unnecessary subjectivity as well as uncertainty\n                    into a situation which,ex hypothesi, does not\n                    relate to the actual intentions of the parties as such (except by way of an\n                    imputation by the court itself by way of auniversalprinciple, which is contained within thesecond limbinHadleyitself). 128    Further, the view that there ought not to be a sharp distinction drawn between\n                    the two limbs inHadley(which is by no means a\n                    recent development (see, for example, the House of Lords decision ofR and H Hall, Limited v W H Pim (Junior) and\n                        Company, Limited(1928) 33 Com Cas 324 at 334,perLord Shaw of Dunfermline (observing\n                    that the two limbs “need not be antithetically treated: they may run into\n                    each other and, indeed, be one”); reference may also be made toRobertson Quay(and the decisions cited therein at [59])\n                    as well as the English Court of Appeal decision ofKpohraror\n                        v Woolwich Building Society[1996] 4 All ER 119 at 127-128\n                    and the English High Court decision ofSatef-Huttenes\n                        Albertus SpA v Paloma Tercera Shipping Co SA (The\n                        “Pegase”)[1981] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 175\n                    at 182) actually serves – if we accept the argument made above to the\n                    effect that thefirst limbinHadley necessarily imputesan assumption of responsibility or an\n                    implied obligation on the part of the defendant – to buttress the related\n                    argument to the effect thatthe second limb in Hadley ought\n                        not to be interpreted in a manner different from the first limb of the\n                        same. (2)   Some Australian authorities 129    It is, admittedly, relatively soon forThe\n                        Achilleasto have been considered by courts across the\n                    Commonwealth. However, there have, to the best of our knowledge, been (in\n                    addition to the English decisions discussed in the preceding section of this\n                    judgment) a few Australian decisions which have referred toThe Achilleas(albeit without shedding much light on the issues\n                    canvassed above). 130    In the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision ofRussell\n                        v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney\n                        and Another(2008) 72 NSWLR 559 (“Russell”), Basten JA (with whose reasons\n                    both Giles and Campbell JAA agreed) referred toboththe traditional approach inHadley as\n                        well asLord Hoffmann’s reference to the concept of\n                    assumption of responsibility inThe Achilleas.\n                    However, there was no detailed analysis of the relationship between both\n                    approaches. 131    The same court, inDome Resources NL and Another v Silver\n                        and Another(2008) 72 NSWLR 693, referred (at 711) only\n                    in passing toThe Achilleas –and in the\n                    context of the doctrine of consideration only. 132    In the (also) New South Wales Court of Appeal decision ofEvans & Associates v European Bank Ltd(2009)\n                    255 ALR 171 (“Evans & Associates”), Campbell JA\n                    referred (at [58], and as was the case inRussell(see above at[130])) toboththe traditional approach inHadley as\n                        well asthe concept of assumption of responsibility which\n                    (significantly, perhaps) the learned judge states as having “recently\n                    beenreiteratedin”The Achilleas. This observation is, with respect,\n                    ambiguous and, if at all, appears to support the proposition endorsed above to\n                    the effect that the traditional approach inHadley already\n                        embodies as well as incorporates the concept of assumption of responsibility\n                        in any event. Further, as inRussell, there was no detailed analysis of the various issues\n                    raised as a result ofThe Achilleas(in\n                    particular, the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in that\n                    decision). 133    It should also be noted that Gyles AJA did also observe inEvans & Associates(at [125]) that “[t]he\n                    complications of changing circumstances in relation to contractual damages are\n                    apparent from the recent decision of the House of Lords in [The Achilleas]”. Again, however, this is, at best, a\n                    neutral observation only. (3)   A short coda 134    A short coda is in order. In a very recent paper (which originated in a\n                    lecture given to the Edinburgh Centre for Commercial Law on 12 May 2009),\n                    Lord Hoffmann in fact revisited as well as explained further the decision\n                    inThe Achilleas(see Lord Hoffmann,\n                    “TheAchilleas: Custom and Practice or\n                    Foreseeability?” (2010) 14 Edin LR 47 (“Hoffmann”)). The decision inThe\n                        Achilleasin general and Lord Hoffmann’s views in\n                    particular ought, strictly speaking, to be interpreted on their own terms.\n                    Nevertheless, this paper sheds some interesting light on the decision itself.\n                    However, it does not, with the greatest of respect, meet the difficulties raised\n                    above, particularly in respect of Lord Hoffmann’s own approach\n                    centring on the concept of assumption of responsibility by the defendant. 135    We do not propose to deal with the paper in any detail and, in any event, this\n                    would not be the correct venue to do so. Hence, a very brief summary of the main\n                    points and even briefer observations (which relate to points already raised\n                    earlier in this judgment) will have to suffice for present purposes. 136    Lord Hoffmann’s principal objection to reliance on the principles\n                    laid down inHadley(which he terms (inHoffmannat p 50) “the orthodox\n                    approach”) have to do with what he observes “is the high degree of\n                    indeterminacy which a pure foreseeability test creates” (idat p 51; see also at p 52). The learned\n                    author is also concerned about a related point (or consequence) that “the\n                    cases show that [the concepts of kind of loss and degree of probability under\n                    “the orthodox approach”] are open to very considerable\n                    manipulation to achieve what the court considers to be a fair result”\n                        (idat p 52). Indeed, he refers to such\n                    “manipulation” as an “intellectual sleight of hand”\n                        (idat p 54). Lord Hoffmann is also\n                    of the view (idat p 52) that the fact\n                    situation inThe Achilleasdid not allow the\n                    reliance onVictoria Laundryin order to achieve\n                    the same result, albeit by reference to “the orthodox approach” (a\n                    point with which some commentators agree). He also refers (idat pp 53 and 56) to the hypothetical of the taxi driver\n                    referred to above (at[118]). 137    In Lord Hoffmann’s view, the concept of assumption of\n                    responsibility (which he advocated inThe\n                        Achilleas) is more effective; in the learned author’s words\n                        (idat p 55): The question is: what obligation to make compensation for breach of\n                        contract woulda reasonable observerunderstand the contracting party to haveundertaken? [emphasis added] 138    We have already considered the treatment ofVictoria\n                        Laundry(above at[115]) as\n                    well as the hypothetical of the taxi driver (above at[118]–[120]). More\n                    importantly, perhaps, the critiques from indeterminacy as well as manipulation\n                    levelled by the learned author against the traditional principles embodied inHadleyare, with the greatest of respect,\n                    misconceived. As already noted above (at[110]), there will always be a measure of uncertainty when any\n                    rule or principle of law (even an extremely established one) is applied to the\n                    facts, simply because the possible fact situations are innumerable. However,\n                    this is not, as we understand it, the kind of indeterminacy referred to by\n                    Lord Hoffmann since such an understanding would apply equally to the\n                    application ofeveryrule or principle of law(including the application of rules and principles based\n                        on the concept of assumption of responsibility). If so, then it\n                    is respectfully suggested that the traditional rules and principles of\n                    remoteness of damage which find their origins in the two limbs inHadleyareno moreindeterminate than those based on the concept of assumption of responsibility.\n                    Indeed, as we have sought to demonstrate above, the former are, in fact, more\n                    stable and objective – in part because they areexternal ruleshavinguniversalapplication. Indeed, as we have also sought to demonstrate, it isthe concept of assumption of responsibilitythat\n                    engenders uncertainty. And, in so far as the critique of manipulation is\n                    concerned, we would prefer – as we have pointed out above (at[113]) – thequite\n                        different term, “flexibility”. We hasten to add\n                    that the “flexibility” we are referring to is no euphemism; it is\n                    a desirable quality in its own right which does not rely on any manipulation or\n                    intellectual sleight of hand by the court to arrive at a pre-determined result.\n                    As we have explained, the flexibility lies in how the facts are characterised\n                    and how the law is applied to those facts. It is, in fact, a truism to state\n                    that the law does not operate in an abstract vacuum, but to individual fact\n                    situations (see also above at[113]). If,\n                    as a result, the court arrives at a substantively fair result, that is, in fact,\n                    the ultimate aim and purpose of the enterprise of the law itself (see also\n                    generally the Singapore High Court decision ofUnited\n                        Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd[2005]\n                    2 SLR(R) 425 at [4]-[9]). However, the desire to arrive at a\n                    substantively fair result does not mean that the rules and principles of the law\n                    can be manipulated. As observed in a recent lecture delivered at the University\n                    of Hong Kong (see Andrew Phang, “Doctrine and Fairness in the Law of\n                    Contract” inThe Common Law Lecture Series\n                        2008–2009(The University of Hong Kong, 2010) (Jessica\n                    Young and Rebecca Lee gen eds), pp 17–100 at\n                    pp 18-24): Put simply, the central thesis of the present lecture is this: The rules\n                        and principles which constitute thedoctrineof the law are not ends in themselves but are, rather, the means through\n                        which the courts arrive atsubstantively fairoutcomes in the cases before them ineveryarea of the law. [It should be added] that neither is more important than the other. In\n                        other words, the desire to arrive at a fair outcome does not mean that the\n                        courts can manipulate legal doctrine in an arbitrary fashion. Indeed, part\n                        of [the] task in the present lecture is to demonstrate – through\n                        illustrations from the law of contract - that legal\n                        doctrine is a coherent body of rules and principles which contain many\n                        common threads or linkages. Hence, any attempt to manipulate them in order\n                        to arrive at a predetermined result would be both artificial as well as\n                        unacceptable, and would instead lead to a loss of legitimacy in the law in\n                        the eyes of both the legal profession as well as the public alike. [It\n                        should also be mentioned], at this juncture, that academic literature is\n                        also important in the analysis as well as formulation of legal doctrine,\n                        especially with regard to the consideration of nascent and/or controversial\n                        areas of the law. However, [one pauses] to mention (parenthetically) that,\n                        whilst there is the need for the consideration as well as citation of\n                        academic writings, there is also the need for such writings to berelevantinasmuch as,inter\n                            alia, esoteric and/or highly abstract discourse ought to be\n                        avoided. In other words, whilst academic writings must always maintain their\n                        intellectual rigour, it must never be forgotten that theirhighestcalling (and achievement) consists, in the\n                        final analysis, in their contribution to the legalprofessionas a whole. On the other hand, legal doctrine is not an end itself. Its primary\n                        function is to guide the court, in a reasoned fashion, to arrive ata fair resultin the case before it. Here,\n                        too, academic literature has a potentially significant (perhaps even\n                        pivotal) role to play. This is because, in some quarters, there has\n                            - particularly with the advent of postmodern legal\n                        thought - been an increased (and, unfortunately,\n                        increasingly) skeptical view taken of the law in general and legal\n                        objectivity in particular. Such an approach is, on any view, both corrosive\n                        as well as destructive. Whilst one cannot deny that theapplicationof objective rules and principles is adynamic processwhich may therefore give rise (on\n                        occasion at least) to some unpredictability as well as uncertainty\n                        (particularly in an imperfect world), it is certainly thevery antithesisof the law to argue that the law is wholly\n                        subjective and that (putting it crudely) “anything goes”.\n                        Indeed, as [was] observed in the Singapore High Court decision ofForefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Private\n                            Ltd: [I]t is important to stress that notwithstanding many academic\n                            critiques to the effect that commercial certainty and predictability are\n                            chimerical, it cannot be gainsaid that theperceptionof their importance is deeply entrenched\n                            within the commercial legal landscape in general and in the individual\n                            psyches of commercial parties (and even non-commercial parties, for that\n                            matter) in particular. It may be worth observing that most of these\n                            critiques stem from a radical view of the law. To put it bluntly, many\n                            of such views stem from the premise that objectivity of the law is not\n                            merely elusive but positively illusory. In particular, such a sceptical\n                            approach is based on the idea that everything is subjective. This is, of\n                            course, the very antithesis of the very enterprise of the law itself.\n                            Such an approach also conveniently misses its own absolute cast.\n                            Unfortunately, though, it is an absolute view that dispirits and\n                            disempowers. It is profoundly negative and ought to be avoided at all\n                            costs. Indeed, the view that the law is subjective (and, consequently, arbitrary)\n                        would cause an irreparable loss in thelegitimacyof the law in the eyes ofthe\n                            public. And, as just mentioned, it would also dispirit as\n                        well as disempower lawyers, judges and students alike. And, from just a\n                        logical perspective (as also pointed out in the judgment just mentioned),\n                        the very view that all law is subjective isitselfan “absolute” proposition that thus\n                        involves circularity and (more importantly) self-contradiction. ... [S]implistic reductionism must, [it should be added], be assiduously\n                        avoided by all concerned (including the courts) – if nothing else,\n                        because life is too complex. [The preferred approach is] viewing doctrine\n                        and fairness as aninteractiveprocess,\n                        although the attainment of a fair result in each case is the ultimate aim of\n                        the court. [emphasis in original] 139    Indeed, as we have sought to demonstrate above, it is (on thecontrary) the concept ofassumption\n                        of responsibilitywhich engenders excessive uncertainty (see\n                    generally above at[94]-[100]) – not least because it is premised\n                    on a very broad and vague concept of interpretation, when what is in fact\n                    required are clear and specific rules and principles of law (which criterion is\n                    fulfilled, in our view, by the traditional rules and principles of law relating\n                    to remoteness of damage in contract law). Conclusion 140    Consistent with the analysis set out above, we take this opportunity to\n                    confirm the approach relating to remoteness of damage in the law of contract as\n                    set out in the decision of this court inRobertson\n                        Quay(which affirmed the principles laid down inHadley). We also take this opportunity to state that the\n                    approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann inThe\n                        Achilleasis not the law in Singapore, except to the extent that\n                    the learned law lord’s reliance on the concept of assumption of\n                    responsibility by the defendant is already incorporated or embodied in both\n                    limbs inHadleyitself. 141    Let us turn now to apply the relevant legal principles to the facts of the\n                    present proceedings – specifically, the damages to be awarded in thepost-breach context.",
        "Conclusion": "147    For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal in part inasmuch as the\n                    total amount of damages to be awarded to the Respondent is$193,967.38(comprising $95,649.98 for damages to be awarded\n                    during the Breach Period (see above at[70])and$98,317.40 for damages to be awarded\n                    during the Post-Breach Period (see above at[146])). 148    In so far as the costs of the present appeals are concerned, each party is to\n                    bear its own costs. As for the costs of the proceedings below, both the costs\n                    orders before the AR as well as the Judge are to remain. The usual consequential\n                    orders will apply.  [note: 1]Appellants’ Core Bundle (“ACB”) (Vol II)\n                                at pp 47–48.
