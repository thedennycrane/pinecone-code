        "The background": "3.\n\n        The events giving rise to the actions took\n\nplace in November and December 1997. At the time, the three vessels were managed by a\n\nGreek company called Dynacom Tankers Management Ltd. They were also on time charter to\n\nMetro Trading International Inc (‘Metro’). Metro was then a significant supplier\n\nof bunkers in the Persian Gulf as well as of fuel oil to the Far East. In addition, Metro\n\nowned and operated a floating fuel oil storage and blending facility using vessels\n\nanchored in the waters off Fujairah. The primary storage and blending vehicle was an oil\n\ntanker calledMetrotank.4.\n\n        Between April 1992 and February 1998, the\n\nrespondents and Metro did business together on many occasions. From the end of 1994\n\nonwards, the respondents regularly delivered substantial quantities of oil into\n\nMetro’s floating storage facility at Fujairah. These cargoes were intended for\n\nsubsequent resale, often in the form of blended products. The arrangement between Metro\n\nand the respondents from June 1996 onwards was that the respondents would purchase oil to\n\nbe stored at Fujairah on the basis that such oil would subsequently be sold to Metro who\n\nwould then sell it on to consumers in India and the Far East. Both Metro and the\n\nrespondents purchased the oil required for this business operation. Additionally, the\n\nrespondents financed Metro’s purchases. Whenever Metro entered into a contract with a\n\nsupplier, the respondents would enter into a contract with Metro to purchase the oil on\n\nback-to-back terms and the respondents would then provide the letter of credit necessary\n\nto enable the supplier to receive payment. It became the practice for the respondents to\n\nopen a letter of credit in the name of Metro in favour of the supplier and for Metro to\n\ngive irrevocable instructions to its bankers to hold the documents of title relating to\n\nthe cargo to the order of the respondents.5.\n\n        Three of the four parcels of oil involved in\n\nthe present case were purchased by Metro from Kuwait Petroleum Corporation\n\n(‘KPC’) on FOB Kuwait terms. These parcels were on-sold by Metro to the\n\nrespondents. The respondents then voyage chartered the vesselsCherry,EpicandAddaxfrom Metro to carry the oil to Fujairah and deliver the same to the\n\nfloating storage facility. In respect of these parcels, the respondents’ claims\n\nrelated to the fact that on the arrival ofCherryandAddaxat Fujairah,\n\nonly part of their cargoes were discharged into the storage facility. The rest was\n\nretained on board. In respect ofAddaxnone of the cargo was discharged. The claims\n\nwere made in respect of the cargo so retained.6.\n\n        The fourth parcel was bought by Metro from the\n\nNational Iranian Oil Company and shipped on board the vesselHyperionat Bandar\n\nMahshahr, Iran, to be carried to Fujairah. Metro on-sold it to the respondents. When theHyperionarrived at Fujairah, instead of discharging its cargo into the storage tanks there, it\n\ndischarged the cargo into theCherry.TheCherrythen carried the cargo on\n\nto Singapore and delivered it to a third party.7.\n\n        In respect of the cargoes loaded on to the\n\nvessels at Kuwait, the respondents’ original claims were for damages for breach of\n\nthe bills of lading contracts and/or duty and/or breach of duty as bailees. The claims\n\nwere founded in contract and, alternatively, in tort. In respect of theHyperioncargo loaded onto theCherry, the respondents’ claim was for damages for\n\nbreach of duty as bailees and/or conversion and/or wrongful detention and/or wrongful\n\ninterference with the cargo by misappropriating it or removing it from Fujairah. The\n\ndifference stemmed from the fact that the respondents had no contractual relationship with\n\nthe owners of theCherryin relation to their receipt of theHyperioncargo\n\nso that this claim was founded only in tort. We will consider the appeals on the\n\ncontractual claims and the tortious claim separately.",
        "The bills of lading claims: the\n\nfacts": "8.\n\n        As the facts and issues in the three appeals\n\nrelating to the carriage of the cargoes to Fujairah by the appellants are, for practical\n\npurposes, similar, we will adopt the approach of the judge and use theCherryaction to consider the common matters.9.\n\n        On 24 November 1997, the respondents chartered\n\ntheCherryfrom Metro as disponent owners to carry a parcel of oil from Kuwait to\n\nFujairah. Pursuant to the charterparty, on 3 December 1997, theCherryloaded a\n\ncargo of 87,972 metric tons of bunker grade fuel oil 380 cst at the port of Mina Abdulla,\n\nKuwait.10.\n\n        The bill of lading issued for the shipment on 3\n\nDecember 1997 named KPC as the shipper, was signed on behalf of the master, and was made\n\nout to the order of Banque Trad Credit Lyonnais (France) SA (‘BTC’). In\n\naccordance with the arrangements described in  4, BTC had, at the instance of the\n\nrespondents, issued a letter of credit in favour of KPC and Metro had given instructions\n\nthat all correspondence relating to the credit were to be addressed to the respondents and\n\nthe bill was to be at their disposal.11.\n\n        BTC duly made payment under the letter of\n\ncredit upon presentation of the bill and, on 2 February 1998, the respondents instructed\n\nBTC through their agents, Glencore UK Ltd (‘Glencore UK’), to endorse the bill\n\nto the order of Credit Lyonnais and forward it to Credit Lyonnais with further\n\ninstructions for the latter to endorse the bill in blank and forward it to Glencore UK.\n\nThese instructions were complied with and Glencore UK duly received the bill.12.\n\n        In the court below, the appellants contended\n\nthat the respondents could not sue as holders of the bill of lading because they were not\n\nin physical possession of the bill which was with Glencore UK. The judge found that\n\nGlencore UK was holding the bill simply as the agent of the respondents for the\n\ntransmission of documents and therefore the respondents were the holders of the bill for\n\nthe purposes of the Bills of Lading Act (Cap 384). On appeal, the appellants did not\n\ncontest this finding. Thus, before us the ability of the respondents to sue the appellants\n\nin contract as parties to the respective bills of lading is not challenged.13.\n\n        Before loading took place, Metro as time\n\ncharterers had ordered the vessel to proceed to Kuwait to load the cargo of fuel oil and\n\n‘on completion of loading vessel to proceed for orders to STS Area offshore Fujairah\n\n… if Fujairah will be declared as final dischport [ie discharge port], cargo will be\n\ndischarged according to the instructions of ‘Metro Storage Coordinator …’.\n\nAfter the vessel loaded the cargo, the respondents as voyage charterers gave instructions\n\nto Metro regarding the discharge of the cargo.14.\n\n        The instructions which Metro received from the\n\nrespondents were not conveyed to the ship. Instead, on the same day, Metro asked the\n\nappellants to tell the master of theCherryto discharge the cargo at Fujairah\n\nwithout production of the bill of lading and in accordance with Metro’s instructions\n\nthere. In making this request, Metro invoked the clause in the time charter (‘the LO1\n\nclause’) which provided that they could make a request for delivery of the cargo\n\ndespite non-production of the bill of lading against provision of a letter of indemnity\n\nfor such delivery. This letter of indemnity was duly provided thereafter.15.\n\n        TheCherryarrived at Fujairah on 8\n\nDecember and discharged only 32,000 metric tons of the oil. 55,972 metric tons remained on\n\nboard and were carried to Singapore without the respondents’ knowledge or consent.\n\nThe appellants claimed that they acted under the instructions of Metro’s officers at\n\nFujairah when they discharged part of the oil and retained the rest on board.16.\n\n        The respondents sued the appellants for having\n\nbreached their obligations under the bill of lading to deliver the entireCherrycargo at Fujairah. Metro, having collapsed in February 1998, was left out of these\n\nproceedings.",
        "The decision below": "17.\n\n        The substantive issues raised by the appellants\n\nbelow in respect of theCherry, EpicandAddaxcargoes were:(1) the appellants were not in\n\n    breach of contract because they had delivered the cargo to Metro, the respondents’\n\n    agents, at Fujairah.(2) the appellants had acted on\n\n    the instructions of the respondents’ agents, Metro, at Fujairah.(3) the respondents had clothed\n\n    Metro with all the appearance of being the owner of the cargo and were bound by\n\n    Metro’s acts; and(4) in any event, the respondents\n\n    had failed to prove that the appellants’ acts had caused their loss.The last issue, that of\n\ncausation, is also relevant in relation to theHyperionclaim and will be dealt\n\nwith after we have considered the arguments on substantive liability in respect of both\n\nthe contractual and conversion claims.18.\n\n        The judge considered the first two issues\n\ntogether. He agreed with the appellants’ submission that, as a matter of law,\n\ndelivery of a cargo does not necessarily include its discharge from the carrying vessel.\n\nIn this case, however, on the face of the respondents’ instructions, discharge of all\n\nthe oil into the storage facility was required. Anything short of that would not\n\nconstitute delivery according to their instructions.19.\n\n        The judge then held that when the respondents\n\nissued the instructions that discharge should take place in accordance with instructions\n\nfrom the Metro local representatives, they did not constitute the Metro representatives\n\ntheir agents for issuing or changing discharge instructions. Instead, they were directing\n\ntheCherryto work with those representatives to carry out their discharge\n\ninstructions. The instructions received by the master of theCherryfrom Metro to\n\ncomply with the ‘local instructions’ of the Metro storage coordinator referred\n\nto instructions in connection with the storage of the oil at the facility because the\n\ncoordinator controlled the facility. Thus, when the Metro representatives instructed the\n\nappellants to discharge only part of the cargo, they should have sought confirmation as to\n\nwhether the obligation to discharge had been varied, instead of effecting a partial\n\ndischarge and thereafter becoming parties to false reports and documents put up to\n\nrepresent that full discharge had actually taken place when it had not.20.\n\n        The appellants also contended that the\n\ninstructions given by Metro to them were given by Metro as an agent acting on behalf of\n\nand within the scope of the authority conferred by their principal, the respondents, who\n\nhad delegated to Metro the task of dealing with the appellants in taking delivery of their\n\ncargo. The fact that this task was performed by Metro contrary to the instructions of\n\ntheir principal or even in fraud of their principal would not take their acts outside the\n\nscope of their employment and, on the basis of the principles established byLloyd v\n\nGrace, Smith & Co[1912] AC 716, the respondents would be liable for Metro’s\n\nacts. The judge held those principles did not avail the appellants because:(1) the Metro representatives at\n\n    Fujairah were characterised in the voyage instructions as storage coordinators whose scope\n\n    of authority covered only coordinating storage of the oil; thus in purporting to decide\n\n    the amount of oil to be discharged, they acted outside the scope of their authority; and(2) the appellants did not regard\n\n    Metro as anyone’s agent as their case was that they believed Metro to be the owner of\n\n    the cargo.21.\n\n        On the third issue, the judge rejected the\n\ncontention that the respondents had clothed Metro with the appearance of ownership of the\n\ncargo as even though they did not directly notify the appellants of their interest in the\n\ncargo, they had directed in the discharge instructions that they be identified as\n\nreceivers of the cargo. Further, he found as a fact that the appellants knew of the\n\nrespondents’ sub-charter.",
        "The appeals on the bills of\n\nlading claims": "22.\n\n        The issues arising in these appeals are\n\nbasically the same issues that were canvassed below. In respect of the bills of lading\n\nclaims, apart from causation, the appellants have framed the main issues as follows:(1) were the cargoes lately laden\n\n    on board the three vessels delivered to the respondents under the bills of lading\n\n    notwithstanding that they were not fully discharged into Metro’s storage tanks; and(2) were the respondents bound by\n\n    the acts of Metro in instructing the appellants to retain the cargo on board the three\n\n    vessels?It should be noted here that in\n\nboth issues the underlying question is whether and to what extent Metro was acting as the\n\nagent of the respondents in relation to the cargo.",
        "What constitutes delivery?": "23.\n\n        The position taken by the respondents below,\n\nand accepted by the judge, was that on arrival of the vessels at Fujairah all the cargo\n\nshould have been discharged into the storage facility and that it was a breach of the\n\ndelivery obligation under the bills of lading contracts for some of the cargo to have been\n\nretained on board the vessels. In this appeal, the appellants contended that there was no\n\nbreach of the contracts of carriage in that the various parcels of cargo were delivered to\n\nthe respondents at Fujairah and that this delivery was effected by placing the cargo at\n\nthe immediate disposal, and under the control, of Metro, the respondents’\n\nrepresentative at Fujairah.24.\n\n        The appellants’ argument ran as follows.\n\nThe judge expressly held as a matter of law that there can be delivery without full\n\ndischarge. This holding meant that delivery can be effected even when cargo is retained on\n\nboard. Accordingly, the fact that all the cargo was not fully delivered into Metro’s\n\nstorage tanks did not per se amount to a breach. The circumstances in which some of the\n\ncargo was retained on board the vessels had to be examined to determine whether such\n\nconduct constituted delivery. In this case, they submitted such examination would show\n\nthat the respondents had no claim for non-delivery. Before us, the respondents have not\n\nchallenged the proposition that delivery does not necessarily include discharge. They say\n\nthat that is not the issue and the issue is whether the appellants were entitled on the\n\nfacts of the case to effect delivery without discharge as the carrier’s normal\n\nobligations are to discharge and deliver.25.\n\n        In their consideration of the facts, the\n\nappellants placed great emphasis on what they saw as the respondents’ intention as to\n\nhow the cargo was supposed to be dealt with. They argued that the respondents intended\n\nthat the cargoes be delivered to Metro without reference to the bills of lading and that\n\nthe bills were not to serve the usual function of being the ‘key to the\n\nwarehouse’. In this respect, the appellants relied on the following:(1) it was the respondents’\n\n    own case that they expected and intended the appellants to deliver the cargo into\n\n    Metro’s storage tanks without production of the bills because they knew that the\n\n    vessels would arrive at Fujairah before the bills came into their possession;(2) the respondents had conceded\n\n    that if all the cargoes had been so delivered, then despite the non-production of the\n\n    bills, there would have been no claim against the appellants and, in fact, for those\n\n    portions of the cargoes that were so discharged the respondents have not asserted any\n\n    claim against the appellants even though no payment in respect of the same was ever\n\n    received from Metro; and(3) the respondents never\n\n    presented the bills to the appellants in order to take delivery of the cargoes at\n\n    Fujairah.26.\n\n        With due respect to the appellants, we think\n\ntheir emphasis on the fact that the respondents did not contemplate that in this case\n\ndelivery would be effected against production of the original bill of lading is a red\n\nherring. In the usual case of a claim for non-delivery, the complaint is that the cargo\n\nwas discharged at the designated discharge port but handed over to someone who did not\n\nhave the original bill of lading. In this case, the complaint is that cargo was not\n\ndischarged and that this failure to discharge was a breach of the delivery obligation\n\nunder the contract of carriage. It is not an answer to this complaint to say that the\n\nrespondents could not have complained about a discharge of the cargo into the Fujairah\n\nstorage tanks without production of the bill of lading since this is what they as voyage\n\ncharterers instructed Metro as operators of the vessel to do.27.\n\n        The rule that a carrier who delivers cargo\n\nwithout surrender of the original bill of lading does so at his peril has been too long\n\nestablished to need the citation of authority in support. The corollary of this\n\nproposition is that neither the owner of the cargo nor anyone else can insist on delivery\n\nof the cargo being made to him if he is unable to produce the bill of lading. InThe\n\nHouda[1994] 2 LLR 541, it was argued that a provision in a time charter party\n\nproviding that the charterers would indemnify the owners against the consequence of\n\ndelivery of the cargo without presentation of the bill of lading gave the time charterer\n\nthe right to order the shipowner to make such delivery. This argument was accepted at\n\nfirst instance but rejected by all three judges of the Court of Appeal. They held that\n\nthere was no good reason, in the case of a time charterer, to depart from the general rule\n\nthat the owners did not fulfil their contractual obligations if the cargo was delivered to\n\na person who could not produce the bill of lading. Further, whilst it was open to a\n\nshipowner to decide that he was adequately protected by a letter of indemnity and to\n\ndeliver in the absence of the bill, the rights of a time charterer to give orders in\n\nrelation to the cargo did not entitle him to insist that cargo should be discharged\n\nwithout production of the bill. What applies to the time charterer who has a contract\n\nproviding for him to indemnify the shipowner in such circumstances, applies even more\n\nforcefully to the owner of the cargo who has no such contractual arrangements.\n\nAccordingly, the respondents were never in a position to insist on the delivery of the\n\ncargo without the bill of lading whether such demand was made to Metro or to the\n\nappellants directly and the appellants could have refused to deliver the cargo at Fujairah\n\nor to deal with it there in any way until the bills were produced. The appellants did not\n\ntake this course. Instead, they invoked the indemnity provisions and acted on the\n\ninstructions of Metro in relation to the disposal of the cargo in the full knowledge that\n\nMetro could not produce the bills at that stage. The appellants thus knowingly committed\n\nacts that were in breach of contract and to escape liability for doing so they would have\n\nto establish that the respondents had given the instructions on which they acted or could\n\nbe deemed to have done so and therefore that the respondents could not complain about the\n\nbreach. They would have been able to establish this in answer to a contention by the\n\nrespondents that discharge into the storage tanks at Fujairah without production of the\n\nbill of lading was a breach since the evidence was clear that that was what the\n\nrespondents as voyage charterers had instructed Metro to do. Whether they have been able\n\nto establish this as an answer to the complaint of non-discharge is, as the respondents\n\ncontend, a matter of fact to be decided on the evidence.28.\n\n        First, we have to consider whether, prima facie\n\non the facts of this case, the appellants were required, as part of their delivery\n\nobligation, to discharge the cargo from the vessels. Looking at the documentary evidence,\n\nthe bill of lading for theCherrycargo stated:‘Shipped in apparent good\n\n    order and condition by Kuwait Petroleum Corporation in the tank ship called … at the\n\n    port of Mina Abdulla, Kuwait, a quantity of petroleum products said to be …, in bulk\n\n    and to be delivered … in the like good order and condition at the port of Fujairah\n\n    U.A.E. or so near thereto as the said ship may safely get (always afloat) unto the order\n\n    of …’The bill of lading thus provided\n\nfor delivery at Fujairah. There was nothing in it to contradict the normal understanding\n\nthat the carrier was required to physically discharge the cargo from the vessel at the\n\ndischarge port and thereafter deliver it to the bill of lading holder. As stated above, in\n\norder to excuse non-performance of the discharge obligation by the carrier, there would\n\nhave to be evidence that such was also the intention and/or instruction of the respondents\n\nas the other party to the contract of carriage. The judge stated that the instructions\n\nreceived by the carrier must be considered to determine whether delivery has been made.\n\nWith respect, this statement is too broad. As far as the instructions received by the\n\ncarrier are concerned, for him to avoid liability he would have to show that those\n\ninstructions emanated from the bill of lading holder or were given with his authority.\n\nOtherwise acting on instructions received whether from a third party such as a shipping\n\nagent on shore or from a person with whom the carrier had a contract such as a time\n\ncharterer would not release the carrier from liability.29.\n\n        In this case, the appellants’ difficulty\n\nis that they had no direct contact with the respondents in relation to discharge. On\n\ndischarge, the respondents dealt directly with Metro because they had voyage chartered the\n\nvessels from Metro and had rights vis--vis Metro to give instructions in relation to the\n\ncargo which they did not have vis--vis the vessels themselves as they were not then in\n\npossession of the bills of lading. However, the appellants would be able to rely on such\n\ninstructions as a defence if the instructions supported their case. The respondents’\n\ninstructions to Metro were not passed on to the vessels and the only discharge\n\ninstructions the vessels received were from Metro itself.30.\n\n        In relation toCherry, these\n\ninstructions were given on two occasions. On 24 November 1997, Metro instructed theCherrythat ‘if Fujairah will be declared as the final discharge port cargo will be\n\ndischarged according to instructions of Metro storage coordinator’. On 6 December\n\n1997, Metro further directedCherrythat ‘You are kindly requested to follow\n\nlocal instructions from Metro storage coordinator’. In the cases of theAddaxand theEpic,the voyage instructions from Metro to the vessels were even clearer\n\nin that they read in part ‘Cargo will be discharged according to instructions of\n\nMetro storage coordinator’. Reading these instructions it appears to us that even\n\nMetro had told the vessels that what was required was a physical discharge of the cargo at\n\nFujairah. This impression is fortified by Metro’s telexes to the appellants invoking\n\nthe respective LO1 clauses which telexes stated that owners were requested ‘to\n\ndischarge cargo as below without production of original B/L’ followed by a\n\ndescription of the cargo involved and giving its quantity as the full quantity shipped on\n\nboard.31.\n\n        The respondents’ own instructions to Metro\n\nwere specifically described as their ‘discharge instructions’ and in the case of\n\ntheCherrywere given on 4 December. They read as follows:‘Please find below ourdischarge\n\n    instructions, after completion of loading please forward full loaded details and\n\n    instruct vessel to proceed to off Fujairah where she willdischargeinto MT\n\n    Metrotank and or any other vessel and or shoretanks as instructed by Metro local\n\n    representative.Receivers: Glencore\n\n    International A.G.Inspectors: We understand that\n\n      you will ullage vessel on her arrival at Fujairah and that provided there is not a\n\n      significant difference between arrival quantity and B/L quantity vessel willdischargewithout inspector being present and B/L quantity will be applied to inventory.Obviously should you note a\n\n      significant difference between vessels arrival quantity and B/L then we request that you\n\n      appoint Caleb Brett to attend for outturn quantity prior to vessel commencingdischarge.ETA notices to be sent to\n\n    following on a daily basis and then 12/6 hours.1) The respondents, London Tlx\n\n    21223 attn. D. HawkinsPlease also keep the above\n\n    informed of vessel tendering NOR [ie Notice of Readiness] and throughoutdischarge’\n\n    (emphasis ours)The judge found that on the face\n\nof these instructions the carrier was to discharge all the oil into the facilities and\n\nanything short of that would not constitute delivery according to the respondents’\n\ninstructions.32.\n\n        The appellants took a different view of the\n\nrespondents’ instructions. They submitted that it was clear from the same that:(1) the respondents were\n\n    effectively instructing that delivery of the cargoes was to be made to Metro; and(2) the appellants were entitled\n\n    to follow the instructions of the local representative of Metro as to the quantities to be\n\n    discharged and the quantities to be retained on board.33.\n\n        The judge rejected the argument that the\n\nconcluding words in the respondents’ discharge instructions ie ‘to discharge\n\nintoMT Metrotankand or any other vessel and/or shoretank as instructed by Metro\n\nlocal representative’ were evidence that Metro were the respondents’ agents for\n\nthe receipt of the cargo. He found that those words simply meant that theCherrywas to work with the Metro representative to carry out the discharging operation since\n\nMetro operated the storage facilities at Fujairah and the vessel could not discharge oil\n\ninto the same without liasing with the Metro representative on an operational level.34.\n\n        Before us the appellants sought to argue that\n\nthere were no words in the quoted instructions to restrict Metro’s authority to\n\nmerely ‘coordinating storage’. Instead these instructions suggested that Metro\n\nhad authority to issue instructions relating to discharge includingdischarge into\n\nother vessels(emphasis added by the appellants). The only qualification to the\n\nrespondents’ instructions was that the discharge must be ‘… as instructed\n\nby Metro local representative’. This language precluded any interpretation that\n\nMetro’s authority was only restricted to coordinating storage.35.\n\n        We cannot agree with the interpretation given\n\nto the instructions by the appellants. It was because the storage facility consisted not\n\nonly of theMetrotankbut also of other vessels that the Metro representative had\n\nto give instructions on which ships’ tanks the cargo had to be discharged into. This\n\nwas a storage coordination function since where the cargo went would have depended on the\n\navailable capacity of the various tanks comprising the storage facility.36.\n\n        We agree with the judge that the\n\nrespondents’ instructions required full discharge of the cargo from the ship into the\n\nstorage facilities. It was clear from the repeated use of the word ‘discharge’\n\nin relation to various aspects of what would happen on arrival at Fujairah that the\n\nrespondents wanted all the cargo to leave the ship and be pumped into the storage\n\nfacilities. These were the primary instructions. The direction that the vessel was to act\n\nin accordance with the instructions of the local Metro representative was only an\n\noperational instruction. Metro’s storage facilities were made up of theMetrotankand other storage vessels and the reference to them could only have been intended as a\n\ndescription of the tanks into which the cargo was to be discharged. That the full quantity\n\nhad to be discharged was also made clear from the instructions as to the ullaging of the\n\nvessel which was to confirm that there was no discrepancy between the bill of lading and\n\nthe arrival quantities. This was because the bill of lading quantities were to be applied\n\nto the inventory of cargo in storage maintained by Metro for the respondents. The bill of\n\nlading quantity was essentially the full loaded quantity of the cargo and the respondents\n\nwere therefore asking for and expecting the full loaded quantity to be discharged. As far\n\nas the respondents were concerned, Metro had no authority to direct the ship to retain any\n\npart of the cargo on board.",
        "Was delivery to Metro delivery to\n\nthe respondents?": "37.\n\n        The appellants, however, argued that the\n\ncargoes were delivered to the respondents when they were placed at the immediate disposal,\n\nand under the control, of Metro at Fujairah because Metro was and/or must have been the\n\nrespondents’ agent to take delivery of the cargo. The appellants as the parties who\n\nwere asserting that placing the cargo at the disposal of Metro meant delivery to the\n\nrespondents had to prove that Metro had actual authority from the respondents, either\n\nexpress or implied to take delivery of the respondents’ cargo at Fujairah without\n\ndischarge and to deal with it as if the same belonged to Metro.38.\n\n        As far as express authority goes, we are of the\n\nview that on the evidence the appellants have not been able to establish this. First, a\n\nstorage agreement existed between Metro and the respondents which provided that all oil\n\nbought by the respondents from Metro would be stored at Fujairah and then be dealt with in\n\naccordance with the respondents’ further instructions. Secondly, the written\n\ninstructions given to Metro by the respondents when the vessels were on route to Fujairah\n\nwere, as discussed in  36, that all cargo was to be taken off the ship and put into the\n\nstorage facility. Thirdly, the appellants did not adduce any evidence whether oral or\n\nwritten to show that the respondents had changed their instructions to Metro in relation\n\nto the discharge of the cargo.39.\n\n        The appellants’ evidence was that oral\n\ninstructions had been given by Metro at Fujairah for the partial discharge of theCherryand theEpic. They did not call any evidence on how such instructions had been\n\ngiven in relation to theAddax. There was no evidence at all that these oral\n\ninstructions from Metro actually emanated from the respondents.40.\n\n        Further, the relationship between Metro and the\n\nrespondents in relation to the various parcels of cargo purchased by the respondents from\n\nMetro and thereafter stored at Fujairah was explored in legal proceedings between these\n\nparties in the High Court in England to which the appellants were also parties. This case\n\n(Case No: 1998 Folio 273, and commonly referred to as the UK Phase II proceedings) was\n\nheard before Mr Justice Moore-Bick together with other cases against Metro by other\n\ncompanies which had entered into agreements with Metro for the storage of oil products\n\nbelonging to them at Metro’s storage facility in Fujairah. Among the complex\n\nquestions dealt with in his judgment delivered on 1 August 2001, was the question whether\n\nMetro was entitled to dispose of the oil as soon as it reached Fujairah. In answer to this\n\nquestion, Moore-Bick J said at 173:‘I am unable to accept\n\n    either that Mr Kilakos (Metro) asked Mr Heuze (Glencore) to give him the freedom to\n\n    dispose of oil as soon as it reached Fujairah and to account for it in arrears, or that,\n\n    if he had done so, Mr Heuze would have agreed to such a request. Whatever Glencore’s\n\n    perception of the arrangements in place under JV1, I am quite sure that Mr Heuze would not\n\n    have agreed to release oil to Metro without qualification from the very moment of its\n\n    arrival at Fujairah since such an agreement would quite clearly have deprived Glencore of\n\n    the benefit of any security.’41.\n\n        In answer to arguments that Metro had the\n\nauthority to use the oil once it arrived at Fujairah, the judge said at  245:‘For the reasons I have\n\n    already given I am unable to accept that it was agreed between them that Metro should be\n\n    entitled to dispose of oil before any ITT contract had been issued in respect of it. I do\n\n    not consider that there was any ambiguity about the agreement in this respect or that Mr\n\n    Kilakos believed that the new arrangements involved a fundamental change in the\n\n    parties’ relationship of that kind.’42.\n\n        As parties to the UK Phase II proceedings, the\n\nappellants would be bound by the decision therein. We also note that in fact the\n\nappellants had pleaded in their defences herein certain findings of Moore-Bick J in those\n\nproceedings and had alleged that the respondents were also bound by the same and that it\n\nwould beres judicatato raise the issues decided in the UK Phase II proceedings in\n\nSingapore.43.\n\n        Accordingly, the judgment of the English court\n\nhas confirmed that Metro had no actual authority and were not entitled to use the oil as\n\nthough it were their own from the moment of its arrival at Fujairah and this finding must\n\nalso bind the appellants in these proceedings.44.\n\n        The fact that Metro had no actual authority\n\nfrom the respondents to instruct the appellants to retain and divert cargo to the Far East\n\nis, as the respondents submitted, further supported by the elaborate trail of false\n\ndocumentation which purported to show that the cargo had been fully discharged at\n\nFujairah. Two categories of false documents adduced in evidence are relevant here:(a) false discharge telexes from\n\n    Metro and Rima (the brokers) showing that the cargoes had been discharged in full when\n\n    they had not; and(b) ships’ documents and\n\n    telexes also showing that the cargoes had been discharged in full when they had not.45.\n\n        The appellants’ witnesses when asked in\n\ncross-examination why it was necessary to falsify the documents took the position that the\n\nfalse documents were necessary to protect the ship-owners from claims and also to deceive\n\nthe end receivers of the cargoes. At the same time, however, they attempted to say that\n\nthe documents were commercially true. The production of such documents which would\n\nindicate that the vessels had totally discharged at Fujairah all cargo carried from Kuwait\n\nappears to us to justify the inference that the appellants knew that Metro did not have\n\nauthority to order the vessels not to discharge nor to deal with the cargoes as though\n\nthey belonged to Metro.46.\n\n        In their Case, the appellants attempted to\n\nexplain why the false documents had been produced. They asserted that these documents were\n\nconsistent with their position that the cargo had been delivered to Metro. At Fujairah,\n\nMetro had ordered only part discharge of the cargo in the case ofEpicandCherryand no discharge in the case ofAddax. After other cargoes were loaded onto the\n\nthree vessels at Fujairah, Metro issued new bills of lading for the voyages from Fujairah\n\nto the Far East. All these new bills described the port of loading as Fujairah. It was\n\ntherefore necessary for the appellants to prepare documentation to signify that the\n\nprevious voyage had ended and the new one had commenced. It was necessary for these\n\ndocuments to evidence that all the cargoes had been delivered to Metro at Fujairah, in the\n\nevent that Metro should claim for short delivery of oil at Fujairah. The documents which\n\nreflected full delivery were the Dry Tank Certificates, OBQ report and the Tank Inspection\n\nCertificate. These arguments are not convincing. To protect themselves against claims from\n\nMetro all that the appellants would have had to do would have been to obtain written\n\ninstructions on how much cargo was to be discharged and how much was to be retained and,\n\non completion of partial discharge, a receipt from the Metro representative confirming the\n\namount of cargo received in the storage facility and the amount of cargo retained on\n\nboard. The documents evidencing that the ships’ tanks were empty could only have been\n\nintended to deceive other parties who might make a claim if it turned out that the\n\nships’ tanks had not been emptied prior to loading of the cargo for carriage from\n\nFujairah to the Far East.47.\n\n        One basis of the agency relationship between\n\nMetro and the respondents as posited by the appellants was that since delivery is a\n\nphysical act there had to be someone to take delivery of the cargo at Fujairah on behalf\n\nof the respondents. The only person who came forward to take delivery at Fujairah was\n\nMetro and the respondents had not suggested that someone other than Metro was their\n\nrepresentative. In fact, the respondents had issued discharge instructions to Metro even\n\nthough they could have issued such instructions directly to the appellants. Whilst the\n\nrespondents refused to describe Metro as their agent, Metro was the only party on the\n\nground able to give instructions as regards the delivery/discharge of the cargo.48.\n\n        The appellants’ assertion that there had\n\nto be a representative from the respondents at Fujairah to take delivery was a peculiar\n\nargument for them to make since at all material times they knew that they would not be\n\nmaking delivery to a representative of the bill of lading holder. This is because the time\n\ncharterer Metro had already invoked the LO1 clause and request discharge and delivery\n\nwithout production of the bill. The appellants therefore knew that they would be acting on\n\nthe instructions of Metro as time charterer and would not have expected a representative\n\nof the cargo owners to be present at discharge. Neither would they have been expecting\n\nanyone but Metro to be giving them instructions in relation to discharge since they had\n\nsecured an indemnity from Metro against any consequences that might arise from following\n\nthose instructions and implementing discharge and delivery at Fujairah without\n\npresentation of the bills.49.\n\n        Accordingly, the reason why Metro was the only\n\nparty that came forward in relation to the cargo at Fujairah would have been self-evident\n\nto the appellants and such an action could not have constituted them the respondents’\n\nagents, let alone the respondents’ agents for taking delivery of the cargo. It is\n\nalso significant that the appellants’ witnesses said that they were acting on the\n\ninstructions of Metro as time charterers. The master of theCherry, for example,when asked whom he was obliged to deliver the cargo to under the terms of the bill,\n\nreplied that he would have to deliver in accordance with his time charterers’\n\ninstructions and that was to the time charterers. Further, the appellants were aware that\n\nthe storage facility was run by Metro and it was only Metro’s representative who\n\ncould give directions on the mechanics of discharge and storage.50.\n\n        The appellants also attempted to rely on\n\nimplied actual authority. They cited the case ofPole v Leask[1860] 28 Beav 562\n\nfor the proposition that when an authority given to an agent is in general terms it would\n\nbe construed liberally and according to the usual course of dealing. Further an agent\n\nalways has the actual implied authority to do whatever is necessary for, or ordinarily\n\nincidental to, the effective execution of his express authority.51.\n\n        The principles relating to implied actual\n\nauthority are not of much assistance to the appellants, however, in view of the holding\n\nabove that the extent of Metro’s actual authority as evidenced by the\n\nrespondents’ instructions to them was to arrange for the cargoes to be discharged at\n\nFujairah and stored there. The authority was specific not general. The only implied actual\n\nauthority that would follow from it would be such implied authority as was necessary to do\n\nwhatever was ordinarily required for the task of discharge and storage. Metro did not need\n\nto have authority to decide on discharge quantities in order to execute effectively its\n\nexpress authority to arrange discharge for the purpose of storage. Coordinating storage\n\nonly involves telling the carrier which storage vessel to discharge into and cannot extend\n\nto instructing the carrier to retain the cargo and take it to a different port altogether.52.\n\n        In an attempt to derive authority from a course\n\nof dealing, the appellants pointed to previous voyages when oil carried from Kuwait to\n\nFujairah had been retained on board at Fujairah and then carried on to the Far East. They\n\nnamed five previous shipments involving the vesselsShoko, Alex, Tasman Spirit, CherryandOrientand said that in these cases the retention of part of the cargo on board\n\nhad had no consequence to the carrier. The significance of the respondents’ failure\n\nin those cases to sue the vessels for keeping cargo on board was that their inaction\n\ndemonstrated a course of dealing by the respondents and Metro in relation to retention of\n\ncargo on board. The appellants thus had no reason not to follow Metro’s instructions\n\non retention.53.\n\n        The evidence was, however, that in the cases ofShoko, AlexandTasman Spirit, the respondents had specifically authorised\n\nMetro not to discharge the cargo so that Metro on those specific occasions had express\n\nactual authority to give the instructions they had given to the ship-owners. Those three\n\ncases therefore are not evidence for the existence of a general authority given to Metro\n\nto retain cargoes on board. Further, in seeking to rely on previous shipments, the\n\nappellants were not in fact relying on the principles of implied actual authority. What\n\nthey were actually seeking to do was invoke the principles of apparent authority. In the\n\npresent case, apparent authority does not avail them because first, they did not plead it\n\nand, secondly, they did not adduce evidence to show that at the material time, they had\n\nconsciously inferred from the previous voyages that Metro had the authority to order the\n\nretention of cargo and that in good faith they had relied upon the appearance of such\n\nauthority.54.\n\n        In the appellants’ Case it is stated that\n\nat all material times the appellants believed that Metro was the owner of the cargo\n\nbecause:(a) the instructions to load\n\n    cargo at Kuwait were given by Metro;(b) these instructions were for\n\n    loading on account of Metro;(c) the instructions relating to\n\n    discharge of the cargo required them to discharge strictly in accordance with Metro’s\n\n    directions; and(d) it was Metro who issued the\n\n    letter of indemnity which stated that the cargo had been consigned to Metro.Without necessarily agreeing that\n\nin a situation where Metro were the time charterers of the vessel and where the commercial\n\nrealities were that ownership of the cargo could change hands several times in the course\n\nof the voyage, the appellants had good reason to believe that Metro owned the cargo, we\n\nwould observe that such a belief completely undercuts the credibility of any assertion\n\nthat relies on a belief that Metro was an agent with apparent authority from the cargo\n\nowners to deal with the cargo as it deemed fit.",
        "Were the respondents bound by the\n\nacts of Metro in instructing the vessels to retain cargo on board?": "55.\n\n        In this respect the appellants’ contention\n\nwas that where Metro had implied actual authority to issue discharge instructions\n\nincluding instructions to retain cargo on board, it must follow that the appellants cannot\n\nbe liable to the respondents for following Metro’s instructions. This is so even if\n\nMetro had acted fraudulently by misappropriating the cargo and in this connection, the\n\nappellants rely on theLloyd v Grace, Smith & Codecision. As we agree with the\n\njudge’s holding that there was no actual or implied actual authority given to Metro\n\nto do what it did, it must follow that, as the judge held, the appellants cannot avail\n\nthemselves of the protection offered byLloyd v Grace, Smith & Co. The\n\nprincipal is not liable merely because by appointing the agent he gives him the\n\nopportunity to behave fraudulently:Farquharson Bros. & Co. v King & Co[1902] AC 325;Morris v C.W. Martin & Sons Ltd[1966] 1 QB 716. In the present case,\n\nthe respondents cannot be liable merely because they did not appoint their own\n\nrepresentatives at Fujairah to prevent Metro from giving false discharge instructions.",
        "TheHyperionappeal": "56.\n\n        The respondents’ claim for the loss of the\n\ncargo carried from Iran to Fujairah on board theHyperionand then discharged into\n\ntheCherrysounded only in conversion as there was no contract between the owners\n\nof theCherryand the respondents in respect of this cargo. It is relevant to note\n\nthe manner in which the respondents have pleaded this cause of action. At paragraphs 11 to\n\n13 of their statement of claim in theCherryaction, they state:‘11. On or about 7 December\n\n    1997, the Defendants unlawfully and without the consent of the Plaintiffs, misappropriated\n\n    and removed from the vessel \"HYPERION\", approximately 32,635.720 mt of 180 CST\n\n    Cargo and loaded the same on board the Vessel.12. The Defendants carried\n\n    approximately 32,635.720 mt of the 180 CST Cargo on board the Vessel from Fujairah, U.A.E.\n\n    to Port Dickson, Malaysia pursuant to a bill of lading dated 8 December 1997.13. In the premises, the\n\n    Defendants have converted approximately 32,635.720 mt of the 180 CST Cargo to their own\n\n    use.’Therefore the act of conversion\n\ncomplained of is alleged to have taken place on or about 7 December 1997.57.\n\n        The appellants contended that the judge was\n\nwrong to find them liable in conversion to the respondents because the respondents were\n\nnot entitled to immediate possession of theHyperioncargo on 7 December 1997 as\n\nthey were not holders nor indorsees of the bill of lading issued by the owners of theHyperionfor that cargo.58.\n\n        The appellants relied on the well established\n\nlegal principle that a person has the right to sue for conversion if and only if he had,\n\nat the time of the conversion, either actual possession of, or the immediate right to\n\npossess, the goods converted. Being the owner of the goods allegedly converted is not\n\nalways sufficient to entitle that person to immediate possession. SeeClerk &\n\nLindsell on Torts(17thEd) 13-51, 13-52 and 13-77. In the court below,\n\nthe judge accepted this principle but went on to hold that the rule was not inflexible and\n\nthat the right to sue in conversion may be transferred to the plaintiff from a preceding\n\nholder of that right. In coming to this conclusion, the judge relied onBristol &\n\nWest of England Bank v Midland Railway Co[1891] 2 QB 653.59.\n\n        In theBristol Bankcase, cargo shipped\n\nunder a bill of lading was subsequently transferred into the custody of Midland Railway.\n\nThe shipping documents were first held by Toronto Bank, then City Bank and last by Bristol\n\nBank. Before Bristol Bank received the documents, Midland Railway had already delivered\n\nthe good to a man named Clark who was acting dishonestly and thus were unable to make\n\ndelivery to Bristol Bank when the latter subsequently presented the bill. Bristol Bank\n\nthen sued Midland Railway for conversion and the action succeeded despite the fact that\n\nthe mis-delivery of the goods took place when City Bank was the holder of the bill of\n\nlading. The judge commented that the defence raised by Midland Railway was that Bristol\n\nBank’s action could not be maintained because the goods were released to the\n\nconsignee before Bristol Bank acquired any title to them but that that defence was\n\nrejected on the basis that City Bank had had property rights to the goods as pledgees and\n\nthose rights had been transferred to Bristol Bank which then acquired the right to sue,\n\nalthough it became the pledgee after the goods were released to the consignee. The judge\n\nwas further of the view that the case dealt with Bristol Bank’s title to the goods\n\nand not to its immediate rights of possession but that that was not an immediate and\n\nmaterial difference as the issue was that of the right to sue and the reasoning would be\n\nthe same whether it was a right to sue by having title in the goods or having the\n\nimmediate right of possession. With respect, we are unable to agree. Conversion as a cause\n\nof action can only be invoked by the person having the immediate right to possess.60.\n\n        Other authorities have not adopted the\n\njudge’s view of theBristol Bankcase. Instead,Bristol Bankhas been\n\nconstrued as a case where the plaintiffs succeeded because the act of conversion sued on\n\nwas the inability of Midland Railway to produce the goods when Bristol Bank presented the\n\nbill and demanded delivery. At that stage Bristol Bank was the pledgee of the goods and\n\nhad the right to possess them. Bristol Bank was relying on its own right of possession and\n\nnot on the antecedent right invested in City Bank at the time the goods were delivered to\n\nMr Clark.61.\n\n        InMargarine Union G.M.B.H. v Cambay Prince\n\nSteamship Co[1969] 1 QB 219, Roskill J dealt at length withBristol Bank. In\n\nthe course of his judgment he stated:‘… Mr Lloyd developed\n\n    an interesting argument founded on the decision of the Court of Appeal inBristol and\n\n    West of England Bank v Midland Railway Co …Mr Lloyd argued that the cause of\n\n    action upon which they succeeded was the original cause of action upon which they\n\n    succeeded was the original cause of action in respect of the conversion of the goods when\n\n    they were wrongly handed to Clark. Thus, he argued, they were able to recover in respect\n\n    of an antecedent tort committed by the defendants before the plaintiffs acquired title.Mr Mustill, on the other hand,\n\n    argued that the successful cause of action of the Bristol Bankwas not the original\n\n    conversion but the conversion following the inability (and, therefore, the refusal) of the\n\n    defendants to deliver the goods to the Bristol Bank when the Bristol Bank claimed them\n\n    under the bills of lading after the Bristol Bank had got title thereunder ……If one had to determine the\n\n    matter merely from reading the report itself, I would conclude that the cause of action\n\n    upon which the Bristol Bank succeeded was a cause of action resulting from the inability\n\n    of the defendants to deliver the goods to the Bristol Bank after the Bristol Bank had\n\n    become the pledgees of the goods …I had dealt with the submissions\n\n    on either side in relation to theBristol Bankcase at considerable length because\n\n    much of the argument before me was devoted to an analysis of the decision in that case.\n\n    Clearly it is a case of importance for the decision of the present case, for, if the\n\n    plaintiffs’ submission upon it be right, it is a case where a plaintiff who acquired\n\n    title by accepting shipping documents nonetheless succeeded in recovering in respect of an\n\n    antecedent tort committed at the time when that plaintiff is not the owner. But, in my\n\n    judgment, that is not what that case decided.’ (at pp 246-250)This analysis ofBristol Bankwas accepted by the English Court of Appeal inThe \"Future Express\"[1993] 2 LLR 542 at 548-9.62.\n\n        On the proper interpretation of the case\n\ntherefore, it is clear thatBristol Bankdid not obliterate the requirement that a\n\nplaintiff suing in conversion had to have had the immediate right to possession at the\n\ntime of the alleged conversion in order to maintain such an action. Moreover, the case did\n\nnot allow the right of possession to be transferred retrospectively to the date when the\n\nact of conversion occurred. In the present case therefore, in order to succeed in\n\nconversion the respondents had to show that on 7 December 1997 they had the immediate\n\nright to possession of theHyperioncargo.63.\n\n        The evidence showed that, as of that date, the\n\nrespondents did not hold the bill of lading issued by the owners of theHyperion.This bill was made out to the order of the shipper, National Iranian Oil Company\n\n(‘NIOC’), and was given to the shipper upon completion of loading in Iran. The\n\nrespondents did not dispute this. Their position was that they were the owners of the\n\ncargo at all material times (and thereby entitled to possess it) because the contract of\n\nsale with NIOC provided that title to the cargo would pass at the loading port to the\n\nbuyer, Metro, as the product passed the flanges of the ship and their own back-to-back\n\ncontract with Metro had identical provisions. Thus, on loading, title to the oil passed to\n\nthem.64.\n\n        Having title to the goods, however, does not\n\nmean having the immediate right to possession. When goods are shipped on board a vessel\n\nand a bill of lading is issued in respect of the carriage, it is the carrier’s\n\npresumed intention and legal obligation to deliver to the holder of the bill of lading. In\n\naddition, s 19(2) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393) states that ‘where goods are\n\nshipped, and by the bill of lading, the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller\n\nor his agent, the seller is prima facie to be taken to reserve the right of\n\ndisposal’. Hence, the presumption would be that the immediate right to possession\n\nwould lie with the seller, NIOC, until it endorsed the bill of lading over to the buyer or\n\nits bank and completed the endorsement by delivery of the bill. As per the usual\n\narrangement, that bank was BTC. Such endorsement and delivery could have not occurred\n\nuntil 19 December 1997 at the earliest as that was the date on which payment was made.\n\nAlthough there was no evidence as to when the bill was actually sent to BTC, a telex\n\nmessage sent on 15 December makes it clear that as of that date the document had still to\n\nbe submitted. Thus, on 7 December, NIOC still had the bill of lading and on presentation\n\nof the bill toHyperionwould have been entitled to delivery up of the cargo. On\n\nthat day, the respondents were not the persons entitled to possess the cargo.65.\n\n        The respondents relied on the case ofTheFiliatra Legacy[1991] 2 LLR 337 as support for the proposition that as owners of\n\ntheHyperioncargo they were entitled to sue for conversion. That case, however, is\n\ndistinguishable from the present one. It was a shortage claim and the plaintiff buyer of\n\ncargo founded its suit on the torts of negligence and conversion in the alternative. At p\n\n399 Mustill L.J. considered that since the buyers were suing in tort, ‘they have to\n\nestablish that they were the owners of the oil at the time of discharge:Leigh &\n\nSullivan Ltd v Aliakmon Shipping Co Ltd[1986] 1 AC 785.’Aliakmonwas a\n\nnegligence case. In it Lord Brandon stated (at p 809) that in order to enable a person to\n\nclaim in negligence for loss of or damage to property, he must have had either the legal\n\nownership or a possessory title to the property concerned at the time of the loss or\n\ndamage and it is not enough for him to have had only contractual rights in relation to the\n\nproperty at that time. This meant that to sue in negligence,eitherlegal ownershiporpossessory rights would suffice. InThe Filiatra Legacyneither the issue\n\nof immediate right to possession nor any other possessory right was raised. The\n\nrequirements for maintaining an action for conversion were not considered. Accordingly,The\n\nFiliatra Legacyis of no assistance to the respondents.66.\n\n        In the event, we are satisfied that the\n\nrespondents were not entitled to make a claim for conversion of theHyperioncargo\n\non 7 December 1997 and that, accordingly, the appeal of the owners of theCherryin\n\nrespect of this parcel of cargo must be allowed.",
        "Causation": "67.\n\n        On the issue of causation, the judge held that\n\nthe onus was on the respondents to prove that the oil was lost and that the appellants had\n\ncaused the loss. The respondents did not have to establish, as contended by the\n\nappellants, that they would not have suffered loss through other causes. The appellants\n\nhad the burden of proving their assertion that the oil would have been lost in any event\n\nnotwithstanding their own wrongdoing. The judge found that the respondents had discharged\n\ntheir burden and that the appellants had been unable to establish that the oil would have\n\nbeen lost anyway even if it had been discharged in full at Fujairah in accordance with the\n\nrespondents’ instructions.68.\n\n        As Kan J held inThe Feng Hang[2002] 2 SLR 205, a claimant can recover damages for a breach of contract or in tort where that\n\nbreach (or wrong) was the ‘effective’ or ‘dominant’ cause of the loss.\n\nThe courts adopt a common sense approach in interpreting the facts of each case to\n\ndetermine whether the breach was the cause of the loss or merely gave the opportunity for\n\nthe loss to be sustained. Though different terms have been used, (‘dominant and\n\neffective cause’ in contractual cases likeGaloo Ltd v Bright Grahame Murray[1994] 1 WLR 1360 as opposed to what is termed the ‘but for’ test often used in tort\n\ncases to determine causation) the law of causation in tort and contract is the same.69.\n\n        In the very recent case ofKuwait Airways\n\nCorporation v Iraqi Airways Co[2002] 2 WLR 1353, decided only in May 2002, a month\n\nafter the first instance decision herein, the House of Lords dealt with causation in a\n\nclaim for conversion. Whilst the claims that we are now considering arise from contractual\n\nbreaches, those breaches resulted in misappropriation of the respondents’ property.\n\nThe appellants in submitting that their wrongdoing did not cause the respondents’\n\nloss put their arguments, to a large extent, in terms of the principles enunciated in that\n\ncase in the judgment of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at 69-83 of his judgment. To\n\nsummarise, his Lordship noted that the inquiry into whether the wrongful conduct causally\n\ncontributed to the loss, widely undertaken as a simple ‘but for’ test is\n\npredominantly a factual inquiry. The ‘but for’ test, however, is not always a\n\nreliable guide and can be over-exclusionary particularly in situations where more than one\n\nwrongdoer is involved. To determine the applicability of the test in a particular tortious\n\nsituation, one has to have regard to the purpose sought to be achieved by that tort. In\n\nthe case of conversion, its principle purpose is to protect the ownership of goods by\n\nimposing a strict liability on persons who misappropriate the goods of others. Consistent\n\nwith this principle, every person through whose hands goods pass in a series of\n\nconversions is himself guilty of conversion and liable to the owner for the loss caused by\n\nhis misappropriation of the goods because each such person wrongfully excludes the owner\n\nfrom possession of his goods. Further, it is irrelevant that in the absence of the\n\ndefendant’s conversion someone else would have wrongfully converted the goods. The\n\nlikelihood that had the defendant not wronged the plaintiff, somebody else would have done\n\nso is no reason for diminishing the defendant’s liability for the loss he brought\n\nupon the plaintiff. Thus, in cases of successive conversion, there is little place for the\n\n‘but for’ test and if that test is to be applied at all, it calls for\n\nconsideration of whether the plaintiff would have suffered the loss in question had he\n\nretained his goods and not been unlawfully deprived of them by the defendant. Loss that\n\nthe owner would have suffered even if he had retained the goods is not ‘caused’\n\nby the defendant.70.\n\n        The appellants accepted that to avoid liability\n\nfor the respondents’ loss the burden lay on them to prove that even if the cargoes\n\nhad been delivered in full into Metro’s storage tanks, the respondents would still\n\nhave suffered the loss of the cargoes. To discharge that burden they asserted that the\n\nrespondents would still have suffered the loss because either:(a) Metro had sold the cargo to\n\n    receivers in the Far East. Pursuant to those sales, Metro had to ship out the cargo even\n\n    if it had been discharged in full into the storage tanks and as such the cargo would not\n\n    have remained in those tanks; or(b) It was the respondents’\n\n    sale of the cargoes to Metro through what the parties termed ‘ITT contracts’ and\n\n    Metro’s failure to pay for the same that caused the respondents’ loss.Onward sale by Metro71.\n\n        Turning to the first basis, the appellants\n\nrelied on three pieces of evidence to prove the cargoes had been sold by Metro. First, new\n\nbills of lading had been issued for the cargo that was on-carried to the Far East naming\n\nMetro as shipper and parties in the Far East as the parties to whom, or to whose order,\n\ndelivery was to be made. Secondly, there were also survey reports for these cargoes naming\n\nthe Far Eastern parties as consignees. The appellants considered that the fact that such\n\ndocuments were issued at Fujairah before the vessels left that port lent weight to their\n\ncontention that these cargoes had been sold to buyers in the Far East prior to the\n\nvessels’ respective arrivals at Fujairah or, at the latest, prior to the\n\nvessels’ departures from Fujairah for the Far East. Thirdly, the appellants referred\n\nto the evidence of the respondents’ witness, David Hawkins, in cross-examination.\n\nWhen asked whether he agreed that the three cargoes that were shipped out of Fujairah to\n\nthe Far East on board theCherry, EpicandAddaxhad been sold by Metro to\n\nreceivers who took delivery of them, Mr Hawkins replied:‘I have no idea what Metro\n\n    did with it. I assume that Metro are not stupid to give it away, so I am sure that they\n\n    sold the oil, yes. They sold the oil without the knowledge of Glencore.’The appellants submitted that in\n\nthe light of this evidence, it was clear that if the cargoes had been discharged fromCherry,\n\nEpicandAddaxthey would have not remained in Fujairah. Metro would simply\n\nhave reloaded the same cargoes onto the same vessels or other vessels for shipment to the\n\nFar East since these cargoes had already been sold.72.\n\n        The judge considered this issue and held that\n\nthere was no basis, on the evidence, for assuming that if all the oil had been discharged\n\nit would have been sold and shipped out by Metro. He considered that while that might have\n\nhappened, the fate of the oil in storage was entirely a matter of conjecture. We agree\n\nwith the judge. In order to succeed in their argument, the appellants have to be able to\n\nshow exactly what would have happened to the oil had it been discharged in full. They\n\nadduced no evidence establishing the fact that if this had been done, the very same cargo\n\nwould have been removed by Metro for its own use. In any case, it would have been very\n\ndifficult for Metro to have done this because the storage facility contained oil belonging\n\nto several parties and once any of the oil from these three ships had entered the storage\n\ntanks it would have become commingled with the oil already there and lost its separate\n\nidentity. In view of the fungible nature of oil, the contention of the appellants that\n\nMetro could and would simply have reloaded the ‘same’ cargoes onto the same\n\nvessels or other vessels for shipment to the Far East cannot be accepted. The appellants\n\nwould not have been able to show that the oil loaded back on was the ‘same’\n\ncargo that had been discharged.73.\n\n        Secondly, we agree with the submission of the\n\nrespondents that there was no evidence that Metro had contracted to sell the specific\n\ncargoes that were on board theCherry,theEpicand theAddax. The\n\nevidence showed that what Metro had contracted to sell was a parcel of 180 cst fuel oil\n\nand several parcels of 380 cst fuel oil. The quantities they had contracted to sell and\n\nship out of Fujairah were larger than the quantities that were shipped on board the three\n\nvessels. Also, the specifications of the cargoes sold to the Far East were different from\n\nthe specifications of the cargoes loaded at Kuwait though the generic grades were the\n\nsame. As Metro’s sales were sales of bulk oil cargoes, they had sold unascertained\n\ngoods and not specific goods. There was no evidence that Metro had to use the\n\nrespondents’ cargo on theCherry, theEpicand theAddaxto\n\nfulfil its contracts because as asserted by the appellants, ‘it had sold the\n\nsame’. None of the contracts of sale identified the goods sold as being the cargo on\n\nboard any of the respective vessels at the material time.74.\n\n        The evidence of Mr Hawkins that he assumed that\n\nMetro was not stupid enough to give away oil and that he was sure that they had sold the\n\noil, cannot support the appellants’ contention that if all the oil had been\n\ndischarged it would have been sold. This is because Mr Hawkins was referring to the oil\n\nthat was retained on board the vessels and carried off to the Far East. He was not\n\nreferring to oil that had been discharged. His evidence therefore did not relate to what\n\nMetro would have done to the oil that had it been discharged in full but related only to\n\nwhat Metro did in respect of the oil that it had already converted.75.\n\n        Further, the appellants’ allegation that\n\nif all the oil had been discharged it would inevitably have been lost was considerably\n\nweakened because there was no evidence at all to show that the portions of theCherryandEpiccargo that were discharged did not remain in storage. As at 7 February\n\n1998, when the collapse of Metro was discovered, there were still substantial quantities\n\nof fuel oil remaining in the storage facility, about 750,000 metric tons in all. It is\n\nevident that if the respondents’ cargoes had been fully discharged from the vessels\n\ninto the storage facilities, this may have increased the quantity of fuel oil held in\n\nstorage in February 1998 and available to compensate the various persons who stored oil\n\nwith Metro including the respondents.76.\n\n        As the respondents submitted, even if the\n\nspecific cargoes had been sold by Metro, that sale could not have resulted in the loss if\n\nthe appellants had not actively assisted in the retention of the cargoes on board their\n\nvessels and carried them to destination for delivery to Metro’s buyers. It was the\n\nactive and direct involvement of the appellants in retaining cargoes on board the vessels,\n\nin agreeing to act on the instructions of Metro to issue false documents to create the\n\nappearance that the previous cargoes had been fully discharged, and in actually carrying\n\nthe cargoes and delivering them to the Far East, that enabled Metro to fulfil their sale\n\nobligations.ITT contracts77.\n\n        In the course of their business dealings, the\n\nrespondents often but not always on sold the oil stored in the Fujairah facility to Metro\n\nitself. Such sales were effected by sales contracts termed ‘In-tank Transfer\n\nContracts’ (‘ITT contracts’). In respect of theCherryandEpicshipments, the respondents sold the cargo to Metro by ITT contracts concluded in January\n\n1998. At the time of each sale, the respondents were unaware that part of each shipment\n\nhad not been discharged into the facility and the ITT contracts made were therefore for\n\nthe entirety of each shipment. In the case of theCherry, the relevant ITT contract\n\nwas evidenced by a telex dated 28 January 1998 to Metro from the respondents. This telex\n\nreferred to the recent transaction concluded between the respondents as the seller and\n\nMetro as the buyer and included the following terms:‘Product:Fuel oil ex Kuwait per mtCherrystored on vessel m/tMetrotankoff Fujairah.Quantity/Price:87,972.000 metric tons exactly of\n\n    fuel oil ex Kuwait at USD96.96 per metric ton with tank transfer dates as follows21,993.000 metric tons on the\n\n    20/1/9821,993.000 metric tons on the\n\n    21/1/9821,993.000 metric tons on the\n\n    22/1/9821,993.000 metric tons on the\n\n    23/1/98Delivery:Stock transfer of cargo held to\n\n    order of Glencore International AG stored on m/tMetrotankoff Fujairah.Payment:In full without discount offset\n\n    or counterclaim 55 days after stock transfer date of …Risk and title:Risk shall pass from seller to\n\n    buyer on the date of the stock transfer. Title shall pass on exchange of title document.Special condition:Stock transfer will take place\n\n    upon receipt of an irrevocable documentary credit … However for payment purposes\n\n    stock transfer date will be 20th, 21st, 22ndand 23rdJanuary 98. …’In the case of theEpic,\n\nthe telex was dated 12 January and the oil sold was divided into four equal parcels to be\n\ntransferred on four successive days starting 8 January 1998. There was a similar contract\n\nfor theHyperioncargo but there is no need to consider that further in view of our\n\ndecision above. No such contract was made in respect of theAddaxcargo.78.\n\n        A perusal of the telex confirmation reflecting\n\ntheCherryITT contract would appear to indicate that delivery of the cargo so sold\n\nto Metro was not to take place until Metro supplied the respondents with an irrevocable\n\nletter of credit for the price of the cargo. In the UK Phase II proceedings, however,\n\nMoore-Bick J having heard the evidence on how Metro and the respondents dealt with each\n\nother, found that the respondents had represented to Metro that they, like Metro, regarded\n\nthe ITT date as the date upon which oil sold by in-tank transfer was delivered to Metro.\n\nHe held at 167 of his judgment:‘… Glencore’s\n\n    representation that oil sold by in-tank transfer would be treated as delivered to MTI on\n\n    the ITT date provided the unspoken basis on which all such contracts were made. An\n\n    objective observer standing in the shoes of Mr Heuze and knowing what he knew about the\n\n    commercial background to that request would have realised that. To hold that the parties\n\n    nonetheless intended to contract on terms that delivery would not occur until a letter of\n\n    credit had been opened would be to ignore commercial reality.’79.\n\n        On the basis of the foregoing facts, the\n\nappellants submitted that in respect of theCherryandEpiccargoes, it was\n\nthe respondents’ sale of the cargoes to Metro through the ITT contracts and\n\nMetro’s subsequent failure to pay for the same which effectively caused the\n\nrespondents’ loss. They submitted that even if the entirety of the cargoes lately\n\nladen on board those vessels had been discharged into Metro’s storage facility at\n\nFujairah, as the respondents asserted should have been done, Metro would have had full\n\ncontrol of such cargoes and the ability to deal with them as Metro deemed fit as of the\n\ndates of the respective ITT contracts. As such, Metro would have, at the very latest, been\n\nable to deal with theCherryandEpiccargoes in January 1998 and the\n\nrespondents would not have been able to reclaim the cargo by the time they brought the\n\nclaims against appellants in late February 1998.80.\n\n        In support of their argument, the appellants\n\nrelied on the English Court of Appeal decision ofHiort & anor v The London and\n\nNorth Western Railway Company[1879] 4 Ex D 188. Messrs Hiort and Brochmer, the\n\nplaintiffs in that case, were grain merchants. The defendants were a railway company and\n\nwarehousemen who stored the plaintiffs’ grain. The plaintiffs appointed G as their\n\nagent to sell the grain and the defendants requested the plaintiffs to issue standing\n\norders to permit them to deliver grain on the instructions of G. The plaintiffs refused to\n\nissue such standing orders. Nevertheless G obtained delivery of 60 quarters of oats from\n\nthe defendants on the promise that he would later forward them a delivery order from the\n\nplaintiffs. The plaintiffs subsequently contracted to sell 60 quarters of oats to one T\n\nand gave him a delivery order addressed to the defendants. T then endorsed the delivery\n\norder to G who forwarded it to the defendants as the delivery order that he had promised\n\nto send them. T was unable to pay for the oats and G never accounted to the plaintiffs for\n\nthe oats which he had taken. The Court of Appeal found that there had been conversion by\n\nthe defendants but awarded the plaintiffs only nominal damages.81.\n\n        The appellants argued that the facts of the\n\npresent case were analogous to those ofHiort’scase. It was the fact that the\n\ngoods were delivered that exposed the plaintiffs there to a credit risk. The fact that the\n\ndelivery was early caused no loss to the plaintiffs. Similarly, in the present case, at\n\nbest, the respondents could accuse the appellants of allowing Metro to deal with the cargo\n\nearlier than they were entitled to do under the ITT contracts. It was the ITT contracts\n\nthat exposed the respondents to Metro’s credit risk. The early delivery or release to\n\nMetro did not cause the respondents’ loss. The best corroborative evidence of this\n\nwas the fact that even in respect of the cargo that was discharged into Metro’s\n\nstorage tanks, the respondents received no payment ie they suffered from the same credit\n\nrisk.82.\n\n        The appellants relied in particular on the\n\nfollowing passage from the judgment of Thesiger LJ:‘If [the defendants] had not\n\n    delivered these goods at the respective dates at which they were delivered, they would\n\n    have been bound by virtue of the delivery orderissued subsequentlyby the\n\n    plaintiffs to have delivered them exactly in the same way, and to the persons to whom they\n\n    were delivered. The damage has not been sustained by the delivery by the defendants, but\n\n    in consequence of the plaintiffs selling their goods and authorising the delivery of them\n\n    to persons, who are liable to the plaintiffs for the price, and treated by them as liable\n\n    down to the present time, but who have not paid for them.’ (At p 198, emphasis\n\n    supplied by the appellants)83.\n\n        The second member of the court, Bramwell LJ,\n\nalso considered that the appropriate award was one for nominal damages. There had been a\n\nconversion by the wrongful delivery to G but no substantial damages resulted because of\n\nwhat had taken place subsequently. The order that the oats be delivered to T or his\n\nnominee G was equivalent to a return of the goods in that the plaintiffs were in the same\n\nposition they would have been if, subsequent to first taking delivery, G had returned the\n\noats to the plaintiffs since the plaintiffs would then have redelivered them to G pursuant\n\nto their subsequent sale to T. The third member of the court, Baggallay LJ, held that the\n\nfact did not entitle the plaintiffs to any damages at all, not even nominal damages. It\n\ncan be seen from this short summary that although all three judges inHiortfound\n\nin favour of the defendants, there was no common ground in their reasoning. In the course\n\nof his decision inKuwait Airways,Lord Nicholls consideredHiort.He\n\nobserved that the reason why Hiort failed was that his loss would have been suffered even\n\nif the conversion had not taken place. This was because Hiort would equally have received\n\nno payment for his goods if, instead of misdelivering the goods, the railway company had\n\ndelivered them in accordance with his instructions.84.\n\n        Our task here is to determine whether the\n\nappellants’ breaches of contract were an effective cause of the respondents’\n\nloss or, to put it the other way, whether the respondents would still have lost the oil\n\nhad it all been discharged into the storage tanks. In either case, the answer depends on a\n\nconsideration of the relevant facts. In our view, the most relevant fact is that the oil\n\ncomplained about was not put into the tanks. It was taken away. On the face of it, the\n\naction of the appellants caused the oil to be lost to the respondents. The appellants had\n\nthe burden of showing that it would have been lost in any case. As we have discussed in \n\n72 to 76, they were not able to produce evidence to discharge this burden. There was no\n\nevidence either before the judge or before us that had all the oil from theCherryandEpicbeen put into the tanks in Fujairah in December 1997, it or most of it would\n\nnot still have been there in February 1998 when Metro collapsed.85.\n\n        In our view, the parallel which the appellants\n\nsought to draw between this case andHiort’scase does not bear up under\n\nscrutiny. InHiort’scase, the goods were prematurely delivered into the\n\ncontrol of the fraudster, G, who then made away with them. The plaintiffs’ orders\n\nwere, in effect, to release the same goods from storage to G, with payment to be obtained\n\nfrom T. In this case, however, the oil should have been delivered into a storage tank to\n\nbe kept for the respondents and it was not. No instructions were ever given to the\n\nappellants to take it away or that would allow Metro to deal with it in advance of the ITT\n\ncontracts. That is where the analogy breaks down. No doubt, Metro could lawfully have\n\ndealt with all of theEpicoil from 13 January 1998 onwards and with all of theCherryoil from 23 January 1998 onwards pursuant to the ITT contracts. That fact does not\n\nprove that Metro would have so dealt with all of the oil so as to remove it entirely from\n\nthe storage facility by the end of the first week of February 1998. As long as the oil or\n\npart of it was still in the facility when Metro collapsed, the respondents could have\n\nreclaimed it since, contractually, they retained title until payment although they had\n\nagreed to allow Metro to deal with it from time of the delivery. Even if they had\n\ntransferred title the remaining oil could have been the subject of execution proceedings.\n\nThe difference betweenHiort’scase and the present one is that inHiort’scase, it was proved that the plaintiffs would in any case have delivered the goods to\n\nsomeone who would not have been able to pay for them. In this case, the appellants have\n\nnot proved that had they dealt with the oil as they should have, all of it would in any\n\ncase have been lost in that Metro would have disposed of it as G did the oats. The\n\nappellants’ actions were an effective cause of the loss. The fact that there would\n\nnot have been a loss had Metro been able to pay for the oil is besides the point.86.\n\n        We conclude that even in respect of the oil\n\ncovered by the ITT contracts, the appellants have not been able to establish that their\n\nwrongful actions did not cause the loss sustained by the respondents.",
        "Conclusion": "87.\n\n        In the event, apart from the appeal of the\n\nowners of theCherryin respect of theHyperioncargo, the appellants’\n\nappeals have failed and are dismissed with costs. The appeal of the owners of theCherryin respect of theHyperioncargo is allowed and they are awarded the costs of this\n\nportion of the appeal and of this portion of the action below.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHAO HICK TINJUDITH PRAKASHCHIEF JUSTICEJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
