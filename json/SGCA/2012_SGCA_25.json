        "Introduction": "1       The appellant, Quek Hock Lye\n                    (“Quek”), a 48-year-old male Singapore citizen, was convicted by\n                    the judge (“the Judge”) in the High Court of possession of not\n                    less than 62.14 g of diamorphine (“the seized drugs”), a\n                    controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of\n                    Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) in furtherance of a\n                    criminal conspiracy with one Winai Phutthaphan (“Winai”), a 25\n                    year-old male Thai national, to traffic the seized drugs, an offence under s\n                    5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Act. Quek was sentenced to the mandatory death\n                    penalty under s 120B of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the\n                    PC”) read with s 33 of the Act (seePublic Prosecutor\n                        v PhuthitaSomchit and another[2011] 3 SLR 719). 2       This is Quek’s appeal against his\n                    conviction and sentence.",
        "Background": "",
        "Original and amended charge": "3       The charge on which Quek was convicted pertained\n                    to his participation in a criminal conspiracy with Winai to traffic in not less\n                    than 62.14 g of diamorphine (“the amended charge”). However, it\n                    should be noted that at the commencement of the trial at the High Court, Quek\n                    was in fact jointly charged with one Phuthita Somchit (“Somchit”),\n                    a 37-year-old female Thai national who, in addition to Winai, was identified as\n                    a party to the criminal conspiracy to traffic the seized drugs (“the\n                    original charge”). The amended charge preferred against Quek by the Judge\n                    was distinct from the original charge in only two respects: (a)     Somchit was no longer a named\n                        co-conspirator; and (b)     Quek, rather than Somchit, was stated to have been in possession of\n                        the seized drugs. 4       At this juncture, we should point out that Winai\n                    was a named party to the criminal conspiracy alleged in the original charge\n                    preferred against Quek and Somchit as well as in the amended charge forming the\n                    subject matter of this appeal. However, prior to the commencement of\n                    Quek’s trial before the Judge, Winai pleaded guilty to a wholly separate\n                    charge of possession of not less than 14.99 g of diamorphine in furtherance of a\n                    criminal conspiracy with Somchit and Quek to traffic in the stated quantity of\n                    the drugs (“Winai’s charge”).[note: 1]Winai’s testimony was used by the\n                    Prosecution in the trial against Quek and Somchit. 5       By way of background, we ought to state that\n                    Somchit was distantly related to Winai and was also Quek’s girlfriend. As\n                    per the original charge, Quek and Somchit were jointly tried in a 17 day hearing\n                    before the Judge. Although Quek claimed trial, he elected to remain silent when\n                    called upon to enter his defence. On the 17thday of\n                    trial, having conducted a thorough assessment of the evidence adduced before the\n                    court, the Judge made a number of findings which resulted in the charges\n                    preferred against Quek and Somchit being amended. In particular, the Judge made\n                    the following findings of fact and law: (a)     From her demeanour in the witness box\n                        and the consistency of her evidence, Somchit was a witness of\n                            truth.[note: 2] (b)     Somchit did not have actual knowledge\n                        and was not wilfully blind as to thenatureof\n                        the drug.[note: 3]Somchit had proved on a balance of probabilities that she did not know the\n                        nature of the drug. (c)     Somchit had rebutted the presumption of knowledge raised by s 18(2)\n                        of the Act.[note: 4] 6       Accordingly, the Judge acquitted Somchit of the\n                    original charge. However, exercising his power under s 175(2) of the\n                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”),\n                    the Judge amended the charge against Somchit and convicted her of attempting to\n                    traffic in a controlled drug under Class C of the First Schedule of the Act\n                    (“the separate charge”). On 2 September 2010, Somchit was\n                    sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment. 7       Having convicted and sentenced Somchit under the\n                    separate charge, the Judge further exercised his powers under s 163(1) of\n                    the CPC, and preferred the amended charge against Quek (see[3]above). The following exchange took place when\n                    the amended charge was read out to Quek:[note: 5] Court:How do you\n                                        plead?Interpreter\n                                        Ang:He pleads\n                                        guilty.Court:Wow! Technically, I’m\n                                            not supposed---anyway,\n                                                I’ll---I’ll not accept the plea, all\n                                                right. Are you ready to be tried on the\n                                            altered charge?[Quek]:I don’t want to be\n                                            tried on this charge.Court:Don’t want to be\n                                            tried? No, are you ready to be\n                                    tried?[Quek]:I wish to plead guilty, I\n                                            want to plead guilty, Sir.Court:Yes, are you ready to be\n                                            tried? Is there any reason why the trial should not\n                                            continue---proceed?[Quek]:I hope that this case can\n                                            continue---continue.[emphasis\n                                        added]   8       Notwithstanding the Judge’s reluctance to\n                    accept Quek’s plea of guilt, upon being called to enter his defence, Quek\n                    chose not to call any witnesses or tender any documents in his defence to the\n                    amended charge. In the result, the Judge convicted Quek of the amended charge,\n                    after he was satisfied, having assessed the evidence already adduced, that the\n                    evidence overwhelmingly supported it. As noted above (see[3]), the elements of the amended charge were\n                    identical to the original charge with the exception of the removal of any\n                    reference to Somchit in relation to the alleged criminal conspiracy as well as\n                    the amendment to state that Quek, instead of Somchit, was in possession of the\n                    seized drugs. As will be shown later, these changes did not affect the\n                    sufficiency of the weight of the evidence adduced in support of the amended\n                    charge (below at[9]-[13];[32]-[40]).",
        "Material facts in support of the amended charge": "9       The facts supporting both the original and\n                    amended charges can be found in the statement of agreed facts\n                    (“SAF”) which was signed by Quek and tendered before the Judge\n                    pursuant to s 376(1) of the CPC.[note: 6]In accordance with s 376(3) of the CPC, the SAF could be treated as an\n                    admission of facts for the purposes of the present appeal. 10     The following facts were undisputed before the\n                    Judge as well as before this Court. At the material time, Quek, Winai and\n                    Somchit resided at Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02, Aquarius by the\n                    Park, Singapore (“the Aquarius apartment”). Quek had, using his\n                    forged driving licence, entered into a lease agreement dated 6 September\n                    2008 with the owner of the Aquarius apartment to rent it. On 3 October\n                    2008, Quek was arrested by a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau\n                    (“CNB”) and was led to the Aquarius apartment where he was\n                    searched. Amongst other things, the following were recovered from his\n                    person: (a)     One bunch of four keys attached to a\n                        key tag with the words “21 Aquarius #01-02” written on it;\n                        and (b)     Cash\n                        amounting to a total of S$ 5948.00. 11     The CNB officers thereafter conducted a search\n                    of the Aquarius apartment and seized 124 packets of granular substances which\n                    were later established to contain not less than 62.14 g of diamorphine. Drug\n                    paraphernalia was also found in the apartment which formed the objective\n                    evidence before the Judge to show that the drugs in the apartment were intended\n                    for repacking for sale rather than for personal consumption. 12     Quek made a contemporaneous statement on\n                    3 October 2008 and a cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the CPC on\n                    4 October 2008. Later, five long statements were recorded from him under s\n                    121 of the CPC on 7, 8 and 9 October 2008 and 22 January 2009\n                    (hereinafter all 7 statements taken by the police will be referred to as\n                    “statements”). In his statements, Quek unequivocally admitted to\n                    having possession of the seized drugs, the intent to traffic in them as well as\n                    the requisite knowledge of their specific nature. At the trial, Quek’s\n                    statements were admitted into evidence without any challenge being made by him\n                    as to their voluntariness.[note: 7]Before us, Quek also did not\n                    dispute any of the above-mentioned facts or the Judge’s findings in\n                    relation to his possession of the seized drugs, his knowledge of their specific\n                    nature or his intention to sell them. 13     Somchit’s unchallenged evidence\n                    corroborated the evidence against Quek when she testified that it was Quek who\n                    procured the seized drugs and had directed her to repack them for sale to\n                        customers.[note: 8]Furthermore, Winai had also testified\n                    that Quek had instructed him to deliver the seized “white\n                    substances” to Quek’s customers.[note: 9]",
        "First ground of appeal": "14     Two separate grounds of appeal are raised by\n                    Quek before this Court. First, in the petition of appeal filed by Quek’s\n                    counsel (“Counsel”), he contended that the Judge had erred in law\n                    in proceeding to hear the charge against Quek after he had pleaded guilty to the\n                    amended charge. Quek’s specific complaint was that the Judge had failed to\n                    follow the procedural safeguards set out in ss 139 and 187 of the CPC in\n                    relation to the recording of his plea of guilt (“the plea of guilt\n                        ground”).[note: 10]",
        "The applicable law": "15     The relevant sections of the CPC which Counsel\n                    has relied upon are reproduced below for ease of reference: Committal for trial when\n                            accused wishes to plead guilty 139.    Where an accused\n                            who is brought before an examining Magistrate states that he wishes to\n                            plead guilty to the charge preferred against him, the Magistrate shall\n                            record the facts of the case presented by the prosecution and if the\n                            facts disclose sufficient grounds for committing the accused, he shall\n                            satisfy himself that the accused understands the nature of the charge\n                            and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against\n                            him and, on being so satisfied, shall commit the accused for trial for\n                            the offence. Commencement of\n                            trial 187.    (1) When the court\n                            is ready to commence the trial, the accused shall appear or be brought\n                            before it and the charge shall be read and explained to him and he shall\n                            be asked whether he is guilty of the offence charged or claims to be\n                            tried. (2)    If the accused pleads guilty the pleashallbe recorded, or if he claims to be tried\n                            the court shall – (a)    proceed to try the case; or (b)    if the accused was committed for trial under\n                            section 139, order him to be brought before an examining Magistrate for\n                            a preliminary inquiry. [emphasis added] 16     Pursuant to s 187 of the CPC, where the\n                    accused wishes to plead guilty his plea of guiltshallbe recorded prior to his formal conviction of the charge.\n                    Counsel, while noting that the Judge’s failure to refer to Quek’s\n                    plea of guilt in his grounds of decision (“GD”) was a\n                    “technical” breach of s 187 of the CPC, went on to argue that\n                    this omission by the Judge cast doubt on whether the accused had received a fair\n                    trial in so far as the amended charge was concerned. Further, Counsel\n                    characterised the Judge’s mind when hearing the amended charge, after Quek\n                    had entered his plea of guilt, as being “tainted by a reasonable\n                    suspicion of bias”.[note: 11]With respect, we do\n                    not understand the sense in this argument. First, while the Judge rejected\n                    Quek’s plea of guilt, he proceeded to assess the evidence already adduced\n                    against Quek on the amended charge and having determined that such evidence had\n                    established aprima faciecase against him on the\n                    amended charge, called on Quek to enter his defence by calling such witnesses as\n                    he might wish to do. In these circumstances, we do not see how it could be\n                    validly argued that he did not receive a fair trial on the amended charge.\n                    Secondly, there is no requirement at law that a judge should refer to the\n                    accused’s plea of guilt in his GD. Having said that, the notes of evidence\n                    of the trial had clearly captured Quek’s plea and the Judge’s\n                    rejection of the same. Thirdly, the Judge did not act on his plea of guilt.\n                    Instead, he called on Quek to call such witnesses as he might wish in his\n                    defence. This may explain why the Judge at [50] of his GD stated, though not\n                    entirely accurately, that Quek “claimed trial”. However, we do not\n                    see how this discrepancy is in any way material or sufficient to amount to bias,\n                    either apparent or actual. It was only after Quek decided not to call any\n                    witnesses that the Judge, having assessed the evidence adduced, convicted Quek\n                    of the amended charge. Counsel’s interpretation of the obligations imposed\n                    by ss. 139 and 187 of the CPC failed to have regard to what had in fact\n                    transpired,i.e.the guilty plea was rejected by\n                    the Judge. While we can see some basis for this argument to be advanced in a\n                    case where a judge had acted on the guilty plea (but on which we do not offer a\n                    concluded view), it can have no place where the plea isnotaccepted. While we recognise that the Judge could have, in\n                    his GD, made reference to the guilty plea which he had rejected, non reference\n                    could hardly have given rise to any impropriety or injustice. What the Judge did\n                    was to proceed as if the plea had never been uttered, a course which he was\n                    entitled to take. 17     In this regard, it is also important to note\n                    that theguiding purposeof the requirements in\n                    ss. 139 and 187 of the CPC is the avoidance of any prejudice to the\n                    accused. It is for this reason that the court is required to comply with a\n                    number of safeguards when recording any plea of guilt (seeRajeevanEdakalavan v Public\n                        Prosecution[1998] 1 SLR(R) 10 at [24] and [25]). Counsel did not and, in our view, could not argue that\n                    Quek had suffered any prejudice by the Judge’s decision to reject his plea\n                    and to offer him the opportunity of calling for any additional evidence in\n                    defence to the amended charge. In our opinion, the Judge had followed the spirit\n                    and purpose of the two highlighted sections of the CPC. To our mind, the\n                    approach which the Judge took, following his rejection of the guilty plea, was\n                    clearly prompted by his desire to ensure that Quek received a fair trial.\n                    Accordingly, the first ground of appeal is dismissed as being wholly without\n                    merit.",
        "Second ground of appeal": "18     At the first hearing of this appeal on 18\n                    August 2011, in response to queries from the Bench, Counsel also made arguments\n                    which raised questions as to the propriety of the amended charge on which Quek\n                    was convicted. That was in the light of the fact that Winai’s charge, on\n                    which he had been convicted on, related to “not less than 14.99 grams of\n                    diamorphine” whereas the amended charge against Quek related to\n                    “not less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine”. Counsel also made\n                    further arguments with respect to certain attendant constitutional issues\n                    touching on the principles of equal treatment and protection under the law as\n                    well as the exercise of judicial power. As a result, this Court directed that\n                    further written submissions on those issues be made by the parties. We will\n                    first examine the constitutional issues.",
        "Article 12(1) argument": "19     Counsel argued that the Public\n                    Prosecutor’s actions in charging Winai with possession of not less than\n                    14.99 g of diamorphine while charging Quek with the total seized quantity of not\n                    less than 62.14 g of diamorphine are in breach of Article 12(1) of the\n                    Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the\n                    Constitution”) as both Winai and Quek essentially fell within the same\n                    class of accused persons and shared the same legal guilt, relying here on Lord\n                    Diplock’s speech in the Privy Council decision ofOng\n                        Ah Chuan and another v Public Prosecutor[1979-1980] SLR(R) 710 (“Ong Ah\n                        Chuan”) at [35],\n                        [36] and [39]. Counsel also sought to distinguish the\n                    line of cases followingTeh Cheng Poh v Public\n                        Prosecutor[1979] 1 MLJ 50 (“Teh Cheng Poh”) on the basis that unique to the present\n                    case was the fact that (a) both Winai and Quek were charged for trafficking in\n                    diamorphine and (b) both were in possession of the same amount of diamorphine.\n                    Furthermore, Counsel also took the position that the Court of Criminal Appeal\n                    was wrong inThiruselvams/o\n                        Nagaratnam v Public Prosecutor[2001] 1 SLR(R) 362\n                        (“Thiruselvam”) as it failed to\n                    consider the definition of “class” as elucidated by Lord Diplock\n                    inOng Ah Chuan. 20     Counsel also argued that Winai and Quek fell\n                    within the same legal class for the following reasons:[note: 12] a.    First, [their offences arose] from the same factual\n                            matrix; b.    Second, [the offences relate] to the exact same\n                            amount of drugs trafficked; and c.    Third, [the offences arose] from effectively the\n                            same act/wrongdoing. The argument seemed to flow from the premise that as an\n                    individual’s personal circumstance and moral blameworthiness were not\n                    relevant for determining whether two or more individuals who had committed the\n                    same act fell within the same class,Thiruselvamshould not be followed. In the alternative, Counsel argued thatThiruselvamshould be distinguished from the present\n                    case because Winai and Quek were charged for “essentially the same crime,\n                    a conspiracy to traffic in diamorphine”. In contrast, inThiruselvam, one accused was charged for trafficking and\n                    another for abetment. In essence, Counsel’s point was that:[note: 13] The act of prosecutorial discretion in formulating the artificial charge\n                        so as to discriminate against offenders of the same class violates Article\n                        12 of the Constitution. Analysis of Article 12 21     Art 12(1) of the Constitution states as\n                    follows: 12.—(1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the\n                        equal protection of the law. 22     The issue in the present case is whether Art\n                    12(1) of the Constitution was violated by the Public Prosecutor’s exercise\n                    of prosecutorial discretion in preferring different charges against Quek and\n                    Winai, parties to the same criminal conspiracy. In this regard we must refer to\n                    the recent decision of this Court inRamalingamRavinthran v Attorney-General[2012] SGCA 2 (“Ramalingam v AG”),\n                    which has shed further light on this issue. To better understand the decision inRamalingam v AG, it is necessary for us to\n                    first set out the argument made by the applicant there. Similar to the present\n                    case, there the applicant argued that Art 12(1) of the Constitution was violated\n                    when the Attorney-General, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, charged the\n                    applicant (i.e.in a similar position to Quek)\n                    with a capital charge while the other member of the same criminal enterprise,\n                    one Sundar Arujunan (“Sundar”), was charged with a non-capital\n                    charge. In fact, similar to Winai’s treatment in the present case, Sundar\n                    was charged with trafficking in a reduced quantity of the controlled drugs\n                    found, just below the threshold at which it would attract the mandatory death\n                    penalty on conviction. In the present case, while Quek was charged with\n                    trafficking in all 62.14 g of the seized drugs, Winai was charged only withnot lessthan 14.99 g despite being part of\n                    the same criminal enterprise and underlying agreement. Thus, the position of\n                    Quek is identical to that of the applicant inRamalingam v\n                        AGand Quek has also essentially raised the same constitutional\n                    argument as that was raised by the applicant inRamalingam v\n                        AG, i.e.whether the exercise of prosecutorial discretion which\n                    resulted in differential treatment of two offenders involved in the same\n                    criminal enterprise constituted a breach of Art 12(1) of the\n                    Constitution. 23     InRamalingam v\n                        AG, this Court had discussed many of the cases relied on by\n                    Quek’s Counsel in this appeal. First, the Privy Council decision inOng Ah Chuanwas held to be irrelevant to the\n                    question of constitutionality of the Attorney-General’s exercise of\n                    prosecutorial discretion asOng Ah Chuandealt\n                    with a different question,i.e., the application\n                    of Art 12(1) of the Constitution to legislation (seeRamalingam v AGat [19]-[20] and [40]). The excerpts fromOng Ah Chuanwhich Counsel relied upon were in fact made in the\n                    context of criminal statutes providing for the mandatory death penalty. InRamalingam v AGthis Court pointed out that\n                    the test to be applied to the principle of equality before the law was not the\n                    same when it was being applied in relation to the exercise of prosecutorial\n                    discretion. The distinction has to be drawn because in addition to the legal\n                    guilt of the offender, the Public Prosecutor is obliged to consider a wide range\n                    of factors (seeRamalingam v AGat [63]): [the] moral blameworthiness, the gravity of the harm caused to the public\n                        welfare by his criminal activity, and a myriad of other factors, including\n                        whether there is sufficient evidence against a particular offender, whether\n                        the offender is willing to co-operate with the law enforcement authorities\n                        in providing intelligence, whether one offender is willing to testify\n                        against his co-offenders, and so on – up to and including the\n                        possibility of showing some degree of compassion in certain cases. Accordingly, the appellant’s dogged reliance onOng Ah Chuanas a basis for contending that the exercise\n                    of the Public Prosecutor’s discretion should be restricted to the sole\n                    question of the legal guilt of an offender is both ill founded and patently\n                    incorrect.Teh Cheng Pohand the subsequent line\n                    of cases, includingThiruselvam, were extensively\n                    discussed inRamalingam v AG(see [40] ofRamalingam v\n                        AG). This Court inRamalingam v AGnoted that the circumstances inThiruselvamwere\n                    different from those inTeh Cheng Pohin the sense\n                    that the latter case did not concern the treatment of two offenders but that of\n                    a single offender. Further, inTeh Cheng Poh, the\n                    Public Prosecutor, in exercise of his prosecutorial discretion chose to bring a\n                    charge against the applicant which attracted capital punishment instead of under\n                    a different law where the punishment would have been less severe.\n                    Notwithstanding the identified factual differences betweenThiruselvamandTeh Cheng Poh,\n                    this Court inRamalingam v AGnevertheless held\n                    that Art 12(1) of the Constitution was not infringed if there were grounds\n                    for the Public Prosecutor to bring different charges of unequal gravity against\n                    two or more offenders in the same criminal enterprise. This Court did not think\n                    that the fact that inThiruselvamthe co-offenders\n                    were charged with different offences, one for abetting and the other for\n                    trafficking, constituted a material circumstance to distinguishRamalingam v AGfromThiruselvam. 24     The fact situation in the present case is\n                    similar to that inRamalingam v AG, where both the\n                    accused persons in question were charged with identical offences of drug\n                    trafficking, save for the quantity of drugs involved, resulting in significantly\n                    different consequences as far as the punishment which could be imposed was\n                    concerned. However, the divergent consequences faced by accused persons in the\n                    same criminal enterprise from the prescribed punishments (whether mandatory or\n                    not), flowing from their respective charges by the Public Prosecutor, are notper sesufficient to found a successful Art\n                    12(1) challenge. To the contrary, this divergence in sentence experienced by\n                    accused persons is but a consequence of the broader constitutionally vested\n                    discretion in the Public Prosecutor in preferring charges against accused\n                    persons. Accordingly, applying the principles as elucidated inRamalingam v AG, Quek’s Art 12(1) challenge fails\n                    as the issue isnotwhether the Public Prosecutorcanexercise his discretion to prefer a lower\n                    quantum of the same seized drugs between co-offenders but rather whether this\n                    decision was made for legitimate reasons which,inter\n                        alia, include the considerations outlined above. It is the latter\n                    part of this analysis,i.e.an accused’s\n                    complaint of illegitimate reasons operative on the mind of the Public Prosecutor\n                    in exercise of his discretion which gives rise to the metaphorical key capable\n                    of unlocking a successful Art 12(1) challenge of this nature. 25     At this juncture we would highlight the fact\n                    that unlike inRamalingam v AG, Counsel did not\n                    make any arguments concerning the relative culpability of Winai and Quek which\n                    could have enabled this Court to review the Public Prosecutor’s decision\n                    to treat Quek differently from Winai. In this regard, the following passage inRamalingam v AGis of particular assistance,\n                    at [70]: ... the Applicant must specifically produceprima\n                            facieevidence of bias or the taking into account of\n                        irrelevant considerations by the Attorney-General in differentiating,\n                        pursuant to his prosecutorial discretion, between the charges against the\n                        Applicant and the charges against Sundar. In this regard, the mere\n                        differentiation of charges between co-offenders, even between those of equal\n                        guilt, is not,per se, sufficient to\n                        constitute prima facie evidence of bias or the taking into account of\n                        irrelevant considerations that breaches Art 12(1). Differentiation between\n                        offenders of equal guilt can be legitimately undertaken for many reasons and\n                        based on the consideration of many factors ... It is for the offender who\n                        complains of a breach of Art 12(1) to prove that there are no valid grounds\n                        for such differentiation. In the absence of proof by the offender, the court\n                        should not presume that there are no valid grounds in this regard. As such, we find that Quek has not discharged his burden of\n                    establishing aprima faciecase that the Public\n                    Prosecutor has infringed Art 12(1) of the Constitution in charging him with a\n                    capital charge while sparing Winai of the same. In any event, we find that on\n                    the evidence, Quek was really the brain behind the criminal enterprise and thus\n                    the main culprit. In addition, Winai’s willingness to testify against Quek\n                    and Somchit was a relevant consideration which could have operated on the mind\n                    of the Public Prosecutor in preferring separate charges against Quek and Winai.\n                    Accordingly, the Art 12(1) argument is dismissed.",
        "Article 93 argument": "26     We turn now to the second constitutional issue\n                    and the argument here is that the “selection of punishment for members of\n                    a class of offenders is for the Judiciary by virtue of Article 93 of the\n                        Constitution”.[note: 14]Counsel’s point is that the\n                    Public Prosecutor’s actions in formulating a drug trafficking charge\n                    against Winai, which wasjust underthe amount\n                    necessary to trigger the mandatory death penalty, contravenes the doctrine of\n                    separation of powers and breaches Article 93 of the constitution as it\n                        “[usurps]the\n                        judicial function of sentencing”.[note: 15]Borrowing the language ofOng Ah Chuan, Counsel\n                    took the position that so long as the two accused persons were of the same legal\n                    guilt, the “manipulation” of the quantum of seized drugs in their\n                    respective charges infringed Art 93 of the Constitution. Counsel averred that\n                    the manner in which the Public Prosecutor acted in relation to Winai and Quek\n                    amounted to reserving to itself the ability to determine who should face the\n                    death penalty and who need not, even though both Quek and Winai were\n                    “charged for the same offence”.[note: 16]Counsel seemed to be suggesting\n                    that the decision to charge one offender with a non-capital charge and another\n                    with a capital charge fell within the jurisdiction of the court and that the\n                    Public Prosecutor would be acting unconstitutionally by virtue of Art 93 of the\n                    Constitution if it were to be permitted to “manipulate” the\n                    quantum of seized drugs resulting in a non-capital charge being preferred\n                    against a co-offender. Counsel also argued that this objection would not arise\n                    so long as both co-offenders were charged with separate offences such as\n                    trafficking and abetment, as inThiruselvam. Analysis of the Article 93 argument 27     We would first observe that Counsel’s\n                    complaint against the Public Prosecutor’s exercise of his discretion which\n                    could result in two offenders in the same criminal enterprise being liable for\n                    different sentences could also arise in other situations (i.e.non drug-related) where mandatory penalties are involved.\n                    For example the same objection could be taken when the Public Prosecutor decides\n                    to charge A with murder and B with culpable homicide where both A and B were\n                    part of the same criminal enterprise. If the charge was proven beyond a\n                    reasonable doubt, the court would be compelled to sentence A to the mandatory\n                    death penalty whereas B would only be liable for life imprisonment. Another\n                    instance would be where two persons were acting in concert to damage property.\n                    One could be charged for mischief and the other for vandalism, the latter of\n                    which would attract mandatory caning as the prescribed punishment. Thus, if\n                    Counsel’s submission is valid and ought to be accepted, it would have\n                    implications in relation to all offences which carry mandatory penalties and not\n                    just offences which attract the mandatory death penalty. 28     Counsel’s argument characterising the\n                    Public Prosecutor’s exercise of his discretion in relation to Quek and\n                    Winai as unconstitutional disregards the fact that Art 35(8) of the Constitution\n                    confers upon the Attorney-General, as the Public Prosecutor, a constitutional\n                    power to exercise his discretion in individual cases, which must necessarily\n                    impact the sentencing range available to the court in relation to the particular\n                    charge preferred. In a mandatory penalty scenario, this impact is further\n                    heightened as the court, in sentencing, is not in a position to take into\n                    account the mitigating circumstances. However, the question of usurpation of\n                    judicial power does not arise. It is not the function of the court to prefer\n                    charges against an accused brought before it. The court exercises its judicial\n                    power in relation to the charge or charges brought by the Public Prosecutor\n                    against an accused person. The court may only exercise its power to amend the\n                    charge in the light of the evidence adduced before it. The powers and\n                    jurisdiction of the courts as set out in Art 93 of the Constitution are distinct\n                    and separate from the powers of the Public Prosecutor under Art 35(8) of the\n                    Constitution. 29     In the scheme envisioned under the\n                    Constitution, the judiciary does not possess the power or jurisdiction to\n                    formulate or prefer charges against accused persons; that is the constitutional\n                    provenance of the Attorney-General. As rightly pointed out by the Prosecution,\n                    only when the charge is preferred against the accused can the court exercise its\n                    judicial power over the proceedings. The limitation of the sentencing range or\n                    sentence (in a mandatory penalty scenario) available to the court is a necessary\n                    consequence following the charge preferred. While the court has the power to\n                    review the considerations taken into account by the Public Prosecutor in\n                    preferring the charge, to decide whether or not the evidence adduced by the\n                    Public Prosecutor proves the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and to amend the\n                    charge in light of the evidence before it, it is not for the court to determine\n                    what charge should be preferred against an accused person irrespective of\n                    whether the charge would invoke a mandatory penalty. This principle applies\n                    equally to the situation where multiple parties are involved in a criminal\n                    enterprise. It is the very essence of prosecutorial discretion that due weight\n                    is given to all relevant circumstances or considerations prior to the\n                    formulation of a charge. Arts 93 and 35(8) of the Constitution should be\n                    construed harmoniously, with neither being subordinate to the other.\n                    Counsel’s submission would mean that Art 93 of the Constitution overrides\n                    Art 35(8) of the Constitution. His characterisation of the Public\n                    Prosecutor’s exercise of his discretion as “manipulation”\n                    would appear to stem from his misconception of Art 12(1) of the Constitution\n                    wherein the Public Prosecutor is limited to preferring charges solely on the\n                    basis of legal guilt. This submission has been shown to be incorrect (see[21]-[25]above). 30     For completeness, we will briefly comment on\n                    the Privy Council decision inMohammed Muktar Ali & Anor\n                        v The Queen[1992] 2 AC 93 (“Muktar\n                        Ali”) which is relied upon by Counsel. InMuktar Ali, the court was concerned with the question of\n                    whether a provision in the Mauritius Dangerous Drugs Act 1986 which conferred on\n                    the Director of Public Prosecutions the discretion to determine the court which\n                    a drug importer should be tried, infringed the principle of separation of\n                    powers. There, if the court selected by the Director of Public Prosecutions was\n                    the Supreme Court and if the offender was found to be guilty of drug trafficking\n                    he would be sentenced to death. Contrarily, if he was tried in an Intermediate\n                    or District Court, the offender would be sentenced to a fine and a term of penal\n                    servitude. The Privy Council found that since the discretion to select the court\n                    enabled the Director of Public Prosecutions to, in effect, select the penalty to\n                    be imposed, the relevant provision of the Mauritius Dangerous Drugs Act 1986 was\n                    unconstitutional. 31     Similar to the discussion inOng Ah Chuan, it would be noted thatMuktar Aliconcerned an ordinary legislative provision rather\n                    than the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, a power conferred and governed by\n                    the Constitution itself, which is the issue in the present appeal. In fact, as\n                    pointed out by the Prosecution, Lord Keith of Kinkel expressly stated at pp\n                    103-104 ofMuktar Alithat the case was concerned\n                    with the particular legislative provision’s impact on the court before\n                    which a person was tried. His Lordship clearly articulated at p 104 ofMuktar Alithat“[i]n general, there is no\n                    objection of a constitutional or other nature to a prosecuting authority having\n                    discretion of that nature”. In fact, the Privy Council expressly stated\n                    that the prosecuting authority’s discretion to prefer a more serious\n                    charge rather than a less serious one against an accused would not give rise to\n                    any constitutional objection. Counsel’s reliance on this case was\n                    accordingly misplaced. In the present case, it is the Prosecutor’s\n                    discretion which Counsel seeks to challenge, a discretion conferred under the\n                    Constitution. The situation here is completely different from that inMuktar Ali. The Public Prosecutor’s decision to\n                    prefer separate charges on members of the same criminal enterprise does not\n                    interfere with the court’s judicial power. Accordingly, Quek’s\n                    second ground of appeal is dismissed.",
        "The use of criminal conspiracy in Quek’s amended\n                charge": "32     Having disposed of the two constitutional\n                    issues, what remains to be addressed is the issue of the propriety of the\n                    amended charge on which Quek was convicted. This issue may, in turn, involve the\n                    consideration of the following two sub-issues: (a)     Whether Quek and Winai could be said\n                        to be parties to the same criminal conspiracy to traffic diamorphine despite\n                        being separately charged for different quantities of the same parcel of\n                        seized drugs found in their possession; and (b)     If not, whether this Court should exercise its\n                        discretion to amend the charge on which Quek was convicted and to offer him\n                        an opportunity to plead thereto. 33     As a starting point it bears noting that, like\n                    abetment and attempt, criminal conspiracy is defined as an incomplete or\n                    inchoate crime in ss 120A and 120B of the PC as follows: Definition of criminal\n                            conspiracy 120A.—(1) When 2 or more persons\n                        agree to do, or cause to be done — (a)    an illegal act; or (b)    an act, which is not illegal, by illegal means,\n                            such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy: Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall\n                        amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is\n                        done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof. (2)    A person may be a party to a criminal conspiracy\n                            notwithstanding the existence of facts of which he is unaware which make\n                            the commission of the illegal act, or the act, which is not illegal, by\n                            illegal means, impossible. Punishment of criminal\n                            conspiracy 120B.    Whoever is a party\n                            to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence shall, where no express\n                            provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy,\n                            be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such\n                        offence. 34     It is trite law that a charge of criminal\n                    conspiracy requirestwo or more personsin\n                    agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act (or an act, which is not\n                    illegal, by illegal means) which in the present case is the trafficking of 62.14\n                    g of diamorphine. As such, a finding of the existence of a co-conspirator, in\n                    the present case Winai, is necessary in order for this Court to uphold\n                    Quek’s conviction under the amended charge. In this regard, two questions\n                    arise: (a)     Whether the evidence before this\n                        Court supports a finding that there was an underlying agreement between\n                        Winai and Quek to traffic the seized drugs; and (b)     If so, notwithstanding the Court’s\n                        satisfaction with the evidence in relation to the underlying agreement,\n                        whether the difference in the precise quantity of the seized drugs in Quek\n                        and Winai’s respective chargesper se,\n                        undermines a positive finding of criminal conspiracy? The existence of an underlying agreement between Quek and Winai to\n                traffic the seized drugs 35     The critical question is whether there was\n                    indeed an agreement between Winai and Quek to traffic in 62.14 g of the\n                    diamorphine found. On this question, the statement of facts to which Winai\n                    pleaded guilty to under the separate charge brought against him (i.e. Winai’s charge above at[4]), for a lesser quantum of not less than 14.99 g\n                    of the seized drugs, states as follows (“Winai’s\n                        SOF”):[note: 17] At all material times, Quek, Somchit and Winai had agreed to perform\n                        specific tasks in the process of procuring, packaging and delivering\n                        diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. Pursuant to this agreement,\n                        Somchit was in possession of 62.14 grams of diamorphine at the unit of 3\n                        October 2008 for the purpose of trafficking, which is an offence under\n                        Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Act. 36     Winai’s SOF also details the various\n                    packets of controlled substance found and the HSA analysis of the seized drugs\n                    which established that a total of 62.14 g of diamorphine was found at the\n                    Aquarius apartment. By admitting to the SOF, and by pleading guilty to the\n                    separate charge brought against him, Winai admitted to having the knowledge and\n                    the intention to traffic in the total quantum of the seized drugs. The evidence\n                    adduced at the trial against Quek also amply demonstrated that such an\n                    underlying agreement existed between Quek and Winai. It also bears noting that\n                    at his appeal, Counsel did not canvas the argument that there was any deficiency\n                    in the evidence supporting the existence of an agreement between Winai and Quek\n                    to traffic in the total quantity of the seized drugs. Indeed, we do not see how\n                    he could as the evidence overwhelmingly shows that Quek and Winai had agreed to\n                    traffic in the total quantity of the seized drugs. The issue of congruity arising from Quek and Winai’s respective\n                charges 37     On the present facts, the incongruity in the\n                    charges faced by Quek and Winai does not impact their underlying agreement to\n                    traffic in the 62.14 g of diamorphine. This is for the simple reason that\n                    Winai’s charge specifying a lower quantum of diamorphine merely reflects\n                    the Public Prosecutor’s discretion to prefer a less serious charge, and we\n                    do not see how that could have any impact on or affect the primary factual\n                    question, namely, the existence of an agreement between Quek and Winai to\n                    traffic in the full 62.14 g of diamorphine. As noted above at[35]-[36],\n                    substantial evidence was adduced before this Court in satisfaction of this\n                    crucial question. In this regard, the following statement in Stanley Yeo, Neil\n                    Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong,Criminal Law in Malaysia and\n                        Singapore(LexisNexis, 2ndEd, 2012)\n                    at p 918, discussing the burden of proof on the Public Prosecutor setting out to\n                    establish criminal conspiracy, is germane: [34.54] … It is also sufficient for the prosecution to prove that\n                        there are two or more persons guilty of conspiracy even though the other\n                        person involvedmay still be at large, dead, unknown, or\n                            for some reason acquitted on a technical ground. However, a\n                        conviction for criminal conspiracy is improper if it is inconsistent with\n                        the acquittal of the other alleged co-conspirator such as absence of proof\n                        of an agreement between the parties. [emphasis added] 38     InPradumnaShriniwasAuradkar v State of Maharashtra1981 Cri. L. J. 1873, the\n                    applicant, A, argued that he could not be convicted of criminal conspiracy as\n                    his only co-conspirator, B, was acquitted of the same offence. In dismissing the\n                    appeal, similar to the present case, the court held at [11] that the conspiracy had been clearly\n                    established on the facts and as the acquittal of B was on a purely technical\n                    ground, the appellant could not be exonerated in the circumstances. The court\n                    also held that to prove criminal conspiracy, it was unnecessary that the\n                    co-conspirator be tried and/ or convicted. Crucially, as no authority had been\n                    presented to suggest that A should be acquittedipso\n                        facto, following from B’s acquittal, his conviction could\n                    not be challenged. As such, the acquittal of Bper\n                        sedid not affect A’s conviction under the criminal\n                    conspiracy charge. One must however note that it is thereasonsupporting the acquittal of a co-accused that the court\n                    must pay attention to. 39     In the House of Lords decision inDirector of Public Prosecutions v Shannon[1975] AC 717,\n                    a similar issue was canvassed wherein the conviction of the accused person was\n                    challenged on the basis that his co-conspirator had been acquitted. The\n                    appellant argued that at least two persons must be proved to be guilty of the\n                    same criminal conspiracy before anyone could be convicted of the same. The\n                    argument that “if A and B alone were indicted together and ‘tried\n                    together’ for conspiracy ... that ‘both must be convicted or both\n                    must be acquitted’” was considered by their Lordships at 722. The\n                    court opined as follows at 745 and 754: So the question arises whether if A and B (but no others) are charged with\n                        conspiracy and if A, with full intention, pleads guilty and if B pleads not\n                        guilty and if B’s trial is postponed, but, taking place at some\n                        subsequent time, results in his acquittal, the law requires the conviction\n                        of A (on his own confession) must be set aside. If it must, the law will be\n                        producing a strange result. No one could know better than A whether he did\n                        or did not agree with B to do something wrongful and if, fully understanding\n                        what he was doing, and having skilled advice to guide or assist him, he\n                        acknowledged by way of confession to the court that he had so agreed, the\n                        law might seem to be artificial and contrariwise which required that because\n                        the charge against B failed A must be held to be not guilty when he himself\n                        knew and had admitted that he was guilty. … … [W]here there is a charge of conspiracy against A and B (the\n                        charge not alleging any conspiracy with anyone else) and where A is first\n                        separately tried and pleads or is found guilty and where B is later\n                        separately tried and acquitted,such acquittal does not\n                            of itself warrant setting aside the conviction of A… [emphasis added] 40     Thus the point is that where sufficient\n                    evidence can be adduced to prove the underlying agreement between the\n                    co-conspirators beyond a reasonable doubt, the outcomeper\n                        seof the proceedings of a co-conspirator, or the death or\n                    disappearance of the co-conspirator is notipso\n                        factoa reason to set aside the conviction or amend the charge\n                    preferred against the other co-conspirator. In the present case, the Public\n                    Prosecutor’s decision to prefer charges against Quek and Winai involving\n                    different quantities of the seized drugs does not undermine the fact that there\n                    was a conspiracy between them to traffic in the total seized quantity. The\n                    situation that results is in fact not dissimilar from the situation where a\n                    co-conspirator has either been acquitted or has disappeared. It bears\n                    emphasising that the evidence adduced establishing the underlying agreement\n                    between the respective co-conspirators remains undisturbed. Indeed, in contrast\n                    to a situation involving the acquittal of a co-conspirator, both Quek and Winai\n                    were in fact convicted in the present case; the difference in punishments\n                    arising solely from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, a discretion\n                    accorded to the Public Prosecutor under the Constitution. Furthermore, we also\n                    think that Winai’s separate charge for possession ofnot lessthan 14.99 g of diamorphine in furtherance of a\n                    criminal conspiracy with Somchit and Quek to traffic in the stated quantity of\n                    the seized drugs, is not, on a plain reading, incongruous with the amended\n                    charge on which Quek was convicted as “not less than 14.99 g”\n                    could include 62.14 g. We would reiterate that in Winai’s SOF upon which\n                    he was convicted on the reduced quantity, thefull\n                        weightof the seized drugs discovered was clearly\n                stated. 41     Since this Court is not confronted with the\n                    slightly different scenario whereby Winai lacked the requisite knowledge of the\n                    full quantity of the seized drugs forming the basis of the criminal conspiracy\n                    alleged, whether the answer to the question of congruity in that scenario might\n                    be different is a question on which there is no necessity for us to offer a\n                    concluded view. There is however authority for the proposition that it is not\n                    necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of the\n                    conspiracy as long as they are co-participators in the main object of the\n                    conspiracy – seeYash Pal Mittal v State of\n                        Punjab(1977) 4 SCC 540 at [9] andNomura Taijiand others v Public Prosecutor[1998] 1 SLR(R) 259 at\n                    [110]. The question which must follow and remains unanswered is (a) whether\n                    knowledge of the precisequantityof the\n                    controlled drugs specified in the charges preferred against co-conspirators can\n                    be characterised as a meredetailas outlined by\n                    the case law cited above or (b) whether it should more rightly be viewed as an\n                    integralelement of the underlying agreementas\n                    part of the main object of the criminal conspiracy. While on the first\n                    proposition, (a), the quantityper seis not a\n                    factor which each co-conspirator need be alive to, on the second proposition,\n                    (b), the Public Prosecutor’s ability to establish the individual’s\n                    actual knowledge of the specific quantity of the controlled drugs in the\n                    preferred charge will directly impact the fundamental enquiry before the court\n                    as to whether criminal conspiracy has been made out. 42     On the present facts, in light of this\n                    Court’s finding on the knowledge of Quek and Winai of the total quantity\n                    of the seized drugs, these questions did not arise. In passing, we would venture\n                    to think that there is much to be said in favour of the first proposition. This\n                    is perhaps best illustrated by an example. Say A and B agreed to bring 14 g of\n                    diamorphine into Singapore. Unknown to B, and motivated by greed, A changed his\n                    mind and brought in double the quantity. It would be curious to say that in\n                    those circumstances, just because of the change in quantum of drug brought in,\n                    that there was no conspiracy by them to bring in the drug illegally. Quite\n                    clearly, there was a conspiracy by A and B to commit an illegal act (i.e.to import 14 g of the drug) although B cannot be\n                    said to have conspired with A to import the larger quantity of the drug. On the\n                    other hand, if A and B had agreed to import the drug illegally without\n                    discussion as to the quantity, both could be charged with conspiracy to import\n                    the quantity of the drug actually brought in by either of them. Ultimately, what\n                    conspiracy charge(s) could be brought against co-conspirators must be dictated\n                    by the evidence. 43     Accordingly, we hold that there is nothing\n                    irregular in Quek being convicted on the amended charge. 44     For the reasons stated above, Quek’s\n                    appeal is dismissed.
