        "Background facts": "2. The appellant, Mdm Lim Choon Lai (‘Mdm Lim’) and the\n\nrespondent, Mr Chew Kim Heng (‘Mr Chew’) had had a long marriage of about 30\n\nyears. Unfortunately, their marriage was dissolved on 20 April 1999 on Mdm Lim’s\n\npetition and Mr Chew’s cross-petition on the ground that the marriage had\n\nirretrievably broken down.3. The parties had had a long relationship even before their marriage.\n\nThey first started living together as from December 1962, when Mdm Lim was still a\n\nstudent. She went on to pursue her university education and graduated in 1968. They\n\neventually got married in 1970. At the time of their marriage, both were employed in the\n\nGovernment service, Mr Chew as a clerk and Mdm Lim as a school teacher. He had been\n\nworking as a clerk since 1958 and retired on 1 May 1998. She, on the other hand, started\n\nwork in 1968 and continues to be so employed today. The parties have a daughter and a son\n\nfrom the marriage, and both of them are over 21 years old.4. With regard to the parties’ housing arrangements during the 38\n\nyears that they were together, they first stayed at Mr Chew’s family home for the\n\nperiod from 1963 to 1970. In 1972, they rented a place at 9A Clover Avenue. Soon\n\nthereafter and in the same year, they rented a flat at Block 60, Commonwealth Drive from\n\nthe Housing and Development Board (‘HDB’). They stayed there until they bought\n\ntheir own flat in 1974. The new flat was at Block 8, Holland Avenue (‘the Holland\n\nAvenue flat’), and it was purchased in their joint names from the HDB in early 1974\n\nfor $15,500. The downpayment and monthly instalments were paid for out of Mdm Lim’s\n\nCentral Provident Fund (‘CPF’), while Mr Chew paid for the furnishings and\n\nrenovations and was responsible for the other household expenses. The Holland Avenue flat\n\nwas later sold in November 1979 for $30,273, and they purchased the present matrimonial\n\nproperty, 83 Namly Avenue, Singapore (‘83 Namly Avenue’), which is a two-storey\n\nsemi-detached house. The total purchase price of the house, including renovations and\n\nother expenses, amounted to $229,000. A government loan of $90,000 was taken to finance\n\nthe purchase of the house, while the remaining sum of $139,000 was paid for directly by\n\nthe parties.",
        "Proceedings below": "5. With respect to the ancillary matters in the divorce proceedings\n\nbefore the District Court, the only contentious issue was the division of the matrimonial\n\nproperty, 83 Namly Avenue. The district judge made the following orders on 19 July 2000:(i) That the matrimonial property known as 83 Namly Avenue, Singapore,\n\n  be sold in the open market within six months from the date of this order and the proceeds\n\n  of sale, less the expenses connected with the sale, be divided equally between the\n\n  parties.(ii) That the wife be given the first option, to be exercised within\n\n  one month, to purchase the husband’s share.(iii) No order as to maintenance.(iv) No order as to costs.6. Mdm Lim appealed only against the order relating to the division of\n\nthe matrimonial property. The High Court dismissed her appeal and she appealed to this\n\nCourt.",
        "The appeal": "7. The starting point in our consideration of this appeal is s 112 of\n\nthe Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 ed). Sub-section (1) thereof confers on the court\n\nthe power to order a division of matrimonial assets, and it provides:(1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the\n\n  grant of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the\n\n  division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and\n\n  the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such\n\n  proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.Sub-section (2) of s 112 goes on to provide that the court, in deciding\n\non the question of division, must ‘have regard to all the circumstances of the\n\ncase’ and in particular, a number of matters there enumerated. It would be helpful to\n\nset out, in so far as material, these provisions which are as follows:(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise\n\n  its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the\n\n  circumstances of the case, including the following matters:(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money,\n\n    property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party\n\n    for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;(c) …..(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare\n\n    of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or\n\n    infirm relative or dependant of either party;(e) …..(f) …..(g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party\n\n    (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which\n\n    aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and(h) …..8. The central issue in this appeal was whether the division of the\n\nmatrimonial property, 83 Namly Avenue, between the parties was in a proportion which was\n\n‘just and equitable’. The approach to be taken in determining what is a\n\n‘just and equitable’ division of matrimonial assets has been considered in a\n\nnumber of High Court decisions. InSoh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock(DCA 5017/97, 19\n\nJune 1998, unreported), Warren Khoo J advocated the use of a presumption of equal\n\ncontribution as the starting point. He held, at  4, 9 & 10:4. Division of matrimonial assets is not a science. It is a judicial\n\n  attempt to divide what was never intended to be divided in the first place. The\n\n  legislature and the courts have formulated general guidelines, but it is possible for two\n\n  judges each doing his or her honest best to come to two significantly different results.…9. There is a touch of artificiality in such cases to use as the\n\n  starting point in a division of the matrimonial assets the amount of money each party has\n\n  contributed directly towards the acquisition of the home. This ignores the indirect\n\n  contributions, monetary and otherwise, most of which are incapable of any meaningful\n\n  ascertainment either because no record was kept or because the nature of the contribution\n\n  is irreducible into monetary terms. It is closer to reality to use as the starting point\n\n  the assumption that both parties have contributed jointly and equally throughout the\n\n  marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family home. An account can\n\n  then be taken of other factors to tilt the balance one way or the other. It is more a\n\n  qualitative than a quantitative exercise.10. Working out the exact amounts of direct monetary contribution would\n\n  be worthwhile only in a case, e.g. of a couple who has been married for a short time, with\n\n  no children, each with independent means and who have not shared a household and its\n\n  myriad responsibilities. It is hardly worthwhile in the vast majority of cases that come\n\n  through the divorce courts. It also sometimes adds to the acrimony in ancillary\n\n  proceedings, not to say anything about the costs of them.9. In that case, the marriage lasted for about 28 years, and throughout\n\nthe marriage the wife played a large role in maintaining the family. She even paid the\n\ndebts of the husband. In terms of the financial contributions made to the purchase of the\n\nmatrimonial flat, the wife contributed 34%, while the husband paid the balance of 66%.\n\nAfter taking into account the significant indirect contributions made by the wife, the\n\ndistrict court awarded the wife a 63% share in the flat. The husband appealed and his\n\nappeal was dismissed by Warren Khoo J.10. InLouis Pius Gilbert v Louis Anne Lise[2000] 1 SLR 274,\n\nparties were married on 11 July 1980 and their marriage lasted for about 18 years. The\n\nmatrimonial assets for division between them comprised mainly a HDB flat and the\n\nhusband’s CPF savings. The wife’s contributions were, for the most part,\n\nindirect and the district judge awarded her 35% of the value of the assets. In upholding\n\nthe district judge’s decision, Goh Joon Seng J endorsed the approach taken by Warren\n\nKhoo J inSoh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock, and held that the district judge’s\n\ndecision was not shown to be so out of line as to be perverse or that it was clearly wrong\n\non principle.11. A slightly different approach was, however, taken inLau Loon\n\nSeng v Sia Peck Eng[1999] 4 SLR 409, where the High Court was again dealing with a\n\nlong marriage – a marriage of about 41 years. The wife was a housewife, who looked\n\nafter the family and also helped the husband in his business. The district court gave the\n\nwife a 50% share in the matrimonial assets, but on appeal, the High Court varied the order\n\nand reduced the wife’s entitlement to only 30%. Kan Ting Chiu J held that the\n\ndistrict judge had placed a greater value on the wife’s input than she had done so\n\nherself. He referred to what he considered the genesis of s 112 of the Women’s\n\nCharter, which replaced the previous s 106, and held that the principle of equal division\n\nwas not preserved in the ‘just and equitable’ formulation, and what was just and\n\nequitable must be decided on the facts of each case. The case ofSoh Chan Soon v Tan\n\nChoon Yock, however,was not cited to the judge and was therefore not\n\nconsidered.12. There are two further High Court decisions on the division of\n\nmatrimonial assets, both of which were decided by Judith Prakash J. In the first case,Yow\n\nMee Lan v Chen Kai Buan[2000] 4 SLR 466, the parties were married for 26 years and\n\nhad three children from ages 12 to 24. The wife played a supporting role in the family\n\nbusiness but made less financial contributions than the husband. However, she was the main\n\ncaregiver of the children and she looked after the family. The district judge awarded the\n\nwife 50% of the matrimonial home, 40% of the husband’s Singapore assets, and 30% of\n\nhis foreign assets. Both parties appealed against this decision. Judith Prakash J held\n\nthat the wife should be given 50% of all the assets. In discussing the principles\n\napplicable to the question of division of matrimonial assets, she disagreed with the\n\napproach taken inSoh Chan Soonthat the starting point is the assumption that both\n\nparties have contributed jointly and equally throughout the marriage to the matrimonial\n\nassets. She felt that such an approach placed too much emphasis on financial contributions\n\ntowards the acquisition of matrimonial assets and gave too little weight to other\n\ncontributions made to the marriage. She was of the view that the court should instead\n\nfirst determine the facts of any particular case, consider which of the factors set out in\n\ns 112(2) of Women’s Charter are applicable on those facts, and thereafter decide, on\n\nthat basis, what would amount to an equitable division. She said at32 – 33:32. … The court’s task in each case now is to consider the\n\n  marriage before it as a whole and particularly the role played by each of the parties in\n\n  the physical and emotional care of the family and in their financial dealings, in order to\n\n  arrive, to the best of its ability, at a fair division of the assets. In doing this, the\n\n  court will of course have regard to the various factors laid down both in s 112(2) and in\n\n  s 114 but will not be bound to give pre-eminence to any of those factors in the way it\n\n  used to have to do under s 106(4). Thus, a party’s financial contributions to the\n\n  acquisition of any particular matrimonial asset can no longer be principally determinative\n\n  of how it is divided and the court is free to give as much weight or more to other,\n\n  non-financial, factors.33. Given that the court’s prime function is to make an equitable\n\n  distribution of matrimonial assets in the light of all the circumstances, it cannot carry\n\n  out this function properly if it operates on assumptions. In my view, the correct approach\n\n  would be to first determine the facts of any particular case, consider which of the\n\n  factors set out in s 112(2) are applicable on those facts and thereafter decide what on\n\n  that basis would amount to an equitable division. In this regard, I must respectfully\n\n  disagree with the approach postulated inSoh Chan Soon’s case that the\n\n  starting point is the assumption that both parties have contributed jointly and equally\n\n  throughout the marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family home (an\n\n  assumption which in this case the court below applied equally to all other matrimonial\n\n  assets) and thereafter take account of the other factors mentioned in s 112(2) to tilt the\n\n  balance between them.In particular, Prakash J emphasised that a party’s financial\n\ncontributions to the acquisition of any particular matrimonial asset cannot be principally\n\ndeterminative of how it is divided and just as much weight or more can be given to other\n\nnon-financial factors. She held, at  43:… marriage is not a business where, generally, parties receive an\n\n  economic reward commensurate with their economic input. It is a union in which the husband\n\n  and wife work together for their common good and the good of their children. Each of them\n\n  uses (or should use) his or her abilities and efforts for the welfare of the family and\n\n  contributes whatever he or she is able to. The partners often have unequal abilities\n\n  whether as parents or as income earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and\n\n  talent should not result in unequal rewards where the contributions are made consistently\n\n  and over a long period of time.13. In the second case ofNeil John Ryan v Rosaline Berger[2001] 1 SLR 419, Prakash J reiterated her view that a just and equitable division should not be\n\nequated with an equal division, although she did conclude that in that particular case, an\n\nequal division was just and equitable. She said at32:32. Having considered the submissions and the facts, I concur with the\n\n  judge’s conclusion that in this case the just and equitable division of the\n\n  matrimonial assets was an equal one. I do not think that the judge did equate a just and\n\n  equitable division with an equal division. I agree with the submission that the two are\n\n  not the same because just and equitable has to be determined on the basis of the facts\n\n  before the Court in any proceeding and whilst in one situation it might be just and\n\n  equitable to divide assets equally between the parties, in another situation such a\n\n  decision might very well wreak injustice.Later in relation to the facts of the case, she said at34:34. In this particular case, therefore, on the basis of the factors\n\n  cited by the judge, viz the length of the marriage, the parties’ joint involvement in\n\n  the family business up to 1990, the wife’s contributions in the domestic sphere and\n\n  as a mother thereafter and the wife’s efforts to maintain or improve the value of the\n\n  family’s assets by property investment vis--vis the husband’s role in running\n\n  the main income producing asset ie the company after 1990, it was just and it was\n\n  equitable to order an equal division of all matrimonial assets.14. In our respectful view, the approach adopted by Judith Prakash J inYow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan[2000] 4 SLR 466is correct. In determining a\n\n‘just and equitable’ division of matrimonial assets under s 112(1) of the\n\nWomen’s Charter, the court must, as directed by s 112(2), have regard to all the\n\nrelevant circumstances of the case at hand, and in particular the matters enumerated in\n\nthat sub-section, in so far as they are applicable, and on that basis determine what a\n\n‘just and equitable’, division should be. The matters enumerated there comprise\n\nboth financial and non-financial contributions made by the parties. Where financial\n\ncontributions are concerned, the court must, of course, take into account the sums\n\ncontributed by each party; these are the matters specifically mentioned in paragraphs (a)\n\nand (b) of s 112(2). However, this does not mean that the court should engage in a\n\nmeticulous investigation and take an account of every minute sum each party has paid or\n\nincurred in the acquisition of the matrimonial assets and/or discharge of any obligation\n\nfor the benefit of any member of the family, and then make exact calculations of each\n\nparty’s contributions. The court must necessarily take a broader view than that. As\n\nfor the non-financial contributions, they also play an important role, and depending on\n\nthe circumstances of the case, they can be just as important. At the end of the day,\n\ntaking into account both the financial and non-financial contributions, the court would\n\nadopt a broad-brush approach to the issue and make a determination on the basis of what\n\nthe court considers as a ‘just and equitable’ division.15. It is true that a division of matrimonial assets under s 112(1) of\n\nthe Act is not an exact science, and that each judge would have his own view in a\n\nparticular case as to what is a just and equitable division. It all depends on the facts\n\nof the case before him. That is what is directed by that section. Bearing in mind what the\n\nsection directs, the judge in any particular case is doing the best he can in making a\n\ndivision of the assets between the husband and wife. Such an exercise, in principle, is\n\nanalogous to that of assessment of damages or losses, which a judge does frequently.\n\nHaving regard to what the court is statutorily directed to do, we do not think, with\n\nrespect, that it is correct to say that ‘it is closer to reality to use as the\n\nstarting point the assumption that both husband and wife have contributed jointly and\n\nequally throughout the marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family\n\nhome’, whether the marriage be a long or a short one. The proper approach should be\n\nto have regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular those set out in s\n\n112(2) and make a division on the basis of what the court considers is a ‘just and\n\nequitable’ division between the parties.",
        "Direct contributions": "16. We now turn to the facts in this case. It was undisputed that the\n\npurchase price of 83 Namly Avenue was $229,000 and that a loan of $90,000 was taken to\n\nfinance the purchase, which was to be repaid over 18 years with each party making equal\n\ncontributions of $316.50 per month. The loan had since been fully repaid and there was no\n\noutstanding mortgage over the property. What was really in contention between the parties\n\nbefore us and also below was the extent of each party’s contributions to the balance\n\nsum of $139,000.17. Mr Chew claimed that he paid $125,000 as direct financial\n\ncontributions to the purchase price of 83 Namly Avenue. A sum of $100,000 was his savings\n\nfrom his salary earned during the period from 1958 to 1979, $16,054 from his MPF benefits\n\nand $9,000 from his share of the compensation paid by the government for the acquisition\n\nof his family home at Lorong Tamok. Mdm Lim conceded that he paid only the sum of $22,768\n\naltogether: being $16,054 from his MPF and $6,714 from the government compensation, but\n\ndisputed that he paid the $100,000 from his alleged accumulated savings. It seemed to us\n\nthat Mr Chew’s claim on the amount of his salary savings was exaggerated. His income\n\nfor the 10-year period from 1970 to 1979 was only about $68,000. Having regard to the kind\n\nof job in which he was employed, he could not have earned more than that amount for the\n\nearlier 10-year period from 1958 to 1969. On that basis, his income would be about\n\n$136,000 or less for the period of 20 years from 1958 to 1979. In order to have\n\naccumulated savings of $100,000 over that same period, Mr Chew would have had to spend\n\nless than $36,000 in the 20 years, which would be less than $150 per month. This was\n\nhighly improbable when he also claimed to have helped out with the household expenses,\n\npaying for the taxes and other charges.18. Mdm Lim, on the other hand, claimed that she paid $107,047 as her\n\ndirect contribution for the purchase of 83 Namly Avenue. This was made up of $76,774 from\n\nher accumulated savings from her salary and other sources of income, and $30,273 from the\n\nsale proceeds of the Holland Avenue flat. Mdm Lim said that during the 10-year period from\n\n1970 to 1980, her total income was $116,885, which was almost double that of Mr Chew for\n\nthe same period. It was therefore submitted that she must have made more contributions to\n\nthe purchase price. In our view, her claim was similarly inflated. Firstly, the actual\n\nnett proceeds arising from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat was only $6,995 and not\n\n$30,273, and of this $6,995, half belonged to Mr Chew. Having regard to this, if she\n\ncontributed the sum of $107,047, it could only have come from her savings, which would not\n\nhave been possible with her level of income at that time, especially if her assertion that\n\nshe had paid for most of the household expenses was to be believed.19. The district judge found that both parties were not able to\n\nsubstantiate their respective claims and that they each exaggerated the extent of their\n\nown contributions. The district judge accepted that Mr Chew had contributed $22,768, as\n\nconceded by Mdm Lim. She found that $6,995 came from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat.\n\nIn her view, Mdm Lim should not be given the sole credit for this sum of $6,995, even\n\nthough she had used her CPF monies to pay for the flat, as credit had to be given to Mr\n\nChew’s contributions towards the renovations and household expenses. The district\n\njudge felt that it would be futile to go into a minute examination of each party’s\n\nexact contributions, especially since the sale of the Holland Avenue flat took place 20\n\nyears ago, and she thus concluded that they should be entitled to the profit from the sale\n\nof the flat in equal shares, i.e. each being entitled to $3,497.50.20. On the basis that Mr Chew had contributed $22,768 and that $6,995\n\nhad come from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat, the district judge held that only the\n\npayment for the balance of $109,237 was in dispute. In the face of conflicting evidence\n\nfrom both parties, she did not make a finding as to how much each party paid exactly. She\n\ntook into account the fact that Mr Chew had started working 10 years earlier than Mdm Lim\n\nand would have accumulated more savings even though Mdm Lim was earning a higher salary\n\nthan he was. She found that, at best, each had contributed equally from their savings. On\n\nthis basis, she held that with regard to the purchase of 83 Namly Avenue, Mr Chew’s\n\ndirect financial contribution was 58% while Mdm Lim’s was 42%. On appeal, the High\n\nCourt upheld the district judge’s assessment but noted that the correct calculations\n\nof the percentage contributions should instead be 55% and 45% respectively.21. We were in agreement with the district judge’s decision that\n\nthe nett proceeds from the sale of the Holland Avenue flat should be split equally between\n\nthe parties. Although the flat was substantially paid for from monies from Mdm Lim’s\n\nCPF account, all those monies, presumably with interest, had been refunded to her CPF\n\naccount upon the sale of the flat. Having had the benefit of this repayment, it follows\n\nthat she should not be entitled to the whole of the nett proceeds of sale. Further, it\n\nappeared that Mr Chew had also made financial contributions by paying for the furnishings\n\nand renovations and various household expenses. This was admitted by Mdm Lim.22. We now turn to the balance of $109,237, which was in dispute. The\n\nevidence from the respective parties was conflicting and neither of them was able to prove\n\nwhat were his or her exact contributions. It was not in dispute that in the relevant\n\n10-year period from 1970 to 1980, Mdm Lim earned almost twice the amount earned by Mr\n\nChew. From that alone, it seemed that she was in a much better financial position than Mr\n\nChew and probably had made larger contributions towards the purchase price. The district\n\njudge was of the view that Mdm Lim’s higher earning power was counter-balanced by the\n\nfact that Mr Chew had been working for 10 years more than Mdm Lim and would have had more\n\nsavings than Mdm Lim by 1979. We had grave doubts on this evaluation. We did not think\n\nthat Mr Chew would necessarily have had more savings at the end of the period simply\n\nbecause he had a head-start over Mdm Lim, since his earnings then were rather low and,\n\nmore likely than not, he would have spent most or all of it on the family. It seemed to us\n\nthat the higher earnings of Mdm Lim during the relevant period would probably result in\n\nhigher contributions by her which would offset the $22,768 as the contribution of Mr Chew.\n\nBearing in mind the absence of reliable evidence on the exact monetary contributions made\n\nby each party with regard to the purchase, which took place more than 20 years ago, we\n\nthink that a fairer view would be that the parties made substantially equal contributions\n\ntowards the purchase of 83 Namly Avenue.",
        "Other financial and non-financial contributions": "23. Mdm Lim claimed that throughout the 30-year marriage, she was the\n\none who shouldered the bulk of the household expenses, did most of the housework and\n\nlooked after the welfare of the family. She highlighted repeatedly the fact that her\n\nearnings over that period were significantly higher than Mr Chew’s and that she was\n\nthe one who was able to provide the family with a comfortable living by paying for their\n\noverseas holidays, purchases of cars and branded goods. By contrast, Mr Chew’s meagre\n\nincome was not sufficient for him to provide much for the family at all.24. Mr Chew did not deny that he earned considerably less than Mdm Lim.\n\nIn fact, he said that it was precisely because they both recognised that Mdm Lim would\n\nhave better career prospects that they agreed upon the arrangement, whereby she would\n\nfocus on her career development, while he would be mainly responsible for the family. Mr\n\nChew said that as Mdm Lim was busier with her career, he was the one who did most of the\n\nhousework and he was the main caregiver of the children. In addition, he had made other\n\nfinancial contributions to the family by paying for the household expenses such as the\n\nutilities, taxes, telephone bills, family car, petrol and newspapers. He also paid for the\n\nrent and conservancy charges while they were staying in the rented homes as well as for\n\nthe furnishings and renovations for their Holland Avenue flat. Mr Chew said that he had\n\npaid for four years of the daughter’s medical course at the university, and this came\n\nup to a sum of $48,000. During that period, he had further provided the daughter with a\n\nmonthly allowance of $600 per month. He claimed that the agreement with Mdm Lim was that\n\nhe would pay for the daughter’s medical course, while she would pay for the\n\nson’s engineering course. Mdm Lim disputed the amount that Mr Chew paid for the\n\ndaughter’s medical course. She said that he paid only $36,000 for the course for the\n\nperiod from the second year to the fifth, whereas she was the one who paid for the first\n\nyear. She admitted that Mr Chew paid for some of the household expenses, but claimed that\n\nhis contributions were little due to his paltry income and that she was still the one who\n\npaid for the bulk of the expenses.25. In dealing with the issue of other financial contributions made by\n\nthe parties, the district judge’s view was that it was not surprising for Mdm Lim to\n\nbear the bulk of the household expenses since she earned almost twice Mr Chew’s\n\nincome. However, the judge also chose to give credit to Mr Chew for his payment of the\n\ndaughter’s school fees. With respect to the indirect contributions, no findings were\n\nmade as to who was the primary caregiver of the children but the district judge appeared\n\nto have acknowledged Mdm Lim’s role in running the household and bringing up the\n\nchildren.26. We had no doubt that in the course of the 30-year marriage, it was\n\nMdm Lim who bore the main burden of supporting the family and providing for its welfare.\n\nShe was a determined woman who had worked very hard for her family, and she strove to\n\nimprove herself in her career. She took on extra work and assignments, such as relief\n\nteaching and marking examination papers, in order to augment the family income. From the\n\navailable evidence, which was not disputed, it could be observed that by May 1996, Mdm\n\nLim’s gross monthly income was about $5,000 while Mr Chew’s was only about\n\n$1,800. Although the parties could not be said to be high income earners, the family was\n\nnonetheless able to enjoy a comfortable living. They bought cars and went on packaged\n\ntours overseas, and it was apparent that these material comforts were provided largely by\n\nMdm Lim. Of course, due recognition should also be given to Mr Chew for his contributions.\n\nHe did what his level of income permitted him to, and he paid for the lesser expenses. In\n\nour view, the district judge had been too generous towards Mr Chew and had given too much\n\ncredit to Mr Chew’s financial contributions. Whilst he may have paid for part of his\n\ndaughter’s university education, this could hardly be matched with the level of\n\nfinancial input which Mdm Lim had contributed to the welfare and maintenance of the\n\nfamily.27. As for the indirect contributions made by the parties, we believed\n\nthat Mdm Lim, being a school teacher, would most probably have had more time to spend with\n\nthe family and children, whereas Mr Chew, who worked as a clerk, would have had a nine to\n\nfive vocation and would not have been as likely to spare the time.",
        "Conclusion": "28. After taking into consideration all the various factors and\n\nweighing the contributions, both monetary and non-monetary, made by each party, we were of\n\nthe view that Mdm Lim deserved greater credit for the comparatively larger contributions\n\nshe had made to the family and marriage. Consequently, we held that a just and equitable\n\ndivision would be for Mdm Lim to receive a 60% share in the sale proceeds of 83 Namly\n\nAvenue and for Mr Chew to have a 40% share. In the result, we allowed Mdm Lim’s\n\nappeal.Sgd:Yong Pung HowChief JusticeSgd:L P TheanJudge of AppealSgd:Chao Hick TinJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
