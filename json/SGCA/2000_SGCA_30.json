        "Loss of opportunity": "41.    We now turn to the\n\nplaintiffs’ alternative claim for the loss of opportunity to acquire a similar\n\nproperty. The basis of this claim is that if the defendant had discharged his duty, the\n\nplaintiffs would not only have avoided the contract but would also have acquired a similar\n\nproperty along Jalan Besar or a unit in Sim Lim Tower which is near to the premises where\n\nthey had been conducting their business, and this opportunity they had lost by reason of\n\nthe completion of the purchase of the property. The defendant, on the other hand, contends\n\nthat since this claim was also premised on the same negligence or breach of duty on the\n\npart of the defendant, and all that he had failed to do was to prevent the plaintiff from\n\ncompleting the purchase because the Vendors had no title to the Property, the alternative\n\nclaim must also fail.42.    We are unable to\n\nagree with the defendant’s contention. We think that there is some merit in the\n\nargument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs. While it is true that this alternative\n\nclaim of the plaintiffs is premised on same negligence or breach of duty of the defendant\n\nas that on which the plaintiffs’ claim of loss of the property is based, the same\n\nconsequence does not necessarily follow with respect to the plaintiffs’ loss under\n\nthis head. On the evidence adduced, there are sufficient grounds for saying that if the\n\nplaintiffs had been properly advised they would have rescinded the contract for the\n\npurchase of the property in October 1993 or earlier and very likely would have immediately\n\nor soon thereafter looked for and purchased a similar property along Jalan Besar facing\n\nSim Lim Tower or in the alternative a unit in Sim Lim Tower for the purpose of their\n\nbusiness. The property (which they had then purchased) was rent controlled and they had\n\npurchased it for their own business and not for investment. They had adequate financial\n\nresources for the purpose, as they completed the purchase without any borrowing from a\n\nbank or other financial institution. At or about the time of their purchase, the tenancy\n\nof the shop unit at Sim Lim Square at which they carried on business was due to expire on\n\n31 July 1994. Soon after the completion of the purchase, they instituted proceedings for\n\nrecovery of vacant possession of the property and also at the same time commenced\n\nnegotiations with the tenants of the property with a view to obtaining vacant possession,\n\nwhich they eventually succeeded.43.    There was evidence\n\ngiven by Azam Ali to the effect that if the defendant had advised the plaintiffs that the\n\nVendors had no title to the property, the plaintiffs would have sought to buy a similar\n\nproperty along Jalan Besar facing Sim Lim Tower or alternatively a unit in Sim Lim Tower\n\nhaving an area between 300 and 350 square feet. There was no evidence adduced showing\n\nthat, at or about that time, there was available in the market a similar property along\n\nJalan Besar. But there was evidence adduced showing the availability of units in Sim Lim\n\nTower fulfilling the requirements indicated by Azam Ali. In particular, there was produced\n\nin evidence a list of sales of such units, and on the basis of this list, Azam Ali said\n\nthat if the defendant had advised the plaintiffs in or before October 1993 that the\n\nVendors had no title to the property they would have bought, for example, unit #03-15\n\nhaving an area of 312.2 sq ft or #B1-47 having an area of 322.9 sq ft (depending of course\n\non their availability).44.    Given their need for\n\npremises for their business and the approaching expiry of their existing tenancy of the\n\nshop unit in Sim Lim Square, we find that it is very likely that the plaintiffs would in\n\nfact have gone into the market to look for alternative premises for the purpose of their\n\nbusiness, if they had been advised by the defendant against the completion of the\n\nproperty. On the basis of the evidence adduced, we find that they would have sought to\n\npurchase a unit in Sim Lim Tower as an alternative. In our judgment, the plaintiffs had\n\nindeed lost the opportunity of re-entering the market in or before October 1993 and buying\n\na unit in Sim Lim Tower, which would meet their requirements, and this loss was occasioned\n\nby the defendant’s negligence or breach of duty.45.    The next question is\n\nwhether this loss is too remote. In this case, as there is a concurrent liability in\n\ncontract and tort, it is necessary to bear in mind the respective tests for remoteness in\n\nthese causes of action. In the case of contractual liability, the test for recoverable\n\nloss is that within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, based on their imputed\n\nknowledge (in the ordinary course of things) or actual knowledge: seeHadley v\n\nBaxendale(1854) 9 Ex 341, The Heron II[1969] 1 AC 350. As for tortious\n\nliability, the loss is recoverable if it is reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances:The\n\nWagon Mound[1961] AC 388. However, there is authority for the view that the\n\ndifference between the two tests is semantic and not substantial, especially in situations\n\nof concurrent liability:Parsons v Uttley Ingam & Co[1978] QB 791 at 807;Kienzle\n\nv Stringer(1981) 130 DLR (3d) 272at 276.46.    The crucial question\n\nhere is whether the loss falls within the defendant’s reasonable contemplation or is\n\nreasonably foreseeable on the part of the defendant. Speaking generally, in the ordinary\n\ncourse of things, a nondescript purchaser may be interested in a property because of its\n\npotential or unique characteristics, or because it suits his personal or commercial\n\nrequirements. If the purchase becomes abortive, he may, depending on the circumstances,\n\nimmediately return to the market to purchase a similar alternative, or one that is\n\nsignificantly different, or he may not even purchase a substitute at all. In such a case,\n\na purchaser’s claim for loss of opportunity consequent on the negligence of the kind\n\nin question would be a claim for loss of investment opportunity. Depending on the\n\ncircumstances, such a claim may or may not be too remote.47.    Turning to the case\n\nat hand, we should bear in mind the following. First, the plaintiffs were a commercial\n\nconcern carrying on the business of dealing in electronic goods and articles. They had\n\nbeen carrying on business at the rented shop unit at Sim Lim Square which is in the\n\nvicinity of the property in question. This must have been known to the defendant. Second,\n\nthe nature of the property. This was rent-controlled premises and it must have occurred to\n\nthe defendant that the plaintiffs were purchasing it purely for their business purposes\n\nand not for investment. Soon after the conclusion of the contract, Azam Ali obtained the\n\nnames of the tenants of the property and this was known to the defendant. The defendant\n\nwas clearly aware that the plaintiffs would, after the completion of the purchase, proceed\n\nto apply to the Tenant’s Compensation Board for recovery of vacant possession of the\n\nproperty: see the plaintiffs’ letter to the defendant dated 14 October 1993. It is\n\ntrue that there was no direct evidence that the defendant was subjectively aware of the\n\nplaintiffs’ commercial plans and requirements in purchasing property in the Jalan\n\nBesar area. Nevertheless, given these facts and the plaintiffs’ financial means to\n\nbuy the property without any borrowings, it was within the reasonable contemplation of the\n\ndefendant or would have been reasonably foreseen by the defendant that, if he had advised\n\nthe plaintiffs not to complete the purchase of the property on the ground that the Vendors\n\nhad no title to the Property, the plaintiffs would have rescinded the contract and\n\nre-entered the market to purchase an alternative property which fulfilled their\n\nrequirements. In our judgment, on the facts of this case, the loss in question was not too\n\nremote, either in contract or in tort, and is thus recoverable.48.    Finally, we move to\n\nthe quantification of this loss. The characterisation of this loss is similar to the\n\nprevious head of loss which we have disallowed, the only difference being the subject\n\nproperty in question. In respect of that loss, we are concerned with the loss of the\n\nproperty which was purchased under the contract of sale. The measure applicable is the\n\ndifference between the value of the property at the material date and the contract price:Stinchcombe\n\nv Addison(supra). In respect of this loss under consideration, we are concerned with\n\nthe hypothetical alternative shop unit in Sim Lim Tower which the plaintiffs could have\n\npurchased had they been properly advised. According to Azam Ali, the unit which would meet\n\nthe plaintiffs’ requirements would be one having an area between 300 and 350 sq ft.\n\nFor our purpose, we would take a unit with an area of 325 sq ft. Accordingly, the\n\nappropriate measure of this loss would be the difference between (a) the market value of a\n\nshop a unit in Sim Lim Tower having an area of 325 sq ft at or around the date of\n\ncompletion, i.e. 15 October 1993, and (b) the market value of such unit as at the date\n\n(‘the material date’) on which they ought reasonably to have purchased this\n\nsubstitute. In the court below, the plaintiffs’ arguments on this claim were run\n\nalong this line.49.    The question now is\n\nwhat is the material date for the purpose of this exercise. First, we do not accept the\n\ndate of the judgment in O S 437 of 1995 as the material date. Next, the defendant\n\nsuggested the date of 31 January 1994 or in the alternative 12 November 1994. The first\n\nwas the date on which Mr Lim of SLB wrote to the defendant informing him that the Vendors\n\nhad ‘no power’ to deal with the property and that no interest in the property\n\nhad passed to the plaintiffs. We would reject this date, as Mr Lim was acting primarily\n\nfor the bank, and no copy of the letter was then given to the plaintiffs; in effect the\n\nplaintiffs never received any definitive advice from Mr Lim on that issue. The second\n\ndate, being premised on the letter from the Vendors’ solicitors dated 12 November\n\n1994 offering to refund to the plaintiffs ‘all monies paid without interest’,\n\nwas manifestly unacceptable. The offer would not really reimburse the plaintiffs for their\n\nloss of the bargain and wasted expenditure. The plaintiffs could not be expected to act on\n\nsuch an offer.50.    It seems to us that\n\nthe reasonable date should be 17 March 1995, being the date on which the plaintiffs\n\nreceived Mr Dyne’s opinion on the property. By that date the plaintiffs had received:\n\n(a) Mr Lim’s opinion that no title to the property had passed to them and the\n\nbank’s rejection of the property as security for the loan; (b) P & P’s\n\nadvice on their lack of a good title to the property; and (c) Mr Dyne’s opinion which\n\nconfirmed the earlier legal opinions that (i) no title to the property had passed to the\n\nplaintiffs and (ii) the court order of 27 August 1993 was a nullity. It was patently clear\n\nby that date that, in the absence of any settlement with the beneficiaries, the plaintiffs\n\nought to have sought alternative premises. Further, by 17 March 1995, they or their\n\nsolicitors should have also searched the probate registry and discovered that the grant de\n\nbonis non had already been issued in favour of Alsagoff, precluding any remedy of the\n\ntitle defect. Accordingly, in our judgment, the material date to assess the\n\nplaintiffs’ loss of opportunity under this rubric was the 17 March 1995.Recovery of the tenant compensation and\n\ncosts51.    The question here is\n\nwhether it was reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiffs to have paid the tenants\n\nof the property the compensations in June 1994, when prior to the dates of the payments\n\nthey had notice of a very serious defect in the title of the property. On this issue we\n\nneed to examine what precisely occurred between the time the plaintiffs completed the\n\npurchase of the property and the time the payments were made.52.    The plaintiffs\n\ncompleted the purchase on 15 October 1993, and immediately thereafter initiated an\n\napplication to the Tenants’ Compensation Board for the recovery of possession. They\n\ninstructed their solicitors, P & P, to obtain an early date for the hearing, as the\n\ntenancy of the premises they were then occupying was due to terminate on 31 July 1994. In\n\nconsequence, the hearing was fixed for 25 April 1994. In the meanwhile, Mr Lim of SLB, who\n\nhad been instructed to act for both the plaintiffs and the Bank in the proposed mortgage\n\nof the property to secure a loan from the Bank, had made a search on the property and\n\nfound that there was a defect in the title. On 31 January 1994, he wrote to the defendant\n\npointing out that the Vendors had ‘no power’ to sell the property and that a\n\ngrant of letters of administration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate was essential, and\n\nthat the deed of assignment of the property was ineffectual to transfer any interest in\n\nthe property to the plaintiffs. The defendant replied on 21 March 1994 setting out the\n\ncircumstances leading to the completion of the purchase of the property and concluding\n\nthat the sale had been sanctioned by the court order in O S 787 of 1993 and so long as the\n\norder remained in effect the title was good. In response, Mr Lim wrote to the defendant\n\nreiterating that the plaintiffs did not have a good title to the property. It does not\n\nappear from the evidence that at or about that time Mr Lim sent copies of these letters to\n\nthe plaintiffs. Most probably, he did not. Before us counsel for the plaintiffs asserted\n\n– and this was not challenged by counsel for the defendant – that copies of\n\nthese letters were not sent to the plaintiffs at that time. Sometime thereafter, Azam Ali\n\nenquired with Mr Lim on the position with regard to the mortgage and the latter informed\n\nhim that there was a problem with regard to the title to the property. However, there was\n\nno evidence to the effect that Mr Lim advised the plaintiffs specifically what the problem\n\nwas. Nor did he advise the plaintiffs to take any steps in relation to rectifying the\n\ndefect in the title or take any steps against the defendant. The reason for this is\n\nobvious. As counsel for the plaintiffs points out, at that time, Mr Lim’s primary\n\nduty was to act for the Bank and, if the parties had gone ahead with the mortgage, he\n\nwould represent the plaintiffs as well. It is significant that after the conversation with\n\nMr Lim, Azam Ali or his co-director, Chow, raised the matter with the defendant and was\n\nassured that the title was good.53.    P & P also\n\ncarried out searches on the property. On 30 June 1994, they wrote to Balan Nair stating\n\nthat the Vendors were not the administrators of the Basalamah estate and enquiring whether\n\nthey had taken any step to obtain the letters of administration de bonis non so that the\n\ndefect in the title could be rectified. Balan Nair very promptly replied on 4 July 1994\n\nstating that they had closed the file and that they were no longer acting for the Vendors.\n\nOn 28 July 1994, P & P wrote to the defendant concerning the same point. In this\n\ninstance, they set out the plaintiffs’ position more positively. They stated that the\n\ntitle to the property had not passed to the plaintiffs and that the Vendors did not have\n\nthe power to sell the property to the plaintiffs, as they were not the administrators of\n\nthe Basalamah estate, and they demanded an explanation from the defendant. Here again, it\n\nis unclear from the evidence precisely when P & P carried out the searches on the\n\nproperty and advised the plaintiffs on the question of their lack of title to the\n\nproperty. We could only infer that they probably did the searches and advised the\n\nplaintiffs at or near the end of June 1994.54.    Prior to that date,\n\nhowever, the plaintiffs through P & P had been conducting negotiations with the\n\ntenants of the property as regards payment of compensation. They reached agreement with\n\none of the tenants on or about 20 April 1994 and with the other tenant on or about 10 May\n\n1994 as regards the amount to be paid to each of them. From the evidence adduced, it is\n\nclear to us that these agreements were reached before they were fully advised by P & P\n\nas to the defect in their title to the property. By these agreements the plaintiffs were\n\ncommitted to make the payments and they could not renege from the agreements with\n\nimpunity.55.    The learned judge\n\nbelow said at  85 of his judgment:85. The claim for the compensation paid to\n\n  the tenants require greater examination. By the time the payments were made in June 1994\n\n  the plaintiffs have already been told by Mr Lim of the defect in the title. They also had\n\n  [P & P] to act for them in the application to the Tenants Compensation Board. [P &\n\n  P] made title and probate searches and informed the vendors’ solicitors of the defect\n\n  in the title. The plaintiffs should have sought advice on the state of their title before\n\n  they paid the tenants. When they made payment, either they did not seek advice, or were\n\n  not properly advised, or they disregarded the advice. In any case the defendant is not\n\n  liable for the payment because the chain of causation was broken by the negligence of the\n\n  plaintiffs or their advisors.On the basis of the facts we have\n\nexamined, this finding is plainly incorrect. It is true that the plaintiffs made the\n\npayments in June 1994, but the commitments to make the payments were made earlier, when\n\nthey were not fully advised that they had no title to the property. On our analysis of the\n\nfacts, the chain of causation for this loss sustained by the plaintiffs had not been\n\nbroken and the defendant is liable to pay to the plaintiffs the compensations they had\n\npaid to the tenants of the property. For the same reason, he is liable to pay the\n\nplaintiffs the costs they had paid to their solicitors, P & P, in respect of the\n\napplication to the Tenants Compensation Board.Recovery of costs in O S 437 of 199556.    The next issue is\n\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendant their costs incurred in\n\ncontesting the claim instituted by Syed Alsagoff in O S 437 of 1995 as a\n\nconsequential loss occasioned by the defendant’s negligence. Central to this issue is\n\nthe question of whether the plaintiffs had acted reasonably in contesting the claim.57.    For this purpose,\n\nthe relevant starting point in time was the end of June 1994. By then, the\n\nplaintiffs’ solicitors, P & P, had carried out the necessary searches on the\n\nproperty and must have advised them that they did not have good title to the property.\n\nThis is clearly borne out by the two letters dated 30 June and 28 July 1994 written by P\n\n& P to Balan Nair and the defendant respectively, and copies of these letters were\n\nsent to the plaintiffs. For the next six months nothing of importance transpired. No\n\nuseful step or action appeared to have been taken by the plaintiffs to address the vital\n\nissue of their lack of title to the property. In particular, they and those advising them\n\ndid not actively explore the possibility of the Vendors obtaining the grant of letters of\n\nadministration de bonis non to the Basalamah estate. On 27 December 1994, Mr Lim\n\nwrote to the plaintiffs informing them that the Bank would not accept the property as\n\nsecurity, unless the defect in their title to the property was rectified. On this\n\noccasion, Mr Lim enclosed a copy of the letter dated 31 January 1994 which he wrote to the\n\ndefendant.58.    After this, nothing\n\nappeared to have been done by the plaintiffs in seeking to rectify the defect in the\n\ntitle. Another two months elapsed, and only on 2 March 1995 or thereabouts, did they\n\ninstruct P & P to consult Mr Dyne and obtain an opinion on the question of their title\n\nto the property. On 17 March 1995, Mr Dyne gave a written opinion which, inter alia,\n\nconfirmed what P & P had said, namely: that the plaintiffs had acquired no title to\n\nthe property as the Vendors did not have the letters of administration de bonis non to the\n\nBasalamah estate. He specifically dealt with the question of whether a good title had\n\npassed to the plaintiffs. He said at p 14:A good legal title in the Property has not\n\n  passed to the Purchaser [plaintiffs]. In fact no title has passed to the Purchaser.Hence, by the end of March 1995, the\n\nplaintiffs definitely knew from three sources: Mr Lim, P & P and Mr Dyne, that they\n\nhad no title to the property, and short of negotiating with the administrator, Syed\n\nAlsagoff who had obtained the grant of letters of administration de bonis non on 16\n\nSeptember 1994, there was no real prospect at all of rectifying their lack of title to the\n\nproperty.59.    On 8 May 1995, Syed\n\nAlsagoff commenced proceedings in O S 437 of 1995 against the Vendors and the plaintiffs\n\nseeking an order to set aside the sale. With the opinions given by Mr Lim, P & P and\n\nMr Dyne, it must have been clear to the plaintiffs that they had no real prospect of\n\nsuccess in contesting the claim of Syed Alsagoff. They must have realised that the\n\nVendors, not being the administrators of the Basalamah estate, had no capacity to convey\n\nto them the property and consequently they had not obtained any title to the property. It\n\nis true that in contesting the claim, the plaintiffs raised the defences of acquiescence\n\nand laches, but, again, it must have been obvious to the plaintiffs and their advisers\n\nthat there was no factual basis for maintaining these defences and that there was no real\n\nprospect of success in such defences. In our judgment, the plaintiffs were highly\n\nunrealistic and did not act reasonably in contesting the claim of Syed Alsagoff in\n\nO S 437 of 1995.60.    It is submitted by\n\ncounsel for the plaintiffs that they had to contest the claim, because only with a\n\njudgment could they have persuaded the defendant to accept that the title to the property\n\nwas bad, given the respondent’s previous insistence that the title was in order. The\n\nshort answer to this is that, in such event, the plaintiffs could have apprised the\n\ndefendant of their stand that there was no defence to the claim, and if the defendant was\n\nstill insistent that the plaintiffs had a good title to the property, to offer to the\n\ndefendant that he should take over the defence in the name of the plaintiffs and indemnify\n\nthe plaintiffs against all the costs incurred.Conclusion61.    We now make the\n\nfollowing orders in relation to these two appeals. We allow the plaintiffs’ appeal,\n\nnamely, Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, to the extent as follows. We allow the claim of the\n\nplaintiffs for the amount of $54,500 being the total amount of the compensations paid by\n\nthem to the tenants of the property and the amount of $5,416.39 being their costs incurred\n\nfor applying to the Tenants Compensation Board. We allow the defendant’s appeal,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 195, to this extent. We set aside the order made by learned judge for\n\nassessment of damages and order that damages be assessed by the registrar on the basis of\n\nwhat we have decided in  48-50 above.Costs62.    We now turn the\n\nquestion of costs. The plaintiffs have succeeded partially in Civil Appeal No. 197 of\n\n1999, and we award them 50% of the costs of this appeal. Turning to Civil Appeal No. 195\n\nof 1999, we think that, though the defendant has succeeded in part, he has not really\n\nsucceeded on the point raised in his Case but on the point we raised and brought to\n\ncounsel’s attention. We are not disposed to award him any costs. Nor, on the other\n\nhand, should the plaintiffs be allowed the entire costs of this appeal. We award the\n\nplaintiffs 50% of the costs of this appeal. We so order. There will be usual orders for\n\n(a) refund to the plaintiffs or their solicitors of the deposit in court as security costs\n\nin Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1999, with interest, if any, and (b) payment to the plaintiffs\n\nor their solicitors of the deposit in court as security for costs in Civil Appeal No. 195\n\nof 1999, with interest, if any, to account of costs.YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANCHAO HICK TINCHIEF JUSTICEJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGE OF APPEALCopyright © Government of Singapore."
