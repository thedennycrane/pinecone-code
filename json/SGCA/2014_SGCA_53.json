        "Introduction": "",
        "Overview": "1       There\nare very few legal provisions in the Singapore legal landscape which,\nalthough simply stated (and intuitively attractive), are very difficult to\napply in practice. Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic\nof Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Singapore Constitution”)\nis one of these rare exceptions. In particular, Article 12(1) of\nthe Singapore Constitution (“Art 12(1)”), which is one of the provisions\nin issue in the present appeals (viz,\nCivil Appeal No 54 of 2013 (“CA 54/2013”) and Civil Appeal No 125\nof 2013 (“CA 125/2013”)), is deceptively simple in its economy of\nlanguage: Equal\nprotection 12.—(1) All persons are equal\nbefore the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law. … 2       The\nissue before this court in the present appeals can be stated very simply:\nis s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the current Penal\nCode”) inconsistent with Art 9 and/or Art 12 of the Singapore Constitution\n(referred to hereafter as “Art 9” and “Art 12”, respectively), and\nhence, unconstitutional to the extent of such inconsistency? In\nthis regard, Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution (“Art 9(1)”),\nwhich is the specific provision in Art 9 that the appellants in\nCA 54/2013 and the appellant in CA 125/2013 (collectively, “the\nAppellants”) are relying on, provides as follows: Liberty\nof the person 9.—(1) No person shall be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with\nlaw. … Art 4 of the Singapore Constitution (“Art 4”), which is set\nout below, should also be noted: Supremacy\nof Constitution 4.    This\nConstitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any\nlaw enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution\nwhich is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of\nthe inconsistency, be void. 3       Section 377A\nof the current Penal Code, the provision which is the subject of\nthe Appellants’ constitutional challenge, reads as follows: Outrages on\ndecency 377A.    Any\nmale person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission\nof, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male\nperson of, any act of gross indecency with another male person,\nshall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend\nto 2 years. In this judgment, we shall be referring to s 377A of not only\nthe current Penal Code, but also earlier editions of that statute.\nAs there are no substantial differences between the various versions\nof s 377A, we shall use the generic term “s 377A” to denote the\nversion of s 377A in force at the particular point in time being\ndiscussed. 4       We\nalso note that there is a presumption of constitutionality inasmuch\nas a court will not lightly find a statute or any provision(s) thereof (referred\nto hereafter as a “statute” for short) unconstitutional (see, for example,\nthe decision of this court inPublic Prosecutor\nv Taw Cheng Kong[1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 (“Taw\nCheng Kong (CA)”) at [60]). This is only logical as well\nas commonsensical as our legislature is presumed not to enact legislation\nwhich is inconsistent with the Singapore Constitution. However, an\nissue arises in these appeals as to whether or not this presumption applies\ntocoloniallegislation as well,\ngiven that s 377A was first introduced into our Penal Code in 1938,\nwhen Singapore was still a British colony. 5       Whilst\nthe central issue in the present appeals (as set out above at [2]) can\nbe stated simply, it is intensely controversial, and has elicited diametrically\nopposed (as well as, on occasion at least, intense and even emotional)\nresponses in the extra-legal sphere, especially where Art 12 is concerned.\nA great many arguments have been mounted by proponents on each side\nof the divide. It is no exaggeration to say that this court found itself\nin the midst of a cacophony of voices. Be that as it may, only one\nvoice – and one voice alone – is relevant in so far as the present\nappeals are concerned: it is the voice of the law, which represents\nthe voice of objectivity. All other voices are irrelevant; indeed,\nthey generate unnecessary heat (and distraction) rather than needful\n(and illuminating) light.",
        "Important general points": "Only legal arguments are relevant 6       Before\nwe set out the background facts and procedural history of the present\nappeals, it is necessary for us to first highlight a few important general\npoints. The first is that many of the difficulties encountered in\nthe context of Art 9 and Art 12 relate to the fact that the court\nis often involved in a delicate balancing process. More importantly,\nit often faces a paradox which it must nevertheless negotiate. On\nthe one hand, it must disregard extra-legal considerations that\nare uniquely within the purview of the legislature (here, the Singapore\nParliament). This was in fact a central motif in the justly famous\ntheory of adjudication proffered by the late Prof Ronald Dworkin\n(in an entire series of works, commencing with his seminal book,Taking Rights Seriously(Harvard University\nPress, 1978) (especially at ch 4)). Yet, where the constitutionality\nof a statute is challenged under Art 9 and/or Art 12, the court\nmust have regard to extra-legal considerationsin\nso far as they impact the application ofArt 9 and Art 12\nthemselves. The vexing difficulty – particularly in the context\nof the present appeals – is to discern where the line is to be drawn,\nbearing in mind that where the court does indeed have regard to\nextra-legal considerations, this must (in the nature of things)\nbe by way ofa very limited brief premised\nonly onwhat isabsolutely necessaryto\nenable the court toapplythe relevantlegalprinciplesrelating\nto Art 9 and Art 12. 7       Drawing\nsucha line in the legal sandis\nimperative. If this is not done, the court will necessarily be sucked\ninto and thereby descend into thepoliticalarena,\nwhich would in turn undermine (or even destroy) the very role which\nconstitutes theraison d’êtrefor\nthe court’s existence in the first place – namely, to furnish anindependent, neutral andobjectiveforum\nfor deciding, on the basis of objective legal rules and principles,\n(inter alia) what rights parties\nhave in a given situation. That the court’s role as a neutral arbiter\nis utterly vital is underscored in a situation where (as is the case\nhere) the arguments on either side of what is in substance alegislativedivide are intensely controversial\nand the relevant empirical evidence is ambiguous at best. All that\nthe court can – and must – be concerned with in these circumstances\nis whether anyfundamental rightsunderthe Singapore Constitution(such as those\npursuant to Art 9 and Art 12) have indeed been violated. 8       In\ndetermining the constitutionality of a statute which is alleged\nto be inconsistent with Art 12 (or, for that matter, any other Article\nof the Singapore Constitution), the court’s main concern is to be\ncareful not to trespass into extra-legal territory which legitimately\nbelongs only to the legislature. Looked at in this light, the many\nextra-legal arguments on the constitutionality of s 377A areirrelevantto the court’s application\nof Art 12. We hasten to add that this doesnotmean\nthat these arguments arewhollyirrelevant\ninallcontexts. They are appropriate\nto alegislativedebate, but that\nis wholly beyond the remit of the court. The proponents of these arguments\nfail to see this because they overlook the vital distinction referred\nto above (at [6]) between legal principles and extra-legal considerations.\nHence, they proffer various extra-legal arguments as though those\narguments are central to the court’s task, when they serve only\nto muddy an already difficult legal path which the court is attempting\nits level best to negotiate. This is unfortunate, to say the least.\nIndeed, the difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that some of\nthe extra-legal arguments might also have an overlay of emotional\nand/or other overtones, and, on this ground alone, are more suited\n(if at all) to alegislative(or\nevenphilosophical) – butnotalegal–\ndebate. What is legally relevant (and\nirrelevant) in the context of the present appeals 9       It\nfollows,a fortiori, from the observations\nin the preceding paragraph that in deciding the present appeals,\nthis court cannot – and must not – be drawn into the sphere of even\nbroader (and, arguably, even more speculative) debate, in particular,\non the possible legal as well as extra-legalconsequencesflowing\nfrom its decision on the constitutionality of s 377A. Indeed, counsel\nfor the appellants in CA 54/2013, Ms Deborah Barker SC (“Ms Barker”),\nwas at pains to point out right at the outset of her clients’ written\ncase (as well as in her oral submissions before this court) that\nher clients’ appeal isnotaboutotherlegalrights\n(such as the right to same-sex marriage). There is, in fact,no necessary connectionbetween any court decision\non the constitutionality of s 377A and anypositiverights,\nthe grant (or otherwise) of which is clearly a matter forthe legislature – and the legislature alone.\nThe line referred to above between what is legitimately within the\npurview of the court and what is legitimately within the purview of\nthe legislature applies, as noted at the outset of the present paragraph,\nin ana fortiorimanner in the present\nappeals. 10     It\nfollows that in the present appeals, this court will take into accountonlythose arguments which arelegallyrelevant to the application of\nArt 9 and Art 12. All other arguments – interesting though they\nmight be – ought to be canvassed in theappropriatefora\n(whether of a legislative, academic or some other public (but non-judicial)\nnature). 11     It\nis also important to emphasise that it follows that nothing in this judgment\nimpacts the freedom of a person or group of persons tofreelyespouse as well as practise his/its\nvalueswithin the boundaries of the law(such\nas, in the religious context, within the boundaries laid down by\nArt 15 of the Singapore Constitution and the Maintenance of Religious\nHarmony Act (Cap 167A, 2001 Rev Ed)). This is consistent with the\nmulti-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual as well as multi-religious\nnature of Singapore society. This is not mere political rhetoric,\nbut a real and practical framework that furnishes real and practical\nfreedom for each group and each individual to practise its/his values\n–provided (it is important to reiterate) this\nis done within the parameters and boundaries laid down by the existing\nlaw of the land.This freedomcannot,\nhowever, extend to an insistence by a particular group or individual\nthat its/his values beimposedonothergroups or other individuals. 12     Given\nour approach of focusing only on the relevantlegalarguments in\nthe present appeals, might it be argued that this court is conducting\nitself like an ostrich whose head is buried in the sand inasmuch\nas it might be ignoring the need to achieve asubstantively\nfairresult in the two cases at hand? This is, at first\nblush, a rather powerful argument. However, there seems to us no\nreason why asubstantively fairresult\ncannot be arrived at by focusing only on the relevantlegalarguments. Indeed (and on thecontrary),werethis\ncourt toalsoconsiderextra-legal arguments that arewithin the purview of the Singapore Parliament,\nwouldthatnot becontrarytofairnessin both a proceduralas well asa substantive sense? It should\nalso be noted thatif it is thought that a\nsubstantively fair result can only be achieved by a consideration\nof extra-legal arguments as well, then the Singapore Parliament\ncan always remedy the situation in the appropriate fashion. However,\nit would then be doing so in a legitimate manner. It bears repeating\nthat this court cannot seek to achieve the same result as it does\nnot have the legitimate jurisdiction to do so – the legitimate jurisdiction\nlies, instead, with the Singapore Parliament.",
        "Background facts and procedural\nhistory": "13     As\nwe have already mentioned, the present appeals pertain to the constitutionality\nof s 377A. The Appellants are essentially arguing that s 377A violates\nArt 9 and/or Art 12. 14     The\nappellant in CA 125/2013, Tan Eng Hong (“Tan”), was arrested on\n9 March 2010 for engaging in oral sex with a male partner in the\ncubicle of a public toilet. Tan and the male partner were charged\nunder s 377A on 2 September 2010 and 1 September 2010 respectively.\nTan filed an application (by way of an originating summons (“OS”))\nto challenge the constitutionality of s 377A on 24 September 2010.\nOn 15 October 2010, the Prosecution substituted the s 377A charges\nagainst Tan and his partner with charges under s 294(a) of the current Penal Code for the commission of\nan obscene act in a public place. Tan and the Attorney-General,\nthe respondent in the present appeals (“the Respondent”), proceeded\nto litigate over the issue of whether Tan had the requisitelocus standito challenge the constitutionality\nof s 377A. That culminated in the decision of this court inTan Eng Hong v Attorney-General[2012]\n4 SLR 476 (“Tan Eng Hong (standing)”),\ndelivered on 21 August 2012, where it was held that Tan did have\nthe requisitelocus standi. 15     The\nappellants in CA 54/2013, Lim Meng Suang (“Lim”) and Kenneth Chee\nMun-Leon (“Chee”), have been in a romantic and sexual relationship for\nthe past 15 years. Together, they run “TheBearProject”, an informal social\ngroup for plus-sized gay men. Both men aver that they have been sexually\nattracted to men since young, and have experienced various forms of\nsocial discrimination against homosexual men. On 30 November 2012, slightly\nover three months after the judgment inTan\nEng Hong (standing)was delivered, Lim and Chee filed\nan OS to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A. 16     Tan’s\nsubstantive application was first heard by a High Court judge on\n18 January 2013. Lim and Chee’s substantive application was first\nheard by the same High Court judge (“the Judge”) on 7 February 2013.\nJudgments for these two substantive applications were released on,\nrespectively, 2 October 2013 (reported asTan\nEng Hong v Attorney-General[2013] 4 SLR 1059 (“Tan Eng Hong (substantive)”)) and 9 April\n2013 (reported asLim Meng Suang and another\nv Attorney-General[2013] 3 SLR 118 (“Lim Meng\nSuang”)). In both judgments, the Judge held that s 377A\ndid not violate the Singapore Constitution. 17     Lim\nand Chee filed their notice of appeal on 30 April 2013. On 15 July 2013,\nLim and Chee sought,inter alia,\nleave to amend their OS to include new arguments centring on how\ns 377A violated Art 9. Their application was dismissed by a High\nCourt judge sitting as a single judge of the Court of Appeal. Lim\nand Chee then filed Summons No 3664 of 2013 (“SUM 3664/2013”) on\n17 July 2013, requesting a three-judge Court of Appeal to review\nthat judge’s dismissal of their application. SUM 3664/2013 was heard\non 2 August 2013, whereupon it was adjourned to be heard together\nwith Lim and Chee’s substantive appeal (ie,\nCA 54/2013). CA 54/2013 was set down to be heard on 14 October 2013. 18     In\nthe meantime, Tan filed an application on 14 August 2013 for leave to\nintervene in CA 54/2013. This application for leave to intervene\nwas subsequently withdrawn when it was heard on 5 September 2013.\nAs mentioned above at [16], the judgment for Tan’s substantive application was\nreleased on 2 October 2013. A notice of appeal (assigned the number “CA 125/2013”)\nwas quickly filed on 8 October 2013, along with an application for,inter alia, CA 125/2013 to be expedited\nand heard together with CA 54/2013 on 14 October 2013. That application\nwas heard on 10 October 2013, wherein this court ordered CA 54/2013\nand CA 125/2013 to be heard together because they raised essentially\nthe same issues of law. The hearing for CA 54/2013, originally scheduled\nfor 14 October 2013, was vacated to allow counsel for Tan, Mr M Ravi\n(“Mr Ravi”), to file submissions.",
        "Summary of the arguments in\nthe court below": "19     Ms Barker’s\narguments in the court below centred on how s 377A violated Art 12.\nFirstly, it was submitted that equal protection under Art 12 extended\nto protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\nSecondly, it was said that s 377A was so absurd, arbitrary and unreasonable\nthat it could not be good law. Thirdly, it was argued that s 377A\nfailed the two-step test for determining the constitutionality of\na statute under Art 12 (“the ‘reasonable classification’ test”)\nbecause it disclosed no intelligible differentia and the differentia\napplied bore no rational relation to the object of s 377A. (Under\nthe “reasonable classification” test, which was enunciated in,inter alia,Taw Cheng\nKong (CA),Nguyen Tuong Van v Public\nProsecutor[2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 (“Nguyen Tuong\nVan”) andYong Vui Kong v Public\nProsecutor and another matter[2010] 3 SLR 489 (“Yong Vui Kong”), a statute that prescribes\na differentiating measure will nonetheless be consistent with Art 12\nif it is based on “reasonable classification”;ie,\nif: (a) the classification prescribed by the statute is founded\non an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons within\nthe defined group from persons outside the group; and (b) that differentia\nhas a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the\nstatute.) Lastly, Ms Barker submitted that s 377A did not conform\nto trends in international jurisprudence, which militated against discrimination\non the basis of sexual orientation. She therefore prayed for s 377A\nto be struck down intoto(cfthe prayers sought by Lim and Chee\non appeal at para 347et seqof\ntheir Appellants’ Case, in which it is argued, as an alternative,\nthat s 377A should be read down by striking out the words “or private”\ntherein). 20     Mr Ravi’s\narguments in the court below centred on how s 377A was inconsistent\nwith both Art 9 and Art 12. He argued that s 377A was contrary to\nthe fundamental rules of natural justice and was therefore not “law”\nfor the purposes of Art 9(1). In relation to Art 12, he contended\nthat s 377A was absurd, arbitrary and unreasonable, and that the\ndifferentia of males bore no rational relation to the object of\nthe provision. 21     The\nRespondent essentially argued that s 377A passed the “reasonable classification”\ntest. The objectives of s 377A, it submitted, comprised the preservation\nof public morality and the safeguarding of public health (it should\nbe noted that this last-mentioned point was not pursued before this court).\nThe non-inclusion of female homosexual conduct did not render s 377A\nunder-inclusive because such conduct was either less prevalent or perceived\nto be less repugnant than male homosexual conduct. Even if s 377A\nwere under-inclusive, the Respondent contended, legislative leeway ought\nto be given to our Parliament. Most importantly, it was submitted, there\nshould be a strong presumption of constitutionality for laws passed\nby the legislature.",
        "The decisions below": "",
        "The decision in Lim Meng Suang": "22     The\nJudge commenced his decision inLim Meng Suangby undertaking\na historical inquiry into Art 12. Article 12 was found to be consanguine\nwith equivalent provisions in the US Constitution, the Constitution\nof India and the Federal Constitution of Malaysia. Equal protection,\nthe Judge held, was a guarantee of not merely procedural or administrative\nequality, but also substantive equality. Nevertheless, legislatures\naround the world had had to continually classify diverse groups and\nactivities for different purposes; a legislature was entitled to\npass laws that dealt with the problems stemming from the inherent\ninequality and differences pervasive in society. 23     The\nJudge proceeded to apply the “reasonable classification” test to s 377A.\nIt was clear, he held, that the classification prescribed by s 377A\nwas based on an intelligible differentia: there was little difficulty\nin determining who fell within and without the provision. The second-stage\ninquiry into whether the differentia was rationally related to the\nobject of s 377A was, however, fraught with difficulty. Determining\nthe purpose of legislation was not straightforward, and there were\nalso problems with the extent of over- or under-classification required\nbefore the court could find that a rational relation was absent.\nIn addition, there was a danger of engaging in tautological reasoning. 24     The\nJudge was of the view that the purpose of s 377A was to be determined\nat the time it was first introduced into Singapore’s Penal Code in\n1938. That purpose, he found, had remained unchanged to the present day:\n“[t]he act of males engaging in grossly indecent acts with other\nmales was to be criminalised” (seeLim Meng\nSuangat [67]). There was thus a “complete coincidence”\n(seeLim Meng Suangat [100]) between\nthe differentia in relation to the classification prescribed by\ns 377A and the object of that provision; the “reasonable classification”\ntest was clearly satisfied. Turning to the issue of legitimacy of\npurpose, the Judge held that the purpose of s 377A was legitimate\nbecause of the weight of historical practice and “deep seated feelings”\npertaining to procreation and family lineage (seeLim\nMeng Suangat [127]).",
        "The decision in Tan Eng Hong\n(substantive)": "25     The\nJudge commenced his judgment inTan Eng Hong\n(substantive)with an examination of Art 9(1), and held\nthat the reference to “law” therein had to include a reference to\nthe fundamental rules of natural justice. He observed that there\nwas a dearth of jurisprudence on the concept and scope of those\nrules. Nevertheless, he noted two possible types of legislation\nthat would not qualify as “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1), namely:\n(a) legislation aimed at securing the conviction of particular individuals;\nand (b) legislation that was absurd or arbitrary. 26     After\nconsidering statements from pro- as well as anti-homosexual groups,\nmedical and scientific bodies and court decisions, the Judge declined\nto find that homosexuality was a natural and immutable attribute. This\nrendered moot the argument that s 377A was an absurd law which was contrary\nto the fundamental rules of natural justice because it targeted\na natural and immutable attribute of a person. The Judge was also\nnot persuaded that s 377A was unconstitutional because it was too\nvague and uncertain. 27     In\nso far as the constitutional challenge under Art 12 was concerned, the\nJudge held that the “reasonable classification” test applied to\nall constitutional challenges based on this Article. He did not\nadopt the approach taken in the foreign authorities cited to him\nbecause those authorities factored in legal and extra-legal social,\neconomic, cultural and political considerations which were unique\nto their respective jurisdictions. The Judge also observed that\ns 377A could not be said to have an unsound purpose merely because\nthat purpose was to advance a certain allegedly controversial morality.\nFinally, the Judge ruled that there was a complete coincidence between\nthe differentia embodied in s 377A (viz,\nmale homosexuals or bisexual males who engage in acts of gross indecency\nwith another male within the meaning of the provision) and the purpose\nand object of the provision (viz,\nmaking male homosexual conduct an offence because such conduct was\nnot desirable).",
        "The parties’ respective cases\non appeal": "",
        "CA 54/2013": "28     Before\nthis court, Ms Barker submitted (in relation to CA 54/2013) that\nLim and Chee possessed the requisitelocus\nstandito challenge the constitutionality of s 377A for\nthe following reasons: (a)Tan Eng Hong (standing)made it clear\nthat where a person who was a member of the group defined by a purportedly\nunconstitutional statute (referred to hereafter as an “impugned\nstatute” where appropriate to the context) faced a real and credible\nthreat of prosecution under that statute, this was sufficient to\ngive himlocus standito challenge\nthe constitutionality of that statute under Art 12. Lim and Chee\nwere both sexually active male homosexuals falling within the group\ndefined by s 377A. They thus had thelocus\nstandito challenge s 377A as being violative of Art 12. (b)     With\nregard to Art 9, given Lim and Chee’s averment that their personal\nrights under that Article had been violated and that there was a\nreal controversy between the parties, this sufficed to establish theirlocus standito challenge the constitutionality\nof s 377A under that Article. 29     In\nterms of the substantive merits of CA 54/2013, Ms Barker argued that\ns 377A violated Art 12(1). Section 377A was said to be arbitrary\non its face as: (a) it ran foul of the concept of constitutional\nsupremacy wherein a State could not deprive minorities of their\nfundamental liberties simply because of popular moral sentiment;\nand (b) it criminalised acts that were legal for non-male homosexuals.\nSection 377A, it was contended, also failed the “reasonable classification”\ntest as the classification prescribed by that provision was not\nbased on an intelligible differentia; and even if the classification\ncould be said to be based on an intelligible differentia, that differentia\nbore no rational relation to the object of s 377A. Section 377A,\nit was further submitted, also violated Art 12(2) of the Singapore\nConstitution (“Art 12(2)”) because sexual orientation was a practically\nimmutable aspect of a person’s identity. 30     In\nrelation to Art 9, Ms Barker argued that s 377A violated Art 9(1). The\nright to life and personal liberty set out in Art 9(1), she submitted, should\nbe given a purposive interpretation to include a limited right of privacy.\nLife and personal liberty must, at their core, include a right of personal\nautonomy allowing a person to enjoy and express affection and love\ntowards another human being. 31     The\nRespondent, on its part, originally submitted that Lim and Chee lacked\nthe requisitelocus standito challenge\nthe constitutionality of s 377A. In particular, it argued that a\nreal controversy was required to establish standing and jurisdiction,\nand that such a controversy would only arise when the State took\naction pursuant to the impugned statute in question. However, in\na subsequent letter to Ms Barker dated 1 July 2014, the Respondent\nstated that it would not be pursuing its case on this particular point\nas it had not been raised before the Judge in the proceedings below. 32     In\nso far as the substantive issues in CA 54/2013 were concerned, the Respondent\nargued that s 377A did not violate Art 12(2). Article 12(2), the Respondent\nsubmitted, was exhaustive in terms of the prohibited grounds of\ndiscrimination set out therein, and was distinguishable from constitutional\nprovisions in other jurisdictions which explicitly enumerated sex\nor sexual orientation as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination.\nIt was further argued that: (a)     Section 377A\ndid not violate Art 12(1). A single standard of review should be\napplied to determine the constitutionality of an impugned statute\nunder Art 12(1), namely, the “reasonable classification” test. Applying\nthat test, the classification prescribed by s 377A was founded on\nan intelligible differentia which bore a rational relation to the\nlegislative purpose of the provision. The “reasonable classification”\ntest did not, and ought not to, require substantive judicial review\nof the legislative purpose of s 377A. In any case, the purpose of\ns 377A was constitutionally permissible. (b)     Section 377A\nalso did not violate Art 9(1). In this regard, comparative jurisprudence\nwas inapplicable. Reading Art 9(1) to entail a right to privacy\nwas contrary to the weight of authority, as well as the history,\ntext and structure of Art 9. In any case, s 377A was “law” for the\npurposes of Art 9(1).",
        "CA 125/2013": "33     In\nCA 125/2013, Mr Ravi made four arguments in relation to Art 12. First,\nhe submitted that the applicable test for determining the constitutionality\nof an impugned statute under Art 12 was not confined to the “reasonable\nclassification” test. Secondly, he contended that the classification\nprescribed by s 377A was not based on an intelligible differentia\nbecause s 377A was vague and “[did] not apply differentia based on\neither gender, sexual orientation or [the] nature of [the] sexual\nact”. Thirdly, the object of s 377A was, according to Mr Ravi, an\nexpression of animus by the majority against a minority, and was\ntherefore incompatible with the constitutional guarantee of individual\nfundamental freedoms against majoritarian oppression. Fourthly,\nit was argued that there was no rational relation between the purpose\nof s 377A and the differentia embodied in that section. 34     In\nrelation to Art 9, Mr Ravi argued that s 377A was inconsistent with that\nArticle for three reasons. First, s 377A was impermissibly vague\nin the scope of the activity which it purported to prohibit, thereby\ncreating not only doubt as to its effect, but also a substantial\nrisk of perversity or arbitrariness in its application. Secondly,\ns 377A was arbitrary inasmuch as the criminal penalty which it imposed\nserved no rational purpose in theory or in practice. Thirdly, s 377A\nwas absurd in that it criminalised, without any logically defensible\nreason, a minority of citizens on the grounds of a core aspect of\ntheir identity which was either unchangeable or suppressible only\nat a great personal cost. 35     In\nresponse to Mr Ravi’s submissions, the Respondent made the following\narguments with regard to Art 12. First, the established test for determining\nthe constitutionality of an impugned statute under Art 12(1) only\nrequired the classification prescribed by the impugned statute to\nbe founded on an intelligible differentia which bore a rational\nrelation to the purpose and object of the statute. Secondly, the\nrelevant classification in relation to s 377A was based on an intelligible\ndifferentia (viz, male homosexuals\nor bisexual males who engage in acts of gross indecency with another\nmale within the meaning of the provision), and that differentia\nwas rationally related to the purpose and object of the provision\n(viz, making male homosexual conduct\nan offence because such conduct was not desirable). Thirdly, Art 12(1)\ndid not contemplate judicial scrutiny of the legislative purpose\nof an impugned statute. Fourthly, Art 12(1) “[did] not impose any\nblanket prohibition on classifications based on sex or sexual orientation\nor ‘immutable’ characteristics, or on classifications that [were] ‘unreasonable’\nor ‘impermissible’” [emphasis in original omitted]. 36     The\nRespondent’s submissions in relation to Art 9 were as follows. First,\nArt 9(1) referred to “the deprivation of life in the sense of the\ndeath penalty, and personal liberty in the sense of the liberty\nof the person … and the freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention”.\nSecondly, s 377A was “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1) because\nit had a clear core of meaning and was not unconstitutionally vague.\nThirdly, Art 9(1) did not protect a person’s sexual identity or\norientation, regardless of whether or not that was an immutable\naspect of a person’s identity.",
        "The issues before this court": "",
        "The preliminary issues": "37     From\nthe procedural history set out above, it can be seen that the following\ntwo preliminary issues wereoriginallyraised\nin CA 54/2013: (a)     Do\nLim and Chee have the requisitelocus standito\nchallenge the constitutionality of s 377A? (b)     Should\nLim and Chee be allowed to amend their OS to include new arguments\ncentring on how s 377A violates Art 9? As noted above (at [31]), the Respondent indicated in its\nletter to Ms Barker dated 1 July 2014 that it was no longer pursuing\nthe first of the aforesaid preliminary issues – in particular, because\nthelocus standipoint had not been\nraised before the Judge in the proceedings below. By that same letter, the\nRespondent stated that it was also not objecting to Lim and Chee’s application\nfor leave to amend their OS to include new arguments centring on\nhow s 377A violated Art 9. Both of the above preliminary issues\nare therefore no longer live issues before this court. 38     We\nwould add that, in any event, had it been necessary for us to decide\nSUM 3664/2013, we would have allowed the application. In their supporting\naffidavit for SUM 3664/2013, Lim and Chee averred that the constitutionality\nof s 377A was a matter of public interest, and that the proposed\namendment to their OS would allow this court to consider the merits\nof all the arguments relating to whether or not s 377A was unconstitutional\nand determine once and for all whether s 377A violated Art 12 and/or\nArt 9. Lim and Chee further contended that there would be no prejudice\nto the Respondent if the proposed amendment to their OS were allowed. 39     The\ncourt has a wide discretion to allow an amendment of an OS at any\nstage of the proceedings on such terms as to costs or otherwise\nas may be just (see O 20 r 5(1) read with O 20 r 7 of the Rules\nof Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)). In a similar vein (although\nnot applicable in the present appeals), a party may introduce on\nappeal a new point not taken in the court below, but it must state\nthis clearly in its case (see O 57 r 9A(4)(b)). 40     We\nare of the view that Lim and Chee’s proposed amendment to their OS\nwould not cause the Respondent any prejudice which cannot be compensated\nin costs (see the decision of this court inReview\nPublishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal[2010]\n1 SLR 52 (“Review Publishing Co”)\nat [113]). The proposed amendment would give symmetry to the present\nappeals and allow a broader spectrum of arguments to be aired on\nan important constitutional point in the Singapore context.",
        "The substantive issues": "41     The\npresent appeals raise several overlapping arguments about the constitutionality\nof s 377A. These boil down to whether s 377A violates the following\nprovisions of the Singapore Constitution: (a)     Art 9(1); (b)     Art 12(1);\nand (c)     Art 12(2). We shall discuss each of these substantive issues in turn,\nbeginning with the issue of whether s 377A violates Art 9(1).",
        "Whether s 377A violates Art 9(1)": "42     Article 9,\npart of which was set out above at [2], provides as follows: Liberty\nof the person 9.—(1) No person shall be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with\nlaw. (2)    Where\na complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof that a\nperson is being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into\nthe complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful,\nshall order him to be produced before the Court and release him. (3)    Where a person is arrested, he shall\nbe informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall\nbe allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of\nhis choice. (4)    Where a person is arrested and not\nreleased, he shall, without unreasonable delay, and in any case\nwithin 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey), be\nproduced before a Magistrate, in person or by way of video-conferencing\nlink (or other similar technology) in accordance with law, and shall\nnot be further detained in custody without the Magistrate’s authority. (5)    Clauses (3) and (4) shall not apply\nto an enemy alien or to any person arrested for contempt of Parliament\npursuant to a warrant issued under the hand of the Speaker. (6)    Nothing in this Article shall invalidate\nany law — (a)    in force before the commencement\nof this Constitution which authorises the arrest and detention of\nany person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order;\nor (b)    relating\nto the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorises\nthe arrest and detention of any person for the purpose of treatment\nand rehabilitation, by reason of such law being inconsistent\nwith clauses (3) and (4), and, in particular, nothing in this Article\nshall affect the validity or operation of any such law before 10th March\n1978. 43     The\narguments raised by Mr Ravi and by Ms Barker on Art 9 in the present\nappeals are different. Ms Barker argues that the right to life and personal\nliberty under Art 9(1) should include a limited right to privacy\nand personal autonomy allowing a person to enjoy and express affection\nand love towards another human being. Mr Ravi, on the other hand,\ncontends that s 377A is vague, arbitrary and absurd. 44     In\nso far as Ms Barker’s arguments are concerned, our view is that\nthe right to privacy and personal autonomy which she canvassed should\nnot be read into the phrase “life or personal liberty” in Art 9(1)\nfor three reasons. 45First, such an interpretation of Art 9(1)\nwould be contrary to established Singapore jurisprudence. The phrase\n“personal liberty” in Art 9(1) refers only to the personal liberty\nof a person from unlawful incarceration or detention (seeTan Eng Hong (standing)at [120], affirmingLo Pui Sang and others v Mamata Kapilev Dave and\nothers (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and other appeals[2008]\n4 SLR(R) 754). Although the phrase “life” has not been authoritatively\ninterpreted by the Singapore courts, it should be interpreted narrowly\nin accordance with the jurisprudence on “personal liberty” and Art 9’s\ncontext and structure, which brings us to our next point. 46     Oursecondreason for rejecting Ms Barker’s\narguments on Art 9 is that the narrow interpretation of Art 9(1)\nwhich we have just mentioned above at [45] is (as the Respondent\nhas correctly argued) supported by the context and structure of\nArt 9 itself. Articles 9(2) to 9(4) provide various procedural safeguards\nin relation to the arrest and detention of a person. Article 9(2)\ngives expression to the common law prerogative writ ofhabeas corpus; Art 9(3) provides for an\narrested person’s right to counsel and the right to be informed\nof the grounds for his arrest; and Art 9(4) relates to the production\nof an arrested person before a magistrate within 48 hours. Articles 9(5)\nand 9(6) contain exceptions to the rights guaranteed to an arrested\nperson. Read in this context, it is clear that the phrase “life\nor personal liberty” in Art 9(1) refers only to a person’s freedom\nfrom an unlawful deprivation of life and unlawful detention or incarceration. 47Thirdly, protection against unlawful detention\nis the particular focus of Art 21 of the Indian Constitution, from\nwhich our Art 9 is derived. India’s Art 21 states that “[n]o person\nshall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according\nto procedure established by law”. As the Respondent has argued (again,\ncorrectly, in our view), the framers of India’s Art 21 consciously\nrejected the wider US formulation “without due process of law” in\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution, and\nenacted additional provisions similar to Singapore’s Art 9(3) and Art 9(4)\nto protect India’s citizenry against unlawful detention. There is\nno indication that they intended to impute an expansive meaning\ninto the phrase “life or personal liberty”. India’s Art 21 was the\nbasis for the “liberty of the person” provision in Art 5(1) of the\nMalaysian Constitution, which was later adopted in Singapore as\nArt 9(1). 48     In\na related vein, foreign cases that have conferred an expansive constitutional\nright to life and liberty should be approached with circumspection\nbecause they were decided in the context of their unique social,\npolitical and legal circumstances. For example, the Supreme Court\nof India has taken an expansive view of the right to life to include\nan individual’s right to health and medical care. This approach\nmust be understood in the context of India’s social and economic\nconditions (seeYong Vui Kongat\n[83]–[84]). A similarly broad approach has been adopted in the US\nbecause of the due process clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the US Constitution, which are materially different from our\nArt 9(1). 49     Indeed,\nit is significant that Ms Barker herself conceded that theprivatelaw relating to privacy was adevelopingone. It is clear that Lim and Chee\n(and likewise, Tan in CA 125/2013) cannot obtain by the (constitutional)\nbackdoor what they cannot obtain by the (private law) front door.\nIndeed, that would be a wholly inappropriate utilisation of the existing\nbody ofconstitutionallaw (which\nservesa quite differentfunction). More\nimportantly, as we have already noted above (at [30]), Lim and Chee base\ntheir Art 9(1) rights on a narrow conception of the right to privacy,viz, that the right to life and personal\nliberty under Art 9(1) should include a limited right to privacy\nand personal autonomy allowing a person to enjoy and express affection\nand love towards another human being. Once again, such a right ought,\nin our view, to be developed by way of theprivatelaw\non privacy instead. Indeed, we also observe that the right claimed\nby Lim and Chee, although of an apparently limited nature, is, in\npoint of fact, not only vague and general, but also contains within\nitself (contradictorily) the seeds of anunlimitedright.\nPut simply, such a right could be interpreted to encompass as well\nas legalise all manner of subjective expressions of love and affection,\nwhich could (in turn) embody content that may be wholly unacceptable\nfrom the perspective of broader societal policy. At this juncture,\nwe are, of course, back to “square one”, so to speak, for this brings us\nback (in substance at least) to the issue of whether or not s 377A\nought to enforce broader societal morality. 50     We\nturn now to Mr Ravi’s arguments on the alleged unconstitutionality\nof s 377A under Art 9. 51     First,\nwe do not think the phrase “act of gross indecency with another male\nperson” in s 377A is of such vagueness that would cause the provision to\nfall outside the classification of “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1).\nThe concept of indecency is not alien to Singapore legislation (see,\nfor example, s 145(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev\nEd) and s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev\nEd)), and we do not think there is any objectionable degree of vagueness\ninherent within s 377A itself. We would venture to suggest that\ns 377A prohibits, at its core, sexual acts between males. The Judge’s\nviews on the operation of s 377A (inTan Eng\nHong (substantive)at [76], [82] and [83]) were tentative\nin naturenotbecause the provision\nwas vague,butbecause the matter\nbefore him did not involve a criminal charge under s 377A. 52     Secondly,\ns 377A is not arbitrary. Mr Ravi’s submissions on this point are\nnot easily comprehensible, but they appear to suggest that there\nis no rational purpose for s 377A. Mr Ravi asserted, without any\nlegal substantiation whatsoever, that the purpose of s 377A in signalling\nsocietal disapproval of grossly indecent acts between males was\narbitrary. 53     Thirdly,\ns 377A is not absurd. Mr Ravi argued that s 377A was absurd because\nit criminalised a minority of citizens based on a core aspect of\ntheir identity which was either unchangeable or suppressible only\nat a great personal cost. As noted by the Respondent, Mr Ravi’s\nargument here closely resembles Ms Barker’s argument that “personal\nliberty” in Art 9(1) should be interpreted to include a limited\nright to privacy and personal autonomy. For the reasons given above,\nMr Ravi’s argument in this particular guise must likewise be rejected.\nIn so far as the supposed immutability of a person’s sexual orientation\nis concerned, the conflicting scientific views on this issue suggest\nthat there is, at present, no definitive conclusion, and it may\ntherefore be premature to express any conclusive views on it. Indeed, this\nis precisely one of theextra-legalarguments\nthat isnotwithin the remit of\nthis court (see above at [6]). 54     Let\nus turn now to the issue of whether s 377A violates Art 12(1).",
        "Whether s 377A violates Art 12(1)": "",
        "The relevant legal provisions": "55     To\nbegin our analysis of the constitutionality of s 377A under Art 12(1),\nit would be appropriate to not only set out Art 12(1) again, but also\nreproduce therestof Art 12 as\nwell, as thecontextof Art 12 (in particular,\nArt 12(2)) is, as we shall see, very significant. Article 12 reads\nas follows: Equal\nprotection 12.—(1)All\npersons areequal before the lawandentitled\nto the equal protection of the law. (2)Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution,\nthereshallbenodiscriminationagainstcitizens\nof Singaporeon the groundonlyofreligion,race,descentorplace of birth\nin anylaworinthe appointment\nto any office or employment under a public authorityorinthe administration\nof any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of\npropertyorthe establishing or carrying on of any trade, business,\nprofession, vocation or employment. (3)    This Article does not invalidate or\nprohibit — (a)    any provision regulating\npersonal law; or (b)    any\nprovision or practice restricting office or employment connected\nwith the affairs of any religion, or of an institution managed by\na group professing any religion, to persons professing that religion. [emphasis added in italics, underlined\nitalics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] 56     As\nthe constitutionality of s 377A is the central issue in these appeals, we\nalso set out this provision again, even though we have already done\nso at the outset of this judgment (see above at [3]): Outrages on\ndecency 377A.    Any\nmale person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission\nof, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male\nperson of, any act of gross indecency with another male person,\nshall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend\nto 2 years.",
        "The applicable test for constitutionality:\nthe “reasonable classification” test": "The test articulated 57     The\nestablished test in Singapore for determining the constitutionality of\na statute under Art 12 is the“reasonable classification”test.\nThis is clear from the relevant case law (see, for example,Ong Ah Chuan and another v Public Prosecutor[1979–1980]\nSLR(R) 710 (“Ong Ah Chuan”) at [37];Taw Cheng Kong (CA)at [58];Nguyen Tuong Vanat [70];Yong\nVui Kongat [109]; andTan Eng Hong\n(standing)at [124]). It should, however, be noted that\nthe “reasonable classification” test is not even engaged if the\nimpugned statute is not discriminatory in the first place. In the\nwords of Mohamed Azmi SCJ in the Malaysian Supreme Court decision\nofMalaysian Bar v Government of Malaysia[1987]\n2 MLJ 165 (“Malaysian Bar”) at 170 (referred\nto inTaw Cheng Kong (CA)at [58]): … The first question to be asked is, is\nthe law discriminatory, and that the answer should then be – if\nthe law is not discriminatory, it is good law … Indeed, the question set out in the above quotation has been\nreferred to as the first stage of “a three-stage inquiry” (see,\nfor example, the Singapore High Court decision ofTaw\nCheng Kong v Public Prosecutor[1998] 1 SLR(R) 78 at\n[32]; that decision was reversed by this court inTaw\nCheng Kong (CA), but without any apparent comment on\nthis particular point). Strictly speaking, however, the “reasonable\nclassification” test, in our view, comprises only two closely-related\nstages. 58     The\n“reasonable classification” test was articulated by,inter alia, this court inTaw\nCheng Kong (CA), which, after referring to the above\npassage fromMalaysian Bar, went\non to cite (at [58]) Azmi SCJ’s observations in that same case (viz,Malaysian Bar)\nas follows (at 170): … Discriminatory law is good law if it\nis based on ‘reasonable’ or ‘permissible’ classification, provided\nthat (i)    the\nclassification is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes\npersons that are grouped together from others left out of the group;\nand (ii)   the differentia has a rational relation\nto the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. The\nclassification may be founded on different bases such as geographical,\nor according to objects or occupations and the like. What is necessary\nis that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification\nand the object of the law in question. 59Taw Cheng Kong (CA)also cited (at [54])\nthe following comments by Lord Diplock in the Privy Council decision\nofOng Ah Chuan(at [35] and [37])\nwith approval: 35    All\ncriminal law involves the classification of individuals for the purposes\nof punishment, since it affects those individuals only in relation\nto whom there exists a defined set of circumstances – the conduct\nand, where relevant, the state of mind that constitute the ingredients\nof an offence.Equality before the law and\nequal protection of the law require that like should be compared\nwith like.What Art 12(1) of the\nConstitution assures to the individual is the right to equal treatment\nwith other individuals in similar circumstances. It prohibits laws\nwhich require that some individuals within a single class should\nbe treated by way of punishment more harshly than others; it\ndoes not forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between one\nclass of individuals and another class in relation to which there\nis some difference in the circumstances of the offences that has\nbeen committed. … 37    …\nProvided that the factor which the Legislature adopts as constituting the\ndissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears\na reasonable relation to the social object of the law, there is\nno inconsistency with Art 12(1) of the Constitution. [emphasis added; emphasis in original omitted] 60     Under\nthe “reasonable classification” test, therefore, a statute which prescribes\na differentiating measure will be consistent with Art 12(1) only if:\n(a) the classification prescribed by the statute is founded on an intelligible\ndifferentia;and(b) that differentia\nbears a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by\nthe statute (see alsoTan Eng Hong (standing)at\n[124]). The difficulties with the “reasonable\nclassification” test (1)   The true nature and\nfunction of the test 61     The\n“reasonable classification” test is not without its difficulties.\nThis has been articulated in the legal literature (see, for example,\nJoseph Tussman & Jacobus tenBroek, “The Equal Protection of\nthe Laws” (1949) 37 Cal L Rev 341). Perhaps because of the perceived\nlack of viable alternative tests and the very thorny nature of the\nconcept of equality itself (especially when it is to be applied\nin apracticalcontext), the cases\n(at least in the Singapore context) continue to endorse (only) the\n“reasonable classification” test as the test for determining the\nconstitutionality of a statute under Art 12. The concept of equality\nis thorny, not least because whilst it is eminently desirable (in\ntheory) to achieve equality, this (normative)idealfaces the (factual)realitythatinequality(in\nall its various forms) isan inevitable part\nof daily life. How, then, isthe\nlawto ensure that there is abasiclevel of equality, applying the principle\nof equalitygenerally, and more\nimportantly, inwhat situationswould\nsuch a level of equality be deemed to belegally\nmandated? As we shall see in a moment, the “reasonable\nclassification” test, whilst useful,does not\nreally address the fundamental questions just posed(see\nalso Peter Westen, “The Empty Idea of Equality” (1982) 95 Harv L Rev\n537). This is not surprising because (as we shall also see) thevery natureof the “reasonable classification”\ntest renders itincapableof furnishing\nthe requisite (or complete) normative as well as analytical impetus\n(let alone the requisite criterion or criteria) to answer these\nquestions. 62     However,\nit is also of the first importance to note, at this juncture, that this\ndoesnotmean that the “reasonable\nclassification” test ought to berejectedout\nof hand. That would be to throw the baby out together with the bathwater.\nAs we shall elaborate upon below, the “reasonable classification” test\nisan important threshold test,\nwithout which any attempt to determine whether or not Art 12 has\nbeen contravened by an impugned statute cannot even take off the\nground in the first place. We shall also see that if a particular\nstatute fails to pass legal muster under this test, it would mean that\nthat statuteis so legally illogical and/or\nincoherent that it would,ipso facto,\nbe repugnant to any idea of legal equality to begin with.\nThe reader would be forgiven for thinking that all this is rather\ngeneral and abstract. Indeed, it is. However, it sets the stage\nfor the more detailed analysis that follows. It would, in fact,\nbe appropriate at this juncture to turn to an explanation of why\nthe “reasonable classification” test functions only as athresholdlegal test. 63     It\nwill be recalled (see above at,inter alia,\n[60]) that the “reasonable classification” test states that a statute\nwhich prescribes a differentiating measure will be consistent with\nArt 12(1) only if: (a)theclassificationprescribed by the statute\nis founded on anintelligible differentia(referred\nto hereafter as either “the first limb” or “Limb (a)” of the “reasonable classification”\ntest);and(b)that\ndifferentiabearsa rational relationtothe purpose and objectsought to be achieved\nby the statute (referred to hereafter as either “the second limb”\nor “Limb (b)” of the “reasonable classification” test). It is our\nview that theunderlying rationaleof\nboth the aforementioned limbs of the “reasonable classification”\ntest is not only logical, but also commonsensical as well as self-evident.\nLet us elaborate. 64     In\nour view, whilst it is clear thatbothLimb (a)\nand Limb (b) must be satisfied in order for the “reasonable classification”\ntest as a whole to be satisfied, Limb (a) operatesprior\ntoLimb (b) inasmuch as if the classification concerned\nisnotbased on anintelligible\ndifferentiatobeginwith, then it is pointless for the court\nto ascertain whether Limb (b) has been satisfied (ie,\nwhetherthe differentiabearsa rational relationtothe purpose\nand objectsought to be achieved by the statute in question).\nThis is only logical and commonsensical: if there isnointelligible differentia tobegin with,thenthere\nisnoset ofintelligibledifferentiain existencethat can becompared\nwiththe purpose and object of the statute (which is\nthe pith and marrow of Limb (b)). 65     When,\nhowever, would a statutefailto\npass legal muster under thethresholdlegal\ncriterion embodied within Limb(a)?\nThe answer is that it would, in the nature of things,very seldombe the case. This is because\nthe differentia concerned need not be perfect; it need only be “intelligible”. This connotes (in turn)\narelatively low threshold that ought to avoid\nany consideration of substantive moral, political and/or ethical\nissues because these issues are potentially (and in most instances,\nactually) controversial. We should note, parenthetically,\nthat when we refer to “controversy” with respect to moral, political\nand/or ethical issues, we are not necessarily referring to anything\nsinister, malevolent or even insidious in nature becausereasonable persons can reasonably disagree on a myriad\nof issues which arise in moral, political and/or ethical contexts.More importantly, it is no business of the courts\nor the law generally to engage in the resolution of such issues\n– except to the extent necessary to resolve anylegalissue(s) at hand.\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the (legal) criterion centring\non the need for anintelligibledifferentia\nunder Limb(a)is (as already mentioned)a relatively low thresholdthat only requires\nthe differentia concerned to be based onintelligibility.\nIn this regard, the Judge observed thus inLim\nMeng Suang(at [47]): The First Limb [ie,\nLimb (a)] requires that the classification prescribed by the impugned\nlegislation must be based on an intelligible differentia. “Intelligible”\nmeans something that may be understood or is capable of being apprehended\nby the intellect or understanding, as opposed to by the senses. “Differentia”\nis used in the sense of a distinguishing mark or character, some attribute\nor feature by which one is distinguished from all others. Scientifically,\none talks of an attribute by which a species is distinguished from\nall other species of the same genus. 66     We\nagree with the Judge’s observations. They may appear value-neutral,\nbut that is precisely what, in our view, was intended by the criterion of\nintelligible differentia to begin with. Value-neutrality is not\nthe same as redundancy or an absence of functionality. As alluded\nto earlier, the “reasonable classification” test in general and\nits component limbs in particular are only intended to (and, in\nthe nature of things, can only) serve a minimalthresholdfunction\nof requiring logic and coherence in the statute concerned, without\nwhich the court cannot meaningfully proceed in any event to determine\nwhether that statute violates Art 12. 67     In\nthe context of Limb(a), what this\nmeans is that the differentia embodied in the impugned statute must\nnot only identify a clear distinguishing mark or character, but\nmustalsobeintelligible(as\nopposed to illogical and/or incoherent). In this regard, we would\ngo a little further than the Judge, although we think that our view\nis at least implicit within his observations in any event. In particular,\nwe are of the view that a differentia which is capable of being\nunderstood or which “is capable of being apprehended by the intellect\nor understanding” (seeLim Meng Suangat\n[47]) mayneverthelessstill beunintelligible to the extent that it isso unreasonable as to be illogical and/or incoherent.\nWe recognise that this last-mentioned proposition may open the doors\nto potential abuse, so we include the caveat that the illogicality\nand/or incoherence must be ofan extreme nature.\nIt must be so extreme thatno reasonable personwould\never contemplate the differentia concerned as being functional asintelligibledifferentia. Put simply,\nthe illogicality and/or incoherence of the differentia concerned\nmust be such that there can be no reasonable dispute (let alone controversy)\nas to that fact from a moral, political and/or ethical point of view\n(or, for that matter, any other point of view). Where such illogicality and/or\nincoherence is present, there is no point even beginning to talk about\nthe concept of equality (let alone whether there has been a violation of\nthe right to equality contrary to Art 12) becauseno\nreasonable classification even exists in the first place.\nIn such circumstances, Limb(b)isnot engaged at all. More generally, there\nwould be no way in which the statute concerned can possibly pass\nlegal muster in so far as the concept of equality embodied within\nArt 12 is concerned. 68     Assuming,\nhowever, that there is an intelligible differentia in place such\nthat Limb (a) of the “reasonable classification” test is in fact\nsatisfied, it mustfurtherbe demonstrated\nthat Limb (b) has been satisfiedas wellin order\nfor the “reasonable classification” test as a whole to be satisfied.\nTo recapitulate, where Limb (b) is concerned, it must be demonstrated\nthatthe differentiaidentified\npursuant to Limb (a) bearsa rational relationtothe purpose and objectsought to be achieved\nby the statute in question. It is clear that a prerequisite for\nthe satisfaction of Limb (b) is that thepurpose and\nobjectof the statute in questionmust\nfirst be determined or ascertained. Once that purpose\nand object has been determined or ascertained,a rational\nrelationbetween the differentia identified pursuant\nto Limb (a)andthat purpose and\nobject must then be demonstrated in order for Limb (b) to be satisfied.\nAgain, this is both logical as well as commonsensical: if there\nis no rational relation between the differentia identified pursuant\nto Limb (a) and the purpose and object of the statute concerned,\nthere is,ex hypothesi, no logical\nand/or coherent basis upon which to hold that the statute is based onreasonableclassification to begin with.\nAlthough the absence of such a rational relation can take many forms,\nit seems to us that the requisite rational relation will – more\noften than not – be found. This is because (as the Judge held inLim Meng Suangat [98]) there isnoneed fora perfectrelation\nor “completecoincidence” [emphasis\nadded] between the differentia in question and the purpose and object\nof the statute concerned. As the “reasonable classification” test\nitself prescribes, the relation need only be arationalone.\nThat having been said, this doesnot necessarilymean that\na rational relation willalwaysbe\nfound to exist by the courts. For example, if there isa clear disconnectbetween the purpose\nand object of the impugned statute on the one hand and the relevant\ndifferentia on the other, the “reasonable classification” test will\nbe heldnotto have been satisfied. But,\nall this is easily stated in the abstract. What will determine the\nfinal outcome in any given case will bethe\nspecific facts as well as contextbefore the court. We\nshould add, at this juncture, that ascertaining the purpose and\nobject of a statute will not always be easy. Indeed, as we shall\nsee later in this judgment (below at [116]–[152]), ascertaining\nthe purpose and object of s 377A is both an extremely complex as\nwell as extremely difficult exercise. 69     As\nis the position with regard to Limb (a), the key inquiry under Limb (b)\ndoesnotreally address the concept\nofequalityas such. Its focus,\nas explained above, is primarily logical as well as commonsensical.\nPut simply, if there is no rational relation between the relevant\ndifferentia on the one hand and the purpose and object of the statute\nconcerned on the other, there is (again) no point even beginning\nto talk about the concept of equality (let alone whether there has\nbeen a violation of the right to equality contrary to Art 12) becausenoreasonable classification even existsin the first place. Furthermore, if Limb (b)\nis not satisfied, it would also follow that the statute in questioncannot possiblysatisfy the concept of\nequality embodied within Art 12in any event–\na result that will likewise obtain if Limb (a) is not satisfied\n(as noted above at [64] and [67]). 70     It\nshould be noted that the threshold nature of the “reasonable classification”\ntest helps tobalancethe need to\naccord as much legislative leeway as possible to the legislature\nagainst the need to ensure that laws which are patently illogical\nand/or incoherent do not pass legal muster. In a related vein, this\ntest simultaneously prevents the courts from becoming “mini-legislatures”\n(a point which is dealt with in more detail below, especially at\n[77]). 71     As\nmentioned above at [61]–[62], the fact that the “reasonable classification”\ntest is a threshold test which does not in itself furnish the requisite\ncriteria for determining whether the right to equality under Art 12 has\nbeen violated doesnotmean that\nthis test ought therefore to be dispensed with. Indeed, it is quitethe opposite. As we pointed out earlier\n(at [62] above), the “reasonable classification” test serves a minimal\n–but vital– threshold function\nof requiring logic and coherence in the statute concerned, without\nwhich the court cannot meaningfully proceed to determine whether\nthat statute contravenes Art 12. Put simply, there is no point analysing\nthe statute concerned from the perspective of the concept of equality\nif the “reasonable classification” test is not even satisfied in\nthe first place.Looked at in this light, the\n“reasonable classification” test is by no means a merely mechanical\nor purely procedural test. It does, in fact, contain substantive\nelements.That having been said, it is important to reiterate\nat the same time that the “reasonable classification” testin itselfdoes not really aid the court\nin ascertaining whether or not the concept of equality under Art 12(1)has been violated. Let us elaborate. (2)   The “reasonable classification”\ntest in relation to the concept of equality in Art 12(1) 72     It\nwill be recalled that Art 12(1) reads as follows: Equal\nprotection 12.—(1) All persons areequal before the lawandentitled to the equal protection of the law. … [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined\nbold italics] 73     It\nwill be seen that Art 12(1) comprises two main limbs. Thefirststates that “[a]ll persons areequal before the law” [emphasis added].\nNo reasonable person would seriously attempt to controvert this\nparticular statement as it is just and fair from both a logical\nas well as an intuitive point of view. However, what precisely does\nit mean when we state that “[a]ll persons are equal before the law”?\nIn the first place, what does the phrase “the law” in this particular\nlimb of Art 12(1) mean? Does it refer tothe\nlaw in general? If so, then this particular limb is no\nmore than adeclaratorystatement\nthat is, as just alluded to, self-evident. Alternatively, does the\nphrase “the law” refer specifically to the statute that is sought\nto be impugned as being inconsistent with Art 12(1) and, hence,\nunconstitutional pursuant to Art 4? In the context of the present\nappeals, “the law” would then refer to s 377A. But, even if that\nbe the case, this limb of Art 12(1) does not really assist us in\nso far as the concept of equality is concerned – onwhat\nlegal basis and on what legal criterion (or criteria)can\nthe court find that a particular person or group of persons has\nnot been accorded equality of treatment in relation to s 377A? Presumably,\nall those who fall within the scope of s 377A would be considered\nto be “equal” before that particular provision, but that would hardly\nbe an argument which the Appellants would want to rely upon. If\nthe Appellants seek to argue that they are not being accorded equal\ntreatment because s 377A applies only to them (ie, Lim,\nChee and Tan) and no other male homosexuals, that would be an entirely\nseparate and distinct argument which would require a separate criterion\n(or set of criteria) for determining whether the Appellants’ Art 12(1)\nrights have indeed been violated. 74     What,\nthen, about the second limb of Art 12(1), which states that “[a]ll\npersons are …entitled to the equal protection\nof the law” [emphasis added]? As in the case of the first\nlimb, what does “the law” in this second limb refer to? If it refers\ntothe law in general, then, likewise\nas in the case of the first limb, the second limb would be no more\nthan adeclaratorystatement which\nis, by its very nature, self-evident. Alternatively, if the phrase\n“the law” in the second limb of Art 12(1) refers to the impugned statute\n(in the present appeals, s 377A), this would be of no assistance\nto the Appellants since they arenotseeking\nequalprotectionunders 377A.\nIndeed, what they desire isquite different,\nin that what they are seeking isprotection fromprosecution unders 377A. 75     It\nshould be noted that Ms Barker, in her oral submissions before this court,\nwas of the view that the two aforementioned limbs of Art 12(1) ought to\nbe read as an integrated whole. We agree with this to the extent\nthat the second limb follows from the first. However, this does\nnot preclude (for the purposes of analytical clarity) the approach\nto the two limbs which has just been set out.",
        "Is there an additional test\nof illegitimacy?": "76     We\npause at this juncture to deal with the Judge’s observation inLim Meng Suangthat a statute can still\nbe rendered unconstitutionaleven ifit satisfies\nthe “reasonable classification” test,providedit\ncan be demonstrated that theobjectof\nthat statute isillegitimate(at\n[114]–[116]). Not surprisingly, the Appellants have endorsed this\nparticular proposition. We also note that counsel for the Respondent,\nMr Aedit Abdullah SC (“Mr Abdullah”), whilst not purporting to endorse\nthis propositionin toto, indicated\nthat he was willing (but only by way of a fallback argument) to admit\nto a test ofunreasonablenessalong\nthe lines embodied in this court’s decision inYong\nVui Kong(at [111]–[119]) and the seminal English Court of\nAppeal decision ofAssociated Provincial Picture\nHouses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation[1948] 1 KB\n223 (“Wednesbury”) (cfLim Meng Suangat [116]). We note, parenthetically,\nthat there was no real elaboration by Mr Abdullah with regard to\nthe Respondent’s reliance onYong Vui Kongin\nthis connection. In so far as the test of unreasonableness inWednesburyis concerned, Lord Greene MR\n(with whom Somervell LJ and Singleton J agreed) described the requisite\nlevel of unreasonableness as involving (in the context of administrative\nlaw) a decision or conclusion that was “so unreasonable that no\nreasonable [public] authority could ever have come to it” (seeWednesburyat 230 and 234). We would,\nwith respect,differfromallthese aforementioned views. Let us\nelaborate. 77     It\nis important to commence our analysis in this regard by referring\nto a fundamental proposition that constitutes part of the wider\nconcept of the separation of powers. Put simply, the courts areseparate and distinct fromthe legislature.\nMore specifically, whilst the courts do “make” law, this is only\npermissible in the context of the interpretation of statutes and\nthe development of the principles of common law and equity. It isimpermissible forthe\ncourtsto arrogate to themselveslegislative\npowers– to become, in other words, “mini-legislatures”.\nThis must necessarily be the case because the courts have no mandate\nwhatsoever to create or amend laws in a manner which permits recourse\ntoextra-legal policy factors as well as considerations.\nThe jurisdiction as well as the power to do so lie exclusively within\nthe sphere ofthe legislature. Indeed,\nthe power of the legislature to enact and amend laws is governed\nby quite a different procedure. Hence, the duty of a court is tointerpretstatutes enacted by the legislature;\nitcannot amend or modify statutesbased\non its own personal preference or fiat as that would be an obvious\n(and unacceptable) usurpation of thelegislativefunction. 78     The\nlegislative powers which we have just discussed are different from the\ncourt’s role in developing the law – a task which it frequently undertakes.\nAs already alluded to above, the courts do indeed develop the principles\nof common law and equity. Indeed, as Lord Reid famously observed\nin an extra-judicial lecture (see “The Judge As Law Maker” (1972–1973)\n12 JSPTL (NS) 22 (“The Judge As Law Maker”)\nat p 22): There was a time when it was thought almost\nindecent to suggest that judges make law – they only declare it.\nThose with a taste for fairy tales seem to have thought that in\nsome Aladdin’s cave there is hidden the Common Law in all its splendour\nand that on a judge’s appointment there descends on him knowledge\nof the magic words Open Sesame. Bad decisions are given when the\njudge has muddled the pass word and the wrong door opens. But we\ndo not believe in fairy tales any more. 79     The\nprocess of such development is, however,quite\ndifferentfrom the process oflegislativeenactment\nor amendment of legislation, and is effected throughdevelopment of case law. In this regard,\nit should be noted thatthe legislaturecanrejectexisting principles of common law\nand equity. Put simply, the legislature can enact a statuteoverrulingan existing principle of common\nlaw or equity if the legislature thinks it fit to do so. However, absent\nsuch a situation, the courts can – and do – develop the principles\nof common law and equity. 80     A\nparadigm example of this may be seen in the law of negligence, commencing\nwith the seminal House of Lords decision ofM’Alister\n(or Donoghue) (Pauper) v Stevenson[1932] AC 562 (more\ncommonly cited as “Donoghue v Stevenson”\nand referred to hereafter as “Donoghue”).\nThis decision effected a sea change in this foundational area of\nthe law of tort (see generally the valuable background prior to\nthis decision furnished in Edward H Levi,An\nIntroduction to Legal Reasoning(University of Chicago Press,\n1949), as well as equally valuable background pertaining to the decision\nitself in Geoffrey Lewis,Lord Atkin(Butterworths,\n1983; reprinted, Hart Publishing, 1999) at pp 51–67; see also Matthew\nChapman,The Snail and the Ginger Beer: The\nSingular Case of Donoghue v Stevenson(Wildy, Simmonds\n& Hill Publishing, 2009) andThe Juridical\nReview – Donoghue v Stevenson: The Paisley Papers(Special Edition) (2013)). Indeed, the\nlaw of negligence has developed even further sinceDonoghue.\nFor example, the House of Lords extended the law of negligence to\ncover liability for negligent misstatements in its path-breaking\ndecision inHedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller\n& Partners Ltd[1964] AC 465 (“Hedley\nByrne”). In this regard, and several years prior to the\ndecision of the House inHedley Byrne, Denning LJ\n(as he then was) adopted precisely the legal position which was ultimately\nendorsed inHedley Byrneitself,\nbut found himself in aminorityin\nthe English Court of Appeal decision ofCandler\nv Crane, Christmas & Co[1951] 2 KB 164 (“Candler v Crane”). Indeed, Denning LJ\nsignificantly referred in an extra-legal context to his powerful\ndissenting judgment inCandler v Craneas\nhis “most important judgment” (see Lord Denning’s “Foreword” to\nthe inaugural volume of theDenning Law Journal([1986] Denning LJ\n1 at p 1)). In the course of delivering his judgment in that case, Denning LJ\ndrew a distinction (at 178) between “timorous souls who were fearful\nof allowing a new cause of action” and “bold spirits who were ready to\nallow it [viz, a new cause of action]\nif justice so required”. Indeed, the ultimate vindication by the\nHouse of Lords inHedley Byrneof\nDenning LJ’s views inCandler v Cranebears\nample testimony to the virtues of the courts being “bold spirits”.\nAnd something of that spirit can be seen in the course of the development\nof the law of negligence in countries where English law has been\ntransplanted – as witnessed, for example, in the decision of this court\ninSpandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence\nScience & Technology Agency[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (see\nalso generally the valuable survey as well as analysis in David\nTan & Goh Yihan, “The Promise of Universality – TheSpandeckFormulation Half a Decade on”\n(2013) 25 SAcLJ 510). 81     The\nbriefest of summaries of the development of the law of negligence set\nout in the preceding paragraph is but one illustration not only\nof the nature of the courts’ development of the principles of common\nlaw and equity, but also (and more importantly in the context of\nthe present appeals) of the fact that the courts will not hesitate\nto develop the lawin appropriate circumstances,\ntaking on the nature of “bold spirits” in those circumstances (indeed,\nMs Barker herselfsupportedthis\nparticular point by citing decisions of this court on the development\nofthe common lawin her further\nwritten reply submissions in an attempt to persuade this court to adopt\na more activist approach towards the interpretation of Art 12(1);\nthe decisions which she cited in this regard wereLau\nSiew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another[2008] 2 SLR(R)\n108 andChandran a/lSubbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd (Owners of the Ship\nor Vessel “Tasman Mariner”, third party)[2009] 3 SLR(R)\n995).However, inothersituations,\nthe courts will necessarily be more circumspect. This is especially\nthe case with respect to matters which are uniquely within the sphere\nofthe legislature. Whilst, for\nexample, a court will not hesitate tointerpreta\nstatute, it willnot – indeed, cannot – amend\nor modifya statutebased\non its own personal preference or fiat (or evenitsview\nof whatit thinksthe relevantextra-legal considerations should be)\nbecause (as already noted above at [77]) that would be an obvious\nand unacceptable usurpation of thelegislativefunction. 82     Here,\nwe come to the crux of the issue at hand. To permit the court the\npower –over and aboveits power\nof scrutinising legislation pursuant tothe\n“reasonable classification” test –to declare a statute\ninconsistent with Art 12(1) (and, therefore, unconstitutional under\nArt 4) because theobjectof that\nstatute isillegitimate would precisely be\nto confer on the court a licence to usurp the legislative function\nin the course of becoming (or at least acting like) a “mini-legislature”.\nPut another way,only the legislature has the power\nto review its own legislation and amend legislation accordingly\nif it is of the view that this is necessary. Thecourts, in contrast, havenosuch\npower –nor ought they to have such power. 83     Indeed,\nto argue, as the Appellants seemed to do, that the court has the\nduty to declare a statute unconstitutional if its object is “illegitimate”does not explain the legal basis upon which the court\ncan find the object to be illegitimate in the first place.\nIf the argument is that the object of the statute is illegitimate\nbecause that object is unconstitutional, this would lead to a circularity\nwhich,ex hypothesi, lacks the requisite\nexplanatory as well as normative power. The courts are called upon\n– and ought – to be “bold spirits”,butonlyonappropriateoccasions.Put\nsimply, theycannotclaim to act\nas “bold spirits”when they are in fact acting\noutside their proper sphere of jurisdiction.This point\nwill become particularly important in the analysis below – especially\nin the face of the Appellants’ calls to this court to update the\nlaw on s 377A based purely onextra-legal argumentswhich\nareappropriate onlyin thelegislativesphere.Put\nsimply but clearly, to permit the court to effectively amend (as\nopposed to interpret) the law in this area would not only entail\nthe court acting beyond its jurisdiction, but also permit the Appellants\nto obtain by the (judicial) backdoor what they ought to have sought\nto obtain by the (legislative) front door. 84     That\nhaving been said,an important qualificationis\nin order at this juncture. The important qualification is this:\nto the extent that there areserious flawswith\nregard to theintelligibilityof\nthe differentia embodied in a statute and/or aclear\ndisconnectbetween that differentia and the purpose and\nobject of the statute, the court will hold that the statute does\nnot pass legal muster under Art 12(1).This\nmay be viewed, in substance at least, as introducing a limitedelement of illegitimacywhich\nis embodied in the “reasonable classification” test.However, it is vitally important to note that this\nelementof illegitimacy isnotan additional\ntest over and above the “reasonable classification” test; it is,instead, no more than an application of the “reasonable\nclassification” test.The onlylegaltest\nfor the purposes of Art 12(1) is the “reasonable classification”\ntest, and it is important to note that in applying this test, the\ncourt would be applying alegaltest that is not based on extra-legal considerations,but rather, one that is clearly within its remit\nas a court of law(as opposed to\nacting as if it were a “mini-legislature”). 85     Put\nsimply, in determining the constitutionality of an impugned statute\nunder Art 12(1), there areno legal standardswhich\ncan guide the court in ascertaining whether the object of that statute\nis illegitimate. In the nature of things, any purported standards\nwould beextra-legalin nature. This\nbrings us back to the point just made – thatthe\nlegislatureis the appropriate forum to canvass the issue\nof whether or not the object of a particular statute is illegitimate\nbecause the extra-legal standards pertinent to such an issue would\nbe quintessentially within the sphere of legislative review. 86     At\nthis juncture, we note (as mentioned above at [76]) that Mr Abdullah\nwas prepared (albeit only by way of a fallback position) to endorse\nthe test inWednesbury. This particular\ntest is premised on the concept ofunreasonableness.\nWhilst it does constitute a legal standard, it is not, in our view,\nan appropriate legal standard in the context of a challenge to theconstitutionalityof a statute. More importantly,even ifthe concept of unreasonableness\nlaid down inWednesburywere applicable,\nit would not aid this court inasmuch as the present constitutional\nchallenge to s 377A is premised onextra-legalarguments\nwhich, as we have already noted, are quintessentially within the\npurview ofthe legislature. It also\nbears reiterating what has just been alluded to above at [84] –viz, that in situations ofextreme illogicality and/or incoherence,\nthe statute concerned would probablynotbe\nable to pass legal muster under oneorboth\nlimbs ofthe “reasonable classification” testin\nany event. Indeed, in such situations, the statute might possibly\ninfringeotherArticles of the Singapore Constitution\nas well (cfalsoLim\nMeng Suangat [116]). 87     We\nnote that Ms Barker citedReport of the Constitutional Commission\n1966(27 August 1966) (“the 1966 Report”), the report\nof the constitutional commission chaired by the then Chief Justice Wee\nChong Jin, to buttress her argument that Art 12(1)ought\nto be invoked by this court (via a declaration of s 377A’s unconstitutionality)\nin order to ensure that the Appellants were accorded equality before\nthe law. In particular, Ms Barker referred to para 32 of the 1966\nReport, which dealt with Art 8 of the then Constitution of Malaysia\n(the equivalent of Singapore’s present Art 12) and which stated\nas follows: We deal now with Article 8 of the present\nConstitution of Malaysia. Having regard to our Terms of Reference,\nour recommendations on the form and substance that this Article\nshould take and contain will constitute the very core of our views\non the whole problem of minority rights in Singapore.In the first place we deem it essential that the\nprinciple of equality before the law and equal protection of the\nlaw for all persons should be clearly and categorically laid down.Secondly, it should be no less clearly and categorically\nlaid down that there shall beno\ndiscriminationin any law or in the\neffect of any law, except as expressly authorised by the Constitution, against\nany citizen on the groundonlyofrace, religion,\nplace of birthordescent.Lastly, it should also be clearly and categorically\nlaid down that there shall beno\ndiscriminationin the administration\nof any law, except as expressly authorised by the Constitution,\nagainst any person on the groundonlyofrace, religion,\nplace of birthordescent. [emphasis added in italics, bold\nitalics and underlined bold italics] 88     Ms Barker\nrelied on all the italicised words set out in the above quotation\nto support the argument mentioned in the preceding paragraph. In\nour view, the sentence “In the first place we deem it essential\nthat the principle of equality before the law and equal protection\nof the law for all persons should be clearly and categorically laid\ndown” is buta paraphrase ofthe\nlanguage of Art 12(1) itself, and to that extent, is clearly declaratory and\naspirational in nature (see also below at [90]). For the reasons explained\nabove (at [73]–[74]), this particular sentence (like the words in Art 12(1))\ndoes not really set out any concretelegalprinciples\nwhich can guide the courts, such as the “reasonable classification”\ntest. Indeed, the “reasonable classification” test itself was formulated\nby the courts, and it does (as we have explained above) furnish\nthe courts with particularlegalprinciples\nthat give effect (albeit not fully) to the concept of equality embodied\nin Art 12(1). Significantly, the last two sentences of para 32 of\nthe 1966 Report, which correspond to Art 12(2),\nreferspecificallyto the concept of\n“discrimination” [emphasis added],\nalbeit in the context of the proscription of discriminationon specific grounds(as opposed to a general proscription\nof discrimination as such). Indeed, that thespecific\nand applicable principles relating to the right to equality under\nthe Singapore Constitution are located in Art 12(2) – rather than\nArt 12(1) – is confirmed by the following extract from the very\nnext paragraph of the 1966 Report (viz, para 33): We consider, having regard tothe multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual and\nmulti-religious composition of the population of Singapore and of\nits citizens, thatthe recommendations\nwe have outlined in the preceding paragraphwill not\nonlyform an impregnable shield against racial communalism\nand religious bigotry as well as an effective weapon to wipe away any\nfears the minorities may harbour concerning discriminatory treatment\nbut will also lay a firm and lasting foundation on which to build\na democratic, equal and just multi-racial society in Singapore.\n… [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] Read in its proper context, the reference to “recommendations”\nin the extract just quoted is clearly a reference to the principles\nembodied in Art 12(2), andnotArt 12(1). 89     This\nwould be an appropriate point to turn to a consideration of the legal\nrelationship between Art 12(1) and Art 12(2).",
        "The legal relationship between\nArt 12(1) and Art 12(2)": "Art 12(1) and Art 12(2) read\ninter se 90     To\nrecapitulate, the analysis proffered above at [73]–[74] is that Art 12(1)appears to be more of adeclaratory (as well as aspirational) statement of\nprinciples, as opposed to a set of specific legal criteria\nas such. This is, perhaps, not surprising as Art 12(1) is framed\nata very general level. Indeed,\nas alluded to in the analysis proffered above, the two limbs of Art 12(1)\nare both logically and intuitively attractive, and their content would\nnot be something that a reasonable and fair-minded person would seriously\ncontrovert. However, it is perhaps precisely because Art 12(1) is framed\nat such a general level that it does not furnish thespecificlegal criteria which can guide\nthe courts in determining, in specific fact situations, whether\na particular statute violates Art 12. That having been said, it\nbears reiterating that any statutemustnevertheless\npass (threshold) muster under the“reasonable\nclassification” testbefore it can be found to be consistent\nwith Art 12. More importantly, we emphasise that what we have just\nsaid (about the lack of specific legal criteria in Art 12(1)) doesnotmean that there are no specific legal\ncriteria which can guide the court in specific fact situations.\nOn the contrary,in additionto\nthe“reasonable classification” test,\nArt 12(2)furnishes specific as\nwell as concrete legal criteria which ensure that any statute which\nisdiscriminatory within the scope and meaning\nof Art 12(2)(and, hence, contravenes the concept of\nequality embodied in Art 12) will, pursuant to Art 4, be void to\nthe extent of such contravention and inconsistency. On a practical\nlevel, parties are free to challenge the constitutionality of a\nstatute under Art 12(1) or Art 12(2) or, indeed, under both provisions\n(as was the case here). The court’s decision on the constitutionality\n(or otherwise) of the impugned statute would ultimately depend on\nthe particular facts and circumstances of the case. 91     Article 12(2)\n(also set out earlier at [55] above) reads as follows: (2)Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution,\nthereshallbenodiscriminationagainstcitizens\nof Singaporeon the groundonlyofreligion,race,descentorplace of birth\nin anylaworinthe appointment\nto any office or employment under a public authorityorinthe administration\nof any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of\npropertyorthe establishing or carrying on of any trade, business,\nprofession, vocation or employment. [emphasis added in\nitalics, underlined italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] 92     It\ncan immediately be seen that Art 12(2) furnishesspecific\nlegal criteria as to what constitutes discrimination andis therefore prohibited from a constitutional perspective.\nIn many ways, the approach adopted in Art 12(2) is more structured\nand principled compared to the approach under open-ended constitutional\nprovisions in some other jurisdictions that place the courts in\nthe unenviable position of being (in effect) “mini-legislatures”\nof sorts. It is also noteworthy (indeed, crucial, in so far as the present\nappeals are concerned) that within the prohibited grounds of discrimination\ndelineated in Art 12(2), there isno reference\nto “sex”, “sexual orientation” or “gender”. This is not\nsurprising. Not all Constitutions will be exactly the same. Each\nConstitution is supposed to reflect the social mores of the society\nwhich it emanates from. It is true that such social mores can – and\noften will – change over time. However, there is nothing precluding\na legislature fromamendingthe\nConstitution accordingly. In the Singapore context, the provision\ngoverning amendment of the Singapore Constitution is Art 5(2), which\nstates: A Bill seeking to amend any provision in\nthis Constitution shall not be passed by Parliament unless it has\nbeen supported on Second and Third Readings by the votes of not\nless than two-thirds of the total number of the elected Members\nof Parliament. An amendment of the Singapore Constitution is obviouslybeyondthe remit of our courts. It is\nnevertheless important to emphasise that the possibility of constitutional\namendment just referred to furnishes our Parliament withthe necessary flexibility to ensure that the Singapore\nConstitution reflects theprevailingsocial mores as well as aspirations of Singapore\nsociety. 93     Before\nproceeding to consider some other constitutional provisions in a\ncomparative context, we ought to briefly address a further argument\nby Ms Barker based on the fact that Art 12(2) appliesonlytocitizens\nof Singapore. She argued that in contrast, Art 12(1)\nwas framed more broadly to apply to “[a]llpersons”\n[emphasis added], and hence (citing the paragraph of the 1966 Report\nquoted above at [87]), Art 12(1) ought to be given anexpansiveinterpretation that goesbeyondthe “reasonable classification”\ntest so as to accord equal protection to all persons.However, that brings us back full circle\nto the difficulties outlined above (especially at [77]) to the effect\nthat the courts would then become “mini-legislatures”. Indeed, the\nargument proffered by Ms Barker is a double-edged legal sword inasmuch\nas if Art 12(1) could be construed and applied in the broad manner\nwhich she suggested, why, then, was it necessary to promulgate Art 12(2)? After all, taking the broad approach\ncanvassed by Ms Barker, every prohibited ground of discrimination\nreferred to in Art 12(2) wouldnecessarilybesubsumedunder Art 12(1) and Art 12(2)\nwould then be rendered redundant.In any event,\nnothing in this particular argument by Ms Barker impacts the respective\ncases of not only her clients but also Mr Ravi’s client inasmuch\nas all the Appellants are citizens of Singapore. Be that\nas it may, it also bears emphasising that even though we do not\naccept Ms Barker’s argument that an expansive interpretation should\nbe given to Art 12(1), this doesnotmean\nthatnon-citizens arewithout any rights. They have rights under\nArt 12(1), in that they can avail themselves ofthe “reasonable\nclassification” test. Indeed, it can be said thatthis is the general legal position in any event.\nIt should also be borne in mind that non-citizens are also entitled\nto other specific fundamental rights under the Singapore Constitution,\nsome of which are set out in the next paragraph. 94     It\nis also not – in principle – unfair thatcitizens\nof Singaporeare givenfurther (and\nentrenched) rights under Art 12(2). Indeed, there are\nother fundamental rights in Pt IV of the Singapore Constitution\nwhichonly citizens of Singaporecan\navail themselves of (see, for example, Art 13 in relation to the\nprohibition of banishment and the right to freedom of movement;\nArt 14 in relation to the right of freedom of speech, assembly and\nassociation (see also the decision of this court inReview\nPublishing Coat [254] and [257]); and Art 16(1) in relation\nto rights in respect of education). However, there are also many\nother Articles in Pt IV of the Singapore Constitution which (probably\nbecause they impactanyperson inthe most fundamentalmanner) apply toallpersons (see, for example, Arts 9(1)–9(4)\nin relation to liberty of the person; Art 10(1) in relation to the\nprohibition of slavery and forced labour; Art 11 in relation to\nprotection against retrospective criminal laws and repeated trials;\nand Art 15 in relation to freedom of religion). In any event, the\nquestion of whether or notnon-citizens\nshould be given similar rights as citizens of Singapore in the present\ncontext, whether with respect to some or all of the prohibited grounds\nof discrimination set out in Art 12(2) (or, albeit less probably, outside\nArt 12(2)) is obviously something beyond the remit of the courts, and,\nas already mentioned, is in any event irrelevant on the facts of\nthe present appeals. Comparative constitutional provisions (1)   Constitutional provisions\nwhich make express reference to “sex”, “sexual orientation” and/or\n“gender” 95     It\nis instructive, in our view, that incontrast\ntoArt 12(2), there are constitutional\nprovisions from other jurisdictions whichexpressly\nprohibit discrimination on the grounds of “sex”, “sexual orientation”\nor “gender” (or a combination thereof). 96     One\nexample is Art 8(2) of the Malaysian Constitution. The material part\nof Malaysia’s Art 8 reads as follows: Equality 8.(1) All persons are equal\nbefore the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law. (2)    Except\nas expressly authorized by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination\nagainstcitizenson the ground only\nof religion, race, descent, place of birth orgenderin\nany law or in the appointment to any office or employment under\na public authority or in the administration of any law relating\nto the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing\nor carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 97     Turning\nto the Indian Constitution, which prohibits discrimination on the\ngrounds of (inter alia) sex, the\nrelevant Articles on the right to equality read as follows: Right\nto equality 14. Equality before law.—The\nState shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the\nequal protection of the laws within the territory of India. 15. Prohibition of\ndiscrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste,sexor place of\nbirth.—(1) The State shall not discriminate againstany citizenon grounds only of religion,\nrace, caste,sex, place of birth\nor any of them. (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of\nreligion, race, caste,sex, place\nof birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability,\nrestriction or condition with regard to— (a) access\nto shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment;\nor (b) the\nuse of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort\nmaintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the\nuse of the general public. (3) Nothing in this article shall prevent\nthe State from making any special provision for women and children. (4) Nothing in this article or in clause (2)\nof article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision\nfor the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes\nof citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. (5) Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g)\nof clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making\nany special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially\nand educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled\nCastes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions\nrelate to their admission to educational institutions including private\neducational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State,\nother than the minority educational institutions referred to in\nclause (1) of article 30. 16. Equality of opportunity\nin matters of public employment.—(1) There shall be equality\nof opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment\nor appointment to any office under the State. (2)No citizenshall,\non grounds only of religion, race, caste,sex,\ndescent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible\nfor, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office\nunder the State. (3) Nothing in this article shall prevent\nParliament from making any law prescribing, in regard to a class\nor classes of employment or appointment to an office under the Government\nof, or any local or other authority within, a State or Union territory,\nany requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory\nprior to such employment or appointment. (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent\nthe State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments\nor posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the\nopinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services\nunder the State. (4A) Nothing in this article shall prevent\nthe State from making any provision for reservation in matters of\npromotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes\nof posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State,\nare not adequately represented in the services under the State. … [emphasis added in italics, bold italics\nand underlined bold italics] 98     Section 15\nof the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms likewise contains\nan express prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of (inter alia) “sex”, as follows: 15.(1) Every\nindividual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the\nequal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination\nand, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national\nor ethnic origin, colour, religion,sex,\nage or mental or physical disability. (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any\nlaw, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration\nof conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those\nthat are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin,\ncolour, religion,sex, age or mental\nor physical disability. [emphasis added in bold italics] 99     Finally,\nto take just one more (and even clearer) illustration, s 9 of ch 2\nof the Constitution of South Africa, which prohibits discrimination\non the grounds of (inter alia) gender,\nsexandsexual orientation, reads\nas follows: 9. Equality.—(1) Everyone\nis equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and\nbenefit of the law. (2) Equality includes the full and equal\nenjoyment of all rights and freedoms. To promote the achievement\nof equality, legislative and other measures designed to protect\nor advance persons, or categories of persons, disadvantaged by unfair\ndiscrimination may be taken. (3) The state may not unfairly discriminate\ndirectly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including\nrace,gender,sex,\npregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour,sexual orientation, age, disability,\nreligion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth. (4) No person may unfairly discriminate\ndirectly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds in\nterms of subsection (3). National legislation must be enacted to\nprevent or prohibit unfair discrimination. (5) Discrimination on one or more of the\ngrounds listed in subsection (3) is unfair unless it is established\nthat the discrimination is fair. [emphasis added in bold italics] (2)   Open-ended constitutional\nprovisions 100    As\nmentioned above at [92], there are, in contrast,otherjurisdictions where\nthe corresponding constitutional provision on the right to equality\nisopen-ended. The paradigm example\nis the US Constitution–in particular, the\nFourteenth Amendment, which reads as follows: AMENDMENT XIV SECTION 1. All persons born or naturalized in the\nUnited States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens\nof the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State\nshall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges\nor immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State\ndeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process\nof law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws. … 101    It\ncan be seen that the provision just quoted in the preceding paragraph\nis open-ended inasmuch asit does not contain\nany equivalent of Art 12(2). Not surprisingly, therefore,\nthe US courts (in particular, the US Supreme Court) have taken the\nview that different grounds of discrimination will attract different\nlevels of scrutiny, with the legal principles applicable to the\ndifferent grounds to be enunciated and developed throughcase law. Had, in fact, the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the US Constitution contained a provision which wasequivalent to our Art 12(2), the position\nmight have been quite different. We pause to observe, parenthetically,\nthat an open-ended provision on the right to equality in a Constitution\nbrings problems and difficulties of its own. How, for example, is\nthe court to decidewhich particular groundof discrimination\nought to come within the ambit of that provision? There is every\ndanger that the court could end up acting like a “mini-legislature”. Indeed,\nit might haveno choicebut to do\nso, except, perhaps, in the clearest instances (which would,ex hypothesi, have the endorsement of\nat least the majority of the population in that particular jurisdiction,\nalthough there would be very real and practical difficulties in\nthecourt’sability to ascertain the\nexistence of such endorsement in the first place).",
        "A brief summary of our analysis\nthus far": "102    A\nbrief summary at this juncture is apposite, but it should be read\nand understood in conjunction with the detailed analysis proffered\nabove: (a)     The\n“reasonable classification” test is the applicable test in Singapore\nfor determining the constitutionality of a statute under Art 12(1).\nIt is athresholdtest inasmuch\nas a failure to satisfy it (by satisfying both Limb (a)andLimb (b) of the test) will result\nin the statute concerned being rendered voidwithoutthe\ncourt even having todirectlyengage\nthe concept of equality as such. This is because the statute concerned\nwould be so illogical and/or incoherent that,ex hypothesi,\nit cannot possibly even begin to satisfy the concept of equality\nembodied in Art 12(1). To that extent, the “reasonable classification”\ntest contains substantive elements which impact the concept of equality\nitself. (b)     Article 12(1)is more declaratory and aspirational\nin nature. However, as stated at sub-para (a) above, any statute\nwhich does not satisfy the “reasonable classification” test will\nnecessarily be in contravention of Art 12(1). (c)     To\nthe extent that both limbs of the “reasonable classification” test\nembody the requirements of logic and/or coherence, it can be said that\na statute isillegitimateif and\nto the extent that either or both of these requirements isnotsatisfied because the statute fails\nto pass muster under one or both of the limbs of the “reasonable classification”\ntest. For the avoidance of doubt, it should be emphasised that there\nisno furthertest ofillegitimacy(vis-à-visthe object\nof the impugned statute) for the detailed reasons set out in this judgment. (d)     Article 12(2)prohibitsspecificgrounds\nof discrimination, which are theonlygrounds\nof discrimination that are proscribed under the Singapore Constitution.\nAny discrimination (albeit only) on any of the grounds stated in\nArt 12(2) will render the statute concerned void pursuant to Art 4\nto the extent of the inconsistency with Art 12(2). Article 12(2)\nsets out a structured and principled approach to the right to equality,\nas compared to constitutional provisions in other jurisdictions\nwhich are more open-ended and which might therefore vest too much\n“legislative” power in the courts. Although only specific grounds\nof discrimination are prohibited under Art 12(2), the necessary\nflexibility to include additional prohibited grounds of discrimination\nexists inasmuch as Art 12(2) can be amended by the Singapore Parliament\n(pursuant to Art 5 of the Singapore Constitution) in order to reflect\nthe prevailing social mores as well as aspirations of Singapore\nsociety at any given point in time. Whilst Art 12(2) applies only\nto citizens of Singapore, non-citizens are nevertheless still accorded\nprotection under Art 12(1) pursuant to the “reasonable classification”\ntest. 103    Let\nus now turn toapplythe principles\nset out above to the facts of the present appeals.",
        "Our decision on whether s 377A\nviolates Art 12(1)": "Our approach 104    As\nalready mentioned earlier, the “reasonable classification” test\nmust necessarily be the first legal port of call. This court must\nalso consider whether or not the facts of the present appeals fall\n(more specifically) within Art12(2). However,\nbefore proceeding to examine these two issues, there is a significant\npreliminary issue that needs to be considered: is there (as the Respondent\nargues and, not surprisingly, the Appellants refute) apresumption of constitutionalitywhere\ns 377A is concerned, given the fact that it was promulgated duringcolonialtimes when,ex\nhypothesi, there was (at least literally speaking) no\nConstitution in existence in Singapore? Is there a presumption of constitutionality? 105    As\nalluded to above, the Appellants argue that the Respondent cannot rely\non a presumption of constitutionality in so far as the legal status\nof s 377A is concerned. In particular, they point to the fact that\ns 377A was enacted at a point in time when there wasno Constitutionin\nexistencein Singapore. In doing so, they draw a distinction\nbetween laws enacted before Singapore became an independent sovereign\nState on 9 August 1965 (“pre-Independence laws”) and laws enacted\nthereafter (“post-Independence laws”). 106    The\ndifficulty with the aforesaid distinction is that whilst there was (literally\nspeaking) no Constitution in existence in Singapore at the time pre-Independence\nlaws were promulgated, these laws nevertheless constitute part of\nthe corpus of Singapore law. In this regard, Art 162 of the Singapore\nConstitution (“Art 162”), which provides for the continuation of existing\nlaws, might be usefully noted: Existing laws 162.    Subject\nto this Article, all existing laws shall continue in force on and after\nthe commencement of this Constitution and all laws which have not been\nbrought into force by the date of the commencement of this Constitution\nmay, subject as aforesaid, be brought into force on or after its commencement,\nbut all such laws shall, subject to this Article, be construed as\nfrom the commencement of this Constitution with such modifications, adaptations,\nqualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into\nconformity with this Constitution. Looked at in this light, it is difficult to regard pre-Independence\nlaws as being somehow “inferior” to post-Independence laws inasmuch\nas the former were promulgated during colonial times. Whilst there\nwas some discussion as to whether or not Art 162 had a substantive\n(as opposed to a merely technical (including linguistic)) effect\nin so far as the words “modifications, adaptations, qualifications\nand exceptions” were concerned, this does not detract from the fact\nthat pre-Independence laws do in fact constitute part of the corpus\nof Singapore law. If any of these laws is alleged to be unconstitutional,\nthat will have to be determined (as in the present appeals) by the\ncourts in accordance with the relevant constitutional rules and\nprinciples. 107    Mr Abdullah\naccepted (correctly, in our view) that whilst the presumption of\nconstitutionality ought to still operate even in relation to pre-Independence\nlaws, the presumption might not, in the nature of things, operate\nas strongly as it would compared to post-Independence laws (which would\nnecessarily have been promulgated in the context of,inter alia, an elected legislature which,\nit can be assumed, would have fully considered all views before\nenacting the (post-Independence) laws concerned). As mentioned in\nthe preceding paragraph, it would, in our view, be too artificial\nand too extreme to discard the presumption of constitutionality altogether\nin so far as pre-Independence laws are concerned. The approach advocated\nby Mr Abdullah represents a viable middle-ground which avoids throwing\nout the baby together with the bathwater. Indeed, when viewed from\na practical perspective, the court, in applying the presumption\nof constitutionality, will always have regard to all the circumstances\nof the case (including both the relevant textas\nwell asthe context of the statute concerned). 108    To\nsummarise, whilst the presumption of constitutionality applies in the\ncontext of the present appeals, this is subject to the precise facts\nand circumstances which we shall be considering in due course. Let\nus now turn to the application of the “reasonable classification”\ntest to s 377A. Application of the “reasonable\nclassification” test to s 377A 109    As\nmentioned earlier at (inter alia)\n[60] above, the “reasonable classification” test comprises two limbs,\nboth of which must be satisfied before the test is satisfied. To\nrecapitulate (albeit in the briefest of terms), Limb (a) requires\nthe classification prescribed by the statute concerned to be founded\non an intelligible differentia, while Limb (b) requires a rational relation\nbetween that differentia and the object sought to be achieved by\nthe statute. (1)   Is the classification\nprescribed by s 377A based on an intelligible differentia? 110    As\nalready noted above (at [23]), the Judge held inLim\nMeng Suangthat it was clear that the classification\nprescribed by s 377A was based on an intelligible differentia inasmuch\nas there was little difficulty in determining who fell within and\nwithout the provision. In his view (seeLim\nMeng Suangat [47]–[48]): 47    The\nFirst Limb requires that the classification prescribed by the impugned\nlegislation must be based on an intelligible differentia. “Intelligible”\nmeans something that may be understood or is capable of being apprehended\nby the intellect or understanding, as opposed to by the senses. “Differentia”\nis used in the sense of a distinguishing mark or character, some attribute\nor feature by which one is distinguished from all others. Scientifically,\none talks of an attribute by which a species is distinguished from\nall other species of the same genus. 48    Applying this to the present case,\nit is quite clear that the classification prescribed by s 377A –viz, male homosexuals or bisexual males\nwho perform acts of “gross indecency” on another male – is based\non an intelligible differentia. It is also clear from the differentia\nin s 377A that the section excludes male-female acts and female-female\nacts. There is little difficulty identifying who falls within this\nclassification and who does not. The Court of Appeal seemed to say\nas much inTan Eng Hong [(standing)]at\n[125]–[126]. In my view, the First Limb is satisfied and few can\ncavil with this conclusion. 111    We\nagree with the Judge and his reasoning as set out in the preceding paragraph.\nIndeed, the intense controversy surrounding the debate on s 377A\nin the extra-legal sphere in general and during the parliamentary debates\nin October 2007 on proposed changes to the revised edition of the Penal\nCode then in force (ie, the Penal\nCode (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Penal Code”)) in particular\ndemonstrate that the differentia embodied in s 377A, whilstcontroversial, isnot\nunintelligible. Put simply, if the very elements of s 377A\nwereillogical and/or incoherent to begin with,\nthere would have been no basis upon which the parties on each side\nof this cavernous divide could have joined issue in the first place.Indeed,\nthe controversy relates more toextra-legalarguments\nthat are relevant to the debate as well as the decision in thelegislativesphere (on whether s 377A should\nbe retained in our statute books or repealed). 112    Mr Ravi\nargued that the differentia embodied in s 377A wasnotintelligible\nbecause it was discriminatory inasmuch as it discriminated between\nmale homosexuals on the one hand and female homosexuals on the other.\nHe also utilised (as did Ms Barker), in oral arguments, the analogy\nof a law banning all women from driving on the roads. 113    With\nrespect, Mr Ravi hasconflatedthe\n“reasonable classification” test (in particular, the first limb\nthereof, which is the focus of the present analysis) on the one\nhand and the issue of whether or not there has been discrimination\non the other. Put simply, the latter issue (viz,\nwhether or not there has been discrimination) has been merged with\nthe first limb of the “reasonable classification” test. It will\nbe recalled that the “reasonable classification” test is only athresholdtest (see above at,inter alia, [61]–[62]). As we have already\nexplained, this does not mean that the test is merely technical\nor mechanistic; instead, it does, to some extent, impact the concept\nof equality in Art 12 itself (see above at [62] and [71]). Indeed,\nthe “reasonable classification” test, in embodying the requirements\nof logic and/or coherence, also introduces (tothatextent)\na limited element oflegitimacy,\nalthough it has been emphasised above (at [84]–[85]) that there isno furthertest ofillegitimacy(vis-à-visthe object of the impugned statute) as\nsuch. Looked at in this light, the differentia embodied in s 377A\nis both logical and coherent. Mr Ravi obviously begs to differ.\nHowever, this difference in view is premised onsubstantive\ncriteria that lie outside the scope of the “reasonable classification”\ntest altogether.In theSingaporecontext,\nthese substantive criteria lie, instead, within the purview of Art 12(2)(see above at [92]). Put simply, contrary\nto what Mr Ravi appeared to suggest, the “reasonable classification\ntest” isnotthe only (and definitive)\ntest for determining whether the right to equality under Art 12 as\na whole has been violated. This is because even if an impugned statute passes\nlegal muster under the “reasonable classification” test for the purposes\nof Art 12(1), it willalsohave\nto pass legal muster under Art 12(2). As we shall show below (at\n[181]–[182]), s 377A not only passes legal muster under the “reasonable\nclassification” test, butalsodoesnotrun foul of Art 12(2) for the simple\nreason that Art 12(2) doesnotaddress\nor encompass the subject matter of s 377A. 114    Similar\nreasoning to that set out in the preceding paragraph would apply\nto Mr Ravi’s and Ms Barker’s arguments (by analogy) with respect\nto a law which bans all women from driving on the roads. We would\nobserve, parenthetically, that, in any event, such a law is an extreme\nprovision which would probably not be enacted by a reasonable Parliament\nin the Singapore context. That having been said, anything is, of\ncourse, possible. Should such a law indeed be passed by the Singapore\nParliament, there would, in our view, be at least an arguable case\nthat that law would not pass legal muster under the “reasonable\nclassification” test. The differentia embodied in that law might,\narguably, be illogical and/or incoherent for the purposes of the first\nlimb (ie, Limb (a)) of the “reasonable\nclassification” test. Further, as pointed out above, there is also\na second limb (ie, Limb (b)) of\nthe “reasonable classification” test which must be satisfied, Limb (a)\nand Limb (b) being consecutive andcumulativeaspects\nof the test. Looked at in this light, it is at least arguable that\nthere mightnotbe a rational relation between\nthe differentia embodied in the aforementioned law on the one hand\nand the purpose and object of that law on the other – unless the purpose\nand object of that law is precisely to ban all women from driving. However,\nif that is indeed the case, we would come back full circle, so to speak,\nto the issue (just mentioned) of whether or not the differentia\n(as identified under the first limb of the “reasonable classification”\ntest) is illogical and/or incoherent.Nosuch\ncircularity arises on the facts of the present appeals. 115    We\nturn now to the next (and closely-related) issue of whether or not the\nsecond limb of the “reasonable classification” test has been satisfied\non the facts of the present appeals,viz,\nis there a rational relation between the differentia embodied in\ns 377A and the purpose and object of that provision? (2)   Is there a rational\nrelation between the differentia embodied in s 377A and the purpose\nand object of the provision? (A)   What is the purpose\nand object of s 377A? 116    Although\nthis particular question of the purpose and object of s 377A did\nnot appear to pose a problem in the court below and, indeed, before\nthis court (at least for the initial part of the parties’ oral submissions),\nit does not – for the reasons set out below – admit of that clear\nan answer. (I)   The English origins\nof s 377A 117    Section 377A\nis based on s 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (c 69) (UK)\n(“the 1885 UK Act”), which is more commonly known as “the Labouchere\nAmendment” (as it was introduced by Mr Henry Labouchere). This court\nhas, inTan Eng Hong (standing),\ndealt with the historical backdrop to both the UK and the local\npositions in some detail. Suffice it to state that the precise origins\nof s 11 of the 1885 UK Act (“the UK s 11”) are none too clear –\na point also acknowledged by the Judge in the court below (seeLim Meng Suangat [64]). Put briefly,\nthe UK s 11 was introduced at, literally, the eleventh hour, and\nhad nothing to do with the main thrust of the 1885 UK Act itself.\nIt is therefore not surprising that there was no debate in the UK\nParliament on this particular provision before enacting it. This\nmerely adds to the mystery surrounding its origins and, more importantly,\nits purpose and object. (II)   The introduction\nof s 377A into the Straits Settlements in 1938 118    What,\nthen, of s 377A? Although it was (as already mentioned) based on\nthe UK s 11, it was introduced into our Penal Code only in 1938\n– some53 years after the inception of its\noriginal counterpart in the UK.The UK s 11 was introduced\ninto the Straits Settlements in the form of s 377A of the Penal\nCode (Cap 20, 1936 Rev Ed) (“the 1936 Penal Code”) via s 3 of the Penal\nCode (Amendment) Ordinance 1938 (No 12 of 1938) (“the 1938 Penal\nCode Amendment Ordinance”). Whilst an immediate response might,\nnotwithstanding the substantial lapse of time just referred to,\nbe to assume that the purpose and object of s 377A was the same\nas that of the UK s 11, an equally immediate problem is that the\npurpose and object of the latter provision wasunclear\nto begin with. In this last-mentioned regard, it appears\nthat it has merely beenassumedthat\nthe purpose and object of the UK s 11 wascoterminous\nwith the general language contained therein. This is\nnot the most enlightened of approaches in so far as ascertaining\nthe purpose and object of a statutory provision is concerned, but\nit might, in the circumstances, have been the only viable way forward.\nThat having been said, itdoes not logically\nfollow that the purpose and object of s 377A would necessarily be\nthe same as that of the UK s 11 – especially when we take into account\nthe fact (already mentioned) that s 377A was enacted some 53 years after\nthe latter provision.Unfortunately, whatobjectiveevidence we have on the purpose\nand object of s 377A isitself unclear.\nLet us elaborate. (III)   The Attorney-General’s\nspeech before the Straits Settlements Legislative Council 119    The\nstarting point is the following brief paragraph by the then Attorney-General,\nMr C G Howell (“Mr Howell”), in his speech when introducing the\nPenal Code (Amendment) Bill 1938 (“the 1938 Penal Code Amendment\nBill”) in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (that Bill was\nlater enacted as the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Ordinance). Mr Howell\nstated as follows (seeProceedings of the Legislative\nCouncil of the Straits Settlements(“Proceedings”)\n(13 June 1938) at p B49): With regard to clause 4 [later enacted\nas s 3 of the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Ordinance, which introduced\ns 377A into our Penal Code] it isunfortunately\nthe case thatacts of the nature\ndescribedhave been brought to notice.As the law now stands,such\nactscanonlybe dealt with,if\nat all, underthe Minor Offences\nOrdinance,andthen only if committedin\npublic.Punishmentunderthe Ordinanceisinadequateandthe chances\nof detection are small. It is desired,\ntherefore, tostrengthen the lawandtobring\nit into line with the English Criminal Law,from which this clause is taken,andthe law ofvarious\nother parts of the Colonial Empireof which it is only\nnecessary to mentionHong Kong and Gibraltarwhere conditions aresomewhat similar\nto our own. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics\nand underlined bold italics] 120    Whilst\nMr Howell’s statement (as quoted in the preceding paragraph) is\nbrief, it is (as we shall see) extremely cryptic. It is, in fact,\npregnant with meaning, and (as we shall elaborate upon below) the\ndifficulty lies in ascertaining the precise meaning which Mr Howell\nintended. Before proceeding to do so, it is appropriate to set out\nother historical documentation which might be of relevance to the\npresent inquiry into the purpose and object of s 377A. (IV)   The Objects and\nReasons accompanying the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Bill 121    We\nturn, first, to the “Objects and Reasons” which accompanied the 1938\nPenal Code Amendment Bill (“theObjects and\nReasons”). The material part of theObjects\nand Reasonsreads as follows (seeProceedings(25 April\n1938) at p C81): Clause 4 introduces a new sectionbased on section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment\nAct 1885(48 and 49 Vict. c. 69).The\nsection makes punishableactsofgross indecencybetweenmalepersonswhich do\nnot amount to an unnatural offence within the meaning ofsection 377 of the [1936 Penal] Code.\n[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] (V)   Important questions\nraised 122    At\nthis particular juncture,an extremely important\npoint should be noted: whilst Mr Howell referred to the need to\nsupplement the Minor Offences Ordinance 1906 (No 13 of 1906)(“the\n1906 Minor Offences Ordinance”)in his speech\nto the Straits Settlements Legislative Council(see above\nat [119]),theObjects and Reasonsreferred, instead, to the need to supplement s 377\nof the 1936 Penal Code.(For ease of discussion, we shall hereafter\nuse the term “s 377” to denote not only s 377 of the 1936 Penal Code,\nbut also, where appropriate to the context, its successor provisions\nup to the time s 377 of the 1985 Penal Code was repealed by the\nSingapore Parliament via the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51\nof 2007) (“the 2007 Penal Code Amendment Act”).) Why are there references\ntodifferentstatutes? More importantly,\nis there aninconsistency,oris the inconsistency moreapparentthan real? On a related note,bothMr Howell’s speech to the Straits\nSettlements Legislative Council (referred to hereafter as “Mr Howell’s\nLegislative Council speech” where appropriate to the context)as well astheObjects\nand Reasonsreferred to the fact that s 377A was based\nonEnglish law(ie,the UKs 11).\nWhat is the significance, if any, of this last-mentioned reference\nto English law? Before attempting to answer these questions, we\nshall continue to set out the rest of the historical documentation\nthat might be relevant to the present inquiry. (VI)   Other relevant historical\ndocumentation (a)Colonial Office correspondence 123    There\nis Colonial Office correspondence relating to the 1938 Penal Code\nAmendment Ordinance, which was sentafterthe\nenactment of that Ordinance (the Ordinance was assented to by the\nGovernor and Commander-in-Chief on 2 July 1938 and came into effect\non 8 July 1938). The first piece of correspondence (from the UK\nPublic Record Office, Colonial Office Series 273) is a cover letter\ndated 13 July 1938 from the Deputy of the Governor of the Straits\nSettlements, the material part of which reads as follows: Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith Ordinance\nNo.12 of 1938, entitled “An Ordinance to amend the Penal Code (Chapter 20\nof the Revised Edition)”, together with the Attorney-General’s certificateandreporton the Ordinance. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 124    What\nis interesting in the aforesaid cover letter is the reference to\nthe enclosed “report” [emphasis\nadded], which was entitled “Report on an Ordinance to amend the\nPenal Code (Chapter 20 of the Revised Edition). (No. 12 of 1938)”\nand dated 21 June 1938 (“the June 1938 Report”). The relevant part\nof that report (relating to the introduction of s 377A) reads as follows: Section 3 [of the 1938 Penal Code Amendment\nOrdinance] introduces a new sectionbased on\nsection 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (48 and 49 Vict.\nc. 69). The section makes punishableactsofgross indecencybetweenmalepersonswhich do\nnot amount to an unnatural offence within the meaning ofsection 377 of the [1936 Penal] Code.\n[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] It will be noticed that the extract just quoted isvirtually identicalto the relevant part\nof theObjects and Reasonsset out\nabove (at [121]), and is, correspondingly,different\nfromMr Howell’s Legislative Council speech (which refers,\ninstead, to the need to supplementthe 1906\nMinor Offences Ordinance). (b)Annual Reports on the Organisation\nand Administration of the Straits Settlements Police and on the\nState of Crime 125    Of\npossible relevance, too, are some extracts from theAnnual\nReport on the Organisation and Administration of the Straits Settlements\nPolice and on the State of Crime(“theAnnual\nReport”) for the years 1936 to 1938. In particular, reference\nmay be made to theAnnual Reportfor\nthe year 1936 at para 40, where it is stated as follows: Prostitutes are no longer to be found soliciting\nin numbers on street parades; they find it more profitable to go\nto amusement parks, cafes, dancing places and, generally speaking,\nno exception can be taken to their behaviour.Singapore,\na port and a town combined, is not free from the very low type of prostitute.\nThe lewd activities of these have been sternly suppressed.Male prostitutionwasalsokept in check,as\nand when encountered. [emphasis added in italics and\nbold italics] 126    Reference\nmay also be made to theAnnual Reportfor\nthe year 1937 at para 36 as well as paras 38–39, where it is stated\nthus: Public\nMorals 36.    The Police took action to suppress\nthe old type of brothel (a keeper and several women) and have prevented\nas far as it has been possible the establishment of the new type–two\nor more women living on or available at premises rented for the\npurpose of prostitution. Soliciting in public was kept in check,\na difficult and unpleasant type of work and one requiring ceaseless\nsupervision. … … 38.    The\nfact that the Police are not the deciding authorities in matters\nofpublic moralsis often overlooked.\nThe duty of the Police is to suppress offences.Offencesagainst public decencyare defined\nin the laws of the land. The presence ofprostituteson\nthe streets is no offence.An offence is committed\nonly ifa woman persistently\nsolicitsto the annoyance of a\nmember ofthe public. The public have not yet come forward to give evidence\nthat she does so.It would seem that in Singapore the\nconcourse of East and West is alone responsible for such publicity\nas has been given to a state of affairs similar to that in Europe,\nwhere it passes almost unnoticed. 39.Widespread existenceofmale prostitutionwas\ndiscovered and reported to the Government whose orders have been\ncarried out. A certain amount of\ncriticism based probably upon too little knowledge of the actual\nfacts, has been expressed against a policy the object of which is\nto stamp out this evil.Sodomy\nis a penal offence; its danger to adolescents is obvious; obvious\ntoo, is the danger of blackmail,the\ndemoralising effect on disciplined forces andona mixed community\nwhich looks to the Government for wholesome governing. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics\nand underlined bold italics] 127    Finally,\nreference may be made to theAnnual Reportfor\nthe year 1938 at paras 45–48, which read as follows: Public\nMorals 45.    The duty of the Police insafeguarding public moralsis limited\nto enforcing the law. The slightest deviation from such a policy,\nin this matter more than in any other, would lead to the risk of\nvery serious persecution or connivance. The law of the Colony is\nbased on the law of the United Kingdom, and that human nature is\nnot subject to climatic variations is well proved by a visit to,\nfor instance, Jermyn Street, the dock area of Southampton, or street\ncorners at Woolwich or Sandhurst at the recognised hours. The only\ndifference is to be found in the text of the law inthe\nwords“persistently” solicits.\nThe courts have to be satisfied on this point by evidence independent\nof the Police. This evidence has not been forthcoming in the city\nof Singapore. 46.Action against\nthelocal brothels–2 womenliving\ntogether–was continued, but rapid changes of addresses and fines\nof $1 make matters difficult. 47.    Action was taken against pimps and\ntraffickers whenever evidence was forthcoming. 48.Male prostitutionandother forms\nof beastlinesswere stamped out\nas and when opportunity occurred. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (VII)   Analysis of and\ndecision on the purpose and object of s 377A 128    Let\nus now return to the important questions posed above (at [122]) as\nthey impact directly and significantly on the crucial inquiry at\nhand,viz, the purpose and object\nof s 377A. This relates to the application of Limb (b) of the “reasonable\nclassification” test. 129    It\nwill be recalled that one key difficulty lies in the fact that Mr Howell referred\ntothe need to supplementthe 1906 Minor Offences Ordinancein his speech\nto the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (see above at [119]), whereas\nboth theObjects and Reasonsas well astheJune\n1938Reportreferred\ntothe need to supplement s 377(see\nabove at [121] and [124], respectively). 130    In\nso far asthe 1906 Minor Offences Ordinancewas\nconcerned, the relevant provision wass 23thereof\n(“s 23”), which read as follows: Any person who is found drunk and incapable\nof taking care of himself,oris guilty\nof any riotous, disorderlyor indecent behaviour,orofpersistently soliciting\nor importuning for immoral purposesin anypublicroad or in anypublicplace\nor place ofpublicamusement or\nresort, or in the immediate vicinity of any Court or of any public\noffice or police station or place of worship,shall\nbe liable toa fine not exceeding twenty dollars, or\nto imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen days, and\non a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty\ndollars or to imprisonment for a term which may extend to three\nmonths. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined\nbold italics] 131    Counsel\nfor all the Appellants relied heavily on the fact that Mr Howell\nreferred to the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance to argue that s 377A\nwas enacted in order to combat the problem ofmale\nprostitution. On their argument, applying s 377A to categoriesoutsidethe narrow category just mentioned\n(viz, male prostitution) would beover-inclusive and, hence, unconstitutional.\nIn particular, Ms Barker pointed to the words “persistently soliciting\nor importuning for immoral purposes” in s 23 as evincing an intention\non the part of the Straits Settlements Legislative Council that\ns 377A (dealing as it did with male-to-male conduct) should cover\nthe social as well as public ill ofmale prostitution.\nWhilst we see some force in this particular argument, there are\nat least two difficulties with it. Let us elaborate. 132    Thefirstdifficulty relates to the fact that\ns 23 contains not only the phrase “persistently soliciting or importuning\nfor immoral purposes”,but alsothe\n(more general) phrase “guilty of\nany …indecent behaviour” [emphasis\nadded]. That these two phrases set outtwo\nseparate and distinct limbsof the offence under s 23\nis clear, and is confirmed by the fact that these two limbs presently\nexist astwo separate and distinct sections(viz, s 19 and s 20, respectively) of the\nMiscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184,\n1997 Rev Ed), the current equivalent of the 1906 Minor Offences\nOrdinance. This first difficulty in fact leads us to the second difficulty,\nto which it is (as we shall see in a moment) closely related. This second\ndifficulty lies in the fact thatboththeObjects and Reasonsas\nwell astheJune 1938Reportdidnotrefer\nto the need to supplement the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance at all,\nbut referredinsteadtothe need to supplement s 377.Section 377\nas it stood in 1938 read as follows: Unnatural\noffences 377.    Whoever\nvoluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with\nany man, woman or animal, shall be punished with penal servitude\nfor life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term\nwhich may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine\nor to whipping. Explanation.—Penetration\nis sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to\nthe offence described in this section. 133    This\n(apparently)alternativepurpose\nand object of s 377A (ie, tosupplement s 377) is significantbecause it is consistent with the other (and more\ngeneral) limb of s 23 (which, it will be recalled, relates to the proscription\nof,inter alia, “indecent behaviour”).\nIndeed,thisparticular limb of\ns 23 was broader than s 377 inasmuch as it covered “indecent behaviour” that\nincluded but was not confined to anal and/or oral sex (hereafter referred\nto as “penetrative sex”); however, it was confined topublicconduct. Hence, s 377A, which wouldalsocover “grossly indecent” acts between males\ninprivate, would apply to situations\nwhich wereoutside the purview of s 23.\nIt is also important to note that s 377A wouldsimultaneously supplement\ns 377 inasmuch as s 377A would (like s 23) cover even “grossly indecent”\nacts which fell short of penetrative sex. It should be\npointed out, at this juncture, that it follows that s 377A wouldnecessarily cover acts of penetrative sex as well.\nAny other interpretation would be illogical since it cannot be denied\nthat acts of penetrative sex constitutethe\nmost seriousinstances of the possible acts of“gross indecency”. 134    As\njust mentioned, s 377Abroadened the scopehitherto\ncovered by s 377 to cover not only penetrative sex but alsoother (less serious)acts of “gross indecency” committed betweenmales.However, we would expect that prior\nto our Parliament’s repeal of s 377 via the 2007 Penal Code Amendment\nAct, where acts of penetrative sex were involved, the accused would\nprobably have been charged under s 377 as that section imposed a heavier\npenalty (compared to s 377A), although the Prosecution would also have\nhad the option of charging the accused under s 377A instead. This\nis not surprising because, as we have just observed, acts of penetrative\nsex arethe most seriousinstances\nof the possible acts of “gross indecency”. Now that s 377 has been\nrepealed, there is no reason in principle why a charge under s 377A\ncannot be brought in a situation involving acts ofpenetrativesex\nbetween two males (which, as we have already noted, would,ex hypothesi, fall within the definition\nof “any act of gross indecency” within the meaning of s 377A). We\nnote, however, that the current policy (as declared during the October\n2007 parliamentary debates mentioned at [111] above) is for the\nProsecution to generallynotcharge\naccused persons under s 377A, so the point just referred to is –\nin the practical context at least – merely academic. It is, nevertheless,\nan important point to make in the context ofthe\npresent appeals, particularly in the light of the further written\nsubmissions which Ms Barker tendered on behalf of her clients (and which\nare dealt with below at [144]). 135    Returning\nto the comparison between s 377A and s 23, s 377A was, as we mentioned\nabove at [133],broader in scopethan s 23inasmuch as s 377A covered “grossly\nindecent” acts between males inprivate as\nwell. Such an analysis would explain why Mr Howell referred\nto the need to supplementthe 1906 Minor Offences\nOrdinancein his speech to the Straits Settlements Legislative\nCouncil (see above at [119]), and is in fact supported by the reference\nby Mr Howell himself (in the same speech)\nto the need to capture acts which were committed inprivateas\nwell (which acts, he pointed out, were not captured by the 1906\nMinor Offences Ordinance as s 23only coveredacts\ncommitted inpublic). It wouldalsoexplain why Mr Howell further referred\n(as, indeed, did theObjects and Reasonsas\nwell as the June 1938 Report) to the fact that s 377A was based\nonEnglish law – specifically, on the UK s 11,\nwhich (despite the lack of clarity as to its precise origins) has always\nbeen perceived as a provision havinggeneralapplication. 136    We\nthink that the analysis just set out is the most persuasive because\nit resolves what appears to be an inconsistency (or even a contradiction) between\nMr Howell’s Legislative Council speech (see above at [119]) on the one\nhand and theObjects and Reasonsas\nwell as the June 1938 Report (see above at [121] and [124], respectively)\non the other. But, if that be the case (ie,\nif s 377A was indeed meant tosupplements 377), it would then follow that s 377A\nitself ought to be giventhe same general applicationas\ns 377, and –contraryto the Appellants’\nargument –should notbe confined\nonly to male prostitution. 137    Thats 377was intended to be ofgeneralapplication is clear from the language\nas well as the historical context of that provision. The language itself\nis self-explanatory. In so far as the historical context ofs 377is concerned, it consisted (originally)\nof two provisions which were worded quite differently. They were\nclauses 361 and 362 of the original draft Indian Penal Code submitted\nby the then Indian Law Commission (headed by Lord Macaulay) to the\nthen Governor-General of India in Council, Lord Auckland, in 1837.\nThese clauses read as follows: OF UNNATURAL\nOFFENCES 361.  Whoever, intending to gratify unnatural\nlust, touches, for that purpose, any person, or any animal, or is\nby his own consent touched by any person, for the purpose of gratifying\nunnatural lust, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description\nfor a term which may extend to fourteen years and must not be less\nthan two years, and shall also be liable to fine. 362.  Whoever, intending to gratify unnatural\nlust, touches for that purpose any person without that person’s\nfree and intelligent consent, shall be punished with imprisonment\nof either description for a term which may extend to life and must\nnot be less than seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. 138    That\nthe clauses just quoted in the preceding paragraph (as well as the “successor”\nprovision embodied in s 377) were intended not only to be ofgeneralapplication, butalso\n(and more importantly) to enforce societal morality is clearly evidenced\nin no uncertain terms by the following observations of the then\nIndian Law Commission(seeA Penal\nCode prepared by the Indian Law Commissioners, and published by\ncommand of the Governor General of India in Council(Pelham\nRichardson, 1838; reprinted from the Calcutta Edition and reprinted\n(in turn) by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd, 2002) at p 117 (also reprinted\nasIntroductory Report upon the Indian Penal\nCodeinThe Works of Lord Macaulay:\nSpeeches – Poems & Miscellaneousvol XI, pp 3–198\nat p 144)): Clauses 361 and 362 relate toan odious class of’ offencesrespecting which it is desirable that as little as\npossible should be said. We leave, without com­ment, to\nthe judgment of his Lordship in Council the two clauses which we\nhave provided for these offences. We are unwilling to insert, either\nin the text or in the notes, any thing which could give rise to\npublic discussion onthis revolting subject;as we are de­cidedly of opinion thatthe injurywhich\nwould bedonetothe morals\nof the communityby such dis­cussion\nwould far more than compensate for any benefits which might be derived\nfrom legislative measures framed with the greatest precision.\n[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] 139    Incontrast, if the Appellants’ analysis\nof the purpose and object of s 377A (ie,\nthat the provision wasonlyintended\nto deal withmale prostitution)\nwere adopted, there would necessarily be an inconsistency (or even\na contradiction) between the purpose and object alleged by the Appellants\nand the purpose (mentioned in the preceding paragraph) of guarding\nagainst “injury … to the morals of the community”. 140    Indeed,\nafter s 377A was introduced into the Straits Settlements via s 3 of\nthe 1938 Penal Code Amendment Ordinance,boths 377ands 377A were listed underthe broad and general heading “Unnatural Offences”(see also,\nto this effect, the relevant heading and provisions in the Penal\nCode (Cap 119, 1955 Rev Ed)). This clearly militatesagainstthevery\nspecificpurpose and object canvassed by the Appellantsvis-à-viss 377A. 141    It\nshould also be noted that the relevant historical documents (see above\nat [121] and [124]) refer to “actsofgross indecencybetweenmalepersons”\n[emphasis added] in ageneralsense,\nwhich again militates against the narrow approach advocated by the\nAppellants. 142    What,\nthen, about the references tomale prostitutionin\nthe various volumes of theAnnual Reportcited\nabove (at [125]–[127])? If one looks at the plain language of s 377A\n(reproduced above at [3] and [56]), it is clear that the provision\nwould not only capture “grossly indecent” acts between males in\nageneralsense, but wouldalso necessarily capture(in ana fortiorimanner) the (relatively) morespecificacts relating to male prostitution, including\nprocurement as well as abetment by third-party pimps. It should also\nbe noted that both theAnnual Reportfor\nthe year 1937 and theAnnual Reportfor\nthe year 1938 (at paras 38 and 45, respectively) referred to the problem\nof “persistently soliciting or importuning for immoral purposes” in\nthe context offemale– as opposed\nto male – prostitution. More importantly, perhaps, theAnnual Reportfor the year 1937 and theAnnualReportfor\nthe year 1938 both referred (at paras 38 and 45, respectively) to the\nneed for the Police to safeguard “public morals”\n[emphasis added] in ageneralsense\n(as opposed to in the context of male prostitution specifically). Indeed,\nthe phrase “public morals” constitutes theheadingof\nthe relevant part of the respectiveAnnual\nReportsmentioned above. This is, of course, wholly consistent\nwith the Respondent’s arguments on the purpose and object of s 377A\nin the present appeals. 143    For\nthe reasons set out above, we are of the view that the available objective\nevidence demonstrates that s 377A was intended to be ofgeneralapplication, and was not intended\nto be merely confined only (or even mainly) to the specific problem\nof male prostitution (notwithstanding the fact that this would be\ncovered as well). 144    As\nmentioned above at [134], Ms Barker (with the leave of this court) tendered\nfurther written submissions on behalf of her clients after the oral hearing\nbefore us had concluded. In essence, she argued, first, that the phrase\n“gross indecency” in s 377A didnotcoverpenetrativesex and conduct which amounted\nto an “unnatural offence” under s 377. She argued that s 377A was\nintended, instead, to coverotheracts\nof “gross indecency”apart fromacts\nofpenetrativesex, and that this\nwas the meaning to be attributed to Mr Howell’s Legislative Council\nspeech (reproduced above at [119]) with regard to the ambit of s 377A.\nMs Barker then proceeded to argue, secondly, that the original purpose\nof s 377A was tosuppress male prostitution.To\nsupport this particular argument, she cited not only the historical\nmaterials already referred to earlier in this judgment, but also\nfurther materials relating to the suppression of prostitution and brothels\nin the Straits Settlements. In addition, she referred to materials demonstrating\nthat in theEnglishcontext, the\nprosecution of the famous author, Oscar Wilde, under the UK s 11\nhad been pursuant to his sexual activity with persons who were,\nin effect at least, male prostitutes. In this connection, we note\nthat Mr Ravi similarly tendered further written submissions which\nadopted Ms Barker’s arguments as stated above. Mr Ravi also advanced\narguments based on executive estoppel and doubtful penalisation\nwhich were largely premised on Ms Barker’s arguments. 145    With\nrespect, we are unable to accept either Ms Barker’s or Mr Ravi’s arguments.\nLet us elaborate. 146    In\nso far as Ms Barker’s first argument is concerned, we have already explained\nabove (at [133]) why the phrase “gross indecency” in s 377A must necessarily\ncover penetrative sex as well. Indeed, it must surely be the case thatmale prostitutionmight – and, in most\ncases, probably would – involvepenetrativesex\n(although, conceivably,otheracts\nof “gross indecency” could also be involved). On this logical and\ncommonsensical ground alone, the first argument by Ms Barker at\n[144] above does not, with respect, ring true. 147    In\nso far as Ms Barker’s second argument at [144] above is concerned, the\nadditional historical materials proffered to this court (which included the\nobservations by Ms Nicoll-Jones in “Report on the Investigation\nof the Problem of Prostitution in Singapore” covering the period\nfrom May 1940 to May 1941) are, at best, neutral. They referred\nto the suppression of prostitution and brothelsgenerally.\nMoreover, their focus (as also alluded to above at [142]) was onfemale(as opposed to male) prostitution.\nWe further note the Respondent’s argument in its supplemental written\ncase that, in any event, the references to Ms Nicoll-Jones’ observations\nare irrelevant in so far as those observations were madeafterthe enactment of s 377A. 148    In\nso far as Ms Barker’s reference to the trial of Oscar Wilde is concerned,\nthe argument is, again, neutral, at best. As the Respondent pointed\nout in its supplemental written case, Wilde was also charged under the\nUK s 11 for engaging in sexual activity with men who werenotmale prostitutes, and he was acquitted\nin those instancesnotbecause the\nmen concerned were not male prostitutes, but rather, because the\nProsecution did not succeed in proving the ingredients of the offence.\nIn any event, itdoes not necessarily followfrom\nthe fact that Wilde might have been convicted under the UK s 11\nfor sexual activity with persons who were, in effect at least, male\nprostitutes that this particular provision wasnotintended\nto covermore general situations as well.\nIndeed, the position is precisely the converse: put simply, if the\nUK s 11 coveredallsituations relating\nto “acts of gross indecency” between males,it\nwould follow that similar situations involving male prostitutes\nwould also be covered on ana fortioribasis.\nIn this regard, there is nothing in the legislative background surrounding\nthe UK s 11 which suggests otherwise. Further (and more importantly),\nthe legislative background surrounding s 377A, which has already\nbeen set out in detail above, militates against the interpretation proffered\nby Ms Barker on behalf of her clients. For the same reasons, Mr Ravi’s\narguments fall away as they were premised on the very same arguments\nthat Ms Barker advanced. 149    We\nalso note that if the purpose and object of s 377A had been so specific\nas to only or mainly target the problem of male prostitution, it would\nhave been open to Mr Howell to have been much clearer (and, more importantly,\nmore specific). He spoke, instead, in far moregeneralterms\nin his speech to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (see\nabove at [119]). We also note that given thespecificityof\nthe purpose and object argued for by the Appellants, it might have\nbeen more direct and more relevant for the Straits Settlements Legislative\nCouncil to have simply amended the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance\ninstead (which, of course, was not the measure taken by the Straits\nSettlements Legislative Council in 1938). (VIII)   A comparative\nperspective? 150    In\nhis speech to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, Mr Howell referred,inter alia, to the respective situations\nin Gibraltar and Hong Kong. Unfortunately, what evidence was available\nbefore this court as to the situation in those two jurisdictions\nat that point in time was not particularly helpful. Indeed, there\nappears to be no real historical evidence with regard to the situation\nin Gibraltar at the material time (although we note that Gibraltar’s\nequivalent of s 377A was abolishedlegislativelyin\n1993). 151    In\nso far as the situation in Hong Kong was concerned, Hong Kong’s equivalent\nof s 377A was enacted as s 2 of the Hong Kong Criminal Law Amendment\nOrdinance 1901 (No 3 of 1901). That was done some 37 years prior\nto the introduction of s 377A into the Straits Settlements. In the “Objects and Reasons” accompanying the\nCriminal Law Amendment Bill 1901 (HK), the then Attorney-General,\nMr W Meigh Goodman, stated as follows (see theHongkong\nGovernment Gazette(1 February 1901) at p 170): Section 2 of this Ordinance extends to\nthis Colony the provisions of section eleven of the English Criminal\nLaw Amendment Act, 1885. When the various sections of Part I of\nthat Act which is headed “Protection of Women and Girls” were considered\nwith a view to their being embodied in our local legislation relating\nto that subject, section eleven which is out of place in Part I\nof the English Act was omitted. 152    Unfortunately,\nthe statement quoted in the preceding paragraph does not aid us\nin ascertaining what precisely was the purpose and object of Hong\nKong’s equivalent of s 377A. Indeed, the above statement is somewhat\nambiguous and (at best) merely repeats what the (literal) situation\nin Hong Kong was at the time the 1885 UK Act was promulgated. We\nshould also observe that Hong Kong (like Gibraltar) abolished its equivalent\nof s 377Alegislativelyin 1991. (B)   Is the “rational\nrelation” requirement satisfied? 153    For\nthe purposes of the second limb (ie,\nLimb (b)) of the “reasonable classification” test, we agree with\nthe Judge that there is a rational relation between the differentia\nembodied in s 377A and the purpose and object of the provision as\nset out above. Indeed, given our findings with respect to the two\nlimbs of the “reasonable classification” test, we hold (as did the\nJudge) that there is, in fact,a complete coincidencein\nthe relation between that differentia and that purpose and object. The issue of illegitimacy 154    As\nalready stated earlier in this judgment, there isno\nseparate or independent test of illegitimacy(vis-à-visthe object of the impugned statute) for\nthe purposes of ascertaining the constitutionality of that statute\nunder Art 12. There is therefore no need for us to consider the\nissue of illegitimacy in relation to the facts and circumstances\nof the present appeals, given our finding (applying the “reasonable\nclassification” test to s 377A) that there is no illogicality or\nincoherence in the differentia embodied in that provision. It is\nimportant to reiterate that the courts cannot become “mini-legislatures”.\nThat would be an illegitimate use of their powers. Indeed, the present\nappeals illustrate precisely the dangers of adopting such an approach.\nTo elaborate, we have already referred above (at [111]) to the intense\ncontroversy surrounding the debate on s 377A in the extra-legal sphere\nin general and during the October 2007 parliamentary debates mentioned\nin that same paragraph in particular. This controversy has been marked\non both sides of a very stark (and often emotional) divide by a\ngreat number ofextra-legalarguments\nwhich are clearly and wholly outside the remit of the courts, and\nwhich fall instead within the purview of the legislature. The status and role of extra-legal\narguments 155    We\nturn now to consider the status and role of the aforementionedextra-legalarguments, a number of which\nwere made by the parties in both their written as well as their\noral submissions before this court. In our view, these arguments\nare (as already mentioned) clearlyneitherrelevantnormaterial in so far as the application\nof the “reasonable classification” test is concerned. Neither are\nthey relevant in so far as the application of Art 12(2)is\nconcerned. What, then,wouldbe\nthe relevance (if any) of these arguments? In order to answer this\nmore general question, it would be useful, in our view, to consider\nthe specific extra-legal arguments which were made in the context\nof the present appeals. We should, however, emphasise that in doing\nso, we arenotin any way taking\nthese extra-legal arguments into account for the purposes of our\ndecision on the legal issues set out above at [41]vis-à-visthe\nconstitutionality of s 377A. 156    In\nour view, whilst many of the Appellants’ extra-legal arguments are valid\n(or, at least, plausible) ones, they are not arguments that may\nbe appropriately considered by the court and are thuslegally irrelevant. Put simply, the court\nisnot the appropriate forumin\nwhich to canvass such arguments; the appropriate forum in this regard\nis, instead,the legislature. We\nshall demonstrate this with reference to each of the extra-legal arguments\nproffered to this court. (1)   The “tyranny of the\nmajority” 157    One\nof the extra-legal arguments canvassed by the Appellants was that\ns 377A represented the “tyranny of themajority”vis-à-vispersons who were in the Appellants’\nshoes (and who were in theminority).\nThe right to equality under Art 12(1) constituted, so the argument\nwent, the Appellants’ legal bulwark against the aforementioned “tyranny\nof the majority”. 158    In\nour view, this particular argument, whilst attractive at first blush, consists\nmore of rhetoric than of substance. Let us elaborate. 159    First,\nthe argument raises a centuries-old philosophical conundrum to which,\nto the best of our knowledge, there has (despite the vast amounts\nof ink that have been spilt on this particular subject) hitherto\nbeen no satisfactory solution. Put simply, ought majoritarian rights\nalways to trump minority rights? If not, when should the latter\ntrump the former? In our view, invoking the phrase “tyranny of the\nmajority”,without more, does not address\nthese questions in a practical (nor, for that matter, in a theoretical) manner.\nIndeed, the majority could turn the argument just mentioned on its\nhead and contend that likewise, they ought not to be subject to\nthe “tyranny of theminority”. 160    Secondly,\nand turning to a more practical point, what the minority (in this\ncase, the Appellants) have to demonstrate to make out their argument is\nthat there isa legal basisfor\nclaiming that their rights should trump those of the majority.However, this brings us back full circle to the interpretation as\nwell as the application of Art 12(1) and Art 12(2) which we have\nalready undertaken above. Any other (and broader) argument\nwould not be one that the court can legitimately address. If at\nall, such other arguments should be addressed bythe\nlegislatureinstead. 161    We\nshould, however, observe, in fairness to the Appellants, that perhaps,\ntheir reliance on the argument that there should be no “tyranny\nof the majority” couldalsobe grounded\nin the (related) argument that it would be wrong forthe majorityto enforce (through s 377A)societal moralityto the detriment of\ntheindividual rightsofthe minority. This last-mentioned argument\nwill be dealt with below at [162]–[174] in the course of considering\nthe Appellants’ argument based on the absence of harm, to which\nwe now turn our attention. (2)   The argument based\non the absence of harm (and societal morality revisited) 162    The\nAppellants’ argument based on the absence of harm was that their\nsexual conduct caused no harm to others. This particular argument was,\nof course, part of the broader jurisprudential debate on the enforcement\nof morals between Lord Devlin on the one hand (see generally Patrick\nDevlin,The Enforcement of Morals(Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1963) (“The Enforcement of\nMorals”)) and Prof H L A Hart on the other (see H L A Hart,Law, Liberty and Morality(Oxford University\nPress, 1963) as well as, by the same author,The\nMorality of the Criminal Law: Two Lectures(Magnes Press,\nHebrew University, 1964) (the two lectures mentioned in the title\nof this particular work were the Harry Camp Lectures delivered at Stanford\nUniversity and the Lionel Cohen Lectures delivered at the Hebrew University\nof Jerusalem, respectively)). 163    The\naforesaid debate stemmed from Lord Devlin’s famous Maccabaean Lecture\nin Jurisprudence entitled “The Enforcement of Morals” (1959) 45 Proceedings\nof the British Academy 129, which was delivered on 18 March 1959\nat the British Academy and which was reprinted in the book with\nthe same title (mentioned above) (the lecture constituted the first\nchapter of that work, albeit with the new title “Morals and the\nCriminal Law”). What is interesting in the context of the present appeals\nis that this particular lecture by Lord Devlin was prompted by the views\nexpressed in theReport of the Departmental\nCommittee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution(HMSO,\nCmnd 247, 1957), more popularly known as “The Wolfenden Report”\n(after the chairman of that committee, Sir John Wolfenden) and hereafter\nreferred to as “The Wolfenden Report”.\nParagraph 61 ofThe Wolfenden Reportstates\nas follows: … We have outlined the arguments against\na change in the law, and we recognise their weight. We believe,\nhowever, that they have been met by the counter-arguments we have\nalready advanced. There remains one additional counter-argument\nwhich we believe to be decisive, namely, the importance which society\nand the law ought to give to individual freedom of choice and action\nin matters of private morality.Unless a deliberate\nattempt is to be made by society, acting through the agency of the\nlaw, to equate the sphere of crime with that of sin, there must\nremain a realm of private morality and immorality which is, in brief\nand crude terms, not the law’s business.To say this\nis not to condone or encourage private immorality. On the contrary,\nto emphasise the personal and private nature of moral or immoral\nconduct is to emphasise the personal and private responsibility\nof the individual for his own actions, and that is a responsibility\nwhich a mature agent can properly be expected to carry for himself\nwithout the threat of punishment from the law. [emphasis added] 164    Briefly\nstated, Lord Devlin was of the view – contrary to that expressed\ninThe Wolfenden Report –thatthe lawcouldregulate\nas well as sanctionprivateacts\nin order to preserve the moral fabric of society. In setting out\nhis views, Lord Devlin proceeded,inter alia,\non the premise thatthere was a societal morality\nthat could constitute the basis upon which private conduct could\nbe regulated and sanctioned by means of the law. This is, in fact,\nakin to the approach adopted by the Respondent in the present appeals. 165    Prof Hart,\non the other hand, disagreed with this view. Indeed, although Prof Hart’s\nbest known works are those cited above (at [162]), he in fact pointed\nto an earlier article (viz, H L A Hart,\n“Immorality and Treason”The Listener(30 July\n1959) at pp 162–163) as being not only “one of [his] better [articles]”,\nbut also the piece that catalysed the entire debate; in Prof Hart’s\nown words, the article “attacked Devlin. He was horrified. [So]\nhe [published] a whole book [viz,The Enforcement of Morals] in reply to\nit” (see “Hart Interviewed: H.L.A. Hart in Conversation with David Sugarman”\n(2005) 32 Journal of Law and Society 267 at p 284). Put simply, Prof Hart\nagreed with the views expressed inThe Wolfenden\nReport. In doing so, he was,incontrast toLord Devlin,\nproceeding,inter alia, on the premise\nthatthe individual liberty of each person\nwasinviolate, such that societal\nmoralitycould not be utilised as\na justification for regulating and sanctioning private conduct –\nexcept to the (limited) extent (as we shall elaborate upon briefly\nbelow) that harm would otherwise result to others. This is, in fact,\nakin to the approach adopted by the Appellants in the present appeals. 166    Ideas\nand arguments do not exist in an intellectual vacuum. Not surprisingly,\ntherefore, both Lord Devlin and Prof Hart relied upon works of prior\nauthors in support of their respective views. Lord Devlin’s views\nare consistent with those of the famous Victorian jurist and judge,\nJames Fitzjames Stephen (see James Fitzjames Stephen QC,Liberty, Equality, Fraternity(Smith Elder,\n& Co, 2nd Ed, 1874; reprinted, The University of Chicago Press,\n1991) (“Stephen”); see also the\npreface toThe Enforcement of Moralsat\np vii), whilst Prof Hart’s views are consistent with those of the famous\nBritish philosopher, civil servant and Member of Parliament, John Stuart\nMill (see J S Mill,On Liberty(John W Parker\nand Son, 1859; reprinted with Editing as well as an Introduction\nby Gertrude Himmelfarb in Pelican Books, 1974) (“Mill”)),\nwhose views were (not surprisingly) the subject of vigorous challenge\ninStephen. So the debate between\nLord Devlin and Prof Hart was an important debate with weighty protagonists\non both sides (including their predecessors). 167    As\nalready alluded to above (at [164]), a close analysis of the approach adopted\nbythe Respondentin the present\nappeals will demonstrate that it is essentially relying upon the\napproach adopted byLord Devlin.\nIn particular, Mr Abdullah focused not a few times upon the argument\nthat s 377A gave effect to public morality. Further, Mr Abdullah\nsubmitted that that public morality was one which was determined\nbythe legislatureto exist, and\nsuch determination was uniquely within the purview of that institution.\nAnychange(including, presumably,\nthe repeal of s 377A)therefore lay within\nthe province of the legislature – and the legislature alone.\nWe pause to observe, parenthetically, that the use of the phrase\n“publicmorality” ought to be contrasted\nwith the use of the phrase “popularmorality”\nas the latter might engenderunnecessarily\nnegativepsychological (as well as other) perceptions.\nTo avoid any possible misunderstanding whatsoever, we shall henceforth\nutilise (and, in fact, have already utilised) the phrase “societal morality”\ninstead. 168    The\nAppellants, in contrast, are obviously relying on the views of both Prof Hart\nas well as J S Mill. In particular, Mill enunciated the famous “harm\nprinciple” as follows (seeMillat\npp 68–69): The object of this essay is to assert one\nvery simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings\nof society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control,\nwhether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties\nor the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is thatthe sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually\nor collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any\nof their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which\npower can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized\ncommunity, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.His\nown good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.\nHe cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will\nbe better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because,\nin the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right.\nThese are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning\nwith him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling\nhim or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify\nthat, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be\ncalculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the\nconduct of anyone for which he is amenable to society is that which\nconcerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his\nindependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body\nand mind, the individual is sovereign. [emphasis added] 169    Turning,\nfirst, to the general debate between Lord Devlin and Prof Hart,\nthe arguments on each side of the philosophical divide are, as mentioned\nabove at [166], weighty ones. What is more important is that given\nthose circumstances and given the nature of the arguments themselves,\nthere are no clear answers – not even at a theoretical level and,a fortiori, not at a practical one. This\nis not surprising. Interesting as these issues are as a matter of\njurisprudence and legal philosophy, they are issues that lie quintessentially\nwithin the sphere ofthe legislature.\nThe balancing of rights on a broad philosophical basis is not a\ntask that the court can – or ought to – undertake. In particular,\nthe Appellants’ reliance in these proceedings on the “harm principle”\nenunciated by Mill raises the very pertinent issue of what constitutes\n“harm” in the first place. It is not – as appears to be the implicit\nassumption of the Appellants – necessarily confined only tophysicalharm. But, if not, how far should\nthe ambit of “harm” extend? A moment’s reflection will reveal that\nthe answers to this as well as other related questions lie quintessentially\nwithin the sphere ofthe legislature.This\npoint – already made several times in the course of this judgment\n– cannot be emphasised too much. Hence, the Appellants’ argument\nbased on the absence of harm, when examined more closely, reveals\nitself to be, in substance if not in form, one which ought (if at\nall) to be considered bythe legislature. 170As, if not more, importantly, a fundamental difference\nbetween the approach adopted by the Respondent on the one hand and\nthat adopted by the Appellants on the other lies (as explained above)\nin the fact that whilst the Respondent is of the view that it is\n(paceLord Devlin) appropriate (and, indeed,\nlegitimate) for the legislature to enforce societal morality through s 377A,\nthe Appellants are of the (diametrically opposed)view that it is (paceProf Hart)\ninappropriate for the legislature to do so, except to the extent\nthat harm has resulted (or might result)to\nothers.To recapitulate, it will be recalled (see above\nat [167]) that one of the premises underlyingthe Respondent’sapproach\nis that it is appropriate and legitimate forthe legislatureto\nascertainwhat the prevailing societal morality\nis, and to decide whether or not (in the context of these proceedings)\ns 377A ought to be repealed or retained in view of that societal\nmorality. As already noted above (at [29]–[30] and [33]–[34]),the Appellantsare of the view that such\nan approachsimply discriminates againstthemand deprives them of their fundamental rights,\nand as a result, s 377A is unconstitutional. 171    In\nour view, there is much force in the Respondent’s argument as just set\nout in the preceding paragraph. The legislature is an elected body\nand thus has the mandate from the electorate to promulgate laws\nwhich reflect as well as preserve societal morality. Whilst it might\n(as is the situation in the present proceedings) be difficult to\nascertain what the prevailing societal morality on a particular\nissue is at any given point in time, it is stillthe\nlegislature’s taskto make this determination. 172    As\nwe understand the Appellants’ arguments, even if the prevailing societal\nmorality can be ascertained, giving effect to it through the law\n(in this case, s 377A) would be a violation ofthe\nminority’s constitutional rightsas it would constitute\nthe “tyranny of themajority”.However, as we have already noted above\n(at [159]), this argument isa double-edged\none, for it canequallybe\nargued by the majority that there should be no “tyranny of theminority”. We hasten to add that this\nisnotto endorse the approach thatthemajoritymust always prevail.Rather, this brings\nus back to the protections embodied in the Articles on fundamental\nrights in the Singapore Constitution – of which Art 9 and Art 12\nare the focus of the present appeals.The Appellants\nmust therefore seek to bring their respective cases within the ambit\nof these two Articles. 173    Put\nsimply, Art 9 and Art 12 would constitute alegalbasis\non which the Appellants can seek to vindicate their rights. The\nAppellantscannotask the court\nto vindicate their rights based simply – andwithout\nmore– on the argument thatthey\nfeel that the prevailing societal morality is wrong as it deprives\nthem of their freedom. This isnotto\nstate that such an argument cannot be made. But, a moment’s reflection\nwill reveal that in order to succeed in this argument, the Appellants\nwill necessarily need to bring to bear a great number ofextra-legal arguments, which, as we have\nalready emphasised, areuniquelywithin\nthe purview ofthe legislature.\nThese extra-legal arguments includeempirical\ndata in the form of,inter alia,\nsurveys(some of which were referred to by both the Appellants\nand the Respondent in the course of the present appeals)which this court is not equipped to assess.\nAt this particular juncture, the vitally important distinction between the\njudicial function on the one hand and the legislative function on\nthe other must be emphasised yet again. Put simply, the courtcannot and must not attempt to (still less actually)\noperate as a “mini-legislature”– lest the vital role\nof the court as an independent and neutral institution deciding objectively,\non the basis of objective legal rules and principles, the rights which\nparties have in a particular situation (among other issues) be reduced to\nnaught. 174    Indeed\n(and consistent with the observations just made), it is also highly\nsignificant, in our view, to note thatThe\nWolfenden Report, which (as we mentioned above at [163])\nwas the effective catalyst of the jurisprudential debate between\nLord Devlin and Prof Hart, ultimately led (albeit only a decade\nlater) tolegislativeaction on\nthe part ofthe UK Parliament(in\nthe form of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 (c 60) (UK), which,inter alia, abolished the UK equivalent\nof s 377A). 175    Let\nus now turn to yet anotherextra-legalargument\nwhich the Appellants proffered to this court,viz,\nthe argument based on immutability and/or the intractable difficulty\nof change on the part of male homosexuals. (3)   The argument based\non immutability and/or the intractable difficulty of change 176    Put\nsimply, the Appellants’ argument based on immutability and/or the\nintractable difficulty of change on the part of male homosexuals\nwas this: if the Appellants’ sexual orientation was biologically\ndetermined, they ought not to be discriminated against via s 377A.\nIn particular, Mr Ravi submitted that there was overwhelming evidence\nsupporting the proposition that a person’s sexual orientation was\nbiologically determined. This is primarily ascientificand extra-legalargument which, again,\nisoutsidethe purview of the court.\nWe agree with the Judge (seeTan Eng Hong (substantive)at\n[63]) that the scientific evidence on this particular issue is –\ncontrary to what Mr Ravi submitted – unclear inasmuch as there isno definitive evidencepointing clearly\nto one side of the divide or the other.In\nany event, as just mentioned, the court isnotin a position to arrive at a conclusive\ndetermination on this issue. Again, this argument should – if at\nall – be addressed bythe legislatureinstead. (4)   The safeguarding\nof public health 177    It\nshould be noted that the Respondent, in its case before this court\n(cfits case in the court below\n(see above at [21])), didnotrely\nupon the safeguarding of public health. This was, in our view, the\ncorrect approach simply because, once again, the court isnotin a position to arrive at a conclusive\ndetermination in this particular regard. That having been said, we\nhasten to add that this is by no means an inappropriate argument,\nbut it should – if at all – be addressed bythe\nlegislatureinstead as it raises what are clearlyextra-legal (in this instance, medical as well as\nscientific)issues. (5)   Summary of our discussion\nof the Appellants’ extra-legal arguments 178    The\nunderlying thread of our discussion at [157]–[177] above is clear and\nmay be stated simply: all the arguments referred to in those paragraphs are\nextra-legal arguments that, whilst not necessarily unpersuasive,\nought nevertheless to be raised in the appropriate forum, which\nis the legislature. Correlatively, the court is not the appropriate\nforum to consider such arguments. As emphasised right at the outset\nof this judgment,only relevantlegalarguments can (and should) be considered\nby the court. It is also important to emphasise that the Appellants\narenotthereby deprived of the opportunity\nto proffer theextra-legalarguments\nthey have raised, but they have to do so at adifferentforum,viz, beforethe legislature.\nAt this juncture, it is appropriate to note the following perceptive\nobservations by Lord Reid in the extra-judicial lecture referred\nto above at [78] (seeThe Judge As Law Makerat\np 23): Now let me come to the real difficulty\nabout judges making law.Everyone agrees thatimpartiality is the first essential in any judge. And that means not only that he must not appear\nto favour either party.It also\nmeans that he must not take sides on political issues. When public opinion is sharply divided on any\nquestion – whether or not the division is on party lines – no judge\nought in my view to lean to one side or the other if that can possibly\nbe avoided.But sometimes we get\na case where that is very difficult to avoid. Then I think we must\nplay safe.We must decide the case\non the preponderance of existing authority.Parliament is the right place to settle issues\nwhich the ordinary man re­gards as controversial.On\nmany questions he will say: “That is the lawyers’ job, let them\nget on with it.” But on others he will say: “I ought to have my\nsay in this. I am not going to accept dictation from the lawyers.”\n… [emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] 179    On\na related note, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, quoting from Lord Reid’s\naforesaid lecture, classified the situation where “public opinion is\nsharply divided on [a] question” as a situation “[w]here the question involves\nan issue of current social policy on which there is no consensus within\nthe community” (see Tom Bingham, “The Judge as Lawmaker: An English\nPerspective” inThe Business of Judging: Selected\nEssays and Speeches(Oxford University Press, 2000) ch 2\nat p 31), and stated that judges should, consequently, refrain from\nmaking new law in such a situation. Lord Bingham also referred (at\np 32 of the same work) to another situation where, in his view,\njudges ought to refrain from making new law, namely: [W]here the issue arises in a field far\nremoved from ordinary judicial experience. This is really another\nway of saying thatwhereas the Judges may properly\nmould what is sometimes called lawyers’ law,they should be very slow to lay down far-reaching\nrules in fields outside their experience. They should be alert to\nrecognize their own limitations.[emphasis added in italics\nand bold italics] 180    Indeed,\nour legislature can, apart from actually abolishing s 377A, also effect\nsolutions which are clearly beyond the powers of the court. For example,\nMs Barker strongly urged this court (as a possible alternative)\nto at least delete the words “or private” in s 377A, hence “reading\ndown” s 377A to that extent (see the paragraphs of Lim and Chee’s\nAppellants’ Case which we referred to above at [19]). However, consistent\nwith the analysis set out above, this proposed solution is clearly\noutside the powers of this court, although it is an approach which\ncan be taken by our Parliament (if it is so persuaded). Our ruling on the constitutionality\nof s 377A under Art 12(1) 181    For\nthe reasons set out above, we are of the view that s 377A satisfies both\nlimbs of the “reasonable classification” test. It therefore passes\nlegal muster pursuant to Art 12(1).\nHowever, that is not the end of the matter. Consistent with the\napplicable principles set out earlier in this judgment, and given\nthat a challenge was also mounted to the constitutionality of s 377A\nunder Art 12(2), it is now necessary\nfor us to proceed to consider a further – and more specific – issue:\nalthough s 377A does not violate Art 12(1), does it nevertheless\nfall within the scope of Art 12(2),\nand if so, does it violate that provision?",
        "Whether s 377A falls within\nthe scope of Art 12(2), and if so, whether it violates that provision": "182    It\nis clear, in our view, that s 377A doesnotviolate\nArt 12(2) for the simple reason that it doesnoteven\nfall within the scope of Art 12(2) to begin with. As we have already\nnoted (see above at [92]), the words “gender”, “sex” and “sexual\norientation” are noticeably absent from Art 12(2). When viewed from\na historical context, this is not surprising. In particular, para 33\nof the 1966 Report furnishes us with more than a hint as to why\nArt 12(2)was drafted the way it\nwas. 183    Paragraph 33\nof the 1966 Report reads as follows: We consider, having regard tothemulti-racial,multi-cultural,multi-lingualandmulti-religiouscomposition of the population of Singapore and of\nits citizens, thatthe recommendations\nwe have outlined in the preceding paragraphwillnot only forman\nimpregnable shield against racial communalism and religious bigotry\nas well as an effective weapon to wipe away any fears the minorities\nmay harbour concerning discriminatory treatmentbut willalso lay\na firm and lasting foundation on which to build a democratic, equal\nand just multi-racial society in Singapore. We accordingly recommend\nthat the present Article 8 [the then Malaysian equivalent of our Art 12]\nshould be deleted and in its place we recommend the following two Articles:\n— 8a. All\npersons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection\nof the law. 8b. (1) Except\nas expressly authorised by this Constitution and subject to the\nprovisions of this Article — (a) no\nlaw shall make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself\nor in its effect; and (b) no\npersons shall be treated in a discriminatory manner by any person\nacting by virtue of any written law or in the performance of the\nfunctions of any public office or any public authority. (2) In this Article, the expression “discriminatory”\nmeans affording different treatment to different persons attributable\nwholly or mainly to their respective descriptions by race, place\nof origin, colour or creed whereby persons of one such description\nare subject to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of\nanother such description are not made subject or are accorded privileges\nor advantages which are not afforded to persons of another such\ndescription. (3) Paragraph (1)(a) of this Article shall\nnot apply to any law so far as that law makes provision — (a) for\nthe appropriation of the general revenues of Singapore; (b) with\nrespect to persons who are not citizens of Singapore; (c) with\nrespect to adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, devolution of property\non death or other matters of personal law. (4) Nothing contained in any law shall\nbe held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of paragraph (1)(a) of this Article to the extent that it\nmakes provision with respect to standards or qualifications (not being\nstandards or qualifications specifically relating to race, place\nof origin, colour or creed) to be required of any person who is\nappointed to any office in the public service, any office in a disciplined\nforce, or any office in the service of a body corporate established\nby any law for public purposes. (5) Paragraph (1)(b)\nof this Article shall not apply to anything which is expressly or\nby necessary implication authorised to be done by any such provision\nof law as is referred to in either of the two preceding paragraphs. (6) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) of this Article, the certificate of\nthe Attorney-General that the exercise of any discretion relating\nto the institution, conduct or discontinuance of criminal proceedings\nin any court that is vested in him or in any other person by or\nunder this Constitution or any other law has not been discriminatory\nshall be conclusive and shall not be called in question in any court. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics\nand underlined bold italics] 184    The\nlast sentence of para 32 of the 1966 Report (reproduced in full above\nat [87]) is also relevant and is, in fact, referred to in para 33\nof the same report (see the text in underlined bold italics in the\nquotation in the preceding paragraph). The last sentence of para 32\nof the 1966 Report reads as follows: … Lastly, it should also be clearly and\ncategorically laid down thatthere shall beno discriminationin\nthe administration of any law, except as expressly authorised by\nthe Constitution, against any person on the groundonlyofrace, religion, place of birth or descent.\n[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics] 185    It\ncan be seen that the 1966 Report was concerned, in the main, with the\nentrenching of fundamental rights relating torace,\nlanguage as well as religionin a constitutional context.\nAs pointed out in the 1966 Report itself (at para 33), given Singapore’s\nstatus as a newly-independent sovereign State at that time, “an\nimpregnable shield againstracialcommunalism\nandreligiousbigotry” [emphasis\nadded] had to be put in place; otherwise, societal division and/or\nfriction on racial, linguistic and/or religious lines could have\nresulted in an acutely painful (or even fatal) rending or tearing apart\nof Singapore’s social fabric. That Singapore was (and continues\nto be) a multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural as well as\nmulti-lingual society meant that it was (and remains) particularly\nsusceptible to such a tragic fate if minority rights in relation\nto race, language and religion are not protected constitutionally.\nMore importantly for the purposes of the present appeals, there\nwas no focus whatsoever on the issue of discrimination based on gender,\nsex and/or sexual orientation in the 1966 Report, and hence,no inclusionof these factors as prohibited\ngrounds of discrimination under what is now Art 12(2).\nIt might well be the case that the time is now appropriate for the\ninclusion of these factors as prohibited grounds of discrimination\nwithin our constitutional framework. However, that is a matter which\nis entirely outside the remit of the court, and must (if at all)\nbe effected (as already explained above at [92]) by our legislature\nviaa constitutional amendment instead.Returning\nto the present appeals, it is clear, in our view, that given the\nlinguistic as well as historical contexts set out above, s 377A\n(which relates to matters of gender, sex and/or sexual orientation)\ndoesnotfall within the scope of\nArt 12(2). For that reason, it cannot possibly be inconsistent with\nArt 12(2). 186    Ms Barker\nargued in her written submissions that domestic law, including the\nSingapore Constitution, should as far as possible be interpreted\nconsistently with Singapore’s international obligations (seeYong Vui Kongat [59]). She further argued\nthat one of those obligations was to eliminate discrimination on\nthe basis of sexual orientation, and pointed out that our Government\nhad stated that the Singapore Constitution contained protection\nfrom discrimination on this particular basis. In support of this\ncontention, Ms Barker cited Singapore’s “Responses to the list of\nissues and questions with regard to the consideration of the fourth\nperiodic report” dated 12 May 2011 to the United Nations’ Committee\non the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (“Singapore’s\n12 May 2011 Response”). Paragraphs 31 and 31.1 of Singapore’s 12 May\n2011 Response state as follows: 31.Please comment on reports with regard\nto prevalent and systematic discrimination against women based on\nsexual orientation and gender identity in the social, cultural,\npolitical and economic spheres in the State party. What measures\nare being undertaken to address these problems, especially with\na view to destigmatizing and promoting tolerance to that end. 31.1  The principle of equality of all\npersons before the law is enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic\nof Singapore, regardless of gender, sexual orientation and gender\nidentity. All persons in Singapore are entitled to the equal protection\nof the law, and have equal access to basic resources such as education,\nhousing and healthcare. Like heterosexuals, homosexuals are free to\nlead their lives and pursue their social activities. Gay groups\nhave held public discussions and published websites, and there are\nfilms and plays on gay themes and gay bars and clubs in Singapore. … 187    With\nrespect, we do not think there is any merit in this argument by Ms Barker.\nFirst, the above extract from para 31.1 of Singapore’s 12 May 2011\nResponse does not in any way suggest that Art 12(2) should be expanded\nto include protection from discrimination based on “gender, sexual\norientation and gender identity” since it makes no reference to\neither Art 12(2) or its prohibited grounds of discrimination (viz, race, religion, place of birth and\ndescent). The phrase “equality of all persons before the law” in\nthe above extract is, in our view, a reference to Art 12(1), under which\nthe “reasonable classification” test would indeed apply to all persons regardless\nof “gender, sexual orientation and gender identity” (see above at [93]). 188    Secondly,\nand more fundamentally, international law and domestic law are regarded\nin Singapore asseparatesystems\nof law, and the former does not form part of the latter “until and\nunless it has been applied as or definitely declared to be part\nof domestic law by a domestic court” (see, in the context of customary\ninternational law,Yong Vui Kongat\n[91] as well as the decision of this court inNguyen\nTuong Vanat [94]). Therefore, for the purposes of the\npresent appeals, Singapore’s treaty obligations under international\ntreaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Discrimination against Women would not automatically have the effect\nof amending the Singapore Constitution to include new prohibited grounds\nof discrimination under Art 12(2).",
        "Conclusion": "189    The\npresent appeals were argued by both Ms Barker as well as Mr Ravi\nwith great passion on behalf of their respective clients. This is\nnot surprising, especially when one takes into account the intensely controversial\n(and even emotional) nature of the arguments surrounding the nature\nand function of s 377A which have been canvassed by proponents on\neither side of the extra-legal divide. Indeed, many of the arguments\ntendered to this court, whilst valid (or, at least, plausible) in\ntheir own right, involvedextra-legal considerations\nand matters of social policy which were outside the remit of the\ncourt, and should, instead, have been canvassed in the legislative\nsphere.It is entirely appropriate, at this juncture, to\nreiterate a point we have already made several times in the course\nof this judgment, not least because it is an extremely important\nand fundamental one: the court can only considerlegal(as\nopposed toextra-legal) arguments. This\nensures that it will not become a “mini-legislature”. The courtcannot – and must not– assumelegislativefunctions which are necessarily\nbeyond its remit. To do so would be to efface the very separation\nof powers which confers upon the court itslegitimacyin\nthe first place. If the court were to assume legislative functions,\nit would no longer be able to sit to assess the legality of statutes\nfrom anobjectiveperspective. Worse\nstill, it would necessarily be involved in expressing views on extra-legal\nissues which would – in the nature of things – be (or at least be\nperceived to be)subjectivein nature.\nThis would further erode thelegitimacyof\nthe court, which ought only to sit to administer the law in anobjectivemanner. 190    We\nhave carefully considered all the legal arguments tendered to this court\nin all their various forms (including the relevant historical materials). For\nthe reasons set out above, we dismiss both the present appeals.\nGiven the unusual nature of these proceedings (not least because\nthe decision of this court has implications for male homosexuals\nor bisexual males who might fall within the ambit of s 377A generally),\nwe make no order as to costs both here and below. The usual consequential\norders will apply. Whilst we understand the deeply-held personal\nfeelings of the Appellants, there is nothing that this court can\ndo to assist them. Their remedy lies, if at all, in the legislative\nsphere."
