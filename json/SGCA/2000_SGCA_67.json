        "Facts": "It was undisputed that the appellant had given to one Tan Siew Lam (‘TSL’)a\n\nplastic bag containing 62.76 grams of morphine. This transaction was witnessed by officers of the\n\nCentral Narcotics Bureau and both the appellant and TSL were arrested soon after the transaction\n\ntook place. They were jointly tried in the High Court and were both convicted. TSL chose not to\n\nappeal. The appellant’s story was that he was an innocent courier who had unwittingly delivered\n\nthe drugs. He claimed that he was running an errand for a friend named Ah Seng (aka John) and did\n\nnot know that he was delivering drugs.According to the appellant, he had planned to meet John at the Ang Mo Kio MRT\n\nstation in order to give him a ride back to Johore. However, upon arriving at the station, John told\n\nhim that he had to wait for his girlfriend and thereafter he had to make a delivery to Bishan before\n\nhe could return with the appellant to Johore. The appellant, being pressed for time, suggested that\n\nhe make the delivery while John waited for his girlfriend. John agreed and gave him a plastic bag to\n\ngive to TSL. The appellant claimed that he never suspected that the contents were drugs or anything\n\nillegal. Instead, he believed that he was delivering Chinese New Year goodies and decorations, the\n\nChinese New Year being just a few days away. Upon meeting TSL, the appellant was given a red packet\n\ncontaining $168.00.Upon his arrest and thereafter, the appellant told lies and never mentioned John\n\nor any other aspect of the story he relied on in court. In court, he confessed to his lies but said\n\nthat he lied because he was afraid when he discovered he was being arrested for a drug related\n\noffence, which he knew was very serious. At the trial, TSL raised a token defence but testified for\n\nthe appellant and told a story that appeared to corroborate the appellant’s story.The judge rejected the appellant’s story and convicted him. He was sentenced to\n\ndeath as required by s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and the second schedule to the Act. The\n\nappellant appealed against his conviction.",
        "Held": ", dismissing the appeal:(1) Pursuant to s 18(1) of the Act, the appellant, being in possession of the\n\n  plastic bag which contained the drugs, was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession and\n\n  further, under s 18(2), was presumed to know the nature of those drugs. The burden was thus on the\n\n  appellant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know what the contents of the\n\n  plastic bag were. It was for the appellant to satisfy the court that he was an innocent courier\n\n  (see¶23).(2) The argument that the CNB had not conducted a sufficiently thorough\n\n  investigation which would have revealed evidence to support the appellant’s story was highly\n\n  speculative. The investigations that must be carried out by the CNB must depend on the\n\n  circumstances and in the circumstances of the case, the CNB could not be faulted for not making\n\n  any further investigations into those areas argued for by the appellant’s counsel (see¶24).(3) The crux of the matter was that the appellant had lied upon arrest and had\n\n  persistently failed to reveal the story he alleged was true until the trial. If he was innocent\n\n  and truly believed that he was delivering something innocuous like food and decorations, there\n\n  would have been no need for him to lie when questioned upon arrest. On the contrary, he should\n\n  have been forthcoming with the story about John. The reason for the lies – fear upon arrest –\n\n  was an excuse that rang hollow particularly because he remained silent about this defence even\n\n  after he was formally charged. Even the appellant recognised that had he told the arresting\n\n  officers about John, in all probability John could have been arrested. If the appellant were truly\n\n  innocent and fearful, he would not have hesitated to tell the arresting officers about John (see¶¶25-27).(4) It does not follow that a witness who has lied once ought to suffer the\n\n  rejection of all his evidence. In such circumstances, the witness’ evidence must be scrutinised\n\n  with great care. It is not necessary to enter a discourse on the distinction between ‘credibility\n\n  lies’ and ‘probative lies’. Ultimately, what significance a court should place on a lie must\n\n  depend on the circumstances and the issue in dispute. In this case, the appellant’s lies upon\n\n  arrest were told because of a realisation of guilt and this guilt stemmed from his knowledge of\n\n  the contents of the plastic bag (see¶29);Zoneff v R(2000) HCA 28 referred.(5) There was a contradiction in the judge’s grounds of decision concerning\n\n  the standard of proof expected of the appellant relating to his knowledge of the drugs. This\n\n  question therefore followed: did this confusion result in a substantial miscarriage of justice as\n\n  laid down in s 54(3) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322)? InNg Eng Eng Kooi v PP[1970] 1 MLJ 267, the Federal Court of Malaysia held that where a trial judge misdirected himself\n\n  as to the quantum of proof necessary to rebut a presumptive fact, but rejected the evidence of the\n\n  defence witnessesin toto, the misdirection had no effect on the result which would still\n\n  be the same if the trial judge had correctly directed himself. The judge’s mistake would, in\n\n  such a case, not result in a substantial miscarriage of justice. This was true of this case and,\n\n  therefore, the contradiction occasioned no miscarriage of justice and the appeal would therefore\n\n  be dismissed (see¶¶31-35);Ng\n\n  Eng Eng Kooi v PP[1970] 1 MLJ 267followed.Case(s) referred toNg Eng Eng Kooi v PP[1970] 1 MLJ 267(folld)R v Lucas[1981] QB 720 (refd)Zoneff v R(2000) HCA 28 (refd)",
        "Legislation referred to": "Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) ss 5(1)(a) and 33Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322) s 54(3)JUDGMENT:Grounds of Judgment1.    The appellant was convicted by the High Court of a capital\n\ncharge of trafficking in 3 packets of morphine containing a net weight of 62.76 grams. He was\n\nsentenced to suffer the mandatory punishment of death. We heard his appeal and dismissed it. We now\n\ngive our reasons.2.    We should add that jointly tried with the appellant before\n\nthe High court was one Tan Siew Lam (TSL). The charge against TSL was in relation to having the same\n\nthree packets of morphine in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. Neither TSL nor the\n\nappellant objected to the joint trial. TSL was similarly convicted and sentenced, but he chose not\n\nto appeal.",
        "The facts": "3.    A great part of the evidence tendered before the court was\n\nundisputed. On 1 February 2000, at about 10.10pm a number of Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers\n\nwere on surveillance duties in the vicinity of Block 163, Bishan Street 13, #08-168 (the flat). TSL\n\nresided in the flat. A Malaysian registered vchicle JEQ 8706 was seen being driven into the car-park\n\nof the adjacent Block 164. The driver was later ascertained to be the appellant. He was then wearing\n\na dark-coloured cap. He alighted from the vehicle and walked to the void deck of Block 164 where he\n\nmade a call from a public telephone located there. Sgt Eddie Wee who walked past him heard him say\n\nover the phone \"Come down. I am here.\" The number of that public phone was 3543208. The\n\nappellant then walked back to his vehicle and stood beside it. It was then about 10.15pm. TheCall\n\nTrace Reportof Singtel Mobile showed that a 10-second call was made to mobile phone No 96714234\n\nfrom telephone 3543208 at 10.1219 pm.4.    At about the same time, TSL was seen coming out of the flat.\n\nHe was talking on a handphone as he walked down the staircase to the ground floor. On reaching the\n\nground, he then walked in the direction of Block 164, towards the appellant. TSL was not carrying\n\nanything. As TSL met up with the appellant, the latter took an orange-coloured plastic bag from the\n\ncar and handed it over to TSL who then walked away with the plastic bag in the direction of Block\n\n163 which was the same direction he came. This handing over of the orange plastic bag was seen by\n\ntwo CNB officers, S/Sgt Tan Yian Chye and Sgt Eddie Wee.5.    At Block 163, TSL took the lift up to the 8thfloor and he was arrested as he emerged from the lift. The orange plastic bag held by TSL was\n\nseized; so were a bunch of keys and a handphone (bearing No. 96714234) held by Tan in his left hand.\n\nUpon being questioned by a CNB officer, Ronnie See, TSL said the orange-coloured plastic bag\n\ncontained four packets of heroin and they belonged to him.6.    Much later when the orange plastic bag was opened by the\n\nInvestigating Officer, Insp Tan Choon Hoe, three newspaper bundles were found therein and in each\n\nnewspaper bundle was a plastic packet containing yellowish granular substance. The substance in the\n\nthree packets was analysed to contain not less than 62.76 grams of morphine.7.    In the meantime, the appellant drove off from the car-park\n\nof Block 164 but soon stopped his vehicle at the car-park besides Block 162. It was then about\n\n10.17pm. He alighted from his vehicle and walked towards a public telephone at the void deck of\n\nBlock 167 where he made a call. There, he was arrested by CNB officers. The officers took the\n\nappellant back to his vehicle and seized a red packet, with $168/- in it, which was on the driver’s\n\nseat. A black and red cap was found on him as well.8.    A while later, at the car-park, the appellant, on being\n\nasked by Sr Staff Sgt Ang Oon Tho, told the latter that he had no drugs in the car and that he was\n\nthere to take an \"ang pow\" from an unknown male Chinese who called him on his handphone\n\nNo. 92297274 at 9.00pm and that he had not handed anything to that person.9.    The evidence of TSL was that, through the arrangement of a\n\nfriend Ah Sing (also known as John), he was to receive a plastic bag of goods from an Indian man. He\n\nadmitted that the goods were heroin. He said he ordered four packages of the substance and did not\n\nknow why he got only three. He admitted that mobile phone bearing No. 96714234 belonged to him. TSL\n\ndid not really raise any defence; instead he admitted to the charge.10.    As for the appellant, his defence was that he did not know\n\nthat the plastic bag he was delivering to Tan contained drugs. He thought it contained Chinese New\n\nYear goodies or decorations, as Chinese New Year was just four days away falling on 5 February 2000.\n\nHe was merely doing a favour for John. He did not look inside the plastic bag to see what it\n\ncontained. He trusted John.11.    The learned trial judge had no difficulty in convicting Tan\n\nof the charge he faced. His counsel did not even make any closing submission on his behalf. As\n\nregards the appellant, the trial judge rejected his defence that he did not know that the plastic\n\nbag contained drugs.",
        "Events enumerated by the appellant": "12.    We shall now set out in some detail, the events as\n\ndescribed by the appellant leading to his allegedly doing the favour for John and thereby\n\nunwittingly getting involved in drug trafficking. He told the court that he resided in Johore Bahru\n\nwith his parents. He was a student doing computer studies with the computer school, Informatics, in\n\nJohore Bahru. On 1 February 2000, he was asked by his father to send his mother down to Singapore to\n\nwithdraw some money from a POSB ATM machine at Woodlands. At around 6.00pm he received a call from\n\nJohn who was then in Singapore. John asked if the appellant could give him a lift from Singapore\n\nback to Johore Bahru. The appellant agreed to pick up John at the Ang Mo Kio (AMK) MRT Station.13.    That evening the appellant dropped his mother off at\n\nWoodlands at about 9.30pm and as she also wanted to buy some things in a nearby market he decided he\n\ncould make use of the time to go to the AMK MRT station to pick up John. He told his mother that he\n\nwould be back in half an hour. On seeing John at the station, the appellant was told by John that he\n\nhad to wait for his girlfriend who would only be arriving in 30 to 45 minutes’ time. John also\n\ntold the appellant that he had to deliver something in a plastic bag to a friend at Bishan. In order\n\nto save time, as his mother would be waiting at Woodlands, the appellant volunteered to deliver the\n\nthings for John to the friend at Bishan. He assumed that the things he was delivering were Chinese\n\nNew Year goodies and decorations. John did not tell him what those things were. Neither did John\n\ngive him a description of the person to whom the plastic bag was to be delivered. All John said was\n\nthat the person was at Block 143 Bishan Street 13 and that John would call that person to come down\n\nto meet the appellant.14.    The appellant arrived at Block 163 at Bishan Street 13 but\n\ncould not locate Tan so he made a phone call to John (on his handphone) from a public phone at the\n\nvoid deck of Block 164 telling him to ask Tan to come down from his flat to collect the stuff.\n\nAccording to him he told John \"Look, ask your friend to come down, I’m here.\" Before he\n\ncould also ask if John’s girlfriend had arrived, the line was cut off. He tried calling John again\n\nbut could not get through to John. Then remembering that John had given him a Singapore number which\n\nhe had stored in his pager’s memory, he called that number, which turned out to be TSL’s\n\nhandphone number. However, after his phone rang for a while, his call was directed to the voicemail\n\nbox. He hung up after about 10 seconds of the recorded message, giving him all the available\n\noptions, was played. He returned to his car and shortly thereafter a person (TSL) appeared before\n\nthe appellant who asked the latter if he was John’s friend. The appellant answered in the\n\naffirmative and handed the plastic bag to TSL. TSL told the court that he was instructed by John not\n\nto open the package to examine it. In exchange, TSL gave the appellant a red packet which the latter\n\ninitially declined to receive, as he did not want to be paid for doing a favour for a friend. TSL’s\n\nevidence confirmed that there was this reluctance. But TSL persuaded him to accept it for good luck\n\nand for Chinese New Year and the appellant took it.15.    Later upon discovering that the red packet contained\n\n$168/-, a far larger sum than he had expected, he was happy and called his girlfriend to discuss\n\nwhat they could do with that money. CNB officers arrested him as he was talking to his girlfriend.\n\nHe asserted that he was purely an innocent carrier.16.    As regards the statements given by him upon his arrest, the\n\nappellant admitted that they were lies but explained that he was then frightened, having realised\n\nthat he was implicated in a drug offence. At that moment he thought it better to dissociate himself\n\nfrom John, and to deny having given anything to TSL. This fear led him to lie.",
        "Reasons for judge’s rejection of his defence": "17.    We shall now examine the reasons the learned trial judge\n\ngave for rejecting the appellant’s defence that he did not know what he was carrying and that he\n\nwas only doing a favour for a friend. These were the considerations which led the trial judge to his\n\nconclusion:-(i) The trial judge found the appellant’s behaviour strange. Why did he not\n\n  tell John to find his own way back to Johore Bahru as his girlfriend would be delayed by perhaps\n\n  up to 45 minutes? Instead, he volunteered to deliver the plastic bag to Bishan for John when he\n\n  knew that all these would mean that he would make his mother wait even longer and when he himself\n\n  was unfamiliar with Bishan and did not even know the person to whom he was supposed to deliver the\n\n  plastic bag to. Furthermore, why didn’t he ask John to come along as the journey from AMK MRT\n\n  station to Bishan would only take 10-15 minutes and the return trip would take no more than half\n\n  an hour. Thus, there would be time for John to go to Bishan and come back before his girlfriend\n\n  turned up.(ii) The appellant said he did not check the plastic bag because he trusted\n\n  John. Yet he did not know John’s full name, his address, or his place of work. They had been\n\n  acquainted for only some 2 to 3 months.(iii) The trial judge accepted as plausible the prosecution’s submission that\n\n  there was a motive in TSL’s evidence that he was told by John not to open and inspect the\n\n  package on receiving it. The trial judge felt this assertion was really to help the appellant as\n\n  by the very nature of such transactions, it would follow that the delivery would be hurried and\n\n  surreptitious. There was hardly a need to remind TSL not to open the plastic bag to check the\n\n  goods.(iv) The trial judge found that the appellant did speak to TSL during the\n\n  10-second call made to TSL’s handphone 96714234 when the appellant asked TSL to \"come\n\n  down\". If it were true that 96714234 was a number given by John to the appellant as John’s\n\n  other number, why should John give to the appellant TSL’s handphone number?(v) TSL was then holding the handphone. He was expecting a call. There was no\n\n  reason why he would not answer the call but allow it to go into the voicemail. The trial judge\n\n  disbelieved the appellant that he had made 3 calls. He also disbelieved TSL’s evidence that he\n\n  received no calls from the appellant that evening.(v) The trial judge felt that if indeed the events were as the appellant\n\n  described in court, why didn’t he so state when being questioned. He should have been outraged\n\n  and would have told the officers he was framed by John. The trial judge was conscious that the\n\n  fact that a witness lied on one or two points did not mean that his entire evidence must be\n\n  rejected. But having carefully scrutinised the evidence he found the appellant not to be a\n\n  truthful witness and that the account given by the appellant to be incredible. After referring toR\n\n  v Lucas[1981] QB 720 at 724, he held that the lies told by the appellant related to a\n\n  material issue in the case and were motivated by a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth. All\n\n  these were consistent with the fact that he knew he was delivering a controlled drug to TSL.18.    The trial judge further found that the appellant’s\n\nfailure to enquire of John as to the nature of the contents of the bag he was asked to deliver or to\n\nmake a personal examination himself when he could have easily done so, ‘showed that he was\n\nwilfully shutting his eyes to the truth and was prepared to do anything including act illegally\n\nirregardless [sic] of the consequences’. The trial judge equated this wilful blindness to\n\nknowledge that the appellant knew the bag contained drugs.19.    In the premises, the trial judge concluded that the\n\nappellant had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge operated against him.",
        "Argument of counsel": "20.    Counsel for the appellant went through at great lengths to\n\nshow that it was likely that the appellant did make the three calls that evening. Relying on theCall\n\nTrace Reportwhich showed that a call was received on handphone 96714234 at 10.01pm lasting 32\n\nseconds from 96248258, counsel said that could be the call made by John to TSL. Furthermore, if John\n\nand TSL were part of a drug-ring, it was not impossible that a handphone used by John could be left\n\nwith TSL. At the time of TSL’s arrest he had three handphones (of which two were seized at the\n\nflat), including handphone No. 96714234. So when the appellant made the third call, i.e., to number\n\n96714234, it was possible that the handphone could have been switched off or its battery was flat or\n\nJohn was talking to TSL and the call was diverted to voicemail.21.    Counsel also criticised the investigative agency for not\n\ncarrying out a thorough investigation. Among the several complaints in this regard were:-(i) NoCall Trace Reportswere done on the other two handphones of TSL.\n\n  Neither was any search carried out on all incoming pagings on the appellant’s pager, or on the\n\n  memory stored in the appellant’s pager;(ii) there was no evidence to show how many calls were made from the public\n\n  phone 3543208. The prosecution thus had not proved that only one call was made from the public\n\n  phone 3543208;(iii) there was also no investigation into what John’s handphone number was\n\n  and noCall Trace Reportsobtained for the same. If all these had been gone into, a\n\n  reasonable doubt would have been raised.22.    Counsel’s third contention related to the three lies the\n\nappellant was alleged to have told Sr Staff Sgt Ang Oon Tho:-(i) that he had received a call on his pager from TSL;(ii) that he had gone to take an ‘ang-pow’ from TSL;(iii) that he had not delivered anything to TSL.Quite rightly, counsel centred his argument on the third lie. He contended that\n\non being confronted by the CNB officers, the appellant had one of two choices, and here we would\n\nquote counsel:-\"(i) tell the truth and complicate the whole picture by having to prove\n\n  the existence of John and his connection to the whole fix the appellant now found himself in,\n\n  perhaps even by then doubting John’s entire story about having to wait for his girlfriend; or(ii) conceal the fact that the appellant had anything to do with the orange\n\n  package, and hope that no one had seen him passing the package to (TSL).\"In the spur of the moment the appellant chose option (ii).",
        "Our views": "23.    In our view, in making the submission in the manner the\n\nappellant’s counsel did, one important aspect seemed to have been overlooked. There was clear\n\nevidence that the appellant delivered the orange plastic bag to TSL and in that plastic bag there\n\nwere drugs. The appellant admitted at the trial that he delivered the plastic bag to TSL. Pursuant\n\nto s 18(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, the appellant, being in possession of the plastic bag which\n\ncontained the drugs, was presumed to have had that drug in his possession and further, under s\n\n18(2), was presumed to know the nature of those drugs. The burden was thus on the appellant to\n\nprove, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know the contents in the plastic bag. It was\n\nfor the appellant to satisfy the court that he was an innocent carrier.24.    Counsel’s argument that the appellant did make the three\n\nphone calls, and his allegations that the investigative agency had failed to conduct full searches\n\ninto calls made from public phone 3543208 and on the calls made to and from the other two handphones\n\nseized at the flat of TSL, etc, were highly speculative. Obviously what investigations should be\n\ncarried out by the CNB must depend on the circumstances. It would be recalled that on being\n\nquestioned by Sr/S/Sgt Ang Oon Tho, the appellant did not mention anything about John, or that he\n\nmade any calls to anyone. He also denied handing anything over to any person. He only stated that\n\nsomeone whom he did not know, paged him at 9.00pm that evening and that he was to collect an \"ang-pow\"\n\nfrom a male Chinese. In these circumstances, we did not see how CNB could be faulted for not making\n\nany further investigations into those areas alleged by the appellant’s counsel.25.    As we perceived it, the crux of the matter revolved round\n\nthe statements the appellant made to Sr/S/Sgt Ang and his continued non-disclosure until the trial\n\nof the fact that he was doing a favour for John in carrying the plastic bag from Ang Mo Kio to\n\nBishan. We had carefully considered the arguments of his counsel that he took a gamble, thinking\n\nthat perhaps the CNB officers did not see him passing the package to TSL, and opted not to say\n\nanything about John and thus had to deny having passed any package to TSL. What troubled us\n\nextremely was why did he even have to take that gamble and this was what made his version given in\n\ncourt incredible. All the more so when he himself admitted that the CNB officers did ask him what\n\ndid he pass to TSL. So there was no question of him thinking that the CNB officers did not see him\n\npass the plastic bag to TSL. If he were an innocent carrier, as he claimed to be, then why did he\n\nnot say that he was only delivering a package of Chinese New Year goodies to TSL on behalf of John?26.    The appellant knew clearly what the CNB officers were\n\nafter. Sr/S/Sgt Ang Oon Tho’s first question to him was \"Is there any drugs inside your\n\nvehicle.\" The appellant was told upon arrest that he was involved in a drug activity. He said\n\nhe was frightened. His explanation for the lies was, and here we quote him:-\"when I was arrested, someone told me what did I give to the Chinese guy\n\n  and then someone pulled me away into the car and when I was in the car, I thought there must be\n\n  something wrong in the plastic bag and it had something to do with drugs because they were CNB\n\n  officers. And I knew that if anyone is involved in drug activities in Singapore, he’d be\n\n  (hanged) to death.\"This excuse rang hollow particularly in the light of the fact that even after the\n\nappellant was formally charged, and statements taken from him, he still did not divulge anything\n\nabout John or that he was set-up by John. He further added that because he was scared he stuck to\n\nhis story. But he recognised that if he had at the time of his arrest divulged the role of John in\n\nall this, John could have been arrested. Here again his reason was:-\"Because I’m the one who gave the plastic bag to the Chinese guy … and\n\n  I was afraid of that. And I didn’t want to get involved with John’s activities or whatever\n\n  they were.\"27.    If he were scared, and if he were innocent, then any person\n\nin his shoes would have narrated the facts of how he was made use of by John and not create a false\n\nstory to shelter John.28.    Counsel for the appellant relied upon a recent case of the\n\nHigh Court of Australia inZoneff v R(2000) HCA 28 where that court drew a distinction\n\nbetween ‘credibility lies’ and ‘probative lies’ to contend that the lies told by the\n\nappellant were only ‘credibility lies’. The following passage of the Australian High Court was\n\ncited by his counsel:-Leaving aside irrelevant or inconsequential lies, a distinction has been drawn\n\n  between so-called ‘credibility lies’ and ‘probative lies’. The former are said to be those\n\n  which, according to their content, affect the credibility of the accused’s evidence and thus the\n\n  weight which the jury may give to other testimony of the accused. In this sense, a conclusion that\n\n  the accused has lied upon one matter, even peripheral to the offence charged, may make the jury\n\n  scrutinise with more care (perhaps scepticism) other testimony given by the accused. It might, in\n\n  this way, contribute indirectly to the rejection of the accused’s version of critical events and\n\n  the acceptance of that propounded by the prosecution.Probative lies, on the other hand, are those ‘which naturally indicate guilt\n\n  … a hard test to satisfy’. This is a ‘hard test’ precisely because it is rare that a lie\n\n  about a particular matter will be so crucial as, of itself, if proved, to establish directly guilt\n\n  beyond reasonable doubt of a criminal offence. It could happen if, for example, the lie related to\n\n  an object indisputably linked to the offence. Take a handkerchief with bloodstains proved by DNA\n\n  evidence to be that of the victim but falsely attributed by the accused to a nosebleed. It is\n\n  testimony of this kind that has been explained as evidencing a ‘consciousness of guilt’. It is\n\n  said to be such a lie because the accused tells it knowing that telling the truth would\n\n  necessarily, and without more, establish guilt of the offence charges.Recently, inR v Whitethe Supreme Court of Canada expressed a view\n\n  about ‘consciousness of guilt evidence’ with which I agree. It said that the ‘label is\n\n  somewhat misleading and its use should be discouraged’. In its place that Court has proposed\n\n  what it describes as a more ‘general description’ using ‘more neutral language’ such as\n\n  ‘evidence of post-offence conduct’. At least two considerations support this change. First, it\n\n  adopts an objective classification. It concentrates on the significance of such conduct (including\n\n  lies). It postulates no necessary psychological well-springs (‘mental traces’) for lies. It\n\n  merely measures any suggested lies against other evidence of the accused’s involvement in the\n\n  crime. Secondly, as the Canadian court points out, the words ‘consciousness of guilt’ suggest\n\n  a conclusion about the conduct in question which tends to undermine the presumption of innocence.\n\n  The expression may prejudice the accused in the eyes of the jury. This is the ‘circularity’ to\n\n  which reference has earlier been made. It should be avoided in any direction about the use that\n\n  may be made of a juror’s belief that the accused has lied in or out of court. That is the law in\n\n  Canada. It should be accepted as the law in Australia.29.    The learned trial judge in the present case was aware that\n\nit did not follow that just because a witness had told a lie that all his evidence must be rejected.\n\nQuite rightly, he said in such circumstances the witness’ evidence must be scrutinised with great\n\ncare. We do not wish to go into a discourse on the distinction between ‘credibility lies’ and\n\n‘probative lies’. We do not think it would be a profitable exercise. Ultimately what\n\nsignificance this court should place on a lie must depend on the circumstances and the issue in\n\ndispute. Here, the appellant was asked specifically at the time of his arrest what were the things\n\nhe passed to TSL. If he had genuinely thought that the things were Chinese New Year goodies and\n\ndecorations why did he deny passing anything over to TSL. This question went to the heart of the\n\nmatter: his knowledge of the things he passed over. We had no doubt that the false answers were\n\ngiven because of a realization of guilt. We would reiterate that at no time until the trial did he\n\ndisclose the existence of John and the favour he did for John. There was, however, a bare assertion\n\nby the appellant in the witness box, that at some point he did tell a CNB officer of the existence\n\nof John. But he could not identify who that officer was. In the circumstances, the trial judge was\n\nentitled, and was entirely correct, to have rejected his claim of ignorance. The version that was\n\nplaced before the court smacked clearly of an afterthought. In our judgment, the appellant knew what\n\nhe was carrying and passing over to TSL.30.    We ought to mention that counsel for the appellant averred\n\nthat the trial judge was wrong to have also found that the appellant was guilty of wilful blindness\n\nwhen he did not examine the package all the way to Bishan, before delivering it to TSL, when he had\n\nample opportunity to do so. For the reasons above, it would be wholly unnecessary for us to go into\n\nthis aspect of the matter.",
        "Standard of proof": "31.    Finally, there was the question of the standard of proof\n\nwhich we must briefly touch on. In ¶17.9 of the Grounds of Decision the learned trial judge\n\nstated:-As the 2ndAccused had therefore not proven an absence of knowledge\n\n  of that which he possessedbeyond a reasonable doubt, the presumptions in the MDA against\n\n  him became final and conclusive. He therefore knowingly had possession of the 62.76 grams of\n\n  morphine and trafficked in it when he gave it to the 1stAccused thereby failing to\n\n  prove the contraryon a balance of probabilities– namely that he did not traffic in the\n\n  said drug. (Emphasis added).32.    It would be seen that there is a contradiction in this\n\nparagraph as to the standard of proof which the appellant must satisfy in relation to the proof\n\nrequired on his knowledge of the things in the plastic bag. Thus, the issue that arose was whether\n\nthis confusion had resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice as laid down in s 54(3) of the\n\nSupreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322).33.    InNg Eng Kooi v PP[1970] 1 MLJ 267the Federal Court of Malaysia held that where the trial\n\njudge misdirected himself as to the quantum of proof necessary to rebut a presumptive fact, but\n\nrejected the evidence of the defence witnessesin toto, the misdirection had no effect on the\n\nresult which would still be the same if the trial judge had correctly directed himself. The judge’s\n\nmistake would, in such a case, not result in a substantial miscarriage of justice.34.    In the present case, as shown above, the trial judge had\n\nclearly, for good reasons, rejected the appellant’s claim that he did not know the nature of the\n\nthings in the plastic bag that he was carrying. The trial judge found the appellant to be an\n\nuntruthful witness. Therefore, notwithstanding this apparent confusion on the question of the\n\nrequired standard of proof, we had no hesitation in concluding that the finding of the trial judge\n\nshould be upheld because it had not, as a result, occasioned any substantial miscarriage of justice.35.    In the premises, we dismissed the appeal."
