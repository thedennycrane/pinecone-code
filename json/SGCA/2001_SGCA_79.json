        "The background facts": "2.     The\n\nrelevant facts giving rise to the appeal are briefly these. SC Piling were the main contractors for\n\nthe construction of a runway, associated taxiways and drainage at Changi East (the project).\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (Mindef) is the employer of the project. PWD Consultants (Airport\n\nDevelopment Division) (PWD Consultants) are the consultants on site for the employer and are\n\nresponsible for, among other things, the pavement design in the project. SC Piling entered into a\n\nsub-contract with Gim Chuan Contractor Pte Ltd (Gim Chuan), whereby the latter undertook the\n\ncarrying out of the following works:(i) runway pavement(ii) CAAS taxiway fillets(iii) MINDEF taxiway fillets up to 75 m from east of the runway centre line(iv) Three reinforced concrete box culverts and U-drains including outfall structures(v) All drainage works west of the runway(vi) All drainage works across the runway(vii) All drainage works east of the runway until western edge of taxiway(viii) Turfing works until western edge of parallel taxiway(the principal sub-contract).3.     Gim\n\nChuan in turn sub-contracted to Samwoh, who were the nominated sub-contractors, the following works:(i) runway pavement(ii) CAAS taxiway fillets(iii) MINDEF taxiway fillets up to 75m from east of the runway centre line(the subsidiary sub-contract).4.    \n\nUnder the terms of the subsidiary sub-contract, for the purpose of securing the performance of that\n\nsub-contract, Samwoh were required to furnish a performance guarantee in favour of SC Piling for the\n\nsum of S$500,000, being about 5% of the subsidiary sub-contract sum. In compliance with this\n\nrequirement, Samwoh procured ECICS to issue a performance guarantee dated 30 September 1999 (the performance\n\nguarantee) in favour of SC Piling.5.    \n\nParagraph (2) of the recital of the performance guarantee stated that ECICS agreed to guarantee\n\nthe due performance of the [subsidiary sub-contract] in the manner set out therein. The\n\nperformance guarantee was therefore intended to guarantee the due performance by Samwoh of the\n\nsubsidiary sub-contract, and not the performance of any other obligation of Samwoh to SC Piling. Nor\n\nwas it a performance guarantee to secure the due performance by Gim Chuan of the principal\n\nsub-contract. For the purpose of this appeal, the key provision is Clause 1 which is as follows:The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes and convenants to pay\n\n  in full forthwith upon demand in writing any sum or sums that may from time to time be demanded by\n\n  the Main Contractor up to a maximum aggregate sum ofS$500,000-00 (Singapore Dollars Five\n\n  Hundred Thousand Only)without requiring any proof that the Main Contractor is entitled to\n\n  such sum or sums under the Contract or that the Nominated Subcontractor has failed to execute the\n\n  Contract or is otherwise in breach of the Contract. Any sum or sums so demanded shall be paid\n\n  forthwith by the Guarantor unconditionally, without any deductions whatsoever and notwithstanding\n\n  the existence of any differences or disputes between the Main Contractor and the Nominated\n\n  Subcontractor arising under or out of or in connection with the Contractor or the carrying out of\n\n  work thereunder or as to any amount or amounts payable thereunder and notwithstanding that such\n\n  differences or disputes have been referred to arbitration or are the subject of proceedings in\n\n  Court or is in the midst of any other means of dispute resolution.",
        "Wetness problem at site": "6.     In\n\nOctober 2000, the runway was flooded and Samwoh was unable to carry out their works. The runway\n\ncontinued to have excessive water content in the sub-soil. Samwoh raised the problem with SC Piling\n\nand Gim Chuan in November, and informed them that their experts were of the opinion that the problem\n\ncould have been due to two causes: a high water table and inadequate drainage systems at the site.\n\nNeither SC Piling nor Gim Chuan really accepted that the excessive moisture or water in the subsoil\n\nwas due to or occasioned by the inadequate drainage. At a site discussion between the\n\nrepresentatives of SC Piling, Gim Chuan and Samwoh held on 20 December 2000, SC Pilings\n\nrepresentative stated that owing to the wet weather there was apparently a problem of discharge\n\nof surface run-off at the site, resulting in stagnation and ponding of water, and suggested to\n\nGim Chuan to provide sufficient temporary site drainage to facilitate discharge of the surface\n\nrun-off so as to alleviate the wetness problem. Apparently, the problem excessive moisture or water\n\nin the sub-soil remained and Samwoh investigated further and raised the problem again with Gim Chuan\n\nand SC Piling. However, the problem was not addressed.7.     It\n\nis Samwohs claim that Gim Chuan were obliged to rectify this problem, which Gim Chuan had failed\n\nto do, and that the excessive water content in the sub-soil had rendered it impossible for them to\n\nproceed with the pavement works, which they had contracted to carry out. On 7 February 2001, Samwoh\n\nby a written notice accepted what they considered was Gim Chuans repudiation of the subsidiary\n\nsub-contract and terminated that sub-contract.8.    \n\nAfter the termination of the subsidiary sub-contract, SC Piling and Samwoh entered into negotiations\n\nwith a view to having a contract made directly between them. While the negotiations were in\n\nprogress, Samwoh at the request of SC Piling carried out certain works at the site for a few days.\n\nHowever, the negotiations subsequently broke down, as the parties could not agree on certain terms\n\non which Samwoh would take over the contract. On 28 February 2000, Samwoh stopped working at\n\nthe site which they had started under the temporary arrangement made with SC Piling.9.     On 1\n\nMarch 2001, SC Piling made a demand on ECICS for payment of S$500,000 under the performance\n\nguarantee. Samwoh immediately initiated proceedings, and on 5 March 2001 applied ex parte and\n\nobtained an interim injunction, restraining ECICS from paying the sum to SC Piling, and SC Piling\n\nfrom receiving it. SC Piling soon thereafter applied for the interim injunction to be discharged. On\n\n11 April 2001, the application was heard before a judge in chambers, and the judge allowed the\n\napplication and set aside the interim injunction. Following that, the sum of S$500,000 was paid by\n\nECICS to SC Piling pursuant to the performance guarantee.",
        "Decision below": "10.     The\n\njudge construed the performance guarantee as a demand guarantee and opined that the purposes\n\nof a demand guarantee were two-fold: to deter parties from evading their contractual obligations,\n\nand to afford the beneficiary a speedy remedy. He felt that the court should uphold the contract,\n\nand that an application for interlocutory restraint was improper. He held that the court must lean\n\nin favour of giving effect to the demand under it rather than nullifying it. He considered that the\n\nperformance guarantee was a sort of indemnity or insurance to SC Piling.",
        "The appeal": "11.     The\n\nmain issue in this appeal is whether SC Piling had acted unconscionably in calling on the\n\nperformance guarantee. In Singapore, unconscionability on the part of the beneficiary in calling for\n\npayment on a performance guarantee is a separate and distinct ground from fraud for seeking\n\ninjunctive relief: seeBocotra Construction Pte Ltd and Ors v A-G (No 2)[1995] 2 SLR 733;Raymond\n\nConstruction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong & Anor(11 July 1996, unreported);Min Thai Holdings\n\nPte Ltd v Sunlabel Pte Ltd & Anor[1999] 2 SLR 368;Sin Kian Contractor Pte Ltd v Lian\n\nKok Hong(31 July 1999, unreported);GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd\n\n& Anor[1999] 4 SLR 604; andDauphin Offshore Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v The\n\nPrivate Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan[2000] 1 SLR 657. In\n\ndetermining this issue it is necessary to examine all the relevant facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase including the facts leading up to the demand for payment under the performance guarantee.",
        "Relevant circumstances": "12.    \n\nFrom the documentary evidence adduced, Samwoh at the material time certainly had a serous concern\n\nabout the excessive water content in the sub-soil, which impeded the pavement works to be carried\n\nout by them under the subsidiary sub-contract. They had raised this problem repeatedly with Gim\n\nChuan and SC Piling. Samwohs own experts had also investigated the problem and they had written\n\ndetailed reports on the causes of the excessive water content in the sub-soil, and copies of these\n\nreports were subsequently furnished by Samwoh to Gim Chuan and SC Piling respectively. SC Piling\n\nwere certainly aware of this problem. On 10 January 2001, they wrote to PWD Consultants highlighting\n\ntheir concern of the problem. In their letter they adopted in part the position taken by Samwoh as\n\nto the causes of the excessive water content in the sub-soil. PWD Consultants responded on 16\n\nJanuary 2001. The consultants did not accept that the cause for the excessive water in the ground\n\nwas the high water table; they attributed the problem largely to the unusually wet weather. They\n\nexpressed no opinion on the question whether the cause was the inadequate drainage systems. Samwoh\n\ndid not know of the exchange of correspondence between SC Piling and PWD Consultants until after the\n\nproceedings had commenced.13.    It is not disputed that Samwoh on or about 7 January 2001\n\nterminated the subsidiary sub-contract with Gim Chuan, and stopped work at the site. Whether this\n\ntermination was lawful or otherwise is not in issue before us. SC Piling were fully aware that\n\nSamwoh terminated the subsidiary sub-contract with Gim Chuan and stopped work at the site. They made\n\nno complaint against Samwoh for stopping work. In fact, they also regarded that the subsidiary\n\nsub-contract was at an end, for they commenced negotiations with Samwoh with a view to having a new\n\ncontract between them and Samwoh. While the negotiations were in progress, Samwoh at the request of\n\nSC Piling mobilized their workforce and carried out some pavement works at the site.14.    It is helpful to set out these events in greater detail.\n\nTheir respective representatives met at the office of SC Piling on 13 February 2001. On 14 February\n\n2001, Samwoh wrote to SC Piling as follows:Thank you for the invitation to an informal meeting with your senior management\n\n  at your kind office.We hope that the information provided on the existing site drainage problems,\n\n  the status of Gim Chuans repudiation of our contract and the seriousness of the existing site\n\n  condition and the inherent long-term effects is useful to you.For your information and necessary actions, please.SC Piling also wrote to Samwoh on 15 February 2001 thus:We refer to our meeting with you on 13thFebruary, 2001 at SCPs\n\n  main office with regards to the above.As discussed and agreed, please mobilize one paving team immediately to site by\n\n  19thFebruary, 2001.Terms and conditions of this temporary arrangement will be settled in due\n\n  course.For your immediate action, please.15.    \n\nArising from these letters there was a further meeting between the representatives of Samwoh and SC\n\nPiling at the latters office on 16 February 2001. Following that meeting, Samwoh wrote to SC\n\nPiling on 17 February 2001 a letter, in which they said, among other things:As discussed and agreed, the following conditions shall prevail upon\n\n  mobilization of one Paving Team to your site on the 19 February 2001.a) That you shall ensure proper drainage and ensure that the area is fit for\n\n    paving.b) That we shall not be liable for any defects caused by the pre-existing\n\n    conditions on site, and in this regard of the performance of the sub-grade or sub-base.c) That we shall pave solely on your instructions only.d) That all plant and machinery remain our property and where required, we\n\n    will be at liberty to demobilize and withdraw all such property from site.In this respect, we shall mobilize One Paving Team, with all other terms and\n\nconditions not herein included to be finalized at our next meeting.16.    \n\nPursuant to what was then agreed, Samwoh proceeded to carry out some works at the site. On 28\n\nFebruary 2001, Samwoh wrote a further letter to SC Piling, the material part of which was as\n\nfollows:As previously confirmed by your kind office prior to our mobilization, the\n\n  conditions set out in our letter ref: SWAP/2001/0136_sy are fundamental to our continued presence\n\n  at your site.As explained to you earlier, our investigations into the drainage situation and\n\n  construction problems had never been seriously looked into nor addressed. It would therefore be\n\n  unreasonable to expect us to accept that the pavement is already in a condition that is fit for\n\n  paving, even though you have indicated that you would ensure that it is so.We would therefore clarify that the conditions set out aforesaid are also to be\n\n  retained if we are to continue with the paving. The price quoted was therefore put forward on the\n\n  basis that these conditions are retained.17.    Unfortunately, the parties could not agree on the terms on\n\nwhich Samwoh would take over the contract. As a result, Samwoh discontinued their work at the site.\n\nIt was at that point in time that SC Piling decided to call on the performance guarantee. They made\n\ntheir call on 1 March 2001. It is significant that at the time when the performance guarantee was\n\ncalled, SC Piling had not made any claim against Samwoh for any damage or loss occasioned by either\n\nany breach of the principal sub-contract or any breach of the subsidiary sub-contract. They then\n\ntook steps to prevent Samwoh from removing their plant and equipment from the site. They also\n\nrefused to pay Samwoh the sum due for work done under the temporary arrangement.18.     In\n\nour judgment, on the basis of the facts we have examined, the call for payment by SC Piling under\n\nthe performance guarantee was not based on any bona fide claim they had against Samwoh. The clear\n\ninference is that they invoked the performance guarantee as a bargaining chip to compel Samwoh to\n\nagree to their terms. It was an abusive call on the performance guarantee. In our judgment, in all\n\nthe circumstances, SC Piling had acted unconscionably in calling for payment under the performance\n\nguarantee and should have been restrained from so doing.19.     The\n\njudge below did not consider at all these relevant circumstances. He said:12. The purpose of the demand guarantee is first to serve as a deterrent \n\n  that is to say to subject the instructing party to act with a sense of reason and responsibility\n\n  vis--vis the beneficiary. Next, the purpose of a demand guarantee is to serve as an expeditious\n\n  remedy. If there are disputes they must be settled between the instructing party and the\n\n  beneficiary at a later date. In this respect, it shifts the onus of establishing a wrongful demand\n\n  to the instructing party at a convenient time. An application for interlocutory restrain is\n\n  improper.13. In this case there was a demand guarantee, though called a performance\n\n  guarantee. The Courts should be slow to interfere or tinker with that contractual arrangement.14. The Court must lean in favour of giving effect to a document and a demand\n\n  under it than nullifying it. Given that learning of the law, one of the purposes of the PG was to\n\n  be deterrent against the plaintiffs walking out of the contractual obligations. In other words the\n\n  PG is a sort of indemnity or insurance to SC Piling the main-contractor. Without such a\n\n  performance guarantee the main contract will be at the mercy of the plaintiffs.20.    \n\nWith respect, we are unable to agree with him. Paragraph 2 of the recital of the performance\n\nguarantee expressly stated that it was to secure the performance by Samwoh of the subsidiary\n\nsub-contract. It is obvious to us that the purpose of this guarantee was to secure the performance\n\nof that contract. It was not intended or meant to be a deterrent as the judge held. Whether this\n\nguarantee is called a performance guarantee or demand guarantee is wholly immaterial and has no\n\nsignificance whatsoever. Where a call is made for payment under such guarantee and it is shown that\n\nthere was fraud or unconscionability on the part of the beneficiary in making the call, the court\n\nwould intervene and grant injunctive relief. We therefore do not agree with the judge that an\n\napplication for interlocutory relief is improper. Whether the court would or would not\n\nintervene depends on the circumstances of the case, and it is of course for the applicant to make\n\nout a case of fraud or unconscionability in support of the application for injunctive relief.21.     The\n\njudge then concluded thus:15. The plaintiffs argued that the demand was unconscionable. In my view it was\n\n  the conduct of the plaintiffs [Samwoh] that was unconscionable. It was unconscionable because in\n\n  order to procure the contract they arranged for the PG without the PG they would not have been\n\n  awarded the contract. Having procured the contract they acted in a manner that would have left SC\n\n  Piling in a lurch in a situation where time was very important.The judge, with respect, was wrong in these findings. Reverting to the case at\n\nhand, we find that there was no evidence that Samwoh had failed to discharge their obligations under\n\nthe subsidiary sub-contract and the demand made by SC Piling was utterly lacking in bona fides. In\n\nour judgment, SC Piling acted unconscionably in calling on the performance guarantee. On this point,\n\nwe find helpful the following part of the judgment of Selvam JC (as he then was) inKvaerner\n\nSingapore Pte Ltd v UDL Shipbuilding (Singapore) Pte Ltd[1993] 3 SLR 350at 354:a demand under the performance guarantee can be made only when the\n\n  seller has failed or refused to fulfil his obligations under the contract. The sellers\n\n  failure or refusal is a condition precedent to the buyer making a demand. An assertion to that\n\n  effect is implied in a demand made by the buyer. In circumstances where it can be said that the\n\n  buyer had no honest belief that the seller has failed or refused to perform its obligation, a\n\n  demand by the defendants/buyers in my view is a dishonest act which would justify a restraint\n\n  order. On the facts of the case a demand made by the buyer was utterly lacking in bona fides.",
        "Conclusion": "22.    In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the order\n\nbelow. We now make further orders as follows. After the interim injunction was discharged, ECICS\n\npaid the amount of S$500,000 under the performance guarantee to SC Piling, and in consequence,\n\nSamwoh in pursuance of their indemnity to ECICS were and are obliged to reimburse ECICS the amount\n\nthey had paid with interest, if any. We understand that Samwoh had substantially reimbursed them the\n\namount due. We think that the parties should, as far as practicable, be placed in the same position\n\nin which they were before the injunction was discharged. We therefore order that SC Piling repay the\n\namount of S$500,000 to ECICS forthwith and that ECICS upon receipt thereof repay the amount to\n\nSamwoh. This order does not prejudice ECICS in any way, as they only pass on to Samwoh the amount\n\nthey received from SC Piling. For avoidance of any doubt, we declare that this order is not to\n\naffect any right of indemnity ECICS may have against Samwoh in respect of the payment, which they\n\nhad made under the performance guarantee. We restore the injunction restraining SC Piling from\n\ncalling for any payment under the performance guarantee and receiving any payment thereunder and\n\nECICS from making any payment thereunder to SC Piling, until the trial of the action or until\n\nfurther order as may be made by the High Court.23.    Next, Samwoh contend that SC Piling should pay interest on\n\nthe amount of S$500,000 which the latter are now required to refund to ECICS. On the authority ofCredit\n\nAgricole Indosuez v Banque Nationale de Paris (No 2)[2001] 2 SLR 301, Samwoh are entitled to\n\ninterest. Instead of ordering SC Piling to pay the interest to ECICS and the latter upon receipt to\n\npay the same to Samwoh, we order that SC Piling pay to Samwoh interest on the amount of S$500,000 at\n\n4.5% per annum for the period from the date of payment of that amount to them by ECICS to the date\n\nof their repayment of the amount of S$500,000 to ECICS as herein ordered. The rate of 4.5% is\n\ncertainly not excessive. It is the prime lending rate of The Development of Singapore Ltd, which we\n\nunderstand is the lowest of the prime lending rates prescribed by the local banks in Singapore.",
        "Costs": "24.    We now come to the question of costs. SC Piling should pay\n\nthe costs of Samwoh here and below. We so order. The next question is whether Samwoh or SC Piling\n\nshould pay the costs of ECICS. We think that it is not wrong for Samwoh to join ECICS in these\n\nproceedings, as at the time when the application for the ex parte injunction was made, SC Piling had\n\nalready made the call on the performance guarantee. Samwoh were justified in joining ECICS as a\n\nparty so that the order they obtained would be binding directly on both SC Piling and ECICS.\n\nSimilarly, in this appeal, Samwoh were also justified in joining ECICS as a party, otherwise it\n\nwould be difficult to have an order along the line of the order made herein. That being so, we think\n\nthat the costs of ECICS here and below should be paid by SC Piling. We so order. We also make the\n\nconsequential order for the refund of the security deposit in court, with interest, if any, to\n\nSamwoh or their solicitors.Sgd:Sgd:L P THEANCHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
