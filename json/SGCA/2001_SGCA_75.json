        "Background": "6.    Before the mid-eighties, nearly all the fire-rated glass doors were\n\nimported, fully assembled from Europe. From the mid-eighties, Glaverbel licensed, inter alia, Flametech,\n\nto produce steel frames for fire-rated glass screens. After Loke joined Flametech in 1991, he made\n\nfurther improvements in the design of Glaverbels fire-rated doors and they are in the following\n\nrespects:-(a)Improving the frame:Under the Glaverbel design, the glass panel was\n\n  supported by calcium silicate boards screwed to the steel frame. However, they cracked slightly\n\n  when screws were applied through them, and might not be able to take the stress of normal usage of\n\n  a door, which swung frequently and was exposed to rain, mechanical impact and constant cleaning.\n\n  Moreover, the exposed calcium silicate boards were unsightly and needed to be covered. Loke\n\n  therefore added a steel-capping (or armour-capping) to the calcium silicate boards, which would\n\n  protect it from the elements and increase its resistance to fire. It was also stronger as the\n\n  weight of the glass was now borne by the steel capping as well as the steel core of the frame.(b)Connecting the door frame to the doorway frame using a hinge:The\n\n  main problem Loke faced was how to attach the door strap of the pivot hinge to the door frame. He\n\n  could not fix it onto the calcium silicate board which was too brittle to take the stress of\n\n  swinging action. He decided to attach the door strap to the steel core. He removed a portion of\n\n  the calcium silicate padding, and reinforced the link by placing steel plates on it so that the\n\n  pivot would not just slip out. As for the gap between the frame and the glass, he added\n\n  intumescent strips in such a manner that they would expand and fill the gaps when a fire occurred.\n\n  He then added door handles and lock sets, and extended the design to include a fixed screen to the\n\n  whole design so that the glass door could be part of a larger glass faade.7.    Based on the Flamelite works, Flametech proceeded to manufacture and sell\n\nsuch fire-rated glass doors and screens. In October 1992, Loke resigned from Flametech, though\n\nremaining its majority shareholder. He proceeded to set up Flamelite (S) Pte Ltd (Flamelite), the\n\nfirst plaintiff.8.    From January 1992 to May 1993, the first defendant (Lam) was engaged by\n\nFlametech, as a sub-contractor to fabricate and install the fire-rated glass door and from December\n\n1992 to June 1994, Lam was so engaged by Flamelite. For the purpose of enabling Lam to discharge his\n\ntask, shop drawings of the Flamelite works were furnished to Lam. The fourth defendant, Wu Kam Fai\n\n(Wu), was from November 1992 to mid 1994 employed by Flamelite and his main responsibility was to\n\nliaise with the various sub-contractors of Flamelite, including Lam. In June 1994, Flamelite\n\nterminated the engagement of Lam.9.    In August 1994, Lam and his wife, Sim Bee Hoon, the second defendant,\n\nincorporated a company, Swissflame Pte Ltd (Swissflame), the third defendant. The majority shares in\n\nSwissflame were held by Lam, who was also its controlling mind. It should be mentioned that the\n\nplaintiffs action against the second defendant was subsequently discontinued.10.    As stated before, the business of Swissflame was also in the manufacture\n\nand sale of similar fire rated glass doors and screens. The fourth defendant, Wu, was from September\n\n1995 employed by Swissflame as its Technical Services Manager, and his main duties were to market\n\nSwissflames fire-rated glass doors and screens.",
        "Present action": "11.    In the present action, the plaintiffs alleged that Lam, Swissflame and Wu\n\nhave infringed their copyright which subsists in the Glaverbal works and the Flamelite works when\n\nthe latter produced their Swissflame fire-rated doors and screens. The plaintiffs claim that the\n\nSwissflames framing system is substantially similar to or a near exact reproduction of the\n\nplaintiffs framing system.12.    Lam and Swissflame contended that while the general arrangement of the\n\ncomponents is similar, Swissflames framing system is not an exact reproduction nor is it a\n\nslavish copy of the plaintiffs framing systems in terms of material and dimensions. Moreover, the\n\ndrawings contained only non-proprietary principles or methods of creating such fire-rated doors and\n\nscreens, and that the methods had been in common use in the industry for some 20 years already,\n\nbeing largely dictated by functions. Vanderstukken admitted that Glaverbels design is elementary\n\nand set out a simple principle of construction.13.    As the preliminary sketches relating to the Glaverbel and the Flamelite\n\nworks were not produced, there was no way to know what was contained therein even though it is\n\nalleged by the plaintiffs that annexures A and B to the Statement of Claim are\n\nillustrative of what the preliminary sketches depicted. Furthermore, the defendants relied upon s 69\n\nof the Copyright Act and asserted that these products do not infringe any copyright of the\n\nplaintiffs as the products would not appear to persons, who are not experts in relation to such\n\ndoors, to be reproductions of the plaintiffs alleged artistic works.14.    It should be mentioned that in the court below Flamelite and Flametech had\n\nalso alleged that Lam and Wu had committed breaches of confidence. However, in this appeal, the\n\nclaim based on breaches of confidence is no longer pursued by the two plaintiffs.",
        "Agreed Facts": "15.    During the course of the trial the parties also agreed, inter alia, to the\n\nfollowing. The preliminary sketches of Vanderstukken, although no longer to be found, are\n\nnevertheless reflected in three University of Ghent Test Reports. Copyright in the preliminary\n\nsketches subsists in Singapore by virtue of the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations,\n\n1990 and 1996 and the copyright to the same vested in Glaverbel, as the employer of Vanderstukken.16.    The preliminary sketches of Glaverbel were not seen by Loke or the\n\ndefendants. What Loke did in 1991, while in the employment of Flametech, was to use the Glaverbels\n\nUniversity of Ghest Test Reports (Nos. 5592, 6223 and 5673) as precedents, made changes and created\n\npreliminary drawings of framework for a fire-rated glass and fixed screens. Loke, in turn, engaged a\n\nfree-lance draughtsman to reproduce the preliminary drawings into shop drawings. The preliminary\n\ndrawings of Loke were never seen by the defendants and could no longer be found, having been\n\ndestroyed or thrown away. The copyright in the preliminary drawings originally vested in Flametech.\n\nIn April 1994, Loke acquired Flametech and Flametech in turn assigned its copyright in the\n\npreliminary drawings (the Flamelite works) to Flamelite.17.    While Lam was engaged by the plaintiffs he was given the shop drawings of\n\nthe plaintiffs framework. Wu also had access to the plaintiffs shop drawings while he was\n\nemployed by Flamelite. There is, however, a dispute as to whether Loke told Wu that the shop\n\ndrawings were proprietary and confidential. Since joining Swissflame, Wu had quoted and sold\n\nSwissflames fire-rated glass doors to various customers.",
        "Decision below": "18.    In relation to Glaverbel works, the judge below found that they consisted\n\nreally of only ideas. He also found that Glaverbal, having consented to the use of their drawings by\n\nFlametech, was thus not entitled to mount their claim against the defendants because it would create\n\n\"unwitting duplication and double-counting.\"19.    In any case the judge found that there was no infringement of the\n\nplaintiffs works because(i) The works related to a method of construction of a functional article. The\n\n  works could not be proprietary and the court would not allow a claimant to establish a monopoly\n\n  through a claim in copyright.(ii) The court accepted Lams explanation that in the course of his\n\n  employment with Flamelite and Flametech, he had not seen any of the plaintiffs preliminary\n\n  drawings but he had seen only some \"rough hand drawn sketches\" of Wu.(iii) There was no substantial similarity between the Swissflame products and\n\n  the plaintiffs works. The judge noted that besides differences as to materials and dimensions\n\n  there were other differences in features between the plaintiffs works and the defendants\n\n  product.",
        "Issues": "20.    There are basically only two issues before us. The first is whether there\n\nhad been any infringement of the copyright works as the defendants did not exactly reproduce the\n\nplaintiffs drawings. The second is whether the defence in s 69 is available to the defendants in\n\nthe circumstances of this case.",
        "Locus of Glaverbel": "21.    Before we proceed to examine the two issues there is a need for us to\n\nbriefly touch on two ancillary questions. The first is whether Glaverbel is entitled to bring the\n\npresent claim. The judge seemed to hold that, in view of Glaverbel having consented to Flametech and\n\nFlamelite using its design, Glaverbel has, as a result, lost its right to sue for infringement. We\n\ndo not think that view is correct. The fact that Glaverbel has consented or licenced another to use\n\nthe design does not mean that Glaverbel has ceased to be the copyright owner of the design. Such a\n\nlicence cannot abrogate the rights of the copyright owner. Section 31(1) of the Copyright Act\n\nexpressly permits the copyright owner to grant licences to third parties. Granting of a licence to a\n\nparty does not mean granting a licence to the world at large. It would have been different if\n\nGlaverbel had assigned its rights to Flametech/Flamelite.22.    Turning next to the second ancillary question, the trial judge found that\n\nthe Glaverbel works and the Flamelite works involved an elementary or simple principle of\n\nconstruction. While he thought they were mere ideas, he did not go on to expressly say that the\n\nworks are thereby incapable of acquiring copyright. We would reiterate that to obtain copyright it\n\nis not necessary that the ideas or thoughts should be original or complex. Copyright protects the\n\nexpression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Mere simplicity does not mean that copyright is\n\nprecluded. We are reminded of what Megarry J stated in the following passage inBritish Northrop\n\nLtd v Texteam Blackburn Ltd[1974] RPC 57 (at p. 68):-It may indeed be that some thing may be drawn which cannot fairly be called a diagram or a\n\n  drawing of any kind: a single straight line drawn with the aid of a ruler would not seem to me to\n\n  be a very promising subject for copyright. But apart from cases of such barren and naked\n\n  simplicity as that, I should be slow to exclude drawings from copyright on the mere score of\n\n  simplicity. I do not think that the mere fact that a drawing is of an elementary and commonplace\n\n  article makes it too simple to be the subject of copyright.\"Infringement23.    The primary concern of copyright is with the form in which an idea is\n\nexpressed. The requirement of originality in copyright law relates solely to the form in which the\n\nwork is expressed:University of London Press Ltd v Barclays Finance Ltd[1994] FSR 275. To\n\ndetermine the issue of infringement, it is essential to bear in mind that in the Statement of Agreed\n\nFacts the parties agreed that \"Swissflames framing system is not an exact reproduction nor a\n\nslavish copy of the plaintiffs framing system in terms of materials and dimensions\". This is\n\nfurther confirmed by a chart which the defendants submitted at the trial, where the Flamelite and\n\nGlaverbel works were compared with Swissflames products, and which highlighted that differences\n\nexisted in relation to materials and dimensions.24.    The plaintiffs pointed out that the defendants expert witnesses\n\nacknowledged that there could be a variety of ways in which the fire-rated glass doors and screens\n\ncould be designed. Although these experts maintained that the Flamelite and Glaverbel works\n\ncomprised a common method of construction, they admitted that this was said from an engineering or\n\ntechnical point of view. Interestingly, the defendants had adduced evidence of a variety of designs\n\nadopted by other manufacturers. So the plaintiffs contended that it is not true that functional\n\nreasons would require that the design of such doors/screens would all be the same. The plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted that there is much room for creativity within the common method of construction. The\n\ndifferences in materials, dimensions and features mentioned by the judge were trivial and do not\n\nrender the infringement any less so.25.    The plaintiffs also emphasised the fact that the defendants had not really\n\nexplained how they arrived at the designs for their fire-rated glass doors and screens which are so\n\nclose to theirs. This, coupled with the fact that Lam and Wu had access to the shop drawings of the\n\nFlamelite and Flametech products, strongly suggests that the defendants must have simply copied the\n\nplaintiffs works.26.    Under s 26(b)(i) of the Copyright Act, copyright confers upon the owner the\n\nexclusive rights to, inter alia, reproduce an artistic work in any material form. An artistic work\n\nin a two-dimensional form is deemed to be reproduced if a version of the work is produced in a three\n\ndimensional form [s 15(3)(a)]. Under s 10(1), infringement is established as long as a substantial\n\npart of the work is reproduced.27.    To succeed in copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove that copying\n\nhas taken place. Such proof can come in the form of establishing similarity combined with proof of\n\naccess to the plaintiffs works.28.    We will first deal with the question of access as it can be disposed of\n\nshortly. As Park J said inA Fulton Co Ltd v Grant Barnett & Co Ltd[2001] RPC 257 at\n\n284:-It is rare that in intellectual property cases for there to be direct copying\n\n  of someones else copyrights or designs. Plagiarists do their copying in secret. The courts\n\n  proceed on the basis that a close similarity between the claimants design and the alleged\n\n  infringing article, coupled with the opportunity for the alleged copier to have access to the\n\n  claimants design or work, raises an inference of copying. It is then up to the defendant to\n\n  rebut the inference by evidence which shows that the apparent similarity arose in some other way.\n\n  InIbcos Computers Ltd v Barclay Finance Ltd[1994] FSR 275 at page 297, Jacob J, said that\n\n  \"the concept of sufficient similarities shifting the onus to the defendant to prove\n\n  non-copying is well recognised in copyright law.\" He added that he thought that the\n\n  proposition \"is not so much one of law as of plain rational thought.\"29.    In this case it is not in dispute that Lam had access to the shop drawings,\n\nincorporating the Flamelite and Glaverbel works. He was then a sub-contractor fabricating the\n\nfire-rated glass doors and screens for Flametech and Flamelite. Wu also had access to the shop\n\ndrawings of Flamelite. This is set out in 16 of the Statement of Agreed Facts. At all material\n\ntimes, Wu knew or was familiar with the framing system used in relation to Flamelites fire rated\n\nglass doors and screens.30.    In this connection we ought to mention that the trial judge seemed to have\n\naccepted Lams evidence in chief that he received instructions through some \"rough hand\n\nwritten sketches\" and seemed to think that Lam did not have access to the shop drawings. But in\n\ncross-examination Lam admitted that he was shown shop drawings of the plaintiffs. More importantly,\n\nin 15 of the Statement of Agreed Facts it is stated that \"in the course of his engagement as\n\na sub-contractor, Lam was given shop drawings of the plaintiffs frames.\" Thus, the judges\n\nfinding on this is not correct.31.    It is not necessary that the copying should be consciously done.\n\nSubconscious copying is just as infringing as is apparent from the following passage fromCopinger\n\n& Skone James on Copyright (14thEdn) Vol 1, p.402.\"As already pointed out, since copyright is a proprietary right, ignorance\n\n  is no defence to an infringement claim. If, therefore, the plaintiffs work has been copied from\n\n  the plaintiffs, either directly or indirectly, the fact that the defendant was unaware that the\n\n  work he was copying in this way existed, or was the plaintiffs or was the subject of copyright,\n\n  or whether he thought he had a licence, provides no defence to a claim for primary infringement\n\n  although in limited circumstances, it may affect the remedy..\"",
        "Similarity": "32.    We now turn to consider the question whether there is substantial\n\nsimilarity between the Swissflame products and the two copyright works. In the Statement of Agreed\n\nFacts the parties have set out their positions on the point as follows:-\"The Plaintiffs claim that Swissflames framing system is substantially\n\n  similar to or a near exact reproduction of the Plaintiffs framing system. Whilst the Defendants\n\n  admit that the general arrangement of components is similar, Swissflames framing system is not\n\n  an exact reproduction nor a slavish copy of the Plaintiffs framing system in terms of materials\n\n  and dimensions. Further, the Defendants say that the frame design is a non-proprietary method of\n\n  construction and is largely dictated by function.33.    The trial judge, having examined the comparison chart tendered to court by\n\nthe defendants, came to the conclusion that:-\"In my view besides the differences as to dimensions, not all the features\n\n  which appear in the plaintiffs product can be found in the defendants design. Besides,\n\n  looking at the products from the standpoint of details, I am also in agreement with defendants\n\n  counsel that the design alluded to by the plaintiffs has been demonstrably elementary and this\n\n  aspect, insofar as the fourth plaintiffs designs are concerned, it had been conceded, albeit\n\n  rather gingerly, by Vanderstukken (page 179 of the NE) that they were elementary. The addition of\n\n  the much-talked about armour cladding by Loke too does not take their case any further as it is\n\n  not claimed that that feature forms part of the infringement. In my determination, annexures A and\n\n  B illustrate nothing but a non-proprietary principle or method of constructing the fire-rated\n\n  glass doors and structural frames. I agree in this regard with the testimonial assertions by the\n\n  defendants, that the method referred to involves the commonplace mounting of fire-resistant glass\n\n  on a hollow steel section between fireproof calcium silicate boards. The steel section and calcium\n\n  silicate boards are then joined to form a structural frame. The gap between the fire resistant\n\n  glass and the calcium silicate board is filled using fireproof materials. I must further mention\n\n  that I accept as valid the opinion of Associate Professor Chew that the framing system alluded to\n\n  illustrate the simplest and most fundamental method of constructing a fire-rated glass door from\n\n  an engineering point of view. I also accept as valid, Mr Kettles view that technically similar\n\n  basic designs have been in existence for sometime and have been previously tested by others in\n\n  conjunction with other proprietary types of insulating glass. One other observation which requires\n\n  inclusion here is that any likeness or close resemblance between the plaintiffs and the\n\n  defendants drawings is mainly owing to the function and functionality of the method which I\n\n  accept as elementary.\"34.    Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that copyright protects against\n\ncopying and that the judge did not identify the features of the plaintiffs works which were\n\ncopied; neither did he rule that what the defendants had copied did not constitute a substantial\n\npart of the plaintiffs works. The chart produced by the defendants set out the differences\n\nbetween the Glaverbel works and the Flamelite works on the one hand and Swissflame works on the\n\nother and those differences are quite insignificant.35.    It is expressly provided in the Act that to constitute infringement what is\n\ncopied must be a substantial part of the artistic work. What would constitute substantial part was\n\nstated rather eloquently by Buckley LJ inCatnic Components Ltd & Anor v Hill & Smith Ltd[1979] FSR 609 at 223 as follows:-\"I do not question the principle that in deciding whether what has been\n\n  reproduced by an alleged infringer is a substantial part of the work allegedly infringed, one must\n\n  regard the quality (that is to say the importance) rather than the quantity of the part reproduced\n\n  (seeLadbroke [Football] Ltd v William Hill [Football] Ltd[1964] 1 WLR 273, per Lord Reid\n\n  at p 276 and per Lord Pearce at p 293); but what is protected is the plaintiffs \"artistic\n\n  work\" as such, not any information which it may be designed to convey. If it is said that a\n\n  substantial part of it has been reproduced, whether that part can properly be described as\n\n  substantial may depend upon how important that part is to the recognition and appreciation of the\n\n  artistic work. If an artistic work is designed to convey information, the importance\n\n  of some part of it may fall to be judged by how far it contributes to conveying that information,\n\n  but not, in my opinion, by how important the information may be which it conveys or helps to\n\n  convey. What is protected is the skill and labour devoted to making the artistic work\n\n  itself, not the skill and labour devoted to developing some ideas or invention communicated or\n\n  depicted by the artistic work. The protection afforded by copyright is not, in my judgment,\n\n  any broader, as counsel submitted, where the artistic work embodies a novel or inventive\n\n  idea than it is where it represents a commonplace object or theme.\"36.    InLadbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd[1964] 1 WLR 273, which was a case concerning literary work, Lord Evershed explained (at 283) the concept of\n\nsubstantial reproduction as follows:-\".. what amounts in any case to substantial reproduction  cannot be\n\n  defined in precise terms but must be a matter of fact and degree. It will, therefore, depend not\n\n  merely on the physical amount of the reproduction but on the substantial significance of that\n\n  which is taken.\"37.    Lord Pearce, in the same case, also amplified the concept of substantial\n\nreproduction in these terms:-\"Whether a part is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than\n\n  its quantity. The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality would not normally be\n\n  regarded as a substantial part of the copyright work and therefore will not be protected. For that\n\n  which will not attract copyright except by virtue of its collocation will when robbed of that\n\n  collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its\n\n  reproduction to be an infringement.\"38.    This view was adopted by Plowman J inWarwick Film Productions Ltd v\n\nEisinger[1969] 1 Ch 508, a case where the plaintiff claimed that copyright in a book entitled\n\n\"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\" had been infringed by a film script. However, the book in\n\nquestion was in turn largely copied from an earlier publication. With respect to these copied\n\nportions, Plowman J said:-\" it had no originality and attracted copyright, as part of the whole\n\n  book, only by reason of its collocation. When robbed of that collocation it does not, in my\n\n  judgment, represent a substantial part of the copyright and so does not involve an infringement of\n\n  it.\"39.    A similar point also arose in the Australian Federal Court case ofA-One\n\nAccessory Imorts Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd(1996) 34 IPR 306, where Drummond J said (at\n\n330):-\"Where an original work comprises non-original material, whether pirated\n\n  or not, and new material, the non-original material in the work attracts copyright protection only\n\n  because of its collocation with the new material, so that, if the only part of such a composite\n\n  work which is copied is the non-original component, once that is robbed of its collocation with\n\n  the new material, it cannot be regarded as forming a substantial part of the entire work in which\n\n  copyright subsists.\"40.    Of course, the existence of dissimilarities does not necessarily mean that\n\nthere is no infringement or that they destroy the notion of copying: seeBaazley Homes Ltd v\n\nArrowsmith[1978] 1 NZLR 394. The question in each instance is whether the defendant has\n\nincorporated into their plans and products, a substantial proportion of the plaintiffs plans. To\n\nanswer this question, the whole of the work must be considered and in this exercise the originality\n\nand simplicity of the plan and its functional object must be borne in mind. All said, past cases are\n\nonly illustrative of judicial approach in the light of the prevailing facts.41.    First, we will refer to an Australian High Court case relied upon by the\n\nplaintiffs:Hart v Edward Hot Water Systems[1985] 61 ALR 251. The case concerned the\n\ninfringement of drawings relating to a solar energy hot water system. There Gibbs CJ said (at p.\n\n255):-\"Particular reliance was placed  in argument before us by counsel for\n\n  the respondent on the differences in the dimensions of certain parts manufactured by the\n\n  respondent and the dimensions of corresponding parts shown on the drawings, but I agree with\n\n  Franki J that it does not follow that the relevant similarity does not exist merely because the\n\n  dimensions of a part shown in a drawing and those of the corresponding three-dimensional part\n\n  differ somewhat. Minor differences of that kind may be deliberately made for the very purpose of\n\n  disguising the fact that copying has occurred. It is true that there were a good many differences\n\n  in detail between the respondents products and the appellants drawings, although they seem\n\n  to me to be comparatively minor.The question is not whether there are dissimilarities but whether the\n\n  respondents products closely resembled the appellants drawings or a substantial part of\n\n  them.\"42.    A case very much on point isDixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall & Anor(1990) 18 IPR 481, which concerned an alleged infringement of copyright in the design for a\n\nsimple-storey residential house. Pincus J delivering the judgment of the Federal Court of Australia\n\nexplained why there was no infringement in this manner:-\"The applicant is entitled to succeed if it can show that the house is a\n\n  reproduction of the basic plan or of a substantial part of it. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the\n\n  basic plan said to have been infringed creates a difficulty for the applicant. The simpler and\n\n  more commonplace the copyright drawing, the more closely must the alleged infringer adhere to it,\n\n  in order for liability to exist:Kenrick and Co v Lawrence and Co(1890) 25 QBD 99 at 102;Ownit\n\n  Homes Pty Ltd v D&F Mancuso Investments Pty Ltd(1988) AIPC 90-488 at 38,243  There\n\n  are, of course, many houses of about the same size as those in issue here, and with similar\n\n  facilities  If one adheres to the idea of having a roughly rectangular shape with all the rooms\n\n  all on one level, there is only a limited number of ways in which the rooms can sensibly be\n\n  arranged.\"43.    InCatnic Components Ltd & Anor v Hill & Smith Ltd (supra)the\n\nquestion was whether certain steel lintels manufactured by the defendants were copies of drawings of\n\nthe plaintiffs and infringed the copyright in those drawings. The court found that the dimensional\n\nsimilarities between the defendants lintel and the plaintiffs drawings were due to the\n\nfunctions which the lintels were designed to perform and the normal dimensions of materials used in\n\nthe building of walls.44.    InKenrick & Co v Lawrence & Co(1890) 25 QBD the copyright\n\non which infringement was alleged was a simple drawing of a hand holding a pencil. The defendants\n\ndrawing showed the hand to be in a different position. This slight change was held to be sufficient\n\nto prevent an infringement from arising.45.    Another highly illustrative case isPolitechnikas Ipari Szovelkezer v\n\nDallas Print Transfers Ltd[1982] FSR 529 which concerned, inter alia, infringements of the\n\nrights in the design for the container of the \"Rubik Cubes\" puzzle. The defendants\n\ncontainer was largely similar in that it was also cylindrical in shape, had a square indentation at\n\nthe top of the plastic lid and a recess in the base to take the corners of the cube. There were only\n\nsome differences in the square indentations and recesses. Dillon J held that copyright was not\n\ninfringed and said, at 542:-\"Another way of putting this point is that the drawings of the cover and\n\n  base are very rudimentary, and where very rudimentary drawings are concerned there would be an\n\n  infringement of copyright only if there were almost an exact reproduction of the drawings.\"46.    Ultimately, the question of what is substantial is very much a question of\n\nfact and degree on which difficult decisions would have to be made. Reverting to the instant case,\n\nnot only is there little originality in the copyright works, they are in fact simple and obvious,\n\nbearing in mind the functional object to which they relate. It is not in question that the\n\nSwissflame products do not copy exactly the copyright drawings. The material used is different; so\n\nare some dimensions. On first impression, one may think that these variations are trivial and\n\ninsignificant. But they are not so, if we bear in mind the object the product is intended to serve.\n\nHere, we are reminded of what Loke said. In working out the modifications to be made to the\n\nGlaverbel works, Loke laid stress on the importance of the type of material used as well as the\n\nthickness and depth of such material in order that the end product would be strong and would\n\neffectively serve the intended purpose of the product. Thus, the variations in dimensions which\n\nSwissflame introduced into their products cannot really be considered as inconsequential or merely\n\ncosmetic.47.    Here, we note that the trial judge accepted the expert opinion of Associate\n\nProfessor Chew Chye Heng that the framing system of the plaintiffs was the \"simplest and most\n\nfundamental method of constructing a fire-rated glass door from an engineering point of view.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to diminish the significance of this piece of evidence by highlighting the\n\nfact that Assoc Prof Chew was looking at it from the engineering point of view. We are unable to see\n\nhow that contention can be made. We would have thought this evidence underscores the defendants\n\nargument that the framing system of the plaintiffs is so basic that what was copied was not so much\n\nthe expression but the idea. Where the work is simple, the idea embodied in the work becomes so\n\nclosely identified with its expression that it is hard to separate the form of expression from the\n\nidea. In such a case there should be a much closer degree of copying before infringement can occur.48.    On balance, we are not persuaded that the trial judge was wrong to have\n\ncome to the view that there was no substantial reproduction and thus no infringement. We are\n\ninclined to agree with the trial judge that the general shape and layout of the Swissflame products\n\nare dictated very much by functional requirements. In coming to this view, we have examined the two\n\nmodels of the plaintiffs product which were produced to the court below.",
        "Section 69 defence": "49.    In the light of our decision above, the question whether the defence under\n\ns 69 is available will be quite academic. However, we think it is necessary for us to clarify\n\ncertain views expressed by the trial judge.50.    Section 69, which is inpari materiawith s 9(8) of the English\n\nCopyright Act of 1956, provides that \"the making of an object of any kind that is in 3\n\ndimensions does not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in two dimensions if the\n\nobject would not appear to persons who are not experts in relation to objects of that kind to be a\n\nreproduction of the artistic work.\"51.    The trial judge, in determining whether this defence was made out, took the\n\napproach advanced by the defendants of merely comparing the external view of the product with the\n\ncopyright works. The defendants contended that the profiles and cross-sections of the defendants\n\nframes would be concealed once the fire doors and screens are fabricated and installed. A non-expert\n\nlooking at the Swissflame products could not see the cross-section and hence would not be able to\n\ntell that the Swissflame products were copied from the plaintiffs copyright drawings. On this\n\nbasis, the judge ruled that the non-expert defence was made out as the notional non-expert would not\n\nbe able to conclude that there had been copying from the copyright works.52.    The plaintiffs, relying uponSolar Thompson Engineering Co Ltd &\n\nAnor v Barton[1977] RPC 537, submit that the approach taken by the trial judge is wrong. There,\n\nLord Justice Buckley LJ said (at p.559):-\"If the notional unskilled observer postulated by section 9(8) should be\n\n  treated as having a complete re-treaded cheek piece in his hand, it would, I think, be at least\n\n  arguable that it would not appear to him that the rubber ring was necessarily a three-dimensional\n\n  reproduction of the sectional drawing, for he would be unable to see what the contours of the\n\n  rubber ring were on that side of it nearest to the steel ring; nor would he be able to see the\n\n  contours of the hidden surfaces of the steel ring; nor could he be certain whether the surface of\n\n  the rubber ring and the steel ring were actually in contact over the whole of that area.It seems to me, however, that, the drawing being a sectional drawing, the\n\n  notional unskilled observer should be treated as having a sectioned cheek piece in his hand for\n\n  the purposes of section 9(8).\"53.    We agree with Buckley LJ. To hold otherwise would mean that s 69 affords a\n\nblanket defence to all to copy, so long as what has been copied cannot be seen from the external\n\nappearance of the product. However, this is not to say that the trial judge (as the notional\n\nnon-expert) should repeat the process which he has gone through, with the assistance of experts and\n\nother witnesses, in deciding whether there has been copying or not.54.    For section 69, the comparison is to be visual only though the judge, in\n\nperforming the task, must be entitled to compare the object with the drawings and must also be\n\ncredited with some ability to interpret design drawings: seeLB (Plastics) Ltd v Swish Products\n\nLtd[1979] FSR 145. We also respectfully concur with the views expressed by Gibbs CJ inSW\n\nHart & Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems[1985] 61 ALR 251 that the term \"persons\n\nwho are not experts in relation to objects of that kind\" meant persons of reasonable\n\nintelligence with sufficient ability to interpret drawings to enable them to perform their notional\n\nfunction intelligently. Therefore, while a trial judge may do a cross-sectional comparison visually,\n\nhe is not to undertake a detailed dissection of the product.",
