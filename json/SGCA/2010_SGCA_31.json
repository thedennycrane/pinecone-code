        "Introduction": "1       Progen Holdings Ltd (“the\n                    respondent”), a company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, is the\n                    sole shareholder and holding company of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd\n                    (“PEPL”). A winding-up application was filed against PEPL on\n                    22 January 2007 by a creditor, Chua Aik Kia trading as Uni-Sanitary\n                    Electrical Construction (“Uni-Sanitary”). As a result, an order to\n                    wind up PEPL was made on 16 February 2007. Chee Yoh Chuang and Lim Lee Meng\n                    were then appointed as liquidators of PEPL (“the\n                    liquidators”). 2       On 6 November 2008, the liquidators made an\n                    application to court to order the respondent to repay substantial amounts of\n                    monies paid by PEPL to it. These monies were alleged to be unfair preferences\n                    under s 99(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed)\n                    (‘the Bankruptcy Act’) read with s 329(1) of the Companies Act\n                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (‘the Companies Act’). A High Court\n                    judge (“the Judge”) dismissed this application and the liquidators\n                    now appeal against this decision. 3       This appeal raises interesting issues about how\n                    the law ought to balance the rights of creditors with the company\n                    directors’ desire to keep a company afloat when the company has financial\n                    difficulties. Difficulties often arise when an insolvent company seeks to make\n                    payments to certain creditors at the expense of others. Ordinarily, commercially\n                    sensible transactions made with the objective of creating or extending a\n                    lifeline to a company suffering financial difficulty should not be questioned. A\n                    court ought not to be too astute in taking directors to task when they appear to\n                    have been attempting in good faith to facilitate the preservation or\n                    rehabilitation of a company, and where they had reasonable commercial grounds\n                    for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. With that said, we\n                    must caution that where it appears thatrelated\n                        partieshave benefitted from priority payments, the law would\n                    usually view these transactions with a good measure of scepticism. This is\n                    particularly so if the interests of unrelated creditors, with claims standing on\n                    the same footing, are left in the cold. In respect of these kinds of\n                    transactions, the burden of proof would be placed on the related party for it to\n                    show that there had been no undue preference. Having sketched these broad\n                    parameters bounding the law on undue preferences, we now set out the salient\n                    facts before analysing the Judge’s grounds and giving our\n                decision.",
        "Factual Background": "4       The Progen Group (“the Group”)\n                    comprises the respondent and a stable of ten subsidiaries, including PEPL and\n                    Progen Pte Ltd (“PPL”). The Group is in the business of supplying,\n                    installing, trading, maintaining and servicing air-conditioning and ventilation\n                    systems. Mr Lee Ee @ Lee Eng (“Lee Ee”) is the chairman and\n                    founder of the Group[note: 1], and is the managing director of the\n                    respondent. In addition, Lee Ee and his wife, Koh Moi Huang,\n                    (“Koh”) together owned the largest block of shares in the\n                        respondent[note: 2]amounting to\n                    29.24% of the issued shares during the material period[note: 3]. Lee Ee and\n                        Koh[note: 4]were, it ought to be noted,\n                    directors of PEPL at the material time. It also bears mention that there were\n                    three common directors of PEPL and the respondent at the relevant time, namely,\n                    Lee Ee, Tan Eng Liang and Ch’ng Jit Koon. Undoubtedly, Lee Ee is the key\n                    figure in the Group. Besides his family’s substantial shareholdings in the\n                    respondent, it is noteworthy that he was the only director of either company to\n                    affirm affidavits in these proceedings and in an earlier application for court\n                    sanction for the capital reduction of the respondent see below at[16]. 5       In all, after the liquidators completed their\n                    investigations into PEPL’s affairs, it was alleged that ten transactions\n                    between PEPL and the respondent were unfair preferences. These transactions can\n                    be summarised (in chronological order) as follows: DateAmount(S$)Type of Transaction1st\n                                    Transaction31.01.200592,994.50Salaries,\n                                    etc2nd\n                                    Transaction21.02.200550,000.00Purchases of iron\n                                        ore3rd\n                                    Transaction04.02.200510,987,960.85Capital distribution and\n                                            Special Dividend to Respondent’s\n                                            shareholders4th\n                                    Transaction28.02.200557,837.00Salaries,\n                                    etc5th\n                                    Transaction04.03.200555,000.00Purchases of iron\n                                        ore6th\n                                    Transaction31.03.200548,956.75Salaries,\n                                    etc7th\n                                    Transaction30.04.200548,607.00Salaries,\n                                    etc8th\n                                    Transaction31.05.200548,617.62Salaries,\n                                    etc9th\n                                    Transaction30.06.200550,131.29Salaries,\n                                    etc10th\n                                        Transaction30.06.20057,538,243.15Set-offTotal\n                                                amount transacted-18,978,348.16-   6       The 3rd transaction involved the largest sum and\n                    obviously requires the greatest scrutiny. This particular transaction also gives\n                    an acute insight as to how the common directors typically handled inter-company\n                    transactions. We will therefore examine the 3rd transaction before the other\n                    transactions (“the other transactions”). In addition to the ten\n                    transactions above, PEPL made several payments amounting to $3,528,040 to otherrelatedcompanies within the Group between\n                    23 February 2005 and 22 January 2007.[note: 5]These, however, are not being\n                    questioned in these proceedings.",
        "The 3rd transaction": "7       The 3rd transaction involved the transfer of\n                    $10,987,960.85 from PEPL to the respondent on 4 February 2005. The\n                    respondent maintains in this appeal that the 3rd transaction involved the\n                    repayment of an ordinary loan given by the respondent to PEPL. It asserts that\n                    these monies came from the sale of a property at 12 Woodlands Loop\n                    (”Progen Building”) on 29 July 2004 for a sum of\n                        $24.9m.[note: 6]Progen Building, however,\n                    was consistently reported as a fixed asset in PPL’s audited financial\n                    statements for the financial years.[note: 7]There is absolutely no\n                    documentary evidence of Progen Building ever being declared as an asset of the\n                    respondent. Despite this dearth of evidence, the respondent adamantly maintained\n                    during the trial proceedings that Progen Building was always held on trust by\n                    PPL for it, and the subsequent sale proceeds were trust monies belonging to it.\n                    This untenable contention, however, was not canvassed on appeal. 8       The sale proceeds of the Progen Building were\n                    eventually placed in PPL’s fixed deposit account with United Overseas Bank\n                    Limited (“UOB”) on a monthly basis until 4 December 2004.\n                    Before each renewal, PPL withdrew a small part of the funds. The aggregate sum\n                    in the account on final maturity was $23,342,695.12.[note: 8]Immediately after\n                    maturity, a sum of $19m was transferred from PPL’s UOB fixed deposit\n                    account to PEPL’s fixed deposit account with Malayan Banking Berhad\n                    (”MBB”) for two months.[note: 9]Initially, to persuade the\n                    Judge that the respondent had no intention of making a loan to PEPL, the\n                    respondent claimed that this transfer was merely an interim commercial decision\n                    to secure higher interest returns. However, we note that no satisfactory\n                    evidence to substantiate this was ever adduced. 9       The Group had at this point of time two\n                    available internal sources of funds: (a)     a sum of $19m from the sale proceeds\n                        of Progen Building kept in PPL’s UOB fixed deposit account;\n                    and (b)     a sum of\n                        $300,000 from the sale of the respondent’s shares in Wee Poh\n                            Holdings.[note: 10] 10     From this, $19.3m wastransferred to PEPLby way of two cheques on 4 December\n                    2004: (a)a cheque drawn by PPL from its UOB account for\n                            $19m; and(b)a cheque drawn by the respondent from its UOB\n                            account for $300,000.11     The purported reasons for the transfer of this\n                    sum of $19.3m (captured in two contemporaneous debit notes dated\n                    31 December 2004 and issued by PEPL) were briefly recorded as\n                    follows:(a)     a sum of $300,000 recorded as a\n                        “transfer of funds to PEPL MBB fixed deposit account” and a\n                        sum of $15,750,000 recorded as an “advancefrom [the respondent] to\n                            PEPL”, both were recorded on the same Debit Note:\n                        PHL/DN/167[note: 11][emphasis in bold italics\n                        added]; and(b)     a\n                        sum of $3.25m that was recorded as an advance by PPL to PEPL in Debit Note\n                            PPL/DN/863.[note: 12](This sum was in fact a\n                        repayment by PPL to PEPL of monies previously advanced to PPL. This is not\n                        the subject of the present appeal.)12     Having briefly set out the genesis of the\n                    “loan” given by the respondent to PEPL, we now examine the reasons\n                    given by the respondent to justify the 3rd transaction, that is, the repayment\n                    of the “loan”.Alleged commercial reasons for the 3rd transaction13     The respondent claims that the transaction was\n                    motivated by proper commercial considerations. Specifically, the transfer of\n                    $10,987,960.85 from PEPL to the respondent on 4 February 2005 was meant to\n                    pay for the respondent’s Capital Distribution and Special Dividend payout.\n                    In support of this, the respondent referred to an earlier SGX MASNET\n                    announcement dated 26 August 2004 where it had stated that there would be a\n                    special dividend payment of $4m and capital distribution of $11m to the\n                    respondent’s shareholders.[note: 13]Shareholders’ approval for this was obtained on 24 November 2004 at\n                    an Extraordinary General Meeting and Court approval was obtained on\n                    10 January 2005.14     However, in justifying the payment of the\n                    Capital Distribution and Special Dividend, the respondent has inadvertently\n                    drawn attention to several discrepancies in the processes it employed to secure\n                    sanction from the court. It appears from the relevant court minutes and\n                    affidavits on record that the respondent did not inform the Court about\n                    PEPL’s dire financial position (PEPL’s Balance sheet as at\n                    31 December 2004 showed that it was insolvent). On the contrary, the\n                    respondent apparently misstated the position to the Court by not fully\n                    disclosing the material facts below.15     On 26 November 2004, Winter Engineering\n                    (S) Pte Ltd (“Winter Engineering”) obtained an award against PEPL\n                    in the sum of $3.6m inclusive of costs (“the arbitration award”).\n                    This award adversely affected PEPL’s financial position by adding to its\n                    ever increasing pile of unsatisfied debts. In addition to Winter\n                    Engineering’s arbitration award, PEPL then already had a significant\n                    pre-existing inter-company debt owing to the respondent; PEPL’s General\n                    Transactions Listing dated 30 November 2004 stated that PEPL owed a sum of\n                    $2,787,999.95 to the respondent.[note: 14]As\n                    mentioned above, on 4 December 2004, $19m was transferred from PPL’s\n                    fixed deposit account to PEPL’s MBB bank account. However, none of these\n                    monies were used to settle the debt due to Winter Engineering. Instead, it\n                    appears that PEPL ignored this debt and subsequently attempted to reopen the\n                    arbitration award in an attempt to delay payment. On 6 April 2005, PEPL\n                    unsuccessfully applied for leave to appeal against this arbitration award. A\n                    High Court Judge, in dismissing PEPL’s application for leave to appeal\n                    against the arbitration award, observed that PEPL was improperly attempting to\n                    evade its legal obligations (see Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v\n                        Winter Engineering (S) Pte Ltd[2006] SGHC 224 at\n                    [17]):It is evident that the plaintiff was quite content not to prosecute this\n                        matter diligently as it had incurred a liability to pay a substantial sum to\n                        the defendant pursuant to the First Award.In its attempt\n                            to challenge the First Award it sought to raise several unmeritorious\n                            issues,ie, the remaining\n                        issues. I can only infer from the plaintiff’s conduct that it has,\n                        since the issuance of the Second Award,employed every\n                            legal strategy available either by omission and/or commission to deprive\n                            the defendant of the fruits of litigation. This should no longer be\n                            tolerated or permitted. [emphasis added]16     On 30 November 2004, merely four days\n                    after the arbitration award had been made against PEPL, Lee Ee applied on behalf\n                    of the respondent for court approval of the Capital Distribution and Special\n                    Dividend payment. Regrettably, the existence of the arbitration award was not\n                    drawn to the Court’s attention in Lee Ee’s supporting affidavit.\n                    Instead, Lee Ee made several unqualified assertions about the Group’s\n                    strong financial position, For instance, in para 24 of his\n                        affidavit[note: 15]:These aforesaid audited accounts show that the [respondent] and the Group\n                        are in sound financial health.17     It cannot be disputed by the respondent that\n                    this reference to the Group embraced PEPL since it was expressly referred to as\n                    one of Progen Holdings’ subsidiaries in the affidavit. This representation\n                    was clearly not correct. As will be shown below, PEPL’s balance sheet as\n                    at 31 December 2004 clearly showed that it not just financially\n                    anaemic–it was insolvent and had substantial unsatisfied\n                debts.18     Lee Ee also unequivocally represented to the\n                    Court that even after the Capital Distribution exercise had been implemented,\n                    the companies in the Group would have more than sufficient assets to meet their\n                    then outstanding liabilities. At para 27 of his affidavit he boldly\n                    asserted:After the proposed capital reduction and capital distribution of the\n                        [respondent], it is intended for the [respondent] and the Group to retain\n                        substantial cash and cash equivalents,which will be more\n                            than sufficient to meet the existing liabilities in the accounts and to\n                            continue its operations. [emphasis added]19     Strikingly, the following assertions were also\n                    made at paras 11 and 12 of the same affidavit:... taking into account the reserves available\n                                to the Group in the form of the Available Funds, the working and\n                                other capital requirements of the Group, the Group's present credit\n                                facilities as well as funds required for any business and expansion\n                                opportunities, the current available working capital of the Group is\n                                more than its present requirements...The level of cash distribution pursuant to the capital reduction and\n                        capital distribution exercise has been determined to allow the Group to\n                        maintain sufficient Available Funds and capital and revenue reserves to\n                        support and focus on the Group's businesses as well as to take advantage of\n                        appropriate new business opportunities that may arise from time to time in\n                        the future ...20     We can safely assume that it was only because\n                    of all these unqualified statements about the Group’s robust financial\n                    position that the Court approved the Capital Distribution and Special Dividend\n                    payment on 10 January 2005. Unfortunately, this pattern of misstatement did\n                    not stop here. It will be seen below that the respondent continued to give\n                    further questionable assurances (of a different kind) even after the 3rd\n                    transaction was effected on 4 February 2005.Material misstatements in PEPL’s Financial\n                    Statements and Director’s Statement21     Before dealing with the further misstatements,\n                    it would be appropriate to review the financial situation of PEPL at the\n                    material time. In PEPL’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2004, a sum\n                    of $18,514,288 was recorded as an “Amount due to [the\n                        respondent]”[note: 16](emphasis in bold\n                    italics added). This sum comprises of (a) $16.05m transferred by the\n                    respondent to PEPL, and (b) the pre-existing debt of $2,787,999.95 owed by\n                    PEPL to the respondent. Plainly, the balance sheet as at 31 December 2004\n                    indicated that PEPL was already insolvent at that time with unsatisfied debts of\n                    $2,246,584.22     PEPL’s balance sheet and Financial\n                    Statements dated 31 December 2004 were jointly issued by Lee Ee, Koh, Tan\n                    Eng Liang, and Ch’ng Jit Koon on 23 February 2005. The first alleged\n                    misstatement is in Note 13 of PEPL’s Financial Statements dated\n                    31 December 2004[note: 17](“Note 13”), where it was\n                    stated that:The amount [due to the respondent which is the sum of $18,514,288 recorded\n                        in PEPL’s balance sheet] is non-trade related, unsecured,\n                        interest-free and isnot expected to be repaid within the\n                            next twelve months. [emphasis added]23     This assurance, as we have pointed out above,\n                    was not observed as the respondent and the directors of PEPL allowed this amount\n                    to be utilised, even before it was given, on 4 February 2005 to\n                    “repay” the amount for the purpose of making the dividend\n                    payments.24     The second alleged misstatement was contained\n                    in the Statement made by two of PEPL’s Directors (“Director’s\n                    Statement”), namely Lee Ee and Tan Eng Liang.[note: 18]The\n                    Director’s Statement was dated 23 February 2005 and was issued\n                    together with PEPL’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 and\n                    PEPL’s Financial Statements dated 31 December 2004.\n                    Paragraph (b) of the Director’s Statement represented that:... at the date of this statement there are reasonable grounds to believe\n                        that [PEPL]will be able to pay its debts as and when\n                            they fall due as its holding company has agreed to provide adequate\n                            funds for [PEPL] to meet its liabilitiesas and when they\n                        fall due and tosubordinate the amount owing to it and\n                            its related companies for the prior payment of other\n                            liabilities. [emphasis added]25     This statement was referred to by the Judge as\n                    a “Subordination Statement” (see the Judge’s Grounds of\n                    Decision,Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen\n                        Holdings Ltd[2009] SGHC 286 (“GD”) at\n                    [22]) and we will adopt the same terminology here. Contrary to the\n                    representations made in the Subordination Statement and Note 13, PEPL in\n                    fact had already paid the sum of $10,987,960.85, out of the sum of S$19.3m kept\n                    in the MBB fixed deposit account, to the respondent on 4 February 2005. We\n                    consider it significant that even after this payment was made on 4 February\n                    2005, the directors of PEPL had more than ample opportunity to amend its\n                    Director’s Statement (inclusive of the Subordination Statement) and its\n                    Financial Statements (inclusive of Note 13), as these documents were all\n                    dated and issued much later, on 23 February 2005.The other transactionsPEPL’s payment of salaries and expenses of the\n                respondent’s employees26     Lee Pui Hoon, the respondent’s finance\n                    manager, testified that PEPL had operated as a “payment centre”\n                    since 2001.[note: 19]PEPL would\n                    make payments for and on behalf of the respondent and other subsidiaries. The\n                    payments include salaries, CPF payments and petty cash reimbursements for the\n                    employees in the Group.[note: 20]This arrangement does not\n                    seem, however, to have been properly captured in the Group’s financial\n                    statements.27     During the material period, PEPL made payment\n                    to the respondent on six separate occasions, allegedly as payment for the\n                    salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees. These payments came\n                    to $347,144.16 in all. The six occasions were: 31 January 2005,\n                    28 February 2005, 31 March 2005, 30 April 2005, 31 May 2005\n                    and 30 June 2005 (see above at[5]).\n                    These were all alleged to be unfair preferences. The respondent maintains that\n                    these payments were made in accordance with PEPL’s settled\n                        practices.[note: 21]PEPL’s payment to the respondent for reimbursement of iron ore\n                purchases28     PEPL also made payment to the respondent on\n                    two other occasions, allegedly as reimbursement for iron ore purchases. These\n                    payments amounted to $105,000.00. The two occasions were 21 February 2005\n                    and 4 March 2005. These were alleged to be unfair preferences. The\n                    respondent again claims that these payments followed PEPL’s settled\n                        practices.[note: 22]Set-off on 30 June 200529     On 30 June 2005, a debt of $7,538,243.15\n                    owed by PEPL to the respondent was discharged by setting it off against the sum\n                    of $9,027,964.19 owed by PPL to PEPL. The discharge of the debt owed to the\n                    respondent is also alleged to be an unfair preference. The respondent contends\n                    that this transaction was an ‘inter-company adjustment’, and that\n                    such adjustments were a “normal practice” of the Group. Companies\n                    within the Group would make payments on behalf of each other and\n                    inter–company balances then adjusted periodically.[note: 23]The Judge’s decision30     The Judge found that the evidence did not\n                    support the respondent’s contention that the sum of $16.05m was held on\n                    trust for the respondent. The Judge nevertheless held that that the statutory\n                    presumption under s 99(5) of the Bankruptcy Act had been rebutted in all\n                    ten transactions: see GD at [71]–[82]. The Judge accepted that the sum of\n                    $10,987,960.85 was meant all along to be used for the respondent’s Capital\n                    Distribution; the money had only been temporarily placed in PEPL’s MBB\n                    fixed deposit account to take advantage of higher interest rates pending court\n                    approval. The Judge also determined that even though the undertaking given in\n                    Note 13 and the Subordination Statement had been disregarded, this did not\n                    necessarily mean that there had been an unfair preference (see GD at [68]).Nonetheless, the Judge acknowledged that even if there\n                        was no fraud involved, there had been negligence and recklessness on the\n                        part of Lee Ee and PEPL’s directors. In addition, the Judge\n                    noted that there was no hint that steps would be taken by the respondent to\n                    “put its house in order” (GD at [86]). Noting that the respondent\n                    is a listed company, he intimated that the liquidators ought to draw the\n                    breaches of the various undertakings to the attention of PEPL’s auditors\n                    and the Singapore Stock Exchange. His observations at [85]–[88] of the GD\n                    merit repetition here:85    There is, however,\n                            one other observation I wish to make.It seemed to me\n                                that the directors of [PEPL], or at least Mr Lee Ee, did not\n                                bother to ensure that the Subordination Statement and Note 13 were\n                                accurate. There seemed to be some negligence or recklessness even if\n                                there was no fraud. Furthermore, although Mr Lee Ee\n                            said he would take full responsibility for the Subordination Statement,\n                            and presumably for Note 13 as well, there seemed to be an absence\n                            of genuine remorse. These two statements were not the only\n                            “errors” which had occurred. To recapitulate some other\n                            examples:(a)    the effective dates of transactions were at\n                                times incorrectly entered in accounting documents of [PEPL];\n                                and(b)    the payment of $3,250,000 by PPL to [PEPL] was\n                                actually a re-payment of an amount to [PEPL] but not recorded\n                                correctly.86    There was no hint that steps would be taken by [the\n                            respondent] to put its house in order.[the\n                                respondent] appeared to treat the present claim as more of a\n                                nuisance rather than an overdue alarm.87I am concerned about the [the\n                                respondent] mindset bearing in mind especially that it is a listed\n                                company.88I hope the liquidators will\n                                bring this unsatisfactory state of affairs to the attention of the\n                                auditors of [PEPL] who, I was informed, are also the auditors of the\n                                [the respondent] if not to the Singapore Stock Exchange as\n                                well.[emphasis added]31     With regard to the other transactions, the\n                    Judge was satisfied that they were “part of the Company’s\n                    practice” to treat PEPL as a “payment centre” to pay the\n                    salaries and cash expenses of companies in the Group. Similarly, regarding the\n                    10th transaction (the set-off involving the sum of 7,538,243.15), the Judge\n                    found that it was not the first time that set-offs had been carried out by PEPL\n                    (although the Judge did acknowledge that “it wasnot\n                        normalfor a set-off of thisextentto be done” (GD at [77])).Our decisionRelevant statutory provisions32     The relevant statutory provisions dealing with\n                    unfair preferences are s 329 of the Companies Act read with ss 99 and\n                    100 of the Bankruptcy Act.

In\n                    addition, they were made within a period of two years preceding the date of the\n                    commencement of winding up of PEPL, that is to say, when the winding up\n                    application was filed on 22 January 2007.35     It is also undisputed that PEPL was\n                    “connected” with the respondent, through the common directors, for\n                    the purposes of triggering the statutory presumption under s 99(5) of the\n                    Bankruptcy Act read with s 329 of the Companies Act (we shall refer to this\n                    presumption hereafter as the “statutory presumption”). On this\n                    point, it has been unequivocally decided by this court inShow Theatres Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Shaw Theatres Pte Ltd &\n                        another[2002] 2 SLR(R) 1143 (“Show Theatres”) that where two companies have a\n                    common director or common directors, they will be considered to be\n                    “connected with” each other. A payment to a connected party within\n                    the two years prior to liquidation is presumed to be an unfair preference and it\n                    is for the “connected” company to rebut that presumption, seeShow Theatresat [21].Prima facie, the ten transactions being questioned are presumed\n                    to have been influenced by PEPL’s desire to place the respondent in a\n                    better position in the event of PEPL’s insolvent liquidation than if the\n                    transactions had not been entered into (see ss 99(4) and (3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act).36     As such, the issue that takes centre stage in\n                    this appeal is whether the statutory presumption has been rebutted. To rebut the\n                    statutory presumption, the burden is on the respondent to show, on a balance of\n                    probabilities, that the transactions had not been influenced by PEPL’s\n                    desire to place the respondent in a better position in the event of PEPL’s\n                    insolvent liquidation. Simply put, the respondent must show that the\n                    transactions werenot influenced at allby any\n                    desire on PEPL’s part to place the respondent in a preferential position.\n                    It is never sufficient, where there is objective evidence of a preferential\n                    payment to benefit a related party in the event of an insolvent liquidation, for\n                    the directors to simply deny the existence of such a desire. The facts have to\n                    be explained in detail. We deal with the 3rd transaction in Part 1 below.\n                    The other transactions will be dealt with in Part 2 (at[56]–[68]) below.Part 1 – Analysis of the 3rd transactionPreliminary considerations37     As mentioned above, the Judge had decided that\n                    the sum of $16.05m transferred to PEPL was an ordinary advance. He, quite\n                    rightly, emphatically rejected the contention that the subject monies advanced\n                    by the respondent to PEPL were trust monies that had belonged, all along, to it.\n                    As mentioned above, as there is no cross-appeal by the respondent against this\n                    finding we will not revisit this issue. It suffices for us to say that the\n                    objective facts clearly show the following. First, PEPL’s audited\n                    Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 confirm that the\n                    sum of $18,514,288 (which includes the sum of $16.05m transferred from the\n                    respondent to PEPL) was recorded as a “[n]on-current\n                        liability” [emphasis in bold in original] and as\n                    “Amounts due” to the respondent.[note: 24]In addition,\n                    Note 13 of the Financial Statements emphatically stated that the amount due\n                    to the respondent (the sum of $18,514,288) as “unsecured” and\n                    “interest free” that is “not expected to be repaid within\n                    the next 12 months”.[note: 25]38     Second, the debit note dated 31 December\n                    2004 recorded the transfer of the sum of $15,750,000.00 on 4 December 2004\n                    as an “ADVANCE” from the Respondent to PEPL even though the monies\n                    came from the sale proceeds of an asset owned by PPL.[note: 26]The\n                    balance sum of $300,000 (the sum that the respondent obtained from having\n                    realised its shares in Wee Poh Holdings) had been recorded as a\n                        “transfer of funds toPEPL MBBfixed deposit”.39     Third, Lee Ee and Tan Eng Liang, in their\n                    capacity as directors of PEPL, unequivocally represented in the Subordination\n                    Statement that PEPL would be able to pay its debts when dueas the Respondent had agreed to provide adequate funds for PEPL to meet its\n                        liabilities as and when they fell dueand crucially, to\n                    subordinate the amount owing to it and its related companies to ensure the prior\n                    payment of other liabilities.[note: 27]Presumption for 3rd transaction is not rebutted40     The existence of a subjective desire to prefer\n                    a creditor in the event of an insolvent liquidation may be inferred from all the\n                    circumstances of the transaction. The statutory presumption can therefore be\n                    reinforced or rebutted on the basis of direct evidence and/or on inferences\n                    drawn from the circumstances. If it can be established by the related party that\n                    the transaction was underpinned by proper commercial considerations and not by a\n                    positive desire to prefer it in the event of an insolvent liquidation, the\n                    transaction will not be impugned. On the established facts, in so far as the 3rd\n                    transaction is concerned, we determine that the statutory presumption for the\n                    3rd transaction has not been rebutted for the following reasons:(a)     The failure to adhere to the above\n                        series ofassurancesgiven by the directors of\n                        the respondent and PEPL was highlyirregular- indeed, they were made for an improper reason. Quite\n                        clearly, they were made to allow PEPL to continue operating as a going\n                        concern despite its parlous financial situation. Given the proximity with\n                        which they were made to the date of the adverse arbitration award against\n                        PEPL and the emphatic assurance not to pay related companies in preference\n                        to unrelated creditors in the Subordination Statement and in Note 13,\n                        we think that there was more than compelling evidence of a desire by PEPL to\n                        prefer the respondent.(b)     In situations where there is clear evidence of the\n                        directors’ failure to appropriately consider the interests of the\n                        company’s creditors, the Court should carefully sift through the\n                        evidence to determine if there were any transactions that undermine the\n                        collective procedure of insolvent liquidation. Here, the interests of\n                        PEPL’s unrelated creditors wereobviously\n                            disregarded. The 3rd transaction was undoubtedly orchestrated\n                        by PEPL’s principal director to benefit the respondent’s\n                        principal shareholder, who was essentially one and the same person: Lee Ee\n                        (and his wife, Koh). As such, the established facts in the present case\n                        fortify the statutory presumption.(c)     The purported commercial reason for making the advance\n                        (even if present), in and of itself, is insufficient to rebut the statutory\n                        presumption.41     We now elaborate on each of these\n                    reasons.False assurances given by the directors of PEPL42     It is plain to us that assurances given in the\n                    Subordination Statement and Note 13 have been shown to be false. We should\n                    point out at the outset, that since PEPL is statutorily required[note: 28]to lodge an annual return\n                    attached with the company’s balance sheet, Directors’ report and\n                    Financial Statements; any assurances found in these statements would be made to\n                    the auditors, the public at large, as well its shareholders and, of particular\n                    concern in the present case, PEPL’s creditors. For itsunrelatedcreditors, these publicly filed statements were likely\n                    to be their main source of financial information on PEPL and could have\n                    influenced their decisions on when and how to recover their outstandings.\n                    Note 13 represented that the amounts due to the respondent (referenced as\n                    the sum of $18,514,288 in the Financial Statements) were not intended to be\n                    repaidwithin the next twelve months. Note 13\n                    was part of PEPL’s Financial Statements dated 31 December 2004 and it\n                    was issued together with the Directors’ Report for the year ended\n                    31 December 2004, signed on 23 February 2005.This\n                        assurance was given to ensure that PEPL could continue operating as a going\n                        concern as it was then technically insolvent. In fact, the sum of\n                        $10,987,960.85 from the sum of $18,514,288 had already been repaid to the\n                        respondent on 4 February 2005 – well before this assurance was\n                        even given.43     The assurances given by PEPL’s directors\n                    in the Subordination Statement that PEPL would subordinate the amounts owed to\n                    the respondent and its related companies “for the prior payment of other\n                    liabilities” (see[24]above) were\n                    also disregarded. Counsel for the respondent argued that the Subordination\n                    Statement correctly represented PEPL’s financial situation as of\n                    31 December 2004 as the payment out was only made subsequently. We cannot\n                    agree with this. The Director’s Statement (inclusive of the Subordination\n                    Statement) dated 23 February 2005, was released as an integral part of\n                    PEPL’s Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2004\n                    and annexed to PEPL’s audited balance sheet and Financial Statements\n                    ending 31 December 2004. This assurance that other liabilities would be\n                    paid in priority to related debts giveninter aliato the auditors of the Group did not end on 31 December 2004. It was meant\n                    to unambiguously create an expectation that all debts owed to unrelated\n                    creditors would be paid in priority to related debts. Despite this solemn\n                    assurance, the sum of $10,987,960.85 was paid to the respondent on\n                    4 February 2005.44     The Judge appeared to have vaguely hinted that\n                    the misrepresentations might have been fraudulent but was ultimately content to\n                    find that there was negligence and recklessness on the part of Lee Ee and\n                    PEPL’s directors. It appears to us clear that when the Subordination\n                    Statement and Note 13 were issued on 23 February 2005, the relevant\n                    directors ought to have been aware that $10,987,960.85 had already been paid to\n                    the respondent on 4 February 2005; they were after all directors of both\n                    PEPL and the respondent (with the exception of Koh who was the director of PEPL\n                    only). Lee Ee has now begrudgingly acknowledged that he might have known that\n                    PEPL was “technically insolvent” by the end of the financial year\n                    2004, a few months before the amount was paid on 4 February\n                        2005.[note: 29]This is not the whole truth.\n                    It is surprising that even after these payments were made on 4 February\n                    2005, the directors of PEPL (despite the ample time available to them to amend\n                    its Financial Statements (inclusive of Note 13) and the Director’s\n                    Statement (inclusive of the Subordination Statement) before these were issued on\n                    23 February 2005), took no steps to correct them. In its written\n                    submissions, the respondent claims that Note 13 “was intended as a\n                    standard form statement and not meant to be legally binding”[note: 30]though it is conceded that “[t]hese\n                    statements were made in order to confirm PEPL as a going concern at the end of\n                    the financial year”.[note: 31]These\n                    are astonishing submissions as they suggest that the directors were guilty of\n                    reckless conduct, at the very least. As these statements were made to secure\n                    PELP’s status as a going concern all the directors must take collective\n                    responsibility for their contents and the glaring failure to adhere to the\n                    commitments given therein. This limp attempt to minimise responsibility for a\n                    public commitment in a statutory document must be strongly deprecated. Directors\n                    have to understand that they must take full responsibility for the accuracy and\n                    implementation of all such statements. There is no point in saying that these\n                    were pro forma statements. A failure to appreciate the consequences of not\n                    adhering to such statements can be perilous.45     In our view, the legal significance of the\n                    assurances made in the Subordination Statement and Note 13 were not fully\n                    appreciated by the Judge. We find that the patent breaches of these assurances\n                    fortify the statutory presumption and are, in the final analysis, compelling\n                    evidence of thedesire of the common directors to prefer a\n                        related entity. When these assurances were given, Winter\n                    Engineering had already secured an arbitration award (awarded on\n                    26 November 2006) of $3.6m against PEPL. When this liability of $3.6m was\n                    factored in, PEPL was insolvent with a deficit of more than $2m as shown in its\n                    Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2004. As Winter Engineering was immediately\n                    entitled to enforce its award the risk of PEPL being placed in liquidation was\n                    very real.It was only because of those assurances that PEPL\n                        could continue trading as a going concern. Subsequent events made\n                    it plain that the directors of PEPL and the respondent never had any intention\n                    of settling the outstanding due to its unrelated creditors. The evidence is\n                    telling. Between the time PEPL’s Financial Statements and Director’s\n                    Statement were released on 23 February 2005, and when insolvency\n                    proceedings commenced on 22 January 2007, a total sum of $18,978,348.16 was\n                    transferred from PEPLto the respondent, and a\n                    total sum of $3,528,040 was transferred from PEPLto related\n                        companies in the Group.[note: 32]Yet\n                    PEPL’s two largest external creditors, Winter Engineering and Uni-Sanitary\n                    were not paid even a cent. In addition, PEPL owed a total sum of $527,336.28 to\n                    otherunrelatedcreditors (apart from Winter\n                    Engineering and Uni-Sanitary) as at 16 February 2007, the date of the\n                    winding up order.[note: 33]46     The irresistible conclusion is that these\n                    false assurances were given to buy more time for the respondent to transfer\n                    PEPL’s monies to itself and to related creditors, including the respondent\n                        -away from the reach of PEPL’s unrelated\n                        creditors. These facts also suggest the directors of PEPL had\n                    been carrying on PEPL’s business when it was technically insolvent to the\n                    detriment of PEPL’s unrelated creditors. This can perhaps be best\n                    characterised as a case of transparent subterfuge. It raises problematic issues\n                    under s 340(1) of the Companies Act in relation to the directors’\n                    collective responsibility for this sorry state of affairs. As this particular\n                    point is not an issue immediately before us, we will say no more.Breach of director’s duties47     In addition to the false assurances made by\n                    PEPL’s directors, there are additional facts to fortify the statutory\n                    presumption. As will be seen below at[53],\n                    the evidence here presents an obvious situation where the directors (Lee Ee and\n                    Koh in particular) have breached their directors’ duties to consider the\n                    interests of PEPL’s creditors. Indeed, we think that whenever it is\n                    plainly established that the directors have disregarded their duties the Court\n                    should view with even greater scepticism transactions that appear to undermine\n                    the collective procedure of insolvent liquidation, such as unfair preferences or\n                    undervalue transactions. This is because the avoidance rules serve the same\n                    broad policy objectives as the directors’ duties to consider the interests\n                    of creditors when a company’s financial position severely deteriorates.\n                    Both are aimed at protecting the general body of creditors against a diminution\n                    of the assets available for distribution to creditors in the collective\n                    insolvency regime. In certain instances, the breach of the director’s duty\n                    goes hand in hand with an unfair preference transaction and may even be a basis\n                    for independent recovery from the directors if the preferred creditor is unable\n                    to repay the amount adjudged to be an undue preference. To appreciate this, a\n                    proper understanding of the duty is required.48     It is trite that directors have a duty to act\n                    in the best interest of the company as a whole. When a company is solvent, the\n                    company’s directors owe no duty to creditors. (SeeFederal Express Pacific Inc. v Meglis Airfreight Pte Ltd (formerly known as\n                        Thong Soon Airfreight Pte Ltd) and Others[1998] SGHC 417 (“Federal\n                    Express”) at [17] where it was held that such a duty to\n                    consider creditors’ interests only arises during insolvency or in a state\n                    of near insolvency; andMultinational Gas and Petrochemical\n                        Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd[1983]\n                    Ch 258, applied inLexi Holdings plc (In Administration)\n                        v Luqman and others[2007] EWHC 2652 (Ch); also see the\n                    observations in Kala Anandarajah,Corporate Governance,\n                        Practice and Issues(Academy Publishing, 2010) at p 275.)\n                    However, it is now also settled law that when a company is insolvent, or even in\n                    a parlous financial position, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into\n                    account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for\n                    the company. This fiduciary duty requires directors to ensure that the\n                    company’s assets are not dissipated or exploited for their own benefit to\n                    the prejudice of creditors’ interests. In this regard, the purpose of this\n                    duty mirrors that of the avoidance provisions in seeking to preserve the\n                    company’s assets for distribution to the company’s creditors through\n                    the mechanism of insolvency. The House of Lords inWinkworth\n                        v Edward Baron Development Co Ltd and others[1987] 1 All\n                    ER 114 (perLord Templeman) declared at\n                    118:[A] company owes a duty to its creditors, present and future. The company\n                        is not bound to pay off every debt as soon as it is incurred, and the\n                        company is not obliged to avoid all ventures which involve an element of\n                        risk, but thecompany owes a duty to its creditors to\n                            keep its property inviolate and available for the repayment of its\n                            debts.The conscience of the company, as\n                            well as its management, is confided to its directors. A duty is owed by\n                            the directors to the company and to the creditors of the company to\n                            ensure that the affairs of the company are properly administered and\n                            that its property is not dissipated or exploited for the benefit of the\n                            directors themselves to the prejudice of the creditors. Both\n                        Mr and Mrs Wing committed a breach of their duty to the company\n                        and its creditors when £115,000 was withdrawn from the company to pay\n                        for their shares and when the company's overdraft was incurred and increased\n                        at least partly for their benefit. When Mr and Mrs Wing paid\n                        £8,600.91 to the company, their liability to the company and its\n                        creditors far exceeded that sum. These breaches of duty would not have\n                        mattered if Mr and Mrs Wing had been able to maintain the solvency\n                        of the company and to see that all its creditors were paid in full.\n                        [emphasis added]49     The English Court of appeal decision ofWest Mercia Safetywear Ltd (in liq) v Dodd and\n                        another[1988] BCLC 250 (“West Mercia”) is particularly instructive for present\n                    purposes. In that case the plaintiff company owed its parent company more than\n                    £30,000. Mr Dodd was a director of both companies, which were both\n                    insolvent. The parent company had debts which were guaranteed by Mr Dodd.\n                    At the time when, to Mr Dodd’s knowledge, the plaintiff company was\n                    already insolvent, Mr Dodd authorised the transfer of £4,000 from the\n                    plaintiff company to the parent company so as to reduce his own personal\n                    liability under his guarantees for the parent company. The Court of Appeal found\n                    (at [33]) that by doing so, Mr Dodd had been “in\n                        fraudof the creditors of the company”; he had disregarded\n                    the interests of the creditors of the plaintiff company and had made the\n                    transfer for his sole and personal benefit. Dillon LJ cited with approval\n                    the observations of Street CJ in the New South Wales Court of Appeal\n                    decision ofKinsela and another v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (In\n                        Liq)[1986] 4 NSWLR 722, at p 730\n                        (“Kinsela”):In a solvent company the proprietary interests of the shareholders entitle\n                        them as a general body to be regarded as the company when questions of the\n                        duty of directors arise. If, as a general body, they authorise or ratify a\n                        particular action of the directors, there can be no challenge to the\n                        validity of what the directors have done. Butwhere a\n                            company is insolvent the interests of the creditors intrude.

[emphasis added]50     In Australia, the decision ofWalker v Wimborne and others[1975–1976]\n                    137 CLR 1 (“Walker”)\n                    underscores how such breaches of fiduciary duties can occur where there are\n                    common directors in companies that belong to the same group.Walkerwas a case that involved several companies with common\n                    directors. The directors of the plaintiff company (“Asiatic”)\n                    formulated a general policy for moving funds between the companies in the group\n                    to meet exigencies as they arose. The directors transferred $10,000 from Asiatic\n                    to Australian Sound, a company in the group, as the latter was in financial\n                    difficulties (“the transaction”). However, Asiatic did not receive\n                    any advantage or benefit from this so-called loan, since there was no security\n                    nor any promise to pay interest obtained from Australian Sound. Furthermore,\n                    Asiatic was itself insolvent when the common directors directed the sum of\n                    $10,000 to be transferred to Australian Sound. As such, to finance the\n                    transaction, Asiatic had to borrow $10,000 from another company in the group,\n                    Estoril. This loan was fully secured by an equitable charge granted by Asiatic\n                    to Estoril. This meant that Asiatic’s unsecured creditors had been\n                    deprived of $10,000 which would have been available for distribution but for the\n                    transaction. The Court emphasised that each company in a group is a separate\n                    legal entity, and that the directors of each company had to discharge their\n                    duties with regard to the interests of the creditors of that company, without\n                    allowing such interests to be prejudiced by movement of monies between companies\n                    in a group (at 6–7):… each of the companies [in a group of companies] was a separate\n                        and independent legal entity, and that it was the duty of the directors of\n                        Asiatic [the plaintiff company] to consult its interests and its interests\n                        alone in deciding whether payments should be made to other companies. In\n                        this respect it should be emphasized that the directors of a company in\n                        discharging their duty to the company must take account of the interest of\n                        its shareholders and its creditors. Any failure by the directors to take\n                        into account the interests of creditors will have adverse consequences for\n                        the company as well as for them. The creditor of a company, whether it be a\n                        member of a \"group\" of companies in the accepted sense of that term or not,\n                        must look to that company for payment. His interests may be prejudiced by\n                        the movement of funds between companies in the event that the companies\n                        become insolvent.51     The English and Australian approach to these\n                    issues has also been adopted by the Singapore courts. In the decision ofChip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi\n                        Mo and others[2004] 1 SLR(R) 434, the High Court\n                    correctly endorsed the basic proposition that “[w]hen a company is\n                    insolvent, the interests of creditors become the dominant factor in what\n                    constitutes ‘the benefit of the company as a whole’” (at\n                    [13]; also seeFederal Expressat\n                [17]).52     It can be seen (at[49]above) from the observations by Street CJ inKinsela(cited with approval inWest\n                        Mercia) that the rationale for such a duty is that, when a\n                    company is insolvent, the creditors’ interests come to the fore as the\n                    company is effectively trading and running the company’s business with the\n                    creditors’ money. Because of the limited liability principle, the risks\n                    (of trading when the company is insolvent) on shareholders would be minimal as\n                    they would at worst lose only what they have already invested in the company in\n                    their capacity as shareholders. Unsecured or partially secured creditors on the\n                    other hand may never recover any monies due to them. Unlike shareholders who\n                    have the most to gain from risky ventures, unsecured creditors, in particular,\n                    have everything to lose when illegitimate risks are taken. As such, it is only\n                    right that directors ought to be accountable to creditors for the decisions they\n                    make when the company is, or perilously close to being, insolvent. We add,\n                    parenthetically, that this fiduciary duty is strictly speaking owedto the company; there isno duty owed\n                        directly to creditors. In other words, individual creditors\n                    cannot, without the assistance of liquidators, directly recover from the\n                    directors for such breaches of duty (seeYukong Line Ltd. of\n                        Korea v Rendsburg Investments Corporation of Liberia and Others\n                        (No. 2)[1998] 1 WLR 294; and more recently,Re Pantone 485 Ltd, Miller v Bain and others[2002] 1 BCLC 266 ). If creditors were allowed to recover directly, it\n                    would contravene the collective procedure of insolvency and open a back door for\n                    some of them to work around thepari passurule.\n                    Allowing creditorsandthe company to directly\n                    recover from directors might also lead to double recovery; seeD D Prentice, “Creditor’s Interests and Director’s Duties”\n                    (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 265 at 275.53     In the present case, we find that the\n                    statutory presumption, far from being rebutted, had in fact been reinforced by\n                    PEPL’s directors’ manifest breaches of their personal\n                    directors’ duties. The transfer of $10,987,960.85 on 4 February 2005,\n                    made in direct contravention of the representations found in the Subordination\n                    Statement and Note 13, had been for the purposes of the Capital\n                    Distribution and Special Dividend payout to the respondent’s\n                        shareholders.[note: 34]It is not an unimportant consideration\n                    that Lee Ee and his wife, Koh together own 29.24% of the shareholding in the\n                        respondent.[note: 35]As such, the\n                    3rd transaction had the effect of conferring a direct benefit to Lee Ee and Kohpersonallyin their capacity as substantial\n                    shareholders of the respondent. In light of the fact that they were:\n                    (a) the ultimate beneficiaries of a substantial portion of $10,987,960.85;\n                    (b) directors of PEPL and (c) one of them (Lee Ee) was also a director\n                    of the respondent, there are grounds for a compelling inference that Lee Ee and\n                    Koh were thedirecting mindsbehind the payment of\n                    $10,987,960.85 on 4 February 2005 to the respondent. This is irrefutable\n                    evidence of the requisite desire to prefer, even without having to rely upon the\n                    statutory presumption of the desire to prefer. In essence, the directors of\n                    PEPL, especially Lee Ee and Koh, had brazenly disregarded their very own\n                    assurances (quadirectors) not to prefer (as\n                    manifested in the Subordination Statement and Note 13) or benefit\n                    themselves to the prejudice of the interests of PEPL’s unrelated\n                    creditors.Commercial reason for making the advance is in and of itself\n                insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption54     We have emphasised that the directors’\n                    breaches of their own assurances constitute compelling evidence of the desire of\n                    PEPL to prefer the respondent. In this regard, the 3rd transaction ought to be\n                    set aside as an unfair preference with or without the aid of the statutory\n                    presumption. Even if we did not take into consideration the broken assurances\n                    and the breaches of director’s duties on Lee Ee’s part, the\n                    respondent has, in our view, failed to discharge its burden of proof to rebut\n                    the statutory presumption.55     The respondent stated that the advance of\n                    $16.05m to PEPL was made to take advantage of higher interest rates in\n                    PEPL’s MBB fixed deposit accounts. The respondent’s commercial\n                    reasons given to justify the advance of the loan are not apparent to us (see\n                    above at[8]). The fact that $16.05m had been\n                    advanced by the respondent to PEPL on 4 December 2004 purportedly to take\n                    advantage of higher interest rates in PEPL’s MBB fixed deposit account\n                    does not explain why the repayment of $10,987,960.85 by PEPL to the respondentwould not bean unfair preference. This is\n                    because there is nothing exceptional in a creditor lending money to take\n                    advantage of the possibility of higher returns upon repayment of the money lent.\n                    In other words, the commercial reason for making the advance (to take advantage\n                    of higher interest rates), without more, does not explain away the presumption\n                    that therepaymentof the advance was influenced\n                    by a desire to prefer the creditor. More importantly, the monies loaned were\n                    unsecured loans which could not thereafter be repaid in priority relative to\n                    other outstanding liabilities of PEPLwhen the company itself\n                        was insolvent. In any case, we are satisfied that the crucial\n                    consideration in the decision by the respondent to loan the money to PEPL was to\n                    enable PEPL’s accounts to be finalised on a going concern basis. In our\n                    view, sanction for the capital reduction of the respondent and the payment of\n                    the dividends would not have been given if the court had been apprised of the\n                    true facts.Part 2 - The presumption in relation to PEPL’s other payments\n                to the respondent and the set-off effected on 30 June 2005 has not been\n                rebutted56     The other payments made by PEPL to the\n                    respondent alleged to be unfair preferences were:(a)     Payments allegedly made for the\n                        salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees on six occasions:\n                        31 January 2005, 28 February 2005, 31 March 2005,\n                        30 April 2005, 31 May 2005 and 30 June 2005. These payments\n                        amounted to $347,144.16 (see above at[27]);(b)     Payments allegedly made as reimbursement to the\n                        respondent for iron ore purchases on 21 February 2005 and 4 March\n                        2005. These payments amounted to $105,000.00, (see above at[28]).In addition, there\n                    was a set-off transaction which was alleged to be an unfair preference:(c)     The set-off was effected on\n                        30 June 2005; as a consequence a debt of $7,538,243.15 owed by PEPL to\n                        the respondent has been discharged, as this sum was set off against the sum\n                        of $9,027,964.19 owed by PPL to PEPL (see above at[29]).57     The respondent’s position is that\n                    transactions[56](a)–(c) are not\n                    unfair preferences as there was evidence that they were part of PEPL’s\n                    settled practice. PEPL had been acting as the “payment centre” to\n                    make payments to other related companies within the Group. This, in our view, is\n                    not a valid legal reason for the payments. Just because a transaction has been\n                    earlier carried out while a company is solvent, it does not necessarily follow\n                    that the presumption that such transactions have been influenced by the\n                    requisite desire to prefer will be rebutted. There is no formulaic magic to a\n                    transaction being part of a past practice; a creditor cannot simply evade the\n                    statutory presumption by merely labelling a transaction as “past\n                    practice”. The key issue in rebutting the statutory presumption is to\n                    show that the particular transactions have not been influenced by the requisite\n                    desire to prefer the respondent. The existence of an established course of\n                    dealings, or “past practice” so to speak, is onlyrelevantif those past practices show that the creditor\n                    has beenproviding new valueby granting new\n                    credit to the company to purchase supplies and items (for example) to keep its\n                    business going. Where that is the case, payment is made not with the desire to\n                    prefer the creditor, but with the motivation to obtain fresh financing to\n                    sustain the company’s business in earnest. As observed by\n                    Professor Roy Goode inPrinciples of Corporate\n                        Insolvency Law, (Thomson Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005)\n                    at p 465:[The] fact that there is a series of mutual dealings, with debits and\n                        credits on both sides, will usually suffice to negate an intention to\n                        prefer, for it suggests either that a payment into the account was made in\n                        the expectation that further drawings would be allowed or that the bank\n                        allowed a further drawing on the understanding that it would be covered by a\n                        further payment into the account. In either case there is no intention to\n                        prefer, or indeed, a true preference at all. Indeed, it has been said that\n                        the real question is … the intention that payments into the account\n                        will generate future supplies of goods, services or credit.Accordingly … even payments made to discharge specific\n                            debit items will qualify for the application of the principle if the\n                            intention is that they should form part of a continuing relationship\n                            involving the extension of further credit. [emphasis\n                        added]58     Here, we note that the Judge mistakenly\n                    assumed that the presumption for these transactions was\n                    “automatically” rebutted as they were part of a “past\n                    practice”, see GD at [76]–[78]:76    ... I noted that [PEPL] did in the past apply some\n                            inter-company set-offs …77    While it is not normal for a set-off of this extent\n                            to be done, the liquidators did not dispute that there were times when\n                            some set-offs were done.78    As for the payments to CPF and for bonuses and\n                            reimbursements of petty cash, I was satisfied that these were part of\n                            [PEPL] practice. Likewise, for [PEPL] reimbursement to the [respondent]\n                            for the [respondent] earlier payment for the [PEPL’S] iron ore\n                            purchases.59     The Judge,without\n                        elaboration, had earlier approvingly referred to the decision ofRe Libra Industries Pte Ltd[1999]\n                    3 SLR(R) 205 at [49] (‘Re\n                    Libra’) at [70] of the GD:I accept that there was anestablishedpractice for Libra Industries to make payments into the account with Libra\n                        Holding without reference to specific invoices, and that the payments listed\n                        in the table were made in accordance with that practice. [emphasis\n                        added]60     We note that the Court inERC Land Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ho Wing On Christopher and\n                        others[2004] 1 SLR(R) 105 at [48] has similarly\n                    referred to the decision ofRe Libra, without\n                        elaborationfor the same proposition that “an established\n                    past practice of payments would indicate that there was no desire” to\n                    prefer the creditor. As mentioned earlier (in[57]), the existence of an established past practice of a\n                    particular type of transaction does not mean that the statutory presumption willipso factobe rebutted. Indeed, there was\n                    something more than amereestablished past\n                    practice inRe Libra: the court inRe Librafound an established course of dealing where\n                    Libra Holdings (the creditor) extended credit to Libra Industries (the company)\n                    by paying first the salaries of the employees of Libra Industries and by\n                    financing Libra Industries’ purchase of raw materials from third party\n                    suppliers. Libra Industries would in turnrepay sums\n                        owedto Libra Holdings so that the latter couldprovide new value, by extending further credit to Libra\n                    Industries. The practice of repayment of loans hadcontinued\n                        with the extension of new credit; see the succinct summary of\n                    facts by Kan Tin Chiu J inRe Libraat\n                    [46]:[T]hey were payments for moneys owing by Libra Industries to Libra\n                        Holdings for, inter alia, sale of the raw materials by Libra Holdings to\n                        Libra Industries which raw materials were purchased from third party\n                        suppliers pursuant to Libra Industries’ request for salaries paid by\n                        Libra Holdings to Libra Industries’ staff. In short, Libra Holdings\n                        and Libra Industries maintained a running account whereby payments or\n                        purchases on behalf of Libra Industries would be recorded as a debit entry\n                        against Libra Industries whilst payments received from or goods purchased\n                        from Libra Industries would be credited to Libra Industries …Since 1995, Libra Holdings had been providing Libra Industries with\n                        financial support or assistance in that it would provide Libra Industries\n                        credit or make various payments of Libra Industries’ staff salaries\n                        and CPF contributions and purchased the raw materials required by Libra\n                        Industries.61     The reasoning inRe\n                        Librais entirely consistent with Goode’s view in[57]that where the company made repayments of\n                    loans with theintentionof obtaining new credit\n                    to supply its own business operations, these repayments would not be considered\n                    as preferential payments.62     The present case is very different from the\n                    scenarios described above. This is not a case where PEPL repaid loans to the\n                    respondent, in the expectation that the respondent would provide new credit to\n                    PEPL to finance the running of PEPL’s business. If that were the case, it\n                    could be argued that PEPL made the payments to the respondent not with the\n                    desire to prefer the respondent, but with the genuine intention to obtain new\n                    credit required for the running of its business. Here, the respondent’s\n                    employees’ salaries were paid by PEPL. This payment of monies was made\n                    after technical insolvency had set in. The payments constituted “one way\n                    traffic”, in some senses: the respondent did not provide new value nor\n                    did they extend new credit throughout the history of PEPL’s payments. As\n                    for the respondent’s claim that PEPL’s payments to the respondent on\n                    21 February 2005 and 4 March 2005 were based on the past practice ofreimbursementsto the respondent for iron ore\n                    purchases paid by the respondent for and on behalf of PEPL, the\n                    respondent’s best case would be that PEPL made the payments not with the\n                    desire to prefer, but with the intention to obtain fresh financing for iron ore\n                    purchases. However, the respondent did not substantiate this claim with\n                    documentary evidence. It could have easily adduced invoices of iron ore\n                    purchases that it claimed to have paid for on behalf of PEPL, but failed to do\n                    so.63     As regards the set-off transaction\n                    (transaction (c) at[56]above), it clearly\n                    constitutes an unfair preference even without the aid of the statutory\n                    presumption. The set-off placed the respondent in a better position in the event\n                    of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the transaction had not\n                    been done; the debts that had been set off on 30 June 2005 could not have\n                    been set off in PEPL’s insolvent liquidation because of the lack of\n                    mutuality. The set-off transaction employed an asset (PEPL’schose in actionagainst PPL) that could have been\n                    distributed to PEPL’s unsecured creditors (PEPL’s claim against PPL\n                    for the debt owed) to discharge PEPL’s debt owed to the respondent, thus\n                    giving PPL an advantage over the other creditors and at the same time depriving\n                    those same creditors of an asset that could have been used for distribution in\n                    PEPL’s insolvent liquidation. The only inference to be drawn from the\n                    discharge of the debt owed to the respondent,without any\n                        extension of new credit to PEPL, would be that PEPL intended to\n                    prefer the respondent and PPL.64     Furthermore, there is no evidence that the\n                    respondent had extended new credit to PEPL subsequent to this discharge of\n                    PEPL’s indebtedness. It would have been different ifthe respondent had granted new credit to PEPL subsequentto the\n                    discharge of PEPL’s indebtedness so that PEPL could use the new credit to\n                    finance its business operations. If that was the position, it could be argued\n                    that the discharge was made with the intention to sustain PEPL’s business.\n                    In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the presumption remains\n                    unrebutted.65     In any case, there is no satisfactory\n                    objective evidence of an established past practice of similar payments. Although\n                    the respondent adduced several debits notes which shows the recorded\n                    transactions of payments made by PEPL to the respondent[note: 36], these were simple internal documents that\n                    could be prepared by simply making repetitive adjustments on a standard template\n                    on a computer. The respondent ought to have adduced records of invoices from therespondentitself - this it failed to do. With\n                    regard to the set-off transaction effected on 30 June 2005, the respondent\n                    adduced the “Schedule of Inter-Company Contra Involving 3\n                        Companies”[note: 37]which showed tripartite set-off\n                    arrangements made between related companies of the Group for December 2002;\n                    June, September and December 2003; and June and December 2004. However, no\n                    documents adduced were for the transaction that really mattered, that is, for\n                    June 2005. In any event, we have examined the Schedules of those adduced (from\n                    2002 to 2004) and it is pertinent to note that there is no evidence of any\n                    tripartite set-offs between PEPL, PPL, and the respondent evidenced in these\n                    Schedules.66     We should also point out that as at\n                    25 May 2005, when Uni-Sanitary obtained its arbitration award of\n                    $628,791.75, PEPL’S directors, despite having two substantial unsatisfied\n                    arbitration awards, had no reservations about discharging the remaining\n                    “debt” of more than $7.5m to the respondent soon after (see above\n                    at[3]). The debt of $18,514,288 due to the\n                    respondent as at 31 December 2004 (see above at[21]) was completely discharged by the end of June 2005. PEPL,\n                    however, did not pay its debts to its largest unrelated creditors. When it was\n                    eventually wound up its total debts amounted to $5,861,218.91. Of this, slightly\n                    over $1m was due to the respondent. The remaining amount was due to seven\n                    unrelated creditors (including Winter Engineering and\n                Uni-Sanitary).67     There is one final argument that we should\n                    deal with. The respondent, relying on an observation by the Judge (made without\n                    the benefit of hearing arguments), maintained that the set-off effected on\n                    30 June 2005 should not be set aside because PPL was not a party to the\n                    action. In our view, there isno requirementfor\n                    PPL to be made a party to these proceedings. As stated clearly in\n                        s 99(3)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, the\n                    claim for unfair preferences applies only againstcreditors:For the purposes of this section and sections 100 and\n                        102, an individual gives an unfair preference to a person if —(a)    that person is\n                                one of the individual’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for\n                                any of his debts or other liabilities ...68     PPL was in the position of adebtorwho owed PEPL the sum of $9,027,964.19. There is\n                    no claim of unfair preference against PPL. It was for the respondents to make\n                    PPL a party if they desired to be indemnified by it.Conclusion69     For the reasons given above, we allow the\n                    appeal. The payment of $10,987,960.85 made on 4 February 2005 is set aside.\n                    In addition, transactions[56](a) and\n                    (b) above which involved the sums of $347,144.16 and $105,000.00 respectively\n                    are set aside. Transaction[56](c) is\n                    declared void such that the debt of $7,538,243.15 owed by PEPL to the respondent\n                    continues to subsist. The full amount involved for the 3rd transaction and the\n                    other transactions is $18,987,348.16. However, since the amount of debt owed by\n                    PEPL to respondent is the sum of $18,514,287.97, the liquidator’s claim\n                    for undue preference of a debt is necessarily limited to that amount\n                        only[note: 38](this was also reflected in the\n                    claim stipulated in Originating Summons No 1433 of 2008[note: 39]).\n                    Accordingly, the respondent is ordered to repay to the liquidators all monies\n                    required to settle debts to unrelated creditors (as well as professional fees)\n                    up to the sum of $18,514,287.97.70     The liquidators are entitled to the costs of\n                    this appeal and the hearing below on an indemnity basis. In view of the\n                    egregious misrepresentations made by Lee Ee to the court to obtain its approval\n                    for the capital reduction of the respondent, and the flagrant breaches of the\n                    assurances given in the Financial Statements and the Director’s Statement\n                    (for which he must take primary responsibility), we order him to personally bear\n                    the costs of the proceedings here and below. While we have not made any costs\n                    orders against the other directors of the respondent and PEPL, we are\n                    constrained to observe that they have clearly not properly discharged their\n                    obligations of care and oversight as directors in relying on the actions and\n                    decisions of Lee Ee. The troubling sequence of improper fund transfers to\n                    related entities and the payment of the dividends (procured through false\n                    assurances of solvency) at the expense of legitimate external creditors\n                    reflected the lack of proper corporate governance within the Progen\n                    Group.[note: 1]ROA Vol3(C) at\n                        p 1300[note: 2]2005 Annual Report of PEPL, ROA\n                                Vol 3(A) at p 171.[note: 3]ROA Vol 3(A) at p85[note: 4]Ibid[note: 5]See\n                                Appellant’s Case at p 56 and ROA Vol 3(A) p 203\n                                to 247.[note: 6]3rdAffidavit of Lee Ee\n                                filed on 10 Nov 09, ROA Vol 3(C) at p 1450\n                                para 15a.[note: 7]3rdAffidavit of Chee Yoh Chuang\n                                filed on 8 May 09, ROA Vol 3(C) at p 1225\n                                para 6(a).[note: 8]RC at p 7.[note: 9]ACB Tab 5 ROA\n                                Vol 3(A)[note: 10]ROA Vol 3(A) p 265 and\n                                    266[note: 11]ROA Vol 3(A) at\n                                    p 77.[note: 12]ROA Vol 3(A) at\n                                    p 81[note: 13]RSCB ROA\n                                Vol 3(B) at p 725.[note: 14]ACB\n                                Vol 2 at p 61 and 62.[note: 15]Lee Ee’s affidavit dated\n                                30 November 2004 filed in support of application for Court\n                                Approval of Special Dividend and Capital\n                        Distribution.[note: 16]ACB\n                                Vol 2 at p 39.[note: 17]ACB Vol 2 at\n                        p51.[note: 18]ACB Vol 2 at p 37.[note: 19]2ndAffidavit of Lee Pui Hoon filed on 31 March 2009, ROA Vol 3(B)\n                                at p 994 para 20..[note: 20]Ibid.[note: 21]RC at\n                        p 14.[note: 22]RC at\n                        p 15.[note: 23]RC at p 16.[note: 24]ACB\n                                Vol II at p 39[note: 25]ACB\n                                Vol II at p 51[note: 26]ACB Vol II at p 58[note: 27]ACB\n                                Vol II at p 37.[note: 28]Every company (having a share capital) must lodge an annual\n                                return under Section 197(1) of the Companies Act with\n                                particulars in the Eight Schedule, which includes the\n                                company’s balance sheet, director’s report and financial\n                                statements.[note: 29]3rdAffidavit of Lee Ee\n                                filed on 10 November 2009, ROA Vol 3(C) at p 1448\n                                para 9.[note: 30]Respondent’s Case at\n                        [71(i)][note: 31]Respondet’s Case at [71(ii)][note: 32]See\n                                    Appellant’s Case at p 56 and ROA Vol 3(A)\n                                    p 203 to 247.[note: 33]See GD at\n                            para [80].[note: 34]RC at\n                        p 15.[note: 35]2005 Annual Report of PEPL, ROA\n                                Vol 3(A) at p 171.[note: 36]ROA Vol 3(A) pg 1013 to\n                        1210.[note: 37]ROA Vol 3(C) pg 1555 to\n                                1563[note: 38]See clarification made by Appellant’s counsel\n                                in N/E of 1 October 2009 found in ROA 3(D) at\n                            p 1729.[note: 39]See ROA Vol 3 at p 44.",
        "Material misstatements in PEPL’s Financial\n                    Statements and Director’s Statement": "21     Before dealing with the further misstatements,\n                    it would be appropriate to review the financial situation of PEPL at the\n                    material time. In PEPL’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2004, a sum\n                    of $18,514,288 was recorded as an “Amount due to [the\n                        respondent]”[note: 16](emphasis in bold\n                    italics added). This sum comprises of (a) $16.05m transferred by the\n                    respondent to PEPL, and (b) the pre-existing debt of $2,787,999.95 owed by\n                    PEPL to the respondent. Plainly, the balance sheet as at 31 December 2004\n                    indicated that PEPL was already insolvent at that time with unsatisfied debts of\n                    $2,246,584. 22     PEPL’s balance sheet and Financial\n                    Statements dated 31 December 2004 were jointly issued by Lee Ee, Koh, Tan\n                    Eng Liang, and Ch’ng Jit Koon on 23 February 2005. The first alleged\n                    misstatement is in Note 13 of PEPL’s Financial Statements dated\n                    31 December 2004[note: 17](“Note 13”), where it was\n                    stated that: The amount [due to the respondent which is the sum of $18,514,288 recorded\n                        in PEPL’s balance sheet] is non-trade related, unsecured,\n                        interest-free and isnot expected to be repaid within the\n                            next twelve months. [emphasis added] 23     This assurance, as we have pointed out above,\n                    was not observed as the respondent and the directors of PEPL allowed this amount\n                    to be utilised, even before it was given, on 4 February 2005 to\n                    “repay” the amount for the purpose of making the dividend\n                    payments. 24     The second alleged misstatement was contained\n                    in the Statement made by two of PEPL’s Directors (“Director’s\n                    Statement”), namely Lee Ee and Tan Eng Liang.[note: 18]The\n                    Director’s Statement was dated 23 February 2005 and was issued\n                    together with PEPL’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 and\n                    PEPL’s Financial Statements dated 31 December 2004.\n                    Paragraph (b) of the Director’s Statement represented that: ... at the date of this statement there are reasonable grounds to believe\n                        that [PEPL]will be able to pay its debts as and when\n                            they fall due as its holding company has agreed to provide adequate\n                            funds for [PEPL] to meet its liabilitiesas and when they\n                        fall due and tosubordinate the amount owing to it and\n                            its related companies for the prior payment of other\n                            liabilities. [emphasis added] 25     This statement was referred to by the Judge as\n                    a “Subordination Statement” (see the Judge’s Grounds of\n                    Decision,Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen\n                        Holdings Ltd[2009] SGHC 286 (“GD”) at\n                    [22]) and we will adopt the same terminology here. Contrary to the\n                    representations made in the Subordination Statement and Note 13, PEPL in\n                    fact had already paid the sum of $10,987,960.85, out of the sum of S$19.3m kept\n                    in the MBB fixed deposit account, to the respondent on 4 February 2005. We\n                    consider it significant that even after this payment was made on 4 February\n                    2005, the directors of PEPL had more than ample opportunity to amend its\n                    Director’s Statement (inclusive of the Subordination Statement) and its\n                    Financial Statements (inclusive of Note 13), as these documents were all\n                    dated and issued much later, on 23 February 2005.",
        "The other transactions": "PEPL’s payment of salaries and expenses of the\n                respondent’s employees 26     Lee Pui Hoon, the respondent’s finance\n                    manager, testified that PEPL had operated as a “payment centre”\n                    since 2001.[note: 19]PEPL would\n                    make payments for and on behalf of the respondent and other subsidiaries. The\n                    payments include salaries, CPF payments and petty cash reimbursements for the\n                    employees in the Group.[note: 20]This arrangement does not\n                    seem, however, to have been properly captured in the Group’s financial\n                    statements. 27     During the material period, PEPL made payment\n                    to the respondent on six separate occasions, allegedly as payment for the\n                    salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees. These payments came\n                    to $347,144.16 in all. The six occasions were: 31 January 2005,\n                    28 February 2005, 31 March 2005, 30 April 2005, 31 May 2005\n                    and 30 June 2005 (see above at[5]).\n                    These were all alleged to be unfair preferences. The respondent maintains that\n                    these payments were made in accordance with PEPL’s settled\n                        practices.[note: 21] PEPL’s payment to the respondent for reimbursement of iron ore\n                purchases 28     PEPL also made payment to the respondent on\n                    two other occasions, allegedly as reimbursement for iron ore purchases. These\n                    payments amounted to $105,000.00. The two occasions were 21 February 2005\n                    and 4 March 2005. These were alleged to be unfair preferences. The\n                    respondent again claims that these payments followed PEPL’s settled\n                        practices.[note: 22] Set-off on 30 June 2005 29     On 30 June 2005, a debt of $7,538,243.15\n                    owed by PEPL to the respondent was discharged by setting it off against the sum\n                    of $9,027,964.19 owed by PPL to PEPL. The discharge of the debt owed to the\n                    respondent is also alleged to be an unfair preference. The respondent contends\n                    that this transaction was an ‘inter-company adjustment’, and that\n                    such adjustments were a “normal practice” of the Group. Companies\n                    within the Group would make payments on behalf of each other and\n                    inter–company balances then adjusted periodically.[note: 23]",
        "The Judge’s decision": "30     The Judge found that the evidence did not\n                    support the respondent’s contention that the sum of $16.05m was held on\n                    trust for the respondent. The Judge nevertheless held that that the statutory\n                    presumption under s 99(5) of the Bankruptcy Act had been rebutted in all\n                    ten transactions: see GD at [71]–[82]. The Judge accepted that the sum of\n                    $10,987,960.85 was meant all along to be used for the respondent’s Capital\n                    Distribution; the money had only been temporarily placed in PEPL’s MBB\n                    fixed deposit account to take advantage of higher interest rates pending court\n                    approval. The Judge also determined that even though the undertaking given in\n                    Note 13 and the Subordination Statement had been disregarded, this did not\n                    necessarily mean that there had been an unfair preference (see GD at [68]).Nonetheless, the Judge acknowledged that even if there\n                        was no fraud involved, there had been negligence and recklessness on the\n                        part of Lee Ee and PEPL’s directors. In addition, the Judge\n                    noted that there was no hint that steps would be taken by the respondent to\n                    “put its house in order” (GD at [86]). Noting that the respondent\n                    is a listed company, he intimated that the liquidators ought to draw the\n                    breaches of the various undertakings to the attention of PEPL’s auditors\n                    and the Singapore Stock Exchange. His observations at [85]–[88] of the GD\n                    merit repetition here: 85    There is, however,\n                            one other observation I wish to make.It seemed to me\n                                that the directors of [PEPL], or at least Mr Lee Ee, did not\n                                bother to ensure that the Subordination Statement and Note 13 were\n                                accurate. There seemed to be some negligence or recklessness even if\n                                there was no fraud. Furthermore, although Mr Lee Ee\n                            said he would take full responsibility for the Subordination Statement,\n                            and presumably for Note 13 as well, there seemed to be an absence\n                            of genuine remorse. These two statements were not the only\n                            “errors” which had occurred. To recapitulate some other\n                            examples: (a)    the effective dates of transactions were at\n                                times incorrectly entered in accounting documents of [PEPL];\n                                and (b)    the payment of $3,250,000 by PPL to [PEPL] was\n                                actually a re-payment of an amount to [PEPL] but not recorded\n                                correctly. 86    There was no hint that steps would be taken by [the\n                            respondent] to put its house in order.[the\n                                respondent] appeared to treat the present claim as more of a\n                                nuisance rather than an overdue alarm. 87I am concerned about the [the\n                                respondent] mindset bearing in mind especially that it is a listed\n                                company. 88I hope the liquidators will\n                                bring this unsatisfactory state of affairs to the attention of the\n                                auditors of [PEPL] who, I was informed, are also the auditors of the\n                                [the respondent] if not to the Singapore Stock Exchange as\n                                well. [emphasis added] 31     With regard to the other transactions, the\n                    Judge was satisfied that they were “part of the Company’s\n                    practice” to treat PEPL as a “payment centre” to pay the\n                    salaries and cash expenses of companies in the Group. Similarly, regarding the\n                    10th transaction (the set-off involving the sum of 7,538,243.15), the Judge\n                    found that it was not the first time that set-offs had been carried out by PEPL\n                    (although the Judge did acknowledge that “it wasnot\n                        normalfor a set-off of thisextentto be done” (GD at [77])).",

The relevant parts of s 329 of the Companies Act\n                    read as follows: 329. —(1) Subject to this Act and\n                        such modifications as may be prescribed, any transfer, mortgage, delivery of\n                        goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by\n                        or against a company which, had it been made or done by or against an\n                        individual, would in his bankruptcy be void or voidable under\n                        section 98, 99 or 103 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20) (read with\n                        sections 100, 101 and 102 thereof) shall in the event of the company\n                        being wound up be void or voidable in like manner.

(5)An individual who has given an unfair preference\n                            to a person who, at the time the unfair preference was given, was an\n                            associate of his (otherwise than by reason only of being his employee)\n                            shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have been influenced\n                            in deciding to give it by such a desire as is mentioned in\n                            subsection (4).

[emphasis in bold in original, emphasis in bold italics added] 34     It is common ground that the ten transactions\n                    questioned by the liquidators were entered into while PEPL was insolvent. In\n                    addition, they were made within a period of two years preceding the date of the\n                    commencement of winding up of PEPL, that is to say, when the winding up\n                    application was filed on 22 January 2007. 35     It is also undisputed that PEPL was\n                    “connected” with the respondent, through the common directors, for\n                    the purposes of triggering the statutory presumption under s 99(5) of the\n                    Bankruptcy Act read with s 329 of the Companies Act (we shall refer to this\n                    presumption hereafter as the “statutory presumption”). On this\n                    point, it has been unequivocally decided by this court inShow Theatres Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Shaw Theatres Pte Ltd &\n                        another[2002] 2 SLR(R) 1143 (“Show Theatres”) that where two companies have a\n                    common director or common directors, they will be considered to be\n                    “connected with” each other. A payment to a connected party within\n                    the two years prior to liquidation is presumed to be an unfair preference and it\n                    is for the “connected” company to rebut that presumption, seeShow Theatresat [21].Prima facie, the ten transactions being questioned are presumed\n                    to have been influenced by PEPL’s desire to place the respondent in a\n                    better position in the event of PEPL’s insolvent liquidation than if the\n                    transactions had not been entered into (see ss 99(4) and (3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act). 36     As such, the issue that takes centre stage in\n                    this appeal is whether the statutory presumption has been rebutted. To rebut the\n                    statutory presumption, the burden is on the respondent to show, on a balance of\n                    probabilities, that the transactions had not been influenced by PEPL’s\n                    desire to place the respondent in a better position in the event of PEPL’s\n                    insolvent liquidation. Simply put, the respondent must show that the\n                    transactions werenot influenced at allby any\n                    desire on PEPL’s part to place the respondent in a preferential position.\n                    It is never sufficient, where there is objective evidence of a preferential\n                    payment to benefit a related party in the event of an insolvent liquidation, for\n                    the directors to simply deny the existence of such a desire. The facts have to\n                    be explained in detail. We deal with the 3rd transaction in Part 1 below.\n                    The other transactions will be dealt with in Part 2 (at[56]–[68]) below.",
        "Part 1 – Analysis of the 3rd transaction": "",
        "Preliminary considerations": "37     As mentioned above, the Judge had decided that\n                    the sum of $16.05m transferred to PEPL was an ordinary advance. He, quite\n                    rightly, emphatically rejected the contention that the subject monies advanced\n                    by the respondent to PEPL were trust monies that had belonged, all along, to it.\n                    As mentioned above, as there is no cross-appeal by the respondent against this\n                    finding we will not revisit this issue. It suffices for us to say that the\n                    objective facts clearly show the following. First, PEPL’s audited\n                    Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 confirm that the\n                    sum of $18,514,288 (which includes the sum of $16.05m transferred from the\n                    respondent to PEPL) was recorded as a “[n]on-current\n                        liability” [emphasis in bold in original] and as\n                    “Amounts due” to the respondent.[note: 24]In addition,\n                    Note 13 of the Financial Statements emphatically stated that the amount due\n                    to the respondent (the sum of $18,514,288) as “unsecured” and\n                    “interest free” that is “not expected to be repaid within\n                    the next 12 months”.[note: 25] 38     Second, the debit note dated 31 December\n                    2004 recorded the transfer of the sum of $15,750,000.00 on 4 December 2004\n                    as an “ADVANCE” from the Respondent to PEPL even though the monies\n                    came from the sale proceeds of an asset owned by PPL.[note: 26]The\n                    balance sum of $300,000 (the sum that the respondent obtained from having\n                    realised its shares in Wee Poh Holdings) had been recorded as a\n                        “transfer of funds toPEPL MBBfixed deposit”. 39     Third, Lee Ee and Tan Eng Liang, in their\n                    capacity as directors of PEPL, unequivocally represented in the Subordination\n                    Statement that PEPL would be able to pay its debts when dueas the Respondent had agreed to provide adequate funds for PEPL to meet its\n                        liabilities as and when they fell dueand crucially, to\n                    subordinate the amount owing to it and its related companies to ensure the prior\n                    payment of other liabilities.[note: 27]",
        "Presumption for 3rd transaction is not rebutted": "40     The existence of a subjective desire to prefer\n                    a creditor in the event of an insolvent liquidation may be inferred from all the\n                    circumstances of the transaction. The statutory presumption can therefore be\n                    reinforced or rebutted on the basis of direct evidence and/or on inferences\n                    drawn from the circumstances. If it can be established by the related party that\n                    the transaction was underpinned by proper commercial considerations and not by a\n                    positive desire to prefer it in the event of an insolvent liquidation, the\n                    transaction will not be impugned. On the established facts, in so far as the 3rd\n                    transaction is concerned, we determine that the statutory presumption for the\n                    3rd transaction has not been rebutted for the following reasons: (a)     The failure to adhere to the above\n                        series ofassurancesgiven by the directors of\n                        the respondent and PEPL was highlyirregular- indeed, they were made for an improper reason. Quite\n                        clearly, they were made to allow PEPL to continue operating as a going\n                        concern despite its parlous financial situation. Given the proximity with\n                        which they were made to the date of the adverse arbitration award against\n                        PEPL and the emphatic assurance not to pay related companies in preference\n                        to unrelated creditors in the Subordination Statement and in Note 13,\n                        we think that there was more than compelling evidence of a desire by PEPL to\n                        prefer the respondent. (b)     In situations where there is clear evidence of the\n                        directors’ failure to appropriately consider the interests of the\n                        company’s creditors, the Court should carefully sift through the\n                        evidence to determine if there were any transactions that undermine the\n                        collective procedure of insolvent liquidation. Here, the interests of\n                        PEPL’s unrelated creditors wereobviously\n                            disregarded. The 3rd transaction was undoubtedly orchestrated\n                        by PEPL’s principal director to benefit the respondent’s\n                        principal shareholder, who was essentially one and the same person: Lee Ee\n                        (and his wife, Koh). As such, the established facts in the present case\n                        fortify the statutory presumption. (c)     The purported commercial reason for making the advance\n                        (even if present), in and of itself, is insufficient to rebut the statutory\n                        presumption. 41     We now elaborate on each of these\n                    reasons.",
        "False assurances given by the directors of PEPL": "42     It is plain to us that assurances given in the\n                    Subordination Statement and Note 13 have been shown to be false. We should\n                    point out at the outset, that since PEPL is statutorily required[note: 28]to lodge an annual return\n                    attached with the company’s balance sheet, Directors’ report and\n                    Financial Statements; any assurances found in these statements would be made to\n                    the auditors, the public at large, as well its shareholders and, of particular\n                    concern in the present case, PEPL’s creditors. For itsunrelatedcreditors, these publicly filed statements were likely\n                    to be their main source of financial information on PEPL and could have\n                    influenced their decisions on when and how to recover their outstandings.\n                    Note 13 represented that the amounts due to the respondent (referenced as\n                    the sum of $18,514,288 in the Financial Statements) were not intended to be\n                    repaidwithin the next twelve months. Note 13\n                    was part of PEPL’s Financial Statements dated 31 December 2004 and it\n                    was issued together with the Directors’ Report for the year ended\n                    31 December 2004, signed on 23 February 2005.This\n                        assurance was given to ensure that PEPL could continue operating as a going\n                        concern as it was then technically insolvent. In fact, the sum of\n                        $10,987,960.85 from the sum of $18,514,288 had already been repaid to the\n                        respondent on 4 February 2005 – well before this assurance was\n                        even given. 43     The assurances given by PEPL’s directors\n                    in the Subordination Statement that PEPL would subordinate the amounts owed to\n                    the respondent and its related companies “for the prior payment of other\n                    liabilities” (see[24]above) were\n                    also disregarded. Counsel for the respondent argued that the Subordination\n                    Statement correctly represented PEPL’s financial situation as of\n                    31 December 2004 as the payment out was only made subsequently. We cannot\n                    agree with this. The Director’s Statement (inclusive of the Subordination\n                    Statement) dated 23 February 2005, was released as an integral part of\n                    PEPL’s Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2004\n                    and annexed to PEPL’s audited balance sheet and Financial Statements\n                    ending 31 December 2004. This assurance that other liabilities would be\n                    paid in priority to related debts giveninter aliato the auditors of the Group did not end on 31 December 2004. It was meant\n                    to unambiguously create an expectation that all debts owed to unrelated\n                    creditors would be paid in priority to related debts. Despite this solemn\n                    assurance, the sum of $10,987,960.85 was paid to the respondent on\n                    4 February 2005. 44     The Judge appeared to have vaguely hinted that\n                    the misrepresentations might have been fraudulent but was ultimately content to\n                    find that there was negligence and recklessness on the part of Lee Ee and\n                    PEPL’s directors. It appears to us clear that when the Subordination\n                    Statement and Note 13 were issued on 23 February 2005, the relevant\n                    directors ought to have been aware that $10,987,960.85 had already been paid to\n                    the respondent on 4 February 2005; they were after all directors of both\n                    PEPL and the respondent (with the exception of Koh who was the director of PEPL\n                    only). Lee Ee has now begrudgingly acknowledged that he might have known that\n                    PEPL was “technically insolvent” by the end of the financial year\n                    2004, a few months before the amount was paid on 4 February\n                        2005.[note: 29]This is not the whole truth.\n                    It is surprising that even after these payments were made on 4 February\n                    2005, the directors of PEPL (despite the ample time available to them to amend\n                    its Financial Statements (inclusive of Note 13) and the Director’s\n                    Statement (inclusive of the Subordination Statement) before these were issued on\n                    23 February 2005), took no steps to correct them. In its written\n                    submissions, the respondent claims that Note 13 “was intended as a\n                    standard form statement and not meant to be legally binding”[note: 30]though it is conceded that “[t]hese\n                    statements were made in order to confirm PEPL as a going concern at the end of\n                    the financial year”.[note: 31]These\n                    are astonishing submissions as they suggest that the directors were guilty of\n                    reckless conduct, at the very least. As these statements were made to secure\n                    PELP’s status as a going concern all the directors must take collective\n                    responsibility for their contents and the glaring failure to adhere to the\n                    commitments given therein. This limp attempt to minimise responsibility for a\n                    public commitment in a statutory document must be strongly deprecated. Directors\n                    have to understand that they must take full responsibility for the accuracy and\n                    implementation of all such statements. There is no point in saying that these\n                    were pro forma statements. A failure to appreciate the consequences of not\n                    adhering to such statements can be perilous. 45     In our view, the legal significance of the\n                    assurances made in the Subordination Statement and Note 13 were not fully\n                    appreciated by the Judge. We find that the patent breaches of these assurances\n                    fortify the statutory presumption and are, in the final analysis, compelling\n                    evidence of thedesire of the common directors to prefer a\n                        related entity. When these assurances were given, Winter\n                    Engineering had already secured an arbitration award (awarded on\n                    26 November 2006) of $3.6m against PEPL. When this liability of $3.6m was\n                    factored in, PEPL was insolvent with a deficit of more than $2m as shown in its\n                    Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2004. As Winter Engineering was immediately\n                    entitled to enforce its award the risk of PEPL being placed in liquidation was\n                    very real.It was only because of those assurances that PEPL\n                        could continue trading as a going concern. Subsequent events made\n                    it plain that the directors of PEPL and the respondent never had any intention\n                    of settling the outstanding due to its unrelated creditors. The evidence is\n                    telling. Between the time PEPL’s Financial Statements and Director’s\n                    Statement were released on 23 February 2005, and when insolvency\n                    proceedings commenced on 22 January 2007, a total sum of $18,978,348.16 was\n                    transferred from PEPLto the respondent, and a\n                    total sum of $3,528,040 was transferred from PEPLto related\n                        companies in the Group.[note: 32]Yet\n                    PEPL’s two largest external creditors, Winter Engineering and Uni-Sanitary\n                    were not paid even a cent. In addition, PEPL owed a total sum of $527,336.28 to\n                    otherunrelatedcreditors (apart from Winter\n                    Engineering and Uni-Sanitary) as at 16 February 2007, the date of the\n                    winding up order.[note: 33] 46     The irresistible conclusion is that these\n                    false assurances were given to buy more time for the respondent to transfer\n                    PEPL’s monies to itself and to related creditors, including the respondent\n                        -away from the reach of PEPL’s unrelated\n                        creditors. These facts also suggest the directors of PEPL had\n                    been carrying on PEPL’s business when it was technically insolvent to the\n                    detriment of PEPL’s unrelated creditors. This can perhaps be best\n                    characterised as a case of transparent subterfuge. It raises problematic issues\n                    under s 340(1) of the Companies Act in relation to the directors’\n                    collective responsibility for this sorry state of affairs. As this particular\n                    point is not an issue immediately before us, we will say no more.",
        "Breach of director’s duties": "47     In addition to the false assurances made by\n                    PEPL’s directors, there are additional facts to fortify the statutory\n                    presumption. As will be seen below at[53],\n                    the evidence here presents an obvious situation where the directors (Lee Ee and\n                    Koh in particular) have breached their directors’ duties to consider the\n                    interests of PEPL’s creditors. Indeed, we think that whenever it is\n                    plainly established that the directors have disregarded their duties the Court\n                    should view with even greater scepticism transactions that appear to undermine\n                    the collective procedure of insolvent liquidation, such as unfair preferences or\n                    undervalue transactions. This is because the avoidance rules serve the same\n                    broad policy objectives as the directors’ duties to consider the interests\n                    of creditors when a company’s financial position severely deteriorates.\n                    Both are aimed at protecting the general body of creditors against a diminution\n                    of the assets available for distribution to creditors in the collective\n                    insolvency regime. In certain instances, the breach of the director’s duty\n                    goes hand in hand with an unfair preference transaction and may even be a basis\n                    for independent recovery from the directors if the preferred creditor is unable\n                    to repay the amount adjudged to be an undue preference. To appreciate this, a\n                    proper understanding of the duty is required. 48     It is trite that directors have a duty to act\n                    in the best interest of the company as a whole. When a company is solvent, the\n                    company’s directors owe no duty to creditors. (SeeFederal Express Pacific Inc. v Meglis Airfreight Pte Ltd (formerly known as\n                        Thong Soon Airfreight Pte Ltd) and Others[1998] SGHC 417 (“Federal\n                    Express”) at [17] where it was held that such a duty to\n                    consider creditors’ interests only arises during insolvency or in a state\n                    of near insolvency; andMultinational Gas and Petrochemical\n                        Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd[1983]\n                    Ch 258, applied inLexi Holdings plc (In Administration)\n                        v Luqman and others[2007] EWHC 2652 (Ch); also see the\n                    observations in Kala Anandarajah,Corporate Governance,\n                        Practice and Issues(Academy Publishing, 2010) at p 275.)\n                    However, it is now also settled law that when a company is insolvent, or even in\n                    a parlous financial position, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into\n                    account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for\n                    the company. This fiduciary duty requires directors to ensure that the\n                    company’s assets are not dissipated or exploited for their own benefit to\n                    the prejudice of creditors’ interests. In this regard, the purpose of this\n                    duty mirrors that of the avoidance provisions in seeking to preserve the\n                    company’s assets for distribution to the company’s creditors through\n                    the mechanism of insolvency. The House of Lords inWinkworth\n                        v Edward Baron Development Co Ltd and others[1987] 1 All\n                    ER 114 (perLord Templeman) declared at\n                    118: [A] company owes a duty to its creditors, present and future. The company\n                        is not bound to pay off every debt as soon as it is incurred, and the\n                        company is not obliged to avoid all ventures which involve an element of\n                        risk, but thecompany owes a duty to its creditors to\n                            keep its property inviolate and available for the repayment of its\n                            debts.The conscience of the company, as\n                            well as its management, is confided to its directors. A duty is owed by\n                            the directors to the company and to the creditors of the company to\n                            ensure that the affairs of the company are properly administered and\n                            that its property is not dissipated or exploited for the benefit of the\n                            directors themselves to the prejudice of the creditors. Both\n                        Mr and Mrs Wing committed a breach of their duty to the company\n                        and its creditors when £115,000 was withdrawn from the company to pay\n                        for their shares and when the company's overdraft was incurred and increased\n                        at least partly for their benefit. When Mr and Mrs Wing paid\n                        £8,600.91 to the company, their liability to the company and its\n                        creditors far exceeded that sum. These breaches of duty would not have\n                        mattered if Mr and Mrs Wing had been able to maintain the solvency\n                        of the company and to see that all its creditors were paid in full.\n                        [emphasis added] 49     The English Court of appeal decision ofWest Mercia Safetywear Ltd (in liq) v Dodd and\n                        another[1988] BCLC 250 (“West Mercia”) is particularly instructive for present\n                    purposes. In that case the plaintiff company owed its parent company more than\n                    £30,000. Mr Dodd was a director of both companies, which were both\n                    insolvent. The parent company had debts which were guaranteed by Mr Dodd.\n                    At the time when, to Mr Dodd’s knowledge, the plaintiff company was\n                    already insolvent, Mr Dodd authorised the transfer of £4,000 from the\n                    plaintiff company to the parent company so as to reduce his own personal\n                    liability under his guarantees for the parent company. The Court of Appeal found\n                    (at [33]) that by doing so, Mr Dodd had been “in\n                        fraudof the creditors of the company”; he had disregarded\n                    the interests of the creditors of the plaintiff company and had made the\n                    transfer for his sole and personal benefit.

If, as a general body, they authorise or ratify a\n                        particular action of the directors, there can be no challenge to the\n                        validity of what the directors have done. Butwhere a\n                            company is insolvent the interests of the creditors intrude.

However, Asiatic did not receive\n                    any advantage or benefit from this so-called loan, since there was no security\n                    nor any promise to pay interest obtained from Australian Sound. Furthermore,\n                    Asiatic was itself insolvent when the common directors directed the sum of\n                    $10,000 to be transferred to Australian Sound. As such, to finance the\n                    transaction, Asiatic had to borrow $10,000 from another company in the group,\n                    Estoril. This loan was fully secured by an equitable charge granted by Asiatic\n                    to Estoril. This meant that Asiatic’s unsecured creditors had been\n                    deprived of $10,000 which would have been available for distribution but for the\n                    transaction. The Court emphasised that each company in a group is a separate\n                    legal entity, and that the directors of each company had to discharge their\n                    duties with regard to the interests of the creditors of that company, without\n                    allowing such interests to be prejudiced by movement of monies between companies\n                    in a group (at 6–7): … each of the companies [in a group of companies] was a separate\n                        and independent legal entity, and that it was the duty of the directors of\n                        Asiatic [the plaintiff company] to consult its interests and its interests\n                        alone in deciding whether payments should be made to other companies. In\n                        this respect it should be emphasized that the directors of a company in\n                        discharging their duty to the company must take account of the interest of\n                        its shareholders and its creditors. Any failure by the directors to take\n                        into account the interests of creditors will have adverse consequences for\n                        the company as well as for them. The creditor of a company, whether it be a\n                        member of a \"group\" of companies in the accepted sense of that term or not,\n                        must look to that company for payment. His interests may be prejudiced by\n                        the movement of funds between companies in the event that the companies\n                        become insolvent. 51     The English and Australian approach to these\n                    issues has also been adopted by the Singapore courts. In the decision ofChip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi\n                        Mo and others[2004] 1 SLR(R) 434, the High Court\n                    correctly endorsed the basic proposition that “[w]hen a company is\n                    insolvent, the interests of creditors become the dominant factor in what\n                    constitutes ‘the benefit of the company as a whole’” (at\n                    [13]; also seeFederal Expressat\n                [17]). 52     It can be seen (at[49]above) from the observations by Street CJ inKinsela(cited with approval inWest\n                        Mercia) that the rationale for such a duty is that, when a\n                    company is insolvent, the creditors’ interests come to the fore as the\n                    company is effectively trading and running the company’s business with the\n                    creditors’ money. Because of the limited liability principle, the risks\n                    (of trading when the company is insolvent) on shareholders would be minimal as\n                    they would at worst lose only what they have already invested in the company in\n                    their capacity as shareholders. Unsecured or partially secured creditors on the\n                    other hand may never recover any monies due to them. Unlike shareholders who\n                    have the most to gain from risky ventures, unsecured creditors, in particular,\n                    have everything to lose when illegitimate risks are taken. As such, it is only\n                    right that directors ought to be accountable to creditors for the decisions they\n                    make when the company is, or perilously close to being, insolvent. We add,\n                    parenthetically, that this fiduciary duty is strictly speaking owedto the company; there isno duty owed\n                        directly to creditors. In other words, individual creditors\n                    cannot, without the assistance of liquidators, directly recover from the\n                    directors for such breaches of duty (seeYukong Line Ltd. of\n                        Korea v Rendsburg Investments Corporation of Liberia and Others\n                        (No. 2)[1998] 1 WLR 294; and more recently,Re Pantone 485 Ltd, Miller v Bain and others[2002] 1 BCLC 266 ). If creditors were allowed to recover directly, it\n                    would contravene the collective procedure of insolvency and open a back door for\n                    some of them to work around thepari passurule.\n                    Allowing creditorsandthe company to directly\n                    recover from directors might also lead to double recovery; seeD D Prentice, “Creditor’s Interests and Director’s Duties”\n                    (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 265 at 275. 53     In the present case, we find that the\n                    statutory presumption, far from being rebutted, had in fact been reinforced by\n                    PEPL’s directors’ manifest breaches of their personal\n                    directors’ duties. The transfer of $10,987,960.85 on 4 February 2005,\n                    made in direct contravention of the representations found in the Subordination\n                    Statement and Note 13, had been for the purposes of the Capital\n                    Distribution and Special Dividend payout to the respondent’s\n                        shareholders.[note: 34]It is not an unimportant consideration\n                    that Lee Ee and his wife, Koh together own 29.24% of the shareholding in the\n                        respondent.[note: 35]As such, the\n                    3rd transaction had the effect of conferring a direct benefit to Lee Ee and Kohpersonallyin their capacity as substantial\n                    shareholders of the respondent. In light of the fact that they were:\n                    (a) the ultimate beneficiaries of a substantial portion of $10,987,960.85;\n                    (b) directors of PEPL and (c) one of them (Lee Ee) was also a director\n                    of the respondent, there are grounds for a compelling inference that Lee Ee and\n                    Koh were thedirecting mindsbehind the payment of\n                    $10,987,960.85 on 4 February 2005 to the respondent. This is irrefutable\n                    evidence of the requisite desire to prefer, even without having to rely upon the\n                    statutory presumption of the desire to prefer. In essence, the directors of\n                    PEPL, especially Lee Ee and Koh, had brazenly disregarded their very own\n                    assurances (quadirectors) not to prefer (as\n                    manifested in the Subordination Statement and Note 13) or benefit\n                    themselves to the prejudice of the interests of PEPL’s unrelated\n                    creditors.",
        "Commercial reason for making the advance is in and of itself\n                insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption": "54     We have emphasised that the directors’\n                    breaches of their own assurances constitute compelling evidence of the desire of\n                    PEPL to prefer the respondent. In this regard, the 3rd transaction ought to be\n                    set aside as an unfair preference with or without the aid of the statutory\n                    presumption. Even if we did not take into consideration the broken assurances\n                    and the breaches of director’s duties on Lee Ee’s part, the\n                    respondent has, in our view, failed to discharge its burden of proof to rebut\n                    the statutory presumption. 55     The respondent stated that the advance of\n                    $16.05m to PEPL was made to take advantage of higher interest rates in\n                    PEPL’s MBB fixed deposit accounts. The respondent’s commercial\n                    reasons given to justify the advance of the loan are not apparent to us (see\n                    above at[8]). The fact that $16.05m had been\n                    advanced by the respondent to PEPL on 4 December 2004 purportedly to take\n                    advantage of higher interest rates in PEPL’s MBB fixed deposit account\n                    does not explain why the repayment of $10,987,960.85 by PEPL to the respondentwould not bean unfair preference. This is\n                    because there is nothing exceptional in a creditor lending money to take\n                    advantage of the possibility of higher returns upon repayment of the money lent.\n                    In other words, the commercial reason for making the advance (to take advantage\n                    of higher interest rates), without more, does not explain away the presumption\n                    that therepaymentof the advance was influenced\n                    by a desire to prefer the creditor. More importantly, the monies loaned were\n                    unsecured loans which could not thereafter be repaid in priority relative to\n                    other outstanding liabilities of PEPLwhen the company itself\n                        was insolvent. In any case, we are satisfied that the crucial\n                    consideration in the decision by the respondent to loan the money to PEPL was to\n                    enable PEPL’s accounts to be finalised on a going concern basis. In our\n                    view, sanction for the capital reduction of the respondent and the payment of\n                    the dividends would not have been given if the court had been apprised of the\n                    true facts.",
        "Part 2 - The presumption in relation to PEPL’s other payments\n                to the respondent and the set-off effected on 30 June 2005 has not been\n                rebutted": "56     The other payments made by PEPL to the\n                    respondent alleged to be unfair preferences were: (a)     Payments allegedly made for the\n                        salaries and expenses of the respondent’s employees on six occasions:\n                        31 January 2005, 28 February 2005, 31 March 2005,\n                        30 April 2005, 31 May 2005 and 30 June 2005. These payments\n                        amounted to $347,144.16 (see above at[27]); (b)     Payments allegedly made as reimbursement to the\n                        respondent for iron ore purchases on 21 February 2005 and 4 March\n                        2005. These payments amounted to $105,000.00, (see above at[28]). In addition, there\n                    was a set-off transaction which was alleged to be an unfair preference: (c)     The set-off was effected on\n                        30 June 2005; as a consequence a debt of $7,538,243.15 owed by PEPL to\n                        the respondent has been discharged, as this sum was set off against the sum\n                        of $9,027,964.19 owed by PPL to PEPL (see above at[29]). 57     The respondent’s position is that\n                    transactions[56](a)–(c) are not\n                    unfair preferences as there was evidence that they were part of PEPL’s\n                    settled practice. PEPL had been acting as the “payment centre” to\n                    make payments to other related companies within the Group. This, in our view, is\n                    not a valid legal reason for the payments. Just because a transaction has been\n                    earlier carried out while a company is solvent, it does not necessarily follow\n                    that the presumption that such transactions have been influenced by the\n                    requisite desire to prefer will be rebutted. There is no formulaic magic to a\n                    transaction being part of a past practice; a creditor cannot simply evade the\n                    statutory presumption by merely labelling a transaction as “past\n                    practice”. The key issue in rebutting the statutory presumption is to\n                    show that the particular transactions have not been influenced by the requisite\n                    desire to prefer the respondent. The existence of an established course of\n                    dealings, or “past practice” so to speak, is onlyrelevantif those past practices show that the creditor\n                    has beenproviding new valueby granting new\n                    credit to the company to purchase supplies and items (for example) to keep its\n                    business going. Where that is the case, payment is made not with the desire to\n                    prefer the creditor, but with the motivation to obtain fresh financing to\n                    sustain the company’s business in earnest. As observed by\n                    Professor Roy Goode inPrinciples of Corporate\n                        Insolvency Law, (Thomson Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005)\n                    at p 465: [The] fact that there is a series of mutual dealings, with debits and\n                        credits on both sides, will usually suffice to negate an intention to\n                        prefer, for it suggests either that a payment into the account was made in\n                        the expectation that further drawings would be allowed or that the bank\n                        allowed a further drawing on the understanding that it would be covered by a\n                        further payment into the account. In either case there is no intention to\n                        prefer, or indeed, a true preference at all. Indeed, it has been said that\n                        the real question is … the intention that payments into the account\n                        will generate future supplies of goods, services or credit.Accordingly … even payments made to discharge specific\n                            debit items will qualify for the application of the principle if the\n                            intention is that they should form part of a continuing relationship\n                            involving the extension of further credit. [emphasis\n                        added] 58     Here, we note that the Judge mistakenly\n                    assumed that the presumption for these transactions was\n                    “automatically” rebutted as they were part of a “past\n                    practice”, see GD at [76]–[78]: 76    ... I noted that [PEPL] did in the past apply some\n                            inter-company set-offs … 77    While it is not normal for a set-off of this extent\n                            to be done, the liquidators did not dispute that there were times when\n                            some set-offs were done. 78    As for the payments to CPF and for bonuses and\n                            reimbursements of petty cash, I was satisfied that these were part of\n                            [PEPL] practice. Likewise, for [PEPL] reimbursement to the [respondent]\n                            for the [respondent] earlier payment for the [PEPL’S] iron ore\n                            purchases. 59     The Judge,without\n                        elaboration, had earlier approvingly referred to the decision ofRe Libra Industries Pte Ltd[1999]\n                    3 SLR(R) 205 at [49] (‘Re\n                    Libra’) at [70] of the GD: I accept that there was anestablishedpractice for Libra Industries to make payments into the account with Libra\n                        Holding without reference to specific invoices, and that the payments listed\n                        in the table were made in accordance with that practice. [emphasis\n                        added] 60     We note that the Court inERC Land Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ho Wing On Christopher and\n                        others[2004] 1 SLR(R) 105 at [48] has similarly\n                    referred to the decision ofRe Libra, without\n                        elaborationfor the same proposition that “an established\n                    past practice of payments would indicate that there was no desire” to\n                    prefer the creditor. As mentioned earlier (in[57]), the existence of an established past practice of a\n                    particular type of transaction does not mean that the statutory presumption willipso factobe rebutted. Indeed, there was\n                    something more than amereestablished past\n                    practice inRe Libra: the court inRe Librafound an established course of dealing where\n                    Libra Holdings (the creditor) extended credit to Libra Industries (the company)\n                    by paying first the salaries of the employees of Libra Industries and by\n                    financing Libra Industries’ purchase of raw materials from third party\n                    suppliers. Libra Industries would in turnrepay sums\n                        owedto Libra Holdings so that the latter couldprovide new value, by extending further credit to Libra\n                    Industries. The practice of repayment of loans hadcontinued\n                        with the extension of new credit; see the succinct summary of\n                    facts by Kan Tin Chiu J inRe Libraat\n                    [46]: [T]hey were payments for moneys owing by Libra Industries to Libra\n                        Holdings for, inter alia, sale of the raw materials by Libra Holdings to\n                        Libra Industries which raw materials were purchased from third party\n                        suppliers pursuant to Libra Industries’ request for salaries paid by\n                        Libra Holdings to Libra Industries’ staff. In short, Libra Holdings\n                        and Libra Industries maintained a running account whereby payments or\n                        purchases on behalf of Libra Industries would be recorded as a debit entry\n                        against Libra Industries whilst payments received from or goods purchased\n                        from Libra Industries would be credited to Libra Industries … Since 1995, Libra Holdings had been providing Libra Industries with\n                        financial support or assistance in that it would provide Libra Industries\n                        credit or make various payments of Libra Industries’ staff salaries\n                        and CPF contributions and purchased the raw materials required by Libra\n                        Industries. 61     The reasoning inRe\n                        Librais entirely consistent with Goode’s view in[57]that where the company made repayments of\n                    loans with theintentionof obtaining new credit\n                    to supply its own business operations, these repayments would not be considered\n                    as preferential payments. 62     The present case is very different from the\n                    scenarios described above. This is not a case where PEPL repaid loans to the\n                    respondent, in the expectation that the respondent would provide new credit to\n                    PEPL to finance the running of PEPL’s business. If that were the case, it\n                    could be argued that PEPL made the payments to the respondent not with the\n                    desire to prefer the respondent, but with the genuine intention to obtain new\n                    credit required for the running of its business. Here, the respondent’s\n                    employees’ salaries were paid by PEPL. This payment of monies was made\n                    after technical insolvency had set in. The payments constituted “one way\n                    traffic”, in some senses: the respondent did not provide new value nor\n                    did they extend new credit throughout the history of PEPL’s payments. As\n                    for the respondent’s claim that PEPL’s payments to the respondent on\n                    21 February 2005 and 4 March 2005 were based on the past practice ofreimbursementsto the respondent for iron ore\n                    purchases paid by the respondent for and on behalf of PEPL, the\n                    respondent’s best case would be that PEPL made the payments not with the\n                    desire to prefer, but with the intention to obtain fresh financing for iron ore\n                    purchases. However, the respondent did not substantiate this claim with\n                    documentary evidence. It could have easily adduced invoices of iron ore\n                    purchases that it claimed to have paid for on behalf of PEPL, but failed to do\n                    so. 63     As regards the set-off transaction\n                    (transaction (c) at[56]above), it clearly\n                    constitutes an unfair preference even without the aid of the statutory\n                    presumption. The set-off placed the respondent in a better position in the event\n                    of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the transaction had not\n                    been done; the debts that had been set off on 30 June 2005 could not have\n                    been set off in PEPL’s insolvent liquidation because of the lack of\n                    mutuality. The set-off transaction employed an asset (PEPL’schose in actionagainst PPL) that could have been\n                    distributed to PEPL’s unsecured creditors (PEPL’s claim against PPL\n                    for the debt owed) to discharge PEPL’s debt owed to the respondent, thus\n                    giving PPL an advantage over the other creditors and at the same time depriving\n                    those same creditors of an asset that could have been used for distribution in\n                    PEPL’s insolvent liquidation. The only inference to be drawn from the\n                    discharge of the debt owed to the respondent,without any\n                        extension of new credit to PEPL, would be that PEPL intended to\n                    prefer the respondent and PPL. 64     Furthermore, there is no evidence that the\n                    respondent had extended new credit to PEPL subsequent to this discharge of\n                    PEPL’s indebtedness. It would have been different ifthe respondent had granted new credit to PEPL subsequentto the\n                    discharge of PEPL’s indebtedness so that PEPL could use the new credit to\n                    finance its business operations. If that was the position, it could be argued\n                    that the discharge was made with the intention to sustain PEPL’s business.\n                    In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the presumption remains\n                    unrebutted. 65     In any case, there is no satisfactory\n                    objective evidence of an established past practice of similar payments. Although\n                    the respondent adduced several debits notes which shows the recorded\n                    transactions of payments made by PEPL to the respondent[note: 36], these were simple internal documents that\n                    could be prepared by simply making repetitive adjustments on a standard template\n                    on a computer. The respondent ought to have adduced records of invoices from therespondentitself - this it failed to do. With\n                    regard to the set-off transaction effected on 30 June 2005, the respondent\n                    adduced the “Schedule of Inter-Company Contra Involving 3\n                        Companies”[note: 37]which showed tripartite set-off\n                    arrangements made between related companies of the Group for December 2002;\n                    June, September and December 2003; and June and December 2004. However, no\n                    documents adduced were for the transaction that really mattered, that is, for\n                    June 2005. In any event, we have examined the Schedules of those adduced (from\n                    2002 to 2004) and it is pertinent to note that there is no evidence of any\n                    tripartite set-offs between PEPL, PPL, and the respondent evidenced in these\n                    Schedules. 66     We should also point out that as at\n                    25 May 2005, when Uni-Sanitary obtained its arbitration award of\n                    $628,791.75, PEPL’S directors, despite having two substantial unsatisfied\n                    arbitration awards, had no reservations about discharging the remaining\n                    “debt” of more than $7.5m to the respondent soon after (see above\n                    at[3]). The debt of $18,514,288 due to the\n                    respondent as at 31 December 2004 (see above at[21]) was completely discharged by the end of June 2005. PEPL,\n                    however, did not pay its debts to its largest unrelated creditors. When it was\n                    eventually wound up its total debts amounted to $5,861,218.91. Of this, slightly\n                    over $1m was due to the respondent. The remaining amount was due to seven\n                    unrelated creditors (including Winter Engineering and\n                Uni-Sanitary). 67     There is one final argument that we should\n                    deal with. The respondent, relying on an observation by the Judge (made without\n                    the benefit of hearing arguments), maintained that the set-off effected on\n                    30 June 2005 should not be set aside because PPL was not a party to the\n                    action. In our view, there isno requirementfor\n                    PPL to be made a party to these proceedings. As stated clearly in\n                        s 99(3)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, the\n                    claim for unfair preferences applies only againstcreditors: For the purposes of this section and sections 100 and\n                        102, an individual gives an unfair preference to a person if — (a)    that person is\n                                one of the individual’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for\n                                any of his debts or other liabilities ... 68     PPL was in the position of adebtorwho owed PEPL the sum of $9,027,964.19. There is\n                    no claim of unfair preference against PPL. It was for the respondents to make\n                    PPL a party if they desired to be indemnified by it.",
        "Conclusion": "69     For the reasons given above, we allow the\n                    appeal. The payment of $10,987,960.85 made on 4 February 2005 is set aside.\n                    In addition, transactions[56](a) and\n                    (b) above which involved the sums of $347,144.16 and $105,000.00 respectively\n                    are set aside. Transaction[56](c) is\n                    declared void such that the debt of $7,538,243.15 owed by PEPL to the respondent\n                    continues to subsist. The full amount involved for the 3rd transaction and the\n                    other transactions is $18,987,348.16. However, since the amount of debt owed by\n                    PEPL to respondent is the sum of $18,514,287.97, the liquidator’s claim\n                    for undue preference of a debt is necessarily limited to that amount\n                        only[note: 38](this was also reflected in the\n                    claim stipulated in Originating Summons No 1433 of 2008[note: 39]).\n                    Accordingly, the respondent is ordered to repay to the liquidators all monies\n                    required to settle debts to unrelated creditors (as well as professional fees)\n                    up to the sum of $18,514,287.97. 70     The liquidators are entitled to the costs of\n                    this appeal and the hearing below on an indemnity basis. In view of the\n                    egregious misrepresentations made by Lee Ee to the court to obtain its approval\n                    for the capital reduction of the respondent, and the flagrant breaches of the\n                    assurances given in the Financial Statements and the Director’s Statement\n                    (for which he must take primary responsibility), we order him to personally bear\n                    the costs of the proceedings here and below. While we have not made any costs\n                    orders against the other directors of the respondent and PEPL, we are\n                    constrained to observe that they have clearly not properly discharged their\n                    obligations of care and oversight as directors in relying on the actions and\n                    decisions of Lee Ee. The troubling sequence of improper fund transfers to\n                    related entities and the payment of the dividends (procured through false\n                    assurances of solvency) at the expense of legitimate external creditors\n                    reflected the lack of proper corporate governance within the Progen\n                    Group.
