        "The charge": "2 The charge against Yeo reads as follows:-You, Yeo Kang Oh, are charged that you on or about the 27thday of\n\n  January 2001, at about 6:10 p.m., at Blk 9, Toa Payoh Lorong 7 #04-327, Singapore (the Toa\n\n  Payoh flat), did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule\n\n  to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of\n\n  trafficking, 25.55 grams of diamorphine, without having any authorisation under the said Act or\n\n  the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a)\n\n  read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and punishable under section 33 of\n\n  the aforesaid Act.",
        "The prosecutions case": "3 The prosecution presented the following facts. About two months prior to Yeos\n\narrest, he met Tan Jek Cheng (Tan). The pair were friends who shared a common interest in\n\nabusing heroin. At that time, Yeo needed a place to stay because he was trying to hide from law\n\nenforcement officers as he had skipped a scheduled urine test with the police. Tan owned the Toa\n\nPayoh flat and he offered Yeo accommodation in one of the rooms of the flat. Tan himself stayed in\n\nthe utility room. The pair smoked heroin together in the utility room, using drugs and equipment\n\nsupplied by Yeo.4 Yeo wanted to traffic in heroin to maintain his addiction. On 26 January 2001,\n\nhe went to Woodlands Central to meet a drugs supplier called Xiao Tee. He bought one pound of heroin\n\nfrom this person, with the intention to traffic in it. Subsequently, Yeo returned to the Toa Payoh\n\nflat and hid the heroin in his own room. He did not tell Tan about his purchase.5 The next day, Yeo returned to Woodlands to pay Xiao Tee for the drugs. This\n\ntime Tan drove him there in a van, bearing registration number GQ 2429 L. Yeo paid for the rental of\n\nthis van for the Chinese New Year period to avoid the inconvenience of hiring a cab during the\n\nfestive season. Tan was told that Yeo was meeting a friend but did not know who this friend was or\n\nthe purpose of the meeting. Tan waited in the car park for Yeo while he met Xiao Tee. After Yeo paid\n\nXiao Tee, he returned to the van and the pair drove off. They had lunch and proceeded to Yeos own\n\nflat in Jalan Membina. At about 5 p.m., they left the flat and returned to the Toa Payoh flat.6 When they reached the car park adjourning the Toa Payoh flat, Yeo told Tan to\n\ngo back to Jalan Membina to pick up his wife, See Han Kook (See) and his grandson. Tan\n\ncomplied and left the car park without going up to his flat. After they parted, Yeo went up to the\n\nflat and transferred the drugs that he hid in his room to the utility room. He started re-packing\n\nthe drugs into empty sachets for sale in the utility room because he did not want See to find out\n\nabout his drug trafficking activities and was afraid that she would discover his secret if he packed\n\nthem in his own room.7 Meanwhile, Tan picked up See and her grandson from Jalan Membina. They were\n\ntravelling in the van when a party of CNB officers stopped them at the junction of Lorong 6 and 7,\n\nToa Payoh. The officers arrested Tan and See, on the suspicion that they were trafficking in heroin.\n\nSome heroin was found in the van. Tan admitted that he owned them and that they were for his\n\npersonal consumption. The officers also ascertained Tans address and obtained the keys to his\n\nflat from him. Subsequently, they proceeded to raid his flat.8 On reaching the Toa Payoh flat, the officers tried to gain access to it using\n\nTans keys. Yeo was still in the flat and when he discovered that some officers were about to\n\nenter the flat, he armed himself with a chopper in each of his hands. He threatened the officers\n\nwith the choppers and caused them to back off. He then went to the kitchen and discovered that there\n\nwere more officers stationed at the bottom of the block. He re-entered the living room but retreated\n\nto the kitchen again. He went to the kitchen window and jumped down, falling four storeys. He\n\nintended to kill himself as he realised the seriousness of being caught with the drugs in the\n\nutility room.9 After Yeo jumped down, the officers entered the flat and found some drugs on\n\nthe floor of the utility room. They also found a straw of heroin in the kitchen and some drug\n\nparaphernalia in the utility room. The officers secured the premises and handed it over to the\n\nInvestigating Officer, ASP Daniel Tan. ASP Tan brought the drugs recovered from the flat to the\n\nDepartment of Scientific Services for analysis. Subsequently, he received from them eight reports\n\npertaining to the drugs found in the utility room, which revealed that the drugs found in the\n\nutility room were 25.55 grams of diamorphine.10 The prosecution relied largely on four statements that Yeo made after his\n\narrest. Yeo did not challenge the admissibility of these statements. In particular, in his cautioned\n\nstatement, he admitted to the ownership ofall25.55 grams of diamorphine found in the\n\nutility room and exonerated See and Tan completely. His other statements also did not implicate\n\neither of them. They explained, among other things, that he owned the drugs for the purposes of\n\ntrafficking in them.",
        "The defences case": "11 Yeos defence was that he was not guilty of trafficking in all 25.55 grams\n\nof heroin as he only owned half of the drugs in the utility room while Tan owned the other half.\n\nFurthermore, Yeo said that he intended to traffic in only half of his own share and use the rest for\n\npersonal consumption. His counsel argued that he should only be liable for the trafficking of one\n\nquarter of the heroin found in the utility room.12 Yeos version of the facts was as follows. On 26 January 2001, he and Tan\n\nwent to Woodlands to collect drugs. He placed the drugs in the utility room with Tans knowledge.\n\nThe next morning, Tan bought empty sachets to contain the drugs for trafficking. At about 12 p.m.,\n\nboth of them returned to Woodlands together and while Tan waited in the van for him, he went to pay\n\nXiao Tee for the drugs. Tan contributed $1,000 and Yeo raised the other $4,200 required to pay for\n\nthe drugs. Both of them had an agreement to split the pound of heroin equally. Yeo was willing to\n\nlet Tan have a half share on credit, although he only paid $1,000 initially. Tan agreed to pay for\n\nthe rest of his share in the drugs in instalments.13 After paying for the drugs, the pair went for lunch and proceeded to the Jalan\n\nMembina flat. They returned to the Toa Payoh flat at around 3-4 p.m and spent some time there\n\ntogether. Tan only left the flat at about 5 p.m. to fetch See and her grandson.14 This version of the facts contradicted his own statements to the CNB in two\n\nmaterial areas. First, that Tan owned a half share in the drugs pursuant to an agreement the pair\n\nhad made and was aware of all the arrangements that were made in relation to their purchase.\n\nSecondly, that Tan returned to his flat on 27 January before picking up See.15 Yeo accepted that his statements were admissible. However, he explained that,\n\nalthough he made them without threat, inducement or promise, they contained falsehoods. With respect\n\nto the discrepancies as to Tans involvement and ownership of the drugs, he explained that he lied\n\nbecause he wanted to ensure that his wife would not be implicated for drug trafficking. He believed\n\nthat See would be released if he admitted to the sole ownership of the drugs in the utility room and\n\nTan admitted to the ownership of the drugs in the van. With respect to the discrepancies as to\n\nwhether Tan was in the flat with him on 27 January, he explained that he forgot to mention this to\n\nthe investigating officer as he was too nervous at the time.",
        "The decision below": "16 Kan J held that the prosecution had proven the charge against Yeo beyond\n\nreasonable doubt. The judge rejected Yeos defence primarily because he had admitted fully to the\n\ncharge in the clearest terms in his statements to the CNB and he did not challenge the admissibility\n\nof these statements at trial.17 The judge gave full weight to the statements as he believed that the\n\nstatements contained the truth. He gave two reasons for rejecting Yeos contention that he lied in\n\nthe statements about the ownership of the drugs to exonerate his wife. First, it was unnecessary for\n\nYeo to lie about the ownership of the drugs in the flat for fear that See may be implicated by Tan\n\nfor the drugs in the van. Yeo admitted that during the course of investigations and the recording of\n\nhis statements, he had been told that See had been absolved of any liability for the drugs in the\n\nvan since Tan had already admitted to the sole ownership of those drugs. Secondly, it was equally\n\nunnecessary for Yeo to claim sole ownership of the drugs in the flat to exonerate his wife of any\n\nliability for the drugs in the flat. Implicating Tan was in no way inconsistent with Sees\n\ninnocence. The judge also noted that during the course of investigations, Yeo had many opportunities\n\nto implicate Tan, if he were really responsible for half of the drugs, but failed to do so.18 In addition, Kan J found that Yeos argument that he only owned half of the\n\ndrugs could not be sustained because his counsel did not put it to Tan that he had made arrangement\n\nwith Yeo to take the drugs on credit and pay for them in instalments. The judge also disbelieved Yeos\n\ncontention that Tan knew about the drugs in the utility room because he went up to his flat with Yeo\n\non 27 January 2001. He did not believe that Yeo could forget to mention such an important fact in\n\nhis statements simply because he forgot.19 The judge also rejected Yeos contention that he intended to traffic in only\n\nhalf of his own share, leaving the rest for personal consumption. This was because such a contention\n\nwas inconsistent with his statement to the CNB where he claimed that he bought the drugs to traffic\n\nin them. Furthermore, his testimony on his consumption rate varied substantially. The judge\n\nconcluded that, even if some of the drugs were for personal consumption, they were principally for\n\ntrafficking.",
        "The appeal": "20 The grounds of appeal were substantially the same as those canvassed at the\n\ntrial below. There were two main issues. First, whether Yeo lied in his statements to the CNB about\n\nthe ownership of the drugs. Secondly, whether the judge erred in failing to properly consider the\n\nevidence which supports Yeos defence that Tan owned half of the drugs. Yeo did not appeal against\n\nthe judges finding that the defence of consumption was not made out.21 The issues raised in this appeal solely revolved around questions of fact\n\nwhich were more appropriately decided by the trial judge. The principles governing an appellate\n\ncourts decision to overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge are clear. InPP v Ng Ai\n\nTiong[2000] 1 SLR 454, Yong Pung How CJ set out the following:It is trite law that an appellate court will generally be reluctant to overturn\n\n  the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they turn on the trial judge`s assessment of\n\n  the credibility and veracity of witnesses.Thus, we would dismiss this appeal unless Yeo showed that the judges findings\n\nwereclearly wrong. (see alsoYap Giau Beng Terence v PP[1998] 3 SLR 656andTan\n\nHung Yeoh v PP[1999] 3 SLR 93).The veracity of the statements made at the CNB22 Yeo did not address the reasons given by the trial judge for rejecting his\n\ncontention that he incriminated himself in the statements to exonerate his wife. He merely\n\nreiterated that the \"onlything he could do to completely shield his wife from\n\nprosecution would be to admit to sole possession of the drugs in the flat\". No reason was given\n\nas to why incriminating Tan would not achieve the same result of exonerating the wife.23 There was no evidence that the trial judge was clearly wrong in his finding\n\nthat the statements that Yeo gave the investigating officer contained the truth regarding the\n\nownership of the drugs. On the contrary, this finding was amply supported by the two reasons given\n\nby the judge. First, See would also not be implicated for the drugs in the van if Tan was implicated\n\nfor the drugs in the flat. Yeo admitted that he had already been told, during the course of\n\ninvestigations, that Tan had admitted to the ownership of the drugs in the van and absolved See.\n\nSecondly, it was unnecessary for Yeo to admit to the sole ownership of the drugs to shield See since\n\nincriminating Tan only would still exonerate See from the drugs in the flat.24 Furthermore, Yeo also admitted that there was no prior arrangement between Tan\n\nand himself that, if he were to take the blame for the drugs in the flat, Tan would exonerate See\n\nfor the drugs in the van. We did not believe that Yeo would falsely incriminate himself of a capital\n\noffence and completely exonerate Tan when he knew or should have known that implicating Tan would\n\nnot have any effect on Sees liability for the drugs in the van and the flat.Analysis of the evidence that Yeo relies on25 Yeo contended that the judge should have drawn the inference that Tan had an\n\n\"active share\" in his drug trafficking activities based on the following facts that he\n\npresented. First, Tan was a heroin addict who was in need of money to support his addiction.\n\nSecondly, Tan owned the digital weighing scale needed for packing the drugs for trafficking.\n\nThirdly, Tan allowed him to stay in the Toa Payoh flat, even though Tan knew that he was involved in\n\ndrug trafficking. Lastly, Tan participated in obtaining the drugs by driving Yeo to Woodlands to pay\n\nfor the drugs, in a van rented in his name.26 Throughout the appeal, Yeos counsel merely contended that Tan had an\n\n\"active share\" in the drugs but did not quantify the share which Tan allegedly owns. Such\n\na failure to establish the quantity of drugs owned by Tan, and thus, Yeo, was determinative of this\n\nappeal as no reasonable doubts were raised as to whether Yeo owned not more than 15 grams of\n\ndiamorphine and thus was innocent of the charge against him. In any event, the trial judge found\n\nthat Yeo never made an agreement to share the drugs equally with Tan and the records did not show\n\nthat the trial judge was clearly wrong in this finding.27 The conclusion that we drew in the previous paragraph was sufficient to\n\ndismiss this appeal. However, we went on to consider whether Yeos contention that Tan had an\n\n\"active share\" in the drugs was made out. We concluded that this contention should also be\n\nrejected. During the course of the trial, only one of the four alleged facts that Yeo relied on to\n\nmake out his contention that Tan had a share in the drugs was established. This established fact was\n\nthat Tan was a heroin addict and he was in financial difficulties. However, this was not, of itself,\n\nsufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecutions case.28 In the trial below, it was not put to Tan that he owned the digital weighing\n\nscale needed for the packing of the drugs for trafficking. In fact, no questions were asked of Tan\n\nby defence counsel relating to the ownership of such a scale. Thus, this allegation had not been\n\nverified and could not be used in support of Yeos case.29 Yeos counsel also did not establish that Tan knew of Yeos drug\n\ntrafficking activities. No questions were asked as to whether Tan was aware that Yeo trafficked in\n\ndrugs in general. As for the present instance of drug trafficking, i.e. that Yeo bought a pound of\n\nheroin to traffic in and stored it in the flat, Tan testified that he did not know about it. In\n\naddition, he testified that, although he knew that Yeo had a ready source of drugs, he did not know\n\nanything about this source as he did not want to question Yeo on it for fear of being thought to be\n\nan informant.30 Tan also denied that he knew about and participated in the procurement of the\n\ndrugs by sending Yeo to Woodlands Central. He testified that he only knew that Yeo wanted to go to\n\nWoodlands to meet a friend. He was not told and did not ask Yeo who the friend was and the purpose\n\nof the meeting. He did not see who Yeos friend was either because he was waiting for Yeo in the\n\ncar park while the latter went to meet Xiao Tee.31 Tan withstood cross-examination on all the points mentioned in the preceding\n\ntwo paragraphs and thus his testimony that he did not have a share in the drugs was accepted by the\n\ntrial judge. On the other hand, Yeo did not provide reasonable explanations as to the\n\ninconsistencies between his oral testimony and his statements to the CNB. The trial judge accepted\n\nthe veracity of the latter and rejected Yeos oral testimony as to Tans knowledge and\n\nparticipation in Yeos drug trafficking activities. There was no evidence to show that the trial\n\njudge was clearly wrong in preferring Tans testimony in court to Yeos and concluding that Tan\n\ndid not have an active share in the drugs.",
        "Conclusion": "32 In the light of our findings above, we found that the trial judge rightly\n\nconvicted Yeo of the offence as charged. We therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction and\n\nsentence.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWL P TheanCHAO HICK TINChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
