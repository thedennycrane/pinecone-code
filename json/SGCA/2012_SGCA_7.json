        "The parties": "3       The Appellant, SAAG Oilfield Engineering (S) Pte\n                    Ltd (“SAAG Singapore”), was formerly known as Derrick Services\n                    Singapore Pte Ltd (“Derrick”) until Derrick was rehabilitated and\n                    taken over by SAAG Singapore pursuant to the Scheme. 4       The first respondent in CA 55/2011, Shaik\n                    Abu Bakar bin Abdul Sukol (“Shaik”), and the respondent in\n                    CA 56/2011, Azman bin Kamis (“Azman”), were workmen employed\n                    by Derrick. They sustained injuries in the course of their employment, and\n                    commenced common law tort actions against Derrick and/or SAAG Singapore. The\n                    second respondent in CA 55/2011 had no role in the appeal.",
        "Background to the dispute": "5       The relevant facts giving rise to the claims by\n                    the Respondents were not in dispute and may be shortly stated. The Respondents suffered injuries and lodged statutory compensation\n                claims 6       On 14 August 2007, Azman suffered an injury\n                    due to an industrial accident. On 4 February 2008, Shaik also suffered\n                    injuries due to an industrial accident. 7       Both the Respondents lodged statutory claims for\n                    workmen’s compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act\n                    (Cap 354, 1998 Rev Ed) (“WCA”). Shaik’s WCA claim\n                    was lodged on or around 11 February 2008, while Azman’s WCA claim was\n                    lodged on 7 April 2008. Derrick entered provisional liquidation 8       On 24 March 2008, Derrick entered\n                    provisional liquidation. The efforts of the provisional liquidator,\n                    M/s Ferrier Hodgson, resulted in the securing of SAAG Singapore as a\n                    “white knight” investor prepared to save Derrick from liquidation\n                    by acquiring control of Derrick pursuant to an investment agreement conditional\n                    upon creditor approval of the Scheme. 9       The material terms of the Scheme for present\n                    purposes were as follows:[note: 1] 1.Definitions 1.1In this Scheme, except where\n                            the context or subject matter otherwise indicates or requires, the\n                            following expressions shall have the meaning set out opposite or\n                            following the expressions respectively: Actmeans the Companies Act\n                            (Cap. 50, 2006 Rev.

emphasis added in italics] The Scheme 10     Pursuant to s 210(1) of the Companies Act\n                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), on 24 June 2008, Belinda Ang Saw\n                    Ean J (“Belinda Ang J”) ordered that a meeting of\n                    “Scheme Creditors” (as defined in cl 1.1 of the Scheme) be\n                    held on 25 July 2008. Notice of the meeting was accordingly sent to all\n                    Scheme Creditors (in accordance with s 211 of the Companies Act). Azman\n                    allegedly did not receive such notice, nor did he see the notice of the meeting\n                    advertised inThe Straits Times. In contrast,\n                    Shaik did receive notice of the meeting or was otherwise aware of the\n                    Scheme. 11     On 25 July 2008, the meeting of the\n                    Scheme Creditors unanimously approved the Scheme, but neither of the Respondents\n                    was present at or participated in the meeting. 12     In accordance with ss 210(3) and 210(4)\n                    of the Companies Act, Belinda Ang J approved the Scheme on 25 August\n                    2008, and the court order approving the Scheme was lodged with the Accounting\n                    and Corporate Regulatory Authority the following day. The Respondents did not participate in the Scheme 13     On 27 August 2008, Shaik was notified\n                    that the Scheme had been approved and that he was to file a proof of\n                    debt. 14     On 20 October 2008, the Ministry of\n                    Manpower (“the MOM”) notified Shaik that it had assessed his WCA\n                    compensation at $29,400, but Derrick’s insurance company objected to this\n                    assessment (as did Shaik himself). 15     By 22 October 2008 (the deadline provided\n                    by the Scheme for Scheme Creditors to submit proofs of debt to be dealt with\n                    under the Scheme), neither of the Respondents had submitted any proof of debt,\n                    and, thereafter, neither of them participated in or received payments under the\n                    Scheme, which was terminated as per its terms on 4 May 2009. The Respondents commenced common law actions 16     On 8 April 2009, Shaik gave notice to the\n                    MOM of his intention to withdraw or suspend his WCA claim and proceed with a\n                    common law claim in tort. He filed a writ (viz,\n                    the writ for S 717/2009) against Derrick (subsequently amended to SAAG\n                    Singapore) on 20 August 2009. 17     Likewise, on 15 March 2010, Azman gave\n                    notice to the MOM of his intention to withdraw or suspend his WCA claim and\n                    proceed with a common law claim in tort. He filed a writ (viz, the writ for S 183/2010) against SAAG Singapore on\n                    16 March 2010. 18     It was common ground that Derrick (and SAAG\n                    Singapore) was at all material times covered by a valid insurance policy in\n                    respect of the Respondents’ claims, whether under the WCA or at common\n                    law.",
        "The decision below": "19     In determining the question of law set out\n                        at[1]above (“the O 14\n                    r 12 question”), the Judge first identified (at[20]–[25] of the GD) the purpose of s 210 of the Companies Act\n                    as explained by this court inThe Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v\n                        Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd[2008] 3 SLR(R) 121\n                        (“The Oriental Insurance\n                    Co”). 20     The Judge next considered whether the\n                    Respondents were “creditors” within the meaning of s 210(3)\n                    of the Companies Act (see [26]–[31] of the\n                    GD). At one point (viz, [29] of the GD) the Judge stated that it was\n                    not necessary for him to decide whether unliquidated tort claimants such as the\n                    Respondents were “creditors” within the meaning of s 210(3).\n                    Subsequently, however, he appeared to conclude (at [30]–[31] of the GD) that the Respondents were not\n                    “creditors”. The main consideration which seemed to have swayed\n                    the Judge’s mind in this regard was the fact that the Respondents’\n                    unliquidated claims in tort were covered by insurance, and, thus, if the\n                    Appellant were held to be liable, that liability would be met by its insurer and\n                    would not affect the coffers of the Appellant. The Judge then considered whether\n                    the Respondents were “Scheme Creditors” within the meaning of that\n                    term as defined by the Scheme, and held that they were not (see [33] of the GD). In so holding, he was again\n                    influenced by the fact that any tortious liability of the Appellant to the\n                    Respondents would effectively be borne by the Appellant’s insurer. He also\n                    held (at [37] of the GD), however,\n                    that even if the Respondents were to be considered “Scheme\n                    Creditors”, they were nonetheless not bound by the Scheme because they\n                    had not received consideration for it. 21     In short, therefore, the Judge held that a\n                    scheme of arrangement carried out in compliance with ss 210–212 of\n                    the Companies Act was not binding on tort claimants (whose claims would\n                    necessarily be for unliquidated sums) who did not participate in the scheme and\n                    whose claims were covered by a valid policy of insurance, with the result that\n                    such claimants could commence and maintain common law tort actions against the\n                    company in question notwithstanding the completion of the scheme. 22     The Appellant was dissatisfied with this\n                    result and appealed.",
        "The issues before this court": "23     The issues before us on appeal were: (a)     whether the Respondents were\n                        “creditors” within the meaning of s 210 of the Companies\n                        Act; (b)     whether\n                        the Respondents were “Scheme Creditors” within the meaning of\n                        that term as defined in the Scheme; and (c)     whether the Respondents were therefore bound by\n                        the Scheme. 24     In addition, we also gave consideration to a\n                    number of other issues which had not been squarely raised by the parties, but\n                    which were also material to our decision.",
        "Our analysis": "25     In the GD, the Judge made a number of\n                    prefatory comments regarding the purpose of s 210 of the Companies Act, and\n                        at [23], he said: The courts have given effect to the underlying legislative policy of the\n                        antecedents of s 210 of the Companies Act by holding that such creditor\n                        and court approved schemes of compromise or arrangement bind all creditors.\n                        I should underscore that what binds the creditors is the compromise or\n                        arrangement set out in the scheme. A compromise or arrangement ordinarily\n                        means a variation by way of restructuring and/or rescheduling of the\n                        company’s debts owed to creditors.The question\n                            here is whether a scheme has the effect in law of unilaterallyextinguishingan insured claim in totality, quite apart from compromising it.\n                            A careful reading of s 210 of the Companies Actand the\n                        underlying legislative policy set out in the cases cited above,reveals nothing which supports the proposition that s 210\n                            of the Companies Act by its terms confers a statutory result that the\n                            scheme extinguishes an insured claim against a company, after the\n                            completion and termination of a scheme. Debts or claims can\n                        ordinarily only becompromisedto the extent\n                        provided and performed by the company as set out in the schemevis-à-viseach individual creditor or claimant.\n                        [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold] With respect, in our opinion, the portions in bold in the above\n                    quotation reveal that the Judge asked the wrong question and therefore\n                    misdirected himself. He drew a distinction between thecompromiseof a claim or debt and itsextinction, and was of the view that s 210 of the Companies\n                    Act only encompassed the former but not the latter. However, this was a false\n                    dichotomy: as the Judge himself noted in the same paragraph, what binds the\n                    creditors of a company is the compromise or arrangement set out in a scheme of\n                    arrangement, and, therefore, the extent to which a claim against or a debt owed\n                    by the company is compromised obviously depends on the terms of the scheme\n                    itself. If the terms of the scheme dictate it, there is nothing at all\n                    objectionable in concluding that it results in the extinction of claims against\n                    or debts owed by the company. As will be seen, this false premise coloured the\n                    Judge’s approach and affected his conclusions.",
        "Whether the Respondents were “creditors” within the\n                meaning of s 210 of the Companies Act": "26     If the Respondents were not\n                    “creditors” within the meaning of s 210 of the Companies Act,\n                    then there could be no question of the Respondents being bound by the Scheme,\n                    and there would be no need for any further inquiry. In every sense, this was a\n                    threshold question, and unless it was answered in the affirmative, there would\n                    be nothing more to be considered and it would, in turn, also provide the answer\n                    to the O 14 r 12 question. 27     The approaches taken by the courts in England\n                    and Australia as to the proper interpretation of the term\n                    “creditor” in their respective companies legislation, upon which\n                    our Companies Act is modelled, are not uniform. The English cases 28     The English cases adopt a very broad approach\n                    to the term “creditors”, an approach which can be traced back toIn re Midland Coal, Coke, and Iron Company[1895] 1 Ch 267 (“Re Midland\n                    Coal”). In that case, a lessee of certain mines assigned his\n                    leases to a company, which covenanted to indemnify him against the future rents,\n                    royalties and liabilities thereunder. After the company went into liquidation, a\n                    scheme of arrangement under s 2 of the Joint Stock Companies Arrangement\n                    Act 1870 (c 104) (UK) (“the 1870 Act”) was approved by the\n                    court, resulting in the formation of a new company to take over the assets and\n                    liabilities of the old company and to pay or satisfy the claims of unsecured\n                    creditors of the old company. The lessee was aware of the scheme and did not\n                    oppose its approval by the court. However, after the scheme was approved and the\n                    new company formed, he applied, in the liquidation of the old company, to admit\n                    a claim by him of £45,787 against the old company based on its covenant to\n                    indemnify him against the future rents, royalties and liabilities under the\n                    leases. 29     The English Court of Appeal held (at 277)\n                    that the lessee was bound by the scheme: …the word “creditor”is usedin the [1870] Act …in the widest sense, and… itincludes all persons having any pecuniary claims against the\n                            company. Any other construction would render the [1870] Act\n                        practically useless. [emphasis added] 30     WhatRe Midland\n                        Coaldecided, therefore, was that the word\n                    “creditor” in s 2 of the 1870 Act was broad enough to include\n                    a contingent creditor whose claim could be admitted to proof in a winding up,\n                    even if it was for an unproven, unliquidated amount. 31     Section 2 of the 1870 Act was only\n                    applicable to companies in liquidation, but its descendants (viz, s 206 of the Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK),\n                    s 425 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) and now s 896 of the\n                    Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK)), like s 210 of our Companies Act,\n                    applied regardless of whether or not the company in question was in\n                    liquidation. 32     Notwithstanding this change in the\n                    legislation, the broad approach inRe Midland Coalwas followed in the subsequent English cases ofRe Cancol\n                        Ltd[1996] 1 All ER 37 (“Re Cancol”),In re T & N\n                        Ltd and others[2006] 1 WLR 1728 (“Re T & N”)) andRe T & N Ltd and others (No 3)[2007]\n                    1 All ER 851 (“Re T & N\n                        (No 3)”), all of which held that a claimant with some\n                    sort of contingent claim against a company (which might or might not be admitted\n                    to proof in the company’s winding up) was to be considered a\n                    “creditor” for the purposes of the various English equivalents of\n                    s 210 of our Companies Act. 33     The upshot of the English cases, therefore,\n                    was that for the purposes of the various English equivalents of s 210 of\n                    our Companies Act, the position was as follows (see Roy Goode,Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law(Sweet &\n                    Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011) at para 12-18): The word “creditor” is used in the widest sense and includes\n                        a creditor whose debt has not yet become payable [citingRe Cancol] and a contingent creditor [citingRe Midland Coal], whether or not his claim is\n                        provable and, indeed, even if he has yet to make a claim or is unknown\n                        [citingRe T & NandRe T & N (No 3)], provided that\n                        the facts that may give rise to his claim already exist. The Australian cases 34     In contrast to the unanimously wide approach\n                    of the English courts to the interpretation of the term\n                    “creditors”, there is a divide in Australia between a number of\n                    jurisdictions which follow the English approach, and South Australia, which does\n                    not. The disagreement among the Australian courts concerns whether or not tort\n                    claimants are to be considered “creditors” within the meaning of\n                    the various Australian equivalents of s 210 of our Companies\n                Act. 35     In the South Australian Supreme Court case ofTrocko v Renlita Products Pty Ltd; The Commonwealth\n                        Trading Bank and Shepherd (Claimants)(1973) 5 SASR 207\n                        (“Trocko”), the plaintiff\n                    commenced an action against the defendant company in 1967 claiming unspecified\n                    damages for personal injuries caused by the defendant’s negligence. The\n                    defendant denied liability, but judgment was entered in the plaintiff’s\n                    favour in 1971. In the intervening period, however, a scheme of arrangement was\n                    approved by the necessary majority of creditors in 1970, and was approved by the\n                    court pursuant to s 181 of the Companies Act 1962–1972 (No 56 of\n                    1962–No 52 of 1972) of South Australia (“the South Australian\n                    Companies Act”), which is identical to s 210 of our Companies Act.\n                    The question, therefore, was whether the plaintiff was barred from enforcing his\n                    judgment against the defendant as a result of the scheme. 36     Hogarth J in the Supreme Court of South\n                    Australia held that the plaintiff was not so barred since the plaintiff was not\n                    a “creditor” within the meaning of s 181 of the South\n                    Australian Companies Act. His Honour reached that conclusion for a number of\n                    reasons. First, his Honour was of the view (at 209) that: In general, the word creditor means a person who is entitled to payment\n                        (eitherin praesentiorin\n                            futuro, and either unconditionally or subject to conditions)\n                        of a sum certain from some other identified person, the debtor. In this\n                        sense, a person with only a claim for an unspecified amount of damages\n                        arising out of an accident is not a creditor. He becomes a creditor only\n                        when judgment is given in his favour. Second, Hogarth J held that this plain meaning of the word\n                    “creditor” was applicable to s 181 of the South Australian\n                    Companies Act, dismissingRe Midland Coalasobiter(seeTrockoat 209–210). Third, Hogarth J thought\n                    (at 210) that s 181 could “usefully be compared with the\n                    provisions relating to the proof and ranking of claims in a winding up”,\n                    and that it was significant that s 291(1) of the South Australian Companies\n                    Act (identical to s 327(1) of our Companies Act) distinguished between\n                    “debts” on the one hand and “claims …\n                    ‘sounding only in damages’” (seeTrockoat 210) on the other. Fourth, Hogarth J was of\n                    the view that s 181(2) of the South Australian Companies Act (equivalent to\n                    s 210(2) of our Companies Act), in requiring the agreement of “a\n                    majority in number representing ‘three-fourths in value of the creditors\n                    … present and voting either in person or by proxy at the\n                    meeting’” (seeTrockoat 210),\n                    clearly contemplated that “creditors” were “people whose\n                    claims [were] ascertained or capable of being quantified at the meeting at which\n                    the proposed scheme [was to be] adopted” (seeTrockoat 210), especially since no statutory machinery had\n                    been provided to ascertain how unliquidated tort claims would be quantified for\n                    the purposes of determining whether the requisite majority of three-fourths in\n                    value of the creditors was made out. 37     The reasoning inTrockowas endorsed by a majority of the Supreme Court of South\n                    Australia sittingen bancinIn\n                        re Waymouth Guarantee and Discount Co Ltd(1975) 10 SASR 407\n                        (“Re Waymouth”) (perHogarth J at 449 and Walters J\n                    at 457), but this was only by way ofobiter\n                        dictaas the case turned on other matters. The remaining judge,\n                    Bray CJ, considered that the question of whether a person with an\n                    unliquidated tort claim against a company for damages was a\n                    “creditor” within the meaning of s 181 of the South\n                    Australian Companies Act was “very puzzling” (seeRe Waymouthat 443), but eventually remained\n                    agnostic as between the approaches inTrockoandRe Midland Coal(seeRe\n                        Waymouthat 444). 38     In contrast, the Supreme Court of New South\n                    Wales (Equity Division), decisively disapproved ofTrockoinRe Glendale Land Development Ltd\n                        (in liq)(1982) 7 ACLR 171 (“Re\n                        Glendale”). In that case, McLelland J examined the\n                    meaning of the word “creditors” in s 315 of the Companies\n                    (NSW) Code (the New South Wales equivalent of s 210 of our Companies Act).\n                    Rejecting all of Hogarth J’s reasons inTrockofor excluding persons with unliquidated tort claims from\n                    the ambit of the word “creditors”, McLelland J held (seeRe Glendaleat 176): [Hogarth J inTrocko] sought to\n                        distinguish …Re Midland Coal… but seems to me, with\n                        respect, to have done less than full justice to the grounds of [that\n                        decision]. … His Honour also sought to draw support from the absence of statutory\n                        machinery to quantify a claim for unliquidated damages for the purpose of\n                        ascertaining value in relation to a meeting of creditors under s 181(2)\n                        [of the South Australian Companies Act]. In relation to this last matter it may be said that the same consideration\n                        would have applied in …Re Midland Coal… Furthermore,\n                        difficulties as to quantification and disputes as to liability are not\n                        confined to unliquidated claims. … In my opinion, having regard to the history of the legislation, its\n                        evident purpose, the longstanding decision inRe Midland\n                            Coal… and the terms in which s 315 [of the\n                        Companies (NSW) Code] is now expressed, “creditors” in that\n                        section should be understood as embracing all persons with claims which\n                        would be entitled to be admitted to proof if the company were wound\n                        up. 39     Although the last sentence of the above\n                    quotation referred only to “claims which would be entitled to be admitted\n                    to proof if the company were wound up” (seeRe\n                        Glendaleat 176), McLelland J later clarified inRe R L Child & Co Pty Ltd(1986)\n                    10 ACLR 673 (“Re\n                    R L Child”) (at 674) that: This formulation was not intended to limit the scope of the expression\n                        [“creditors”], but rather to indicate that persons with\n                        unliquidated, prospective or contingent claims were not excluded,\n                        notwithstanding difficulties of assessment of value in such cases\n                        … Perhaps more significantly for present purposes, inRe R L Child, McLelland J also gave consideration\n                    (at 674) to “the anomalous rule excluding from proof in the winding\n                    up of an insolvent company a person having an unliquidated claim in\n                    tort”, which applied by virtue of s 438(2) of the Companies (NSW)\n                    Code and s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (the Singapore\n                    equivalents of these provisions (referred to at [27] of the GD) being, respectively,\n                    s 327(2) of the Companies Act and s 87(1) of the Bankruptcy Act\n                    (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed)). As McLelland J noted, the aforesaid\n                    provisions only applied in the case of an insolvent company, and on that basis,\n                    his Honour refused to exclude tort claimants from the ambit of the word\n                    “creditors” in s 315 of the Companies (NSW) Code (seeRe R L Childat 674–675): It is highly unlikely that the legislature would have intended the ambit\n                        of that expression [“creditors”] to vary depending upon\n                        whether the company was solvent or insolvent, and to exclude persons having\n                        unliquidated claims in tort from the scope of s 315 would make little\n                        commercial sense. Instead, McLelland J preferred to look to s 438(1) of the\n                    Companies (NSW) Code (the equivalent of s 327(1) of our Companies Act)\n                    – butexcluding the phrase referring to\n                        bankruptcy(seeRe\n                        R L Childat 675) – as a “convenient\n                    guide” (seeRe R L Childat 675) for the purposes of determining who were “creditors”\n                    within the meaning of s 315 of the Companies (NSW) Code. It should be noted\n                    that s 438(1) of the Companies (NSW) Code was in more or less the same\n                    terms as s 291(1) of the South Australian Companies Act, which\n                    Hogarth J relied upon by analogy inTrocko(see[36]above), yet, the two\n                    judges came to starkly different conclusions. 40     It is clear, therefore, that in New South\n                    Wales,Re Midland Coalholds sway in this area of\n                    the law (see alsoRe BDC Investments Ltd(1988)\n                    13 ACLR 201 at 203). 41     That the decision inTrockois a distinctly minority view in Australia is also\n                    evident from the fact that both Victoria (seeRe Southern\n                        Australia Perpetual Forests Ltd[1971] VR 475) and Western\n                    Australia (seeBond Corporation Holdings Ltd v Western\n                        Australia(1992) 7 ACSR 472 (“Bond\n                        Corporation”)) have adopted the broad approach laid down\n                    inRe Midland Coal. 42     Indeed,Bond\n                        Corporationis particularly instructive as the points which found\n                    favour with Hogarth J inTrocko(such as the\n                    argument that the statutory machinery regulating schemes of arrangement did not\n                    provide a means for determining the quantum of a creditor’s unliquidated\n                    claim at a creditors’ meeting for the purposes of evaluating the value to\n                    be attached to that creditor’s vote) were rejected by Anderson J, who\n                    held (seeBond Corporationat 477)\n                    that: [T]here is ample and persuasive authority for the proposition that the\n                        term “creditors” in [the Western Australian equivalent of\n                        s 210 of our Companies Act] is to be given a wide meaning and includes\n                        persons having any pecuniary claim against the company, including\n                        unliquidated, prospective or contingent claims [citing,inter alia,Re GlendaleandRe R L Child] … The Singapore cases 43     Thus far, the only local case that has dealt\n                    with the foregoing authorities isPacrim Investments Pte Ltd\n                        v Tan Mui Keow Claire and another[2010] SGHC 134\n                        (“Pacrim Investments”), which\n                    concerned whether the plaintiff (“Pacrim”) was bound by the scheme\n                    of arrangement in question, such that its entitlement to damages against the\n                    defendant company was extinguished. That turned on whether Pacrim was a\n                    “Scheme Creditor” within the meaning of the scheme in question,\n                    which in turn depended on whether Pacrim was a “creditor” within\n                    the meaning of s 210 of the Companies Act. The difficulty was that at the\n                    time the scheme was approved and implemented, Pacrim’s contractual claim\n                    against the company for damages had been dismissed by the High Court, but its\n                    appeal to this court against that decision was pending (Pacrim’s appeal\n                    was eventually allowedafterthe scheme had been\n                    completed). 44     At first instance, the assistant registrar\n                    (“the AR”), followingRe Midland\n                        Coal,Re T & N,Re GlendaleandRe\n                        R L Child, held (at [31] ofPacrim Investments) that\n                    the word “creditor” in s 210 of the Companies Act should be\n                    given a wide construction so as to include any person with a pecuniary claim\n                    against the company which was capable of estimate, regardless of whether such\n                    claim was unliquidated, prospective or contingent. Since, at the time the scheme\n                    was approved and implemented, the success of Pacrim’s claim was contingent\n                    upon the decision of the Court of Appeal, Pacrim was a contingent creditor and\n                    came within s 210 of the Companies Act, and was thus bound by the\n                    scheme. 45     The AR’s decision was upheld by the High\n                    Court inPacrim Investments Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Keow Claire and\n                        another[2011] 2 SLR 438, which also proceeded on the\n                    basis of a wide definition of the word “creditors” in s 210\n                    of the Companies Act (at [5]): At the time the [s]cheme [in question] was established, Pacrim had its\n                        claim dismissed by the High Court but its appeal was pending. This meant\n                        that in the event its appeal was allowed, it would be a creditor; indeed\n                        this was an eventuality that did materialise.There was\n                            no basis on principle to exclude persons in Pacrim’s position from\n                            the scope of “creditors”.In practice, doing so\n                        would unfairly benefit such companies who would be able to recoup its entire\n                        debt from a company resuscitated from the sacrifices of all the other\n                        creditors. Therefore there is also no basis on policy to do so. [emphasis\n                        added] The correct approach in this case 46     As indicated at[20]above, the real reason for the Judge’s ruling that\n                    the Respondents were not “creditors” within the meaning of\n                    s 210 of the Companies Act was that their common law tort claims were\n                    covered by insurance and, as such, their claims, even if successfully\n                    prosecuted, would not have affected the financial position of the Appellant.\n                    This was clear from [30]–[31] of the GD: 30    It is appropriate that the courts adopt an approach\n                            which gives the broadest scope to creditors for the purpose of\n                            facilitating corporate rehabilitations.Thus an\n                                insured unliquidated tort claimant may opt in to participate in a\n                                scheme, receive compromised payments thereunder and be bound by the\n                                scheme. Other insured unliquidated tort claimants may elect to opt\n                                out of the scheme and commence court actions against the company\n                                between the period where the company has proposed [the] scheme and\n                                right up to the termination of the scheme.… 31    …The practical reality before me, is that the\n                                [Appellant’s] insurer is the person who bears the\n                                liabilityto meet the unliquidated tort claims should the\n                            [Respondents] succeed. It would not serve any statutory purpose of\n                            s 210(3) of the Companies Act, which is to facilitate\n                            rehabilitation of companies in financial difficulty, and neither is\n                            there any language in s 210(3) of the Companies Act which provides\n                            any basis to conclude that a scheme may statutorily extinguishthe insured claims of persons such as the [Respondents],\n                                which have no real impact on the [Appellant’s]\n                                assets… [emphasis added] 47     With respect, we found it difficult to see why\n                    the fact that the Respondents’ claims were covered by insurance should\n                    make any difference to whether or not the Respondents were\n                    “creditors” for the purposes of s 210 of the Companies Act.\n                    In neither theRe Midland Coalline of cases norTrockowas it suggested that the existence of\n                    insurance in relation to a claim prevented the claimant from being a\n                    “creditor”. InTrocko(at 210),\n                    Hogarth J placed emphasis on the claim being “ascertained or capable\n                    of being quantified at the meeting at which the proposed scheme [was to be]\n                    adopted” (see[36]above), as\n                    opposed to whether or not the claim was covered by insurance. Indeed, in bothRe T & N (No 3)andRe R L Child, it was quite clear\n                    that the claims wereprima faciecovered by\n                    policies of insurance, but it was nonetheless held that the beneficiaries of\n                    those claims were “creditors” for the purposes of the provisions\n                    corresponding to s 210 of our Companies Act. If the Judge were correct in\n                    holding that the existence of insurance was the touchstone, it would follow thatanyperson whose claim was covered by a policy\n                    of insurance (or, for that matter, by a contract of guarantee or an indemnity),\n                    and not just persons with claims for unliquidated damages in tort, would be\n                    excluded from the ambit of the word “creditors” in s 210 of\n                    the Companies Act. This would mean that all manner of judgment or agreed\n                    creditors for liquidated damages in contract or for breach of statutory duty,\n                    not to mention those whose entitlements to damages had yet to accrue, would\n                    – so long as their claims were covered by insurance – thereby be\n                    deemed not to be “creditors” for the purposes of s 210, and\n                    would therefore not be bound by any scheme of arrangement entered into. If this\n                    were the correct position, the object of s 210 would become an impossible\n                    dream. No “white knight” would be willing to rescue a financially\n                    distressed company if he is to be burdened with the existing liabilities of the\n                    company. 48     Given the respectable pedigree ofRe Midland Coal, we were of the view that it should be\n                    presumed, in the absence of contrary evidence, that Parliament, in enacting\n                    s 210 of the Companies Act using wording identical to that of the various\n                    equivalent English provisions mentioned at[31]above, intended the word “creditors” in\n                    s 210 to be given the meaning which had by then been regarded as settled in\n                    England. The whole purpose of s 210 of the Companies Act is to facilitate\n                    compromises and arrangements with a company’s creditors as a practical and\n                    more sensible alternative to liquidation, and, as industrial disease litigation\n                    has revealed, tort claimants may form a substantial (or even the entire) class\n                    of a company’s creditors. As theRe Midland\n                        Coalline of cases has noted, to exclude such claimants from the\n                    ambit of the term “creditors” would render s 210 of the\n                    Companies Act rather pointless. The objection raised inTrocko(viz, that no machinery was\n                    provided in the South Australian equivalent of s 210 of our Companies Act\n                    to quantify the claims of tort claimants for the purposes of deciding whether or\n                    not a scheme of arrangement had obtained the requisite creditor approval) would\n                    apply, as observed inRe Glendale, to all\n                    unliquidated claims (as well as all claims where liability is disputed). In our\n                    view, this objection would be adequately met by the procedure recommended by Ian\n                    M Fletcher, John Higham & William Trower,Corporate\n                        Administrations and Rescue Procedures(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed,\n                    2004) at para 13.20: Where claims against the company have not been agreed, it is usual to\n                        permit creditors to vote for the amounts for which they estimate that the\n                        company is liable to them, provided such amounts appear reasonable. If there\n                        is an obvious error … the chairman of the meeting will correct the\n                        figure and admit it for the corrected amount. If he believes that a claim is\n                        totally groundless, he may reject a claim altogether. If he believes that\n                        the amount claimed is excessive, he may reduce it to what he believes to be\n                        a reasonable estimate. In any such case the creditor would be informed and,\n                        if the figure for which the claim is admitted for voting purposes will be\n                        material in deciding whether or not the statutory majority has or has not\n                        been obtained, the creditor would have the right to object, at the hearing\n                        for sanction, to the amount for which his claim is admitted by the chairman\n                        of the meeting for voting purposes. The chairman of the meeting is not\n                        expected to be an adjudicator of disputed claims and if there is real doubt\n                        as to whether the person claiming to be a creditor is a creditor, or as to\n                        the amount for which he claims the company is liable to him, which cannot be\n                        resolved by agreement with the creditor, the chairman of the meeting should\n                        admit the vote but mark it as objected to, so that if it becomes necessary,\n                        the court may adjudicate upon the issue. 49     Consistently with this, it should be borne in\n                    mind that s 210(2) of the Companies Act provides that a creditors’\n                    meeting under s 210(1) may be adjourned if such adjournment is approved by\n                    a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or\n                    class of creditors present and voting either in person or by proxy at the\n                    meeting. If there is genuine doubt over the existence and/or size of a tort\n                    claimant’s unliquidated claim, and if such a claim appears to be critical\n                    to determining whether the requisite statutory majority has been made out, the\n                    most prudent and practical course of action would be to adjourn the meeting for\n                    the matter to be decided by the court. 50     As a matter of principle, authority and\n                    policy, therefore, the approach inRe Midland Coalis preferable to that ofTrocko, and we endorse it\n                    accordingly.",
        "Whether the Respondents were “Scheme Creditors” within\n                the meaning of the Scheme": "The Judge’s approach 51     Turning now to the question of whether the\n                    Respondents were “Scheme Creditors” as defined in the Scheme, the\n                    Judge concluded (at [33] of the GD)\n                    that the Respondents were not “Scheme Creditors”: It is clear that each Scheme Claim is defined to mean a claim “for\n                        which the [Appellant] is or may be liable to that Scheme Creditor”.\n                        The definition of “liability” … resonates the same\n                        point. I note that an Australian court has following its construction of the\n                        scheme document held that an unliquidated tort claimant was not a creditor\n                        bound by a scheme of arrangement (seeSmith v Carr and\n                            others(1993) 10 ACSR 427).As a\n                            matter of construction of the Scheme document’s definition\n                            clauses, the [Respondents’] insured claims for which the\n                            [Appellant] bears no substantive actual or contingent liability would\n                            not, in my view, be claims for which the [Appellant] “is or may\n                            be liable … (whether contingently or\n                            otherwise)”.[emphasis added] 52     In other words, the Judge held that following\n                    the approach (but not the actual decision) inSmith v Carr\n                        and others(1993) 10 ACSR 427 (“Smith v Carr”), whether or not a particular claimant fell\n                    within the definition of “Scheme Creditor” as set out in\n                    cl 1.1 of the Scheme was a question of construction. The Judge concluded\n                    that as a matter of construction, when an insurer, pursuant to a valid policy of\n                    liability insurance, indemnified an insured in respect of a particular liability\n                    (in this case, unliquidated tort claims), any such claim against the insured\n                    would not result in the insured incurring any “substantive actual or\n                    contingent liability” (see the GD at [33]) to the claimant; rather, it would be the insurer who\n                    incurred such liability. Consequently, the Judge held, since the Appellant was\n                    insured in respect of the Respondents’ claims, it was not liable to them\n                    and they were therefore not “Scheme Creditors” as defined in\n                    cl 1.1 of the Scheme. 53     It is undoubtedly true that the court inSmith v Carr, in construing the terms of the\n                    scheme in that case, came to the conclusion that the plaintiff tort claimants\n                    were not “scheme creditors” as that term was defined in the\n                    scheme. As a general proposition, there is nothing objectionable about this\n                    approach: the meaning of any contractual term (even if the contract, like a\n                    scheme of arrangement, is one entered into pursuant to legislative provisions)\n                    is a question of construction. In that regard, what will be determinative will\n                    be the facts of the case and the relevant terms of the scheme in\n                    question. 54Smith v Carr,\n                    therefore, was something of a red herring in the present context. The Judge\n                    seemed to have referred to it only as authority for an uncontroversial\n                    proposition regarding contractual interpretation. The Judge did not purport to\n                    follow the actualdecisioninSmith v Carr, and it is quite clear that he could not have done\n                    so since the relevant definition of “scheme creditor” in that case\n                    was not the same as that in the present appeals. As we saw it, the actual\n                    decision inSmith v Carrwas probably correct: in\n                    order to maintain consistency as between the various groups of creditors\n                    envisioned by the scheme of arrangement in that case, there were good grounds\n                    for concluding that on the true construction of the relevant terms of that\n                    scheme, tort claimants whose claims were covered by a valid policy of insurance\n                    were not intended to be considered “scheme creditors”. The same,\n                    however, could not be said about the terms of the Scheme in the present\n                    case. Whose liability? 55     As a matter of law, it is quite difficult to\n                    see how it could be said that an insured such as the Appellant does not bear any\n                    “substantive actual or contingent liability” (see the GD\n                        at [33]) when sued by a\n                    claimant (whether for unliquidated damages in tort or otherwise). If the claim\n                    is good, it is clearly the insured who is liable on the claim. The fact that the\n                    insurer may then be liable on the policy of insurance to the insured is\n                    irrelevant. Certainly, the insurer is not, at common law, directly liable to the\n                    claimant as a result of the doctrine of privity of contract. 56     Indeed, as E R Hardy Ivamy,General Principles of Insurance Law(Butterworths, 6th Ed, 1993) notes at p 12: “[i]n liability\n                    insurance, in whichthe assured insures against liability to\n                        third parties… the liability insured against is the real\n                    subject-matter of insurance” [emphasis added]. The same point is repeated\n                    in Robert Merkin,Colinvaux’s Law of\n                        Insurance(Sweet & Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2010) at\n                    para 20-006: “[l]iability insurance provides cover against the risk\n                    ofthe assured incurring liability to third\n                        parties” [emphasis added], and similarly at\n                    para 20-034: The assured’s right to indemnification under a liability policy\n                        will, in the absence of express wording to the contrary, be regarded as\n                        arisingonce the assured’s liability to the third\n                            party has been ascertained… [emphasis added] The same point is also made repeatedly in Desmond Derrington &\n                    Ronald Shaw Ashton,The Law of Liability Insurance(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2005), and it suffices to quote the following extract\n                    from para 1-10: “liability insurance cannot be easily classified\n                    other than as relating to thelegal liability of the insured\n                        to another party” [emphasis added]. 57     It was clear to us from these authorities that\n                    the Appellant was to be considered “liable” to the Respondents\n                    notwithstanding that it was indemnified against that liability by virtue of its\n                    policy of insurance with its insurer. That this must be the case is obvious from\n                    the veryraison d’êtreof liability\n                    insurance. It followed, therefore, that we found it difficult to agree with the\n                    Judge that “[a]s a matter of construction” (see the GD\n                        at [33]), the Respondents were\n                    not “Scheme Creditors” within the meaning of the Scheme. On the\n                    true construction of the relevant terms of the Scheme, the Appellant clearly\n                    “[was] or [might] be liable to”[note: 3]the\n                    Respondents in respect of a “Liability” as defined in cl 1.1\n                    of the Scheme, and, consequently, the Respondents were indeed “Scheme\n                    Creditors” within the meaning of the Scheme. 58     At this juncture, we wish to make an\n                    observation with regard to the Judge’s point that regardless of the formal\n                    legal position (which we have stated at[55]above), as a matter of commercial substance and reality,\n                    even if the Respondents were allowed to proceed with (and were successful in)\n                    their common law claims against the Appellant, the interests of the Appellant\n                    would not be affected because its insurance cover obliged its insurer (and not\n                    the Appellant itself) to meet the Appellant’s liability to the\n                    Respondents. While it is true that in such a scenario, whatever damages a court\n                    might adjudicate against the Appellant would largely (depending on the specific\n                    wording of the insurance policy as to whether any portion of such damages would\n                    have to be borne by the Appellant) be underwritten by the insurer, such payment\n                    out by the insurer would impact the Appellant’s standing before the\n                    insurer as well as the premium which the insurer would likely impose for the\n                    renewal of the policy. Clearly, the interests of the Appellant would be\n                    affected, and this would in turn be unfair to SAAG Singapore, which might not\n                    have agreed to rescue Derrick in those circumstances. To allow the Respondents\n                    to proceed with their common law claims against the Appellant would also be\n                    unfair to other Scheme Creditors who have accepted the Scheme. This is not to\n                    say, however, that where justice so demands, exceptions may not be expressly\n                    made to a scheme of compromise or arrangement before approval by the court is\n                    obtained (see[68]below).",
        "Whether the Respondents were bound by the Scheme": "59     Turning now to the issue of whether the\n                    Respondents were bound by the Scheme, since the Respondents were\n                    “creditors” within the meaning of s 210 of the Companies Act\n                    and were also “Scheme Creditors” as defined in cl 1.1 of the\n                    Scheme, it followed quite naturally that by operation of s 210(3) of the\n                    Companies Act, they were bound by the terms of the Scheme. This in turn entailed\n                    that by operation of cll 5.4 and 7.2 of the Scheme, the Respondents were\n                    precluded from maintaining their common law claims against the\n                Appellant. 60     However, the Judge went on to hold\n                        (at [34]–[37] of the GD) that even if (contrary to his\n                    view) the Respondents were “Scheme Creditors” for the purposes of\n                    the Scheme, the Scheme did not bind them and preclude their common law claims\n                    because cl 2.1.1 of the Scheme contemplated that the Appellant had to\n                    provide some consideration to the Scheme Creditors in exchange for their Scheme\n                    Claims being compromised and discharged. According to the Judge, cl 5.4\n                    (and presumably cl 7.2) of the Scheme was subject to cl 2.1.1, and he\n                    appeared to have concluded from this that since the Respondents had not\n                    participated in the Scheme, they had not received any consideration from the\n                    Appellant, and the Appellant could not therefore enforce cl 5.4 (and\n                    presumably cl 7.2) against them. 61     With respect, we were unable to agree with\n                    this line of reasoning. It is trite that ordinarily, consideration must be\n                    supplied before a contract is binding. A scheme of arrangement, however, is not\n                    an ordinary contract, but a statutory one. Parliament has, by s 210(3) of\n                    the Companies Act, made an exception to the normal requirement of consideration,\n                    and has in effect mandated that as long as the requisite statutory majority of\n                    creditors agree to be bound by a scheme of arrangement (and receive the\n                    specified consideration in exchange),allcreditors will be bound by the scheme, even those who did not so agree or\n                    receive consideration thereby. 62     The Judge in fact cited this court’s\n                    decision inThe Oriental Insurance Co, where, to\n                    quote from holding (3) of the headnote, it was held (inter alia) that the purpose of s 210 of the Companies Act\n                    was to overcome “the impossibility or impracticability of obtaining the\n                    individual consent of every member of the class intended to be bound by the\n                    scheme of arrangement”. From this perspective, it is difficult to see how\n                    there can be any room for asserting that a creditor (who is intended to be bound\n                    by a scheme of arrangement so long as it is approved by the requisite majority\n                    of creditors) is not bound because he did not consent to or participate in the\n                    scheme and therefore did not receive any payouts thereunder. 63     In conclusion, since the Respondents were\n                    “creditors” within the meaning of s 210 of the Companies Act\n                    as well as “Scheme Creditors” within the meaning of the Scheme,\n                    they were bound by the terms of the Scheme, pursuant to which they were\n                    precluded from maintaining their common law claims against the Appellant. On\n                    that basis, we allowed the present appeals.",
        "Other considerations": "64     In reaching that conclusion, we had regard to\n                    two other considerations. No injustice to the Respondents 65     The first was that the result which we reached\n                    was not an unjust one because under the terms of the Scheme, both the\n                    Respondents still had recourse to their WCA claims (by virtue of claims under\n                    the WCA being included in Schedule 1 of the Scheme, the Respondents were\n                    “Preferential Creditors” and, thus, “Excluded\n                    Creditors” who were not bound by the Scheme (see[9]above)). 66     While the amount of compensation recoverable\n                    by the Respondents under the WCA would likely be less than that recoverable at\n                    common law, the Respondents had no real cause for complaint for, in a scheme of\n                    arrangement situation, all unsecured creditors of a company would be expected to\n                    take a “haircut” and receive less than the full amount of their\n                    claims in return for avoiding a winding up of the company (which would likely\n                    result in even smaller sums being returned to them). Guidelines for the future 67     That said, it was fortuitous that the\n                    Respondents could still rely on their WCA claims because of the definition of\n                    “Preferential Creditors” in the Scheme. The Appellant’s\n                    other tort claimants who were not aware of and/or did not participate in the\n                    Scheme might not be so fortunate, and could find their claims entirely barred\n                    without their knowledge as a result of the wide approach to the meaning of the\n                    word “creditors” (as established byRe Midland\n                        Coal) which we have endorsed for the purposes of s 210 of\n                    the Companies Act. 68     InRe\n                        R L Child, McLelland J was clearly aware of the\n                    potential pitfalls of the broad view espoused inRe Midland\n                        Coalfor his Honour went on to give guidance to ensure that the\n                    courts would not unwittingly approve schemes of arrangement which had the\n                    unintended effect of binding tort claimants in circumstances where such\n                    claimants had never heard of the scheme and had no chance to object to it (seeRe R L Childat 675): I consider that where the definition of creditors intended to be bound by\n                        the scheme is in a catch-all form, evidence should normally be adduced, from\n                        a responsible officer of the company, to the effect that the company has\n                        received no notice of any pecuniary claim against it and that the deponent\n                        is not aware of any circumstances likely to give rise to a pecuniary claim\n                        against the company, other than as revealed to the court. In the case of any\n                        disputed or anticipated claim the court can then determine what, if any,\n                        notice of the meeting should be given to the claimant or potential claimant,\n                        or whether some amendment of the scheme is appropriate to accommodate such a\n                        claim. There is always the possibility of some potential claim, particularly in\n                        tort, of which the company is unaware. It seems to me that the court should\n                        be slow to approve a scheme which would have the effect of barring such a\n                        claim with no effective notice to the potential claimant where this can be\n                        avoided without frustrating the commercial purpose of the scheme. I have in\n                        mind particularly a claim against which the company is effectively insured.\n                        In many cases where a catch-all definition of creditors is employed it\n                        would, in my view, be appropriate to qualify the definition by adding an\n                        exclusion along the following lines: “excluding any person having a\n                        claim in respect of which the company is entitled to indemnity under a\n                        policy of insurance, to the extent of the amount recoverable under such\n                        policy in respect of such claim.” Indeed, McLelland J went on to introduce just such an exception\n                    into the scheme in that case. If this authority had been drawn to Belinda\n                    Ang J’s attention during either the hearing to convene a Scheme\n                    Creditors’ meeting or the hearing to approve the Scheme, it is likely that\n                    she would have taken a similar course of action as that taken by\n                    McLelland J, and the situation in the present appeals would not have\n                    arisen. 69     As such, in order to ensure that the wide\n                    interpretation which we have adopted for the term “creditors” in\n                    s 210 of the Companies Act does not cause injustice, we take this\n                    opportunity to also endorse the guidance given by McLelland J inRe R L Childat 675.",
        "Conclusion": "70     For the foregoing reasons, the present appeals\n                    were allowed, but with no order as to costs here and below. 71     Ordinarily, costs here and below would have\n                    been ordered in the Appellant’s favour, but given that such an order might\n                    easily negate whatever compensation the Respondents would obtain via their WCA\n                    claims, we inquired of the Appellant’s counsel whether the Appellant would\n                    be willing to forego seeking costs against the Respondents. In this regard, we\n                    were very gratified to be informed that the Appellant was agreeable to such a\n                    course of action.
