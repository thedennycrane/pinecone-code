<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
accused claimed trial to and was convicted on the following charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, <b>SIVA A/L
SANNASI</b>,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 22 April 2013, at about 11.42am, along
Sungei Kadut Avenue, Singapore, inside vehicle JLF 7845, did traffic
in a controlled drug specified as a “Class A” drug in the First
Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the
Act”), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking,
four bundles of granular / powdery substance which was analysed and
found to contain not less than 43.32 grams of diamorphine, without
any authorisation under the Act or the regulations made thereunder,
and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 5(2) and punishable under
s 33 of the Act, and further upon your conviction under s 5(1) of
the Act, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under s 33B of
the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       A
second charge of drug trafficking was stood down and subsequently withdrawn
after I convicted and sentenced the accused on the first charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
accused was arrested on 22 April 2013 by Central Narcotics Bureau
(“CNB”) officers as part of a drug operation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The accused
was seen driving a heavy goods vehicle bearing the registration
plate number JLF 7845 (“the Prime Mover”). He had entered Singapore
via the Woodlands Checkpoint between 2.00am and 3.00am. After driving
the Prime Mover to the Marina Bay area, he repacked the drugs and
then slept until 8.30am. After he woke up, he went about his work
duties until about 9.40am to 10.00am, when he arranged to meet the
people to whom he was supposed to give the drugs. The accused was
tailed by CNB vehicles from the Marina Bay area to Ang Mo Kio, where
the accused alighted and crossed the road to a petrol kiosk. The
accused was seen making a phone call before returning to the Prime
Mover. He continued to drive in the direction of Yio Chu Kang. CNB
officers lost sight of the Prime Mover, but it was spotted shortly
after in the Sungei Kadut area, at about 11.00am.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       While
the Prime Mover stopped along Sungei Kadut Way, two men, who had
been acting suspiciously and talking under a tree, boarded the Prime
Mover. The men stayed inside the cabin of the Prime Mover for about
20 minutes. The Prime Mover was then driven for a short distance and
the two men alighted at a bus stop while the Prime Mover continued
on its way. The two men were arrested by CNB officers who moved
in on them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The
accused drove on for a short distance before stopping and alighting
from his vehicle, apparently to check on the passenger door which had
not been properly shut when the two men alighted. CNB officers moved
in and arrested him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Amin
bin Abdullah (“Amin”) was one of the two men arrested at the bus
stop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He
was searched and found to possess one plastic bag containing some
brown granular substance, which was later analysed and found to contain
diamorphine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> It transpired
that, in the Prime Mover, Amin had given the accused $4,000 in exchange
for that plastic bag containing the drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
accused was led into the rear seat of a CNB vehicle, where an oral statement
was taken from him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> It

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
Prime Mover was searched in the accused’s presence by CNB officers
who recovered, among other things, one tied black plastic bag with three
packets of brown granular substance (in the compartment above the driver’s
seat) and one green plastic bag containing one packet of brown granular
substance (in the centre console to the left of the driver’s seat).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> These
exhibits were sealed, brought back to CNB, and later conveyed to
the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. They were analysed
and found to contain not less than 43.32g of diamorphine in total.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Over
the course of investigations, W/Insp Yang Rongluan took six statements
under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)
(“CPC”). These were recorded in English with an interpreter’s help
and admitted into evidence without challenge as to their admissibility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In these
statements, the accused admitted that this was the fourth occasion
he had brought drugs into Singapore. He had brought “bola” from
Malaysia to Singapore on three occasions in January and April 2013
prior to his arrest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He understood
“bola” to mean drugs. He obtained the supply from a person known
to him as Jagen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The accused
agreed to work for Jagen because he needed money to pay off his
loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He had delivered “half
bola” on the first occasion and four packets each on the second
and the third occasions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He received
RM2,000 for each of the second and third deliveries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The
accused also helped Jagen collect money from drug clients in Singapore
in February and March 2013 for “about 11 times”. The money would
be collected by men on behalf of “drug bosses”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Jagen subsequently
paid the accused between S$50 and S$150 for each successful collection
of money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> For this fourth trip,
Jagen and another man, known to the accused as “Dinesh”, handed
one and a half packets and three packets of drugs to the accused
respectively. These were to be delivered to various clients of the
“drug bosses” in Singapore. Dinesh had told the accused that the
packets contained chocolate but the accused did not believe him
at any point in time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The accused entered Singapore
in the early hours of 22 April 2013, parked his vehicle at his worksite,
slept and then went about his regular work duties in the morning
before arranging to deliver the drugs to the various drug clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
accused admitted that he was delivering “bola” or drugs on Jagen’s
behalf but contended that he did not know the nature of the drugs he
was delivering at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     He
said that he first accepted Jagen’s offer to deliver “half bola”
to a drug client in January 2013 because he needed money to clear
his debts with a bank and with one Mohan, who was Jagen’s friend.
Jagen told the accused that bringing drugs into Singapore would
fetch quick money and that the drugs would contain little drug content.
He would therefore face a very light sentence if caught.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The accused
said that he was initially reluctant to perform this fourth delivery
but Jagen told the accused that the “bosses” may do “something harmful”
to the accused and his family if he did not. The accused eventually
relented and agreed to do the delivery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
accused also called Amin as his witness. At the time of the trial, Amin
was in remand awaiting trial. The other man who was arrested, one Razali
bin Shafiei (“Razali”), has been given a discharge not amounting
to an acquittal and was released from custody before the present
trial. The accused did not wish to call Razali as a witness. According
to Amin, a person known to him as “J Boy” gave him the accused’s
phone number so that he could meet and pass money to the accused.
On 22 April 2013, Amin called the accused’s phone six times. Through
these calls, the accused arranged to meet Amin at Sungei Kadut Way.
However, Amin denied asking the accused whether the latter had “batu”.
At Sungei Kadut, Amin boarded the Prime Mover with Razali and Amin
handed $4,000 to the accused. The accused later handed him a packet
of drugs, to which Amin said “not mine”. Amin then received a call
from “J Boy”. Amin asked “J Boy” whether he needed to “<em>masak</em>” (Malay for “cook”) the drugs. Amin complained
that “$4,000 was not worth it” but took the packet of drugs. Amin
asked to be dropped off at a bus stop. Both Amin and Razali then alighted
from the Prime Mover and were arrested by CNB officers shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In
substance, the defence focused on the issues of knowledge and, to
a small extent, duress. Before I deal with each in more detail,
I will quickly deal with a point that arose during the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
accused contended that he never used the words “drug boss” in his
statements. Instead, he said that he had consistently referred to
an Indian man in his s 22 statements and he had said “boss” (but
not “drug boss”) in his contemporaneous statement. However, the
accused conceded that the statements were recorded accurately and
he had an opportunity to correct his statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In any event, the issue of
whether it was an Indian man or a drug boss was immaterial as the
accused knew he was delivering drugs on another’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the presumption of knowledge
applied</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Section 18(2)
of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) provides
that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled
drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed
to have known the nature of that drug. This applies to the accused
in two ways: first, by virtue of s 18(1)(<em>a</em>)
of the MDA, as he was arrested with the drugs in the plastic bags
that he was carrying and second, by virtue of s 21 of the MDA, as
the accused was in charge of the Prime Mover at the material time.
To rebut the presumption of knowledge in the context of s 18(2)
of the MDA, the accused must prove on a balance of probabilities
that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have
known that the thing in his possession contained that controlled
drug (<em>Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public
Prosecutor</em> [2012] 2 SLR 903 at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
accused claimed that he had relied on the assurances of Jagen (who
he said was a close friend) that the drugs had low drug content
and that he would face a light sentence if he was caught. Accordingly,
he did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known
that the plastic bags he was carrying contained diamorphine. To
this end, the defence relied on the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Khor Soon Lee</em> [2011] 3 SLR 201 (“<em>Khor Soon Lee</em>”). There, the appellant
appealed against his conviction on the charge of importing 27.8g
of diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant, on the instructions
of one Tony, had brought in various types of drugs like Ketamine
and Ecstasy to Singapore. However, the appellant did not know the
contents of the fourth bundle and thought it to be “ice”. The Court
of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, considered that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
appellant had consistently imported drugs which would not attract
a death sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     he
had been careful to confirm with Tony that the packages contained
only controlled drugs and not diamorphine;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     he
trusted Tony because of a close and personal relationship; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     accordingly,
he did not have a strong suspicion to which he turned a blind eye;
at most, his failure to check the nature of the drugs amounted to
negligence or recklessness but that was not enough to establish
wilful blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Additionally,
the accused also said that he wanted to ask his good friends who
were customs officers what exactly the drugs were, but, unfortunately
for him, none of them was on duty at the checkpoint when he drove
into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Finally,
it was submitted that the accused did not know the nature of what
he was carrying, as supported by the fact that he had left the package of
drugs in an exposed part of the Prime Mover while it was parked
in Johor Baru overnight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and that he
was neither nervous nor behaving unusually both the night before
his arrest (after receiving the drugs from Jagen and Dinesh) and
when passing through the customs checks. The accused also said that
he did not even know what heroin or diamorphine was. He said that
when he asked why he was charged for importing diamorphine, two CNB
officers had told him “It’s heroin. You don’t know, ah?” He asked
the interpreter what “diamorphine” meant and the interpreter replied
that it was the scientific name for heroin. W/Insp Yang also testified
that she explained to the accused that diamorphine is a chemical
name for the drugs that he had brought into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I
shall dispose of the last submission first. The fact that he was behaving
normally might show that he did not have actual knowledge of the nature
of his drugs or that he was a cool courier of drugs. As for his
claim that he did not even know what “heroin” or “diamorphine” was,
he nevertheless said that he knew that it was wrong to bring drugs
in and that he was sorry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The
real issue is whether the presumption of knowledge applied and whether
it has been rebutted. This in turn depends on whether the accused
had a strong suspicion that he was carrying diamorphine and, if so,
whether he had turned a blind eye to it. This brings me back to
the accused’s first two submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
evidence shows that the accused did or should have had a strong suspicion
that he was carrying diamorphine. First, based on his police statements
and oral testimony, he was fully aware that the plastic bags contained
illegal drugs, which he referred to as “bola”. Second, the accused had
an untenable way of reasoning that “bola” had little drug content.
He knew he was carrying “bola” or “batu” (street names for illegal
drugs) and saw that the drugs were brown and powdery. It was different
from another drug known to him as “ganja”, which he knew to be the
“green colour leaf thing”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> He had been told by Jagen
that “ganja” was “nothing” and contained “very little drug content”
and he reasoned that “bola” contained less drug content than “ganja”
simply because it was not “ganja” and because it was a different
colour from “ganja”. In my view, the accused had no basis to reason
this way. Instead, it should have raised suspicions in his mind
about the true nature of what he was carrying. Third, the accused
was disproportionately rewarded for previous deliveries of “bola”.
He was promised a payment of RM2,500, which he conceded was a “big
sum” and he had in fact wondered he was paid so much for delivering
such small packets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The fact that
Jagen was known to deal in drugs and the fact that the accused was
being paid so handsomely for an apparently easy task must have created
a strong suspicion that what the accused was carrying was valuable
and highly illegal and to which he turned a blind eye.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
accused conceded in cross-examination that he knew that drug offences
were very serious and potentially carried the death penalty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Despite this, he was content
to rely only on Jagen’s bare assurances. However, I do not see why
the accused should have done so. Nothing suggests a close friendship
with Jagen; the facts point instead to a more arm’s-length relationship.
In cross-examination, the accused could only say that they would
meet in the coffee shop on Sundays to watch football and that Jagen
would offer him a lift if he was going back to Seremban or Kuala Lumpur.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, he could not
even say where Jagen lived. Moreover, he described his first encounter
with Jagen as one where Jagen had chased the accused to clear his
debt with Mohan on Mohan’s behalf, and where Jagen said that “Mohan
would spread the news and spoil [his] name if [he did] not pay up
soon”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> As for Dinesh’s assurance
that the drugs were chocolate, the accused had already said that
he knew Dinesh was lying and he did not believe Dinesh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
accused claimed that he could not check with his friends working at
the checkpoint what exactly the drugs were as none of them was on
duty when he drove into Singapore. Since he had delivered drugs
on three previous occasions over a span of three months, he had
ample opportunity to check what the drugs were. Moreover, he did
not mention this anywhere in his police statements, which were otherwise
quite detailed. This excerpt from the cross-examination of the accused
is particularly telling:</p>

I want to put it to you that even though you were not entirely in a
relationship of trust with these---with Jagen, you were content
to rely on Jagen’s bare assurances that the drugs you were bringing

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I put it to you that that you knew

my final put to you, Mr Siva, you didn’t conduct your own checks
because you were willing to bring the drugs into Singapore regardless
of what drugs they were, you just wanted to earn the 2,500 Ringgit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In a way.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This
case is not like <em>Khor Soon Lee</em>,
where the appellant was in a relationship of trust with the person
who had passed him the drugs and where he had actually satisfied
himself that the drugs he was handling did not involve the death
penalty. Furthermore, the appellant had been prejudiced by the fact
that Tony, who would have been a significant defence witness, was
not available to testify. In fact, the Court of Appeal warned at [29]
that the facts were unusual and should not set a precedent for future cases.
On the present facts, a reasonable person in the accused’s shoes would
not only have had great suspicions about the true nature of the
drugs that Jagen and Dinesh had handed over but would also have
inquired further to determine the true nature of those drugs. In
my view, the accused, not having done so, turned a blind eye to
these suspicions. Accordingly, I found that he failed to rebut the
presumption of knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defence of duress
applied</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although
the defence made no arguments on duress in closing submissions,
I will mention it briefly. To establish duress under s 94 of the Penal
Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), the accused must prove on a balance
of probabilities that the threats made to him were “imminent, persistent
and extreme”, that such threats <em>could</em> and <em>did</em> impress upon him a reasonable apprehension
that “instant death” would otherwise be the consequence of his failure
to commit the crime and that he had no reasonable opportunity to
escape from or neutralise the threat (<em>Public
Prosecutor v Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam</em> [2011] 2
SLR 830 at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> and <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> <em>per</em> Chan Seng Onn J).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On
the facts, I saw no duress. Although the accused had, in his police statements
and oral testimony, suggested that there was a threat to his well-being,
he could not state any specific threats. Instead, he could only
say that he “felt [that he] was being forced” as the “drug bosses”
knew where he was staying. The accused was also in control of his
situation—on the day of his arrest, he drove into Singapore, slept
in his Prime Mover, repacked the drugs, went about his daily work
and even dictated the time at which he would pass the drugs to other
persons. He could have, for example, escaped or contacted the police
for help at any time. If duress had been raised during the trial,
I would have rejected it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As
the accused has not rebutted the presumptions on a balance of probabilities,
I convicted him accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The
Public Prosecutor certified that the accused had substantively assisted
the CNB. I also found, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused
was a mere courier in that his involvement in the offence was restricted
to transporting and delivering the drugs (s 33B(2)(a)). Having satisfied
both limbs of s 33B(2) of the MDA, the accused could be sentenced under
s 33B(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA which provides
that the court may, instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence
the accused to imprisonment for life and, if the accused is sentenced
to life imprisonment, the court shall also sentence him to caning
of not less than 15 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     No
facts were given and no submissions were made to justify the imposition
of the ultimate punishment of the death penalty on the accused. The
accused was born on 14 September 1968 and is now 46 years old. He therefore
does not fall within s 325(1)(<em>b</em>)
of the CPC which provides that men who are more than 50 years of
age (at the time of infliction of the caning) shall not be punished
with caning. The only submission on sentence made by his counsel
after the conviction was that the minimum number of strokes should
be imposed as the accused was already 46 years old. Accordingly,
I sentenced him to life imprisonment (to commence from 22 April
2013, his date of arrest) and 15 strokes of the cane, the minimum sentence
provided by law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On
26 February 2015, the accused filed a notice of appeal against his sentence
only, on the ground that “the sentence is unreasonable and manifestly
excessive”. As indicated earlier, the accused was sentenced to the minimum
imprisonment and caning provided by law and his life imprisonment
term was backdated to the date of his arrest. It is therefore unclear
upon what grounds he is asserting that the sentence imposed is unreasonable
or excessive.</p>
