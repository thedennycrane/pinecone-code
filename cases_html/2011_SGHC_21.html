<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff brought Suit No 175 of 2010
                    (“the Suit”) against the defendant pursuant to an
                    “Irrevocable Guaranty and Indemnity” dated 10 August 2004
                    (“the Guaranty”). Summons No 1543 of 2010 (“the
                    Summons”) was the defendant’s application to stay the Suit on the
                    basis that Singapore was not the appropriate forum. The present appeal was
                    brought before me following the learned Assistant Registrar’s dismissal of
                    that application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a US bank licensed to carry on
                    business in Indonesia and elsewhere. The defendant, an Indonesian citizen, is
                    the President Director of PT Permata Hijau Sawit (“PHS”), an
                    Indonesian company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff has a long course of dealing with
                    PHS dating back to 2001. However, for the purposes of the present proceedings,
                    only a handful of agreements are material. The Guaranty, as mentioned above, was
                    signed on 10 August 2004. It was governed by New York law. Pursuant to cl 2 of
                    the Guaranty, the defendant guaranteed certain obligations owed by PHS to the
                    plaintiff. This included obligations arising from agreements including and in
                    connection with an ISDA Master Agreement and a Schedule (“ISDA
                    Agreement”) entered into on 18 May 2001 in respect of multi-currency
                    cross-border transactions between PHS and the plaintiff. New York law also
                    governed the ISDA Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 2 January 2008, the plaintiff sent a letter
                    of offer (“the LO”) to PHS and other companies that were part of
                    the same group offering foreign exchange facilities of up to US$5 million. The
                    defendant accepted the offer on behalf of PHS. However, while the LO originally
                    required a personal guaranty from the defendant and his wife for up to US$ 20
                    million each as well as a corporate guaranty from PHS for the same amount to
                    cover the indebtedness of related companies, the defendant struck out these
                    requirements before signing the document and returning the same to the
                    plaintiff. The only other security asked for in the LO was a standby letter of
                    credit for US$500,000. PHS duly provided this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff and PHS subsequently entered into
                    a Confirmation Agreement dated 5 September 2008 in respect of certain Callable
                    Forward transactions. The Confirmation Agreement was entered into pursuant to
                    the foreign exchange facility granted under the plaintiff’s LO. By its
                    terms, the Confirmation Agreement was to supplement and form part of the ISDA
                    Agreement that the plaintiff and PHS entered into on 18 May 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       PHS incurred a debt to the plaintiff of the sum
                    of US$ 23,146,749.41 in respect of the Callable Forward transactions. It
                    defaulted on this debt. Consequently, in letters dated 22 December 2008 and
                    9 January 2009 respectively, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant pay
                    the sum of US$5,250,000. It alleged that the defendant was required to pay this
                    sum pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 16 January 2009, PHS commenced an action
                    in the District Court of South Jakarta, Indonesia, against the plaintiff for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, a declaration that the Callable
                    Forward transactions were “annulled by law”. On 26 November
                    2009, the District Court handed down the judgment that the Confirmation
                    Agreement and the Callable Forward transactions were null and void on the ground
                    of illegality. PHS and the plaintiff were each ordered to refund money belonging
                    to the other under the respective transactions. The plaintiff appealed this
                    decision. I am given to understand that the District Court’s decision has
                    no executory effect pending the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In Singapore, on 12 March 2010, the
                    plaintiff commenced the Suit against the defendant in respect of the Guaranty.
                    On 7 April 2010, the defendant took out the Summons to stay the Suit on the
                    ground that Singapore was not the convenient or appropriate forum for the
                    determination of the dispute that was the subject matter of the Suit. As
                    mentioned above, the defendant’s application was dismissed, upon which,
                    the present appeal was brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After the Suit was commenced, the defendant
                    filed a second action in the District Court of South Jakarta, Indonesia, seeking
                    an order that the Guaranty was null and void. At the time parties first appeared
                    before me, that second application was still in a nascent state. Later, however,
                    on 9 December 2010, the South Jakarta District Court issued a decision
                    declaring the guaranty null and void. This decision is now under appeal. It is a
                    point to which I will return below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on forum non conveniens</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The general principles governing <em>forum non conveniens</em> have been summarised in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 543 at [25] – [26] (“<em>CIMB</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25     The <em>locus
                            classicus</em> on the question of when a stay would be granted on
                        the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987]
                        AC 460 ("<em>Spiliada</em>"), a decision of the House
                        of Lords where Lord Goff of Chieveley, in delivering the leading judgment,
                        laid down certain guiding principles (at 476-478) for determining the
                        question of <em>forum non conveniens</em> ("the
                            <em>Spiliada</em> test"). Those principles have
                        been adopted by this court in several cases such as <em>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services
                            Indonesia</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 345  ,
                            <em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</em> [1995]
                        2 SLR(R) 851  , <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v
                            Yue Xiu Enterprises</em> (<em>Holdings</em>)
                            <em>Ltd</em> [2001]
                        1 SLR(R) 104   and <em>Rickshaw
                            Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007]
                        1 SLR(R) 377   ("<em>Rickshaw
                            Investments</em>").</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26     The gist of these principles is that,
                        under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, a
                        stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some
                        other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The
                        burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and it is not enough just
                        to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum. The
                        defendant must also establish that there is another available forum which is
                        clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The natural forum is
                        one with which the action has the most real and substantial connection. In
                        this regard, the factors which the court will take into consideration
                        include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the
                        availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing
                        the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or
                        carry on business. If the court concludes, at this stage of the inquiry
                        ("stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test"), that there
                        is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial
                        of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it
                        concludes that there is some other available forum which <em>prima facie</em> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the
                        action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by
                        reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused.
                        In this connection, the court will consider all the circumstances of the
                        case. For this second stage inquiry ("stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test"), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to
                        establish the existence of those special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where no jurisdiction clause is relevant to the dispute, the above
                    principles are applied in a straightforward manner in deciding whether or not a
                    stay ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff submitted, however, that where a
                    jurisdiction clause exists, a different test ought to be applied. It pointed out
                    that cl 13 of the Guaranty gave it (but not the defendant) the specific option
                    to submit any dispute to any court having jurisdiction over the
                    defendant’s assets, which included the courts of Singapore. The plaintiff
                    described cl 13 as a semi-exclusive jurisdiction clause and submitted that in
                    such instances as the present, the appropriate test to apply ought to be the
                    “strong cause” test set out in <em>Baiduri Bank Bhd
                        v Dong Sui Hung and Another</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 271
                        (“<em>Baiduri</em>”). It is this issue of
                    the appropriate test to apply that my attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The court has discretion whether or not to
                    grant a stay on the grounds of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. This discretion exists even when parties have agreed
                    to an exclusive jurisdiction clause (<em>Bambang Sutrisno v Bali
                        International Finance Ltd and others</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 632 at [7] – [9] (“<em>Bambang</em>”)). However, while each case has to be decided
                    within its particular factual matrix, where parties have agreed to litigate
                    exclusively in a forum other than Singapore, a stay would ordinarily be granted
                    unless exceptional circumstances warrant otherwise (see <em>The
                        “Eastern Trust”</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 511 at
                    [8]). Similarly, where a defendant, in breach of an agreement applies for a stay
                    of proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>, the court, while not bound to refuse a stay, would in
                    usual circumstances give effect to the agreement between parties (<em>Bambang</em> at [9]). In <em>Baiduri</em> at [23], I held that where a jurisdiction clause exists
                    that limits jurisdiction to a few countries (including Singapore) but no special
                    or specific right of election or option is given to either party to select which
                    of those countries to proceed in, and where a plaintiff has chosen to litigate
                    here but the defendant prefers another jurisdiction, a court would ordinarily
                    refuse to grant a stay if the foreign forum is not clearly more appropriate for
                    the trial of the action. However, where a jurisdiction clause limits
                    jurisdiction to a few countries (including Singapore), but a special or specific
                    right is conferred on the plaintiff but not on the defendant to select any one
                    of these specified countries to institute his action, a stay would ordinarily
                    not be granted unless the defendant shows strong cause (<em>Baiduri</em> at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The underlying principle of the above
                    scenarios is that where there is an agreement between parties as to choice of
                    jurisdiction, the court would strongly lean in favour of giving effect to the
                    contractual bargain unless exceptional circumstances warrant otherwise (see
                        <em>eg</em>, <em>Golden Shore
                        Transportation Pte Ltd v UCO Bank and another appeal</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 6 at [33] (“<em>Golden
                    Shore</em>”)). By inserting a jurisdiction clause, the parties
                    indicate that they regard certain jurisdictions as more appropriate forums than
                    others. Therefore, where parties have agreed to litigate exclusively in Country
                    A, the balance would lie heavily in favour of finding that Country A is a more
                    appropriate forum and the plaintiff who in breach of that brings an action in
                    Singapore has to show strong cause why he is now reneging on the bargain.
                        <em>Vice versa</em>, where the parties have agreed to
                    litigate only in Singapore, the defendant who wishes to obtain a stay has to
                    convince the court that despite the agreement, there is a more appropriate forum
                    elsewhere. Similarly, where parties agree to litigate in either Singapore or
                    Country A, but no specific right of election is given to either party, a
                    defendant would have to explain his preference for Country A but as the
                    defendant has not promised to litigate in Singapore and nowhere else, the burden
                    of proving a more appropriate forum exists is less onerous than in the case
                    where an exclusive jurisdiction clause exists. For the same reason, where the
                    plaintiff but not the defendant has a specific right to select Singapore or
                    Country A as the forum, the latter will have to explain why the plaintiff may
                    not exercise his entitlement. Ultimately, however, even though the existence of
                    a jurisdiction clause may <em>prima facie</em> weigh the
                    scales more heavily in one direction than another, the court in exercising its
                    discretion must still take into account factors relevant to the particular
                    factual matrix. The above examples are not exhaustive but they are illustrative
                    of two points. First, the court, upon construing the terms of agreement between
                    parties, would ordinarily give effect to those contractual intentions, unless
                    the defendant has strong cause to renege. Second, as endless permutations of
                    jurisdiction clauses are possible and limited only by the ingenuity of the
                    draftsman, each jurisdiction clause has to be construed carefully to determine
                    the precise ambit of the agreement between parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Baiduri</em>, I
                    made a distinction between different types of jurisdiction clauses and the
                    considerations that are pertinent in deciding whether or not a stay ought to be
                    granted when sought on the grounds of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. The plaintiff relied heavily on that case and its
                    categorisation of types of jurisdiction clauses in its argument that the
                    “strong cause” case should apply in situations such as the present
                    where, according to its characterisation of cl 13, a semi-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause exists. I would state, however, that my decision in that case should not
                    be construed as standing for the proposition that jurisdiction clauses ought to
                    be pigeonholed into categories with different tests applicable for each. Rather,
                    different factual circumstances may call for an application of different
                    principles and approaches (<em>Baiduri</em> at [7]), and it
                    would be futile to attempt to exhaustively categorise each scenario. Rather, the
                    basic principle is that in cases involving jurisdiction clauses, a party should
                        <em>prima facie</em> be held to his contractual
                    commitment and has to show exceptional circumstances amounting to strong cause
                    why the court should exercise its discretion in his favour and assist him in
                    breaching his promise to bring the action in the contractual forum (<em>Golden Shore</em> at [33]). The court has to carefully
                    construe what promises parties have made. The test not dissimilar to that set
                    out in <em>Spiliada</em>, but heavily weighted against the
                    party attempting to breach its obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Summarising the above, when a stay is sought
                    on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> principles summarised in <em>CIMB</em> would ordinarily apply. However, where a
                    jurisdiction clause exists, the court has to examine such carefully, and
                    construe the ambit of what was agreed to between parties. The clause will
                    ordinarily weigh heavily in favour of the party seeking to uphold the agreement.
                    However, that does not preclude the grant of a stay where strong cause against
                    enforcing the agreement is shown.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the Guaranty is governed by New York law, cl 13 has to be construed
                    in accordance with such. I accept the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert,
                    Alan Schwartz, that New York courts enforce the plain meaning of contracts, and
                    that the plain meaning of cl 13 gives the plaintiff but not the defendant,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the right to choose a forum to
                    hear a suit on the Guaranty from any one of the forums listed in the Guaranty,
                    including any court having jurisdiction over the defendant’s assets. The
                    purpose of providing that the plaintiff could submit a dispute to a court with
                    jurisdiction over the defendant’s assets was clearly to facilitate
                    recovery in the event that sums became owed to the former. It was not disputed
                    that the defendant had assets in Singapore. This was a factor I gave substantial
                    weight to. The defendant’s application for a stay on the grounds of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> goes against his grant of
                    an option to the plaintiff to bring a suit in any court with jurisdiction over
                    his assets. Accordingly, the onus lay on the defendant to show strong cause why
                    that stay ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In deciding whether there was strong cause to
                    grant a stay, I took into account the factors enumerated in <em>Amerco Timbers Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1977-1978] SLR(R) 112 at [11]. Following <em>The
                        “Hyundai Fortune”</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 548 at
                    [24], I also added to the basket other matters of convenience before deciding
                    whether, in totality, the factors added up to strong cause warranting the stay.
                    However, many of the factors cited by the defendant as support for the
                    proposition that Indonesia was clearly the more appropriate forum were, in my
                    view, of limited weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Like the learned Assistant Registrar, I
                    accepted that in the present circumstances, as parties have chosen to confer on
                    the plaintiff a right to sue based on the location of the defendant’s
                    assets, the relative convenience and expense of trial as between Singapore and
                    the Indonesian courts can only be of limited weight (<em>Golden
                        Shore</em> at [33]). The same reasoning applies to the consideration
                    that the defendant is Indonesian and the subject matter has tenuous connection
                    with Singapore. Moreover, I accepted that on the part of the defendant, the
                    evidence on the issues of fact would mostly come from himself and other
                    documentary evidence already filed in the current proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I took into account the fact that New York law
                    governed the Guaranty that is the central document in the present proceedings,
                    and also the ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule. As the learned assistant
                    registrar reasoned, given that Indonesian proceedings are not conducted in
                    English, it would be arguably more convenient for a Singapore court to deal with
                    documentary evidence arising from those agreements. I did note, however, that
                    the letter of offer of 2 January 2008 may be relevant to the proceedings and
                    that Indonesian law may govern that document (which had no express choice of law
                    clause). It was part of the factors I took into account in determining whether
                    strong cause for the stay existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Two actions have been filed by the defendant
                    and PHS respectively against the plaintiff in Indonesia. I noted, in particular,
                    that the action taken out by the defendant was commenced only <em>after</em> this present action was started in Singapore. At the time
                    the matter first came before me, the action brought by the defendant in
                    Indonesia was still in a nascent stage. The defendant submitted that now that
                    the South Jakarta District Court has issued a decision, it must be taken into
                    consideration in determining whether or not to grant a stay. The proposition is
                    correct. However, I also noted that during the course of the proceedings before
                    me, many delays occurred. On 28 June 2010, when the parties first appeared
                    before me, the defendant’s counsel made an application before me for the
                    filing of affidavits of expert opinions. While these could have been obtained at
                    the stage of the hearing before the learned assistant registrar, the move to
                    secure legal experts was not made by the defendant until late in the day,
                    resulting in a four week delay for the filing of affidavits and further
                    affidavits in reply. On 30 July 2010, the defendant’s counsel wrote in to
                    request a vacation of the hearing date that had been fixed as he wanted to file
                    further response affidavits by the experts. This resulted in a further delay of
                    another four weeks for parties to exchange affidavits. Yet another hearing date
                    was fixed, this time for 6 September 2010, but again had to be vacated, because
                    the defendant’s counsel was on three weeks’ leave. The parties
                    finally appeared before me for the substantive hearing on 18 October 2010. All
                    in all, there had been a delay of almost four months, most of it due to
                    applications on the part of the defendant. In light of this fact, and
                    considering the defendant ought not to profit from dragging his heels, while I
                    took into account the second decision of the South Jakarta District Court, I did
                    not give it as much weight in favour of the defendant as I might otherwise have
                    had.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Given the voluminous affidavits filed by the
                    New York and Indonesian legal experts on both sides, and the various points of
                    disagreement between the opinions rendered, I was unable to say that the
                    defendant had no genuine desire for trial. Without going into the merits, there
                    appeared to be genuine dispute as to the effect of the LO on the Guaranty,
                    whether the Guaranty was spent, and the validity of the Callable Forward
                    transactions in light of the South Jakarta District Court’s decision. The
                    effect of the defendant’s striking out of the requirement of a personal
                    guaranty on the LO also could not be clearly resolved at this procedural stage.
                    With respect to the learned Assistant Registrar, most of the expert evidence
                    before me was not available to him. Despite this, however, the defendant did not
                    manage to explain to my satisfaction why his desire for trial could only be
                    consummated in Indonesia, such that he could not be held to his bargain with the
                    plaintiff in cl 13 that the latter would be granted the option to submit this
                    dispute to any court in any country having jurisdiction over his assets. The
                    plaintiff had in fact duly exercised that option and filed the Suit in Singapore
                    (where the defendant has assets) to have the dispute between them determined
                    accordingly. Most of the defendant’s arguments centred on convenience,
                    which ought to have been taken into account at the time the Guaranty was entered
                    into rather than at this late stage. On the other end of the scale, the
                    plaintiff would now undoubtedly be prejudiced if the stay is granted because it
                    would be deprived of its contractual right to bring an action in a country where
                    the defendant’s assets are located. This right was clearly sought by the
                    plaintiff to facilitate the plaintiff’s debt enforcement and would be
                    rendered nugatory by the grant of the stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Taking all the above into consideration, I did
                    not find that there was strong cause warranting the grant of a stay. The
                    plaintiff had also submitted that under New York law, cl 13 operated as a waiver
                    of the defendant’s right to raise arguments based on <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In light of my decision, there is no need
                    to go further to decide this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Res judicata</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant had submitted that the plaintiff
                    was barred under New York’s doctrine of <em>res
                        judicata</em> from litigating the present action. He relied on the
                    evidence of his New York expert, Leonard A. Rhodes:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Summary of Opinion</u>:    It
                            is my opinion that the Indonesian Judgment bars this action for two,
                            separate but related reasons: (1) Under New York law, the Indonesian
                            Judgment was an “adjudication on the merits;” the claims
                            in the Indonesian case and in this case arise from the same
                            “nucleus of operative fact;” and the parties here were
                            also parties, or in privity with parties, to the Indonesian case.
                            Therefore Citibank is barred from relitigating its right to the [sic]
                            collect the alleged debt under New York’s doctrine of res judicata
                            (or “claim preclusion”). (2) Even under Citibank’s
                            reading of the 2004 Guaranty, Robert has guarantied [sic] only those
                            obligations that actually existed at the time this lawsuit was commenced
                            and because the Indonesian Judgment nullified the Callable Forward
                            agreement and declared it void ab initio, New York’s doctrine of
                            “collateral estoppel” requires this Court to hold that no
                            obligation exists that is subject to the 2004 Guaranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was agreed between parties that finality
                    was a requisite element of the test as to <em>res
                        judicata</em>. The dispute centred on whether the South Jakarta
                    District Court judgment constituted final judgment entered on the merits of the
                    case. This point arose out of the fact that under Indonesian law, the South
                    Jakarta District Court’s judgment, which is under appeal, has no
                    executorial power. As the Indonesian law experts of both parties agreed that the
                    judgment under appeal could not be presently executed, and as the
                    defendant’s New York expert does not appear to have considered the effect
                    of this point on the <em>res judicata</em> argument, I find
                    that there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude that the claim is
                        <em>res judicata</em>. Particularly, I accept the
                    evidence of the plaintiff’s New York law expert, Teresa Rosen Peacocke,
                    that New York gives no more finality to foreign judgments than that given by the
                    issuing jurisdiction. I also note that in the defendant’s third affidavit,
                    at para 16 of the defendant’s Indonesian solicitor’s correspondence
                    with the South Jakarta District Court, it was conceded that “since the
                    issue is still in the legal process, so that it has not yet had permanent legal
                    force, then there is no certainty about the bill of [the plaintiff] in the
                    amount of USD 23,146,749.41”. Similar reasoning applies to the
                    defendant’s contention that I am required to hold that no obligation
                    exists that is subject to the Guaranty. Going back to the <em>res
                        judicata</em> point, I also accepted that the claims adjudicated upon
                    by the South Jakarta District Court and those in the present proceedings differ,
                    although there might be some degree of overlap. The former dealt with the
                    validity of the Callable Forward transactions whereas the present is concerned
