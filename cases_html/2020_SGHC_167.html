</div> The plaintiff thus has not suffered any loss. It should therefore not be entitled to recover damages from the defendant for the Glass Defects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The general rule is, of course, that a plaintiff is entitled to recover damages only for loss which a breach of contract causes the plaintiff itself to suffer. The plaintiff, however, relies on the exceptions to that rule recognised by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chia Kok Leong and another v Prosperland Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 484 (“<span class="font-italic">Prosperland</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court (a firm) v Seah Boon Lock and another (trading as Boon Lock Duck and Noodle House) </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 272 (“<span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">Prosperland</span>, the Court of Appeal considered whether a developer was entitled to recover substantial damages from the architect it engaged to design and supervise the construction of a condominium. By the time of the action, the developer had divested ownership of the condominium to the MCST and the subsidiary proprietors. The developer had not spent any of its own money to repair the defects. And the MCST had not sued the developer in respect of the defects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Court of Appeal held that the developer was nevertheless entitled in principle to recover substantial damages from the architects. In arriving at this holding, Chao Hick Tin JA recognised two exceptions to the general rule set out at [17] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 One exception is the “narrow ground”. This allows a plaintiff to recover substantial damages on behalf of a third party. The narrow ground is applicable where it is in the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting that the plaintiff will transfer its proprietary interest in the subject-matter of the contract to a third party after contracting and before the defendant’s breach occurs. If that is within both parties’ contemplation at the time of contracting, the plaintiff is to be treated in law as having entered into the contract for the benefit of all persons who have or may acquire an interest in the property which is the subject-matter of the contract before it is lost or damaged (<span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>at [12], citing <span class="font-italic">The Albazero </span>[1977] AC 774; <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court </span>at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The second exception to the general rule is the “broad ground”. This ground allows a plaintiff to recover substantial damages for the loss of its performance interest in not receiving the benefit of the bargain for which it contracted. The measure of damages is the cost of securing the performance of that bargain (<span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>at [17] and [19], citing <span class="font-italic">St Martins Property Corporation Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd </span>[1994] 1 AC 85).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The plaintiff submits that it is entitled to recover substantial damages from the defendant under both the “narrow ground” and the “broad ground”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 First, this action is not one between an owner and its architect, as in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland</span>. This action is one between a main contractor and a subcontractor. To extend the exceptions in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>to the present case would be unwarranted. The matrix of legal relationships is such that there is no real risk that a main contractor will be found liable to subsidiary proprietors or their tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Second, <span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>concerned residential property, whereas the present case deals with industrial property. Therefore, the consumer-protection considerations in the <span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>case are not readily applicable to this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Third, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>rested on a proprietary base. The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland</span> had a proprietary interest in the subject-matter of the contract and entered into the contract under a larger transaction in which it intended in due course to convey its proprietary interest to third parties. The fundamental point in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland</span> was that both parties contemplated that the contract they entered into would be for the benefit of those third parties who would ultimately acquire and hold the proprietary interest in the subject-matter of the contract.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I agree with the defendant. In so far as the “narrow ground” exception is concerned, <span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>is distinguishable from the present case. It suffices to rely only on the final ground advanced by the defendant. In this case, the plaintiff is merely a main contractor who has no proprietary interest in the subject-matter of the contract let alone an intent to transfer any such proprietary interest to third parties. I therefore hold that the plaintiff is unable to rely on the “narrow ground” exception to recover substantial damages from the defendant in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, I accept that the plaintiff is entitled to rely on the “broad ground” exception. The “broad ground” exception “constitutes an integral part of the common law of contract where protection of the performance interest – <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the plaintiff/promisee’s interest in the contract being performed and (consequently) his receiving the benefit which he had contracted for – is concerned” (<span class="font-italic">Family Food Court </span>at [34]). Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>went so far as to characterise the “broad ground” exception as “probably more consistent with principle” (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span>, Andrew Phang JA explained that the performance interest claimed by the plaintiff/promisee must be a genuine one. The court will “apply an <span class="font-italic">objective test of reasonableness </span>to the performance interest claimed so as to curb what would otherwise be a windfall accruing to the plaintiff/promisee” (at [53], citing <span class="font-italic">Ruxley Electronics and </span><span class="font-italic">Construction Ltd. v Forsyth</span> [1996] 1 AC 344). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Given that it is “broad ground” which entitles the plaintiff to recover substantial damages for the loss it has suffered in not getting the benefit it contracted for, it <span class="font-italic">should not</span> be a prerequisite for the plaintiff to show that it has already carried out the repairs or intends to do so in order to recover substantial damages (<span class="font-italic">Prosperland </span>at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In other words, the plaintiff has an expectation interest arising from the Subcontract that the defendant will carry out the Works in accordance with the Subcontract. The law of contract will vindicate that interest with an award of substantial damages. The corollary is that the defendant’s breach of contract in itself entitles the plaintiff to recover substantial damages for the loss of its performance interest. The plaintiff’s entitlement to recover substantial damages does not require a proprietary base, whether at the time of contracting, at the time of breach or at the time of action. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Prosperland</span> comprehensively considered concerns about the defendant being exposed to multiple liability for the same breach and deemed them to be more apparent than real (at [29] and [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Hence, the plaintiff is entitled to recover substantial damages from the defendant if the defendant is found to be in breach of the Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Have the Glass Specifications been incorporated into the Subcontract?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The defendant submits that the Glass Specifications were not incorporated into the Subcontract. It advances three arguments. First, the allegation that the Glass Specifications are incorporated into the Subcontract is an afterthought. The plaintiff made no reference to the Glass Specifications as being incorporated into the Subcontract until it amended its pleading almost two years after commencing this action. Second, the plaintiff never gave the defendant a copy of the main contract. Finally, the Glass Specifications came into existence only after the Subcontract.

The plaintiff referred to the Glass Specifications only when it amended its statement of claim in March 2019. The defendant submits that the plaintiff amended its statement of claim to include this plea as an afterthought, only because the experts’ joint report confirmed that the white spots affected only the coating on the dark green panels and that there was no delamination as originally pleaded.

It also explicitly gives the defendant a right to inspect the main contract at the plaintiff’s office. As a matter of law, it is well-established that in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, a party is bound by all the terms of a contract that it signs, even if that party did not read or understand those terms (<span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another </span>[2019] 2 SLR 295 at [58]).

It was always within the defendant’s power to exercise its right under cl 8.1 to inspect the main contract at the plaintiff’s office. The defendant cannot now rely on the plaintiff’s failure to supply a copy of the main contract to disclaim the clear effect of cl 8.1 and to argue that the Glass Specifications were not incorporated into the Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Glass Specifications came into existence after the Subcontract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The defendant’s final argument is that the Glass Specifications came into existence only after the plaintiff and the defendant entered into the Subcontract.

</div> The AS are contained in Volume 2 of the main contract. The defendant argues that July 2014 reflects the date of the creation of the main contract, including the AS, and therefore suggests that the main contract came into existence after the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Glass Specifications incorporated into the Subcontract even if they came into existence after June 2014</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I start by pointing out that there is no principle of law that a document which comes into existence only after a contract is formed cannot be incorporated by reference into that contract. It all depends on the parties’ intention, objectively ascertained from the terms of their contract. Indeed, “it is not uncommon for parties to first agree on a set of essential terms which the parties may be bound by as a matter of law and on the basis of which they may act, even while there may be ongoing discussions on the incorporation of other usually detailed terms” (<span class="font-italic">Lonstroff</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 <span class="font-italic">Lonstroff</span> was, of course, considering ongoing discussions of more detailed terms between the contractual counterparties themselves. But there is no reason in principle why the contractual counterparties may not also agree to incorporate by reference the terms of a future contract which one of the contractual counterparties will negotiate and then enter into with a third party. Whether the terms of that later contract are in fact incorporated into the parties’ earlier contract is simply a matter of contractual construction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thus, for example, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lonstroff </span>had to consider whether an arbitration clause in a detailed contract note which the appellant sent to the respondent was incorporated into a contract which the parties had concluded earlier by an exchange of email confirmations. The Court of Appeal held that the arbitration clause was incorporated into the parties’ earlier contract. That took place because both parties contemplated that the basic terms of the email confirmations would be supplemented by additional terms coming later (at [59]). The Court of Appeal also found that it was the practice in the parties’ industry to discuss and reach binding agreement only the key terms of each trade and for the remaining terms to be agreed and incorporated later (at [60]). In the final analysis, it was clear from the parties’ objective intentions at the time they concluded their contract that more detailed terms would follow and would in fact be incorporated into their contract via the contract note.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I am satisfied that cll 8.1 and 24.1(b) of the Subcontract reflect the parties’ objective intention to incorporate into the Subcontract the specifications relating to the Works which were contained in the main contract, whenever that might come into existence. The plaintiff subcontracted the Works to the defendant as glazing specialists.

</div> The clear reference to “all provisions of the main contract … applicable to the Sub-contract works” and “all main contract … specifications” in cll 8.1 and 24.1(b) of the Subcontract respectively puts it beyond doubt that the parties did intend for certain specifications further to govern the specialised nature of the Works, namely, the design, supply and installation of the glass curtain wall. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Indeed, the Glass Specifications were clearly more detailed terms than those found in the Subcontract that would conceivably govern the Works carried out by the defendant. The Glass Specifications consist of a variety of elements relating generally to glass components and specifically to the glass curtain wall including the quality, appearance of the glass panels, as well as its emissivity coating. It is improbable that the parties intended to exclude from their Subcontract the whole host of specifications and terms relating to the glass curtain wall set out in the Glass Specifications. If they had intended the specifications for the glass curtain wall to be confined to that which was set out in the Subcontract, the Works would be uncommercially bereft of sufficiently detailed specifications. This simply could not have been the objectively ascertained intention of commercial parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) No evidence that the Glass Specifications came into existence after June 2014</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any event, I am not satisfied that the Glass Specifications came into existence after June 2014.

Thus, it was reasonable to conclude that the spots would remain stable.

</div> Additionally, the presence of numerous white spots and specks on the glass panels of the glass curtain wall would necessarily interfere with an occupant’s vision through the glass panels.

The defendant argues that cl 2.2.1(a) of the AS is concerned only with the glass and specifically, the surface of the glass panels rather than the coating applied to the panels, which is the location of the Glass Defects. The plain words of cl 2.2.1(a) concern the edges and the portion of the glass exposed and do not make any reference to the coloured coating applied to the glass panels. Because the Glass Defects arise from the coating and not the glass panels, there can be no breach of cl 2.2.1(a).

While the defendant points out that cl 2.2.1(a)’s reference to “undamaged edges, ground smooth when exposed, and surfaces” necessarily confines its operation to the surface of the glass panels, this should be read in its full context. Clause 2.2.1(a) goes on to provide that that the panels should be “free of bubbles, waves, air holes, scratches and all other defects”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 “Bubbles, waves, air holes [and], scratches” must necessarily intrude into the interior of a glass panel, however minor the intrusion might be. It is difficult to conceive how any one of those defects could be confined to the surface of a glass panel. As defendant’s counsel conceded, quite fairly, even his example of a bubble on the exterior would mean that the glass panel would not be smooth. The corollary of that would be that the bubble could dip into the interior of the glass panel.

</div> Commercially, both the coating and the glass are invariably sold together as a system. I therefore find that the word “glass” in cl 2.2.8(b) of the AS should be read to comprise the glass panel and its coating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Glass panels with bubbles clearly do not meet the specifications in cl 2.2.1(a) of the AS. That specification explicitly requires the glass to be free of bubbles. Further, I accept that the white spots and specks fall within the catch-all words “all other defects” in cl 2.2.1(a). I interpret the word “defects” broadly to encompass imperfections or flaws. After all, it is undisputed that both experts consider these white spots and specks to be – at the very least – aesthetic imperfections or flaws, as set out at [61] above. This of course does not address the further issue of the appropriate measure and quantum of damages. That issue will be central in the assessment of damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I therefore find that the presence of the Glass Defects is a failure by the defendant to meet the specification in cl 2.2.1(a) of the AS.

It is true that there is some delamination in the panels, at least with respect to the bubbles. On the whole, however, I accept the defendant’s submission with respect to cl 2.2.8(b). I do not think that the presence of white spots and specks, even though numerous on certain panels, can be said to “obstruct vision” through the glass. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I note both experts agree in their joint report that the white spots and specks do not affect the functional purpose of the panels, preferring to characterise the effect of the white spots and specks as being aesthetically unacceptable and unsightly.

</div> The white spots and specks vary in terms of number, size and distribution in each glass panel. They are unsightly and translucent, rather than transparent. But whether taken alone or on the whole, they do not rise to the level of obstructing vision through the glass panels. An observer can still see through the glass panels with what would ordinarily be described as unobstructed vision. Indeed, Mr Palaniappan Kannappan (“Mr Kannappan”), the plaintiff’s Project Manager, candidly admitted at trial that notwithstanding the Glass Defects, vision through the glass panels was not obstructed.

The rest of the words of the NPQS refer generally to the coating.

While cl 3.3.7(b) does provide that coating will be uniform in colour, there is no basis in its words for restricting its operation to the time the coating is applied or the time the panels are installed. Thus, a coating which complies with cl 3.3.7(b) at the time it is applied must not cease to be “nominally neutral in colour” or to be “uniform in tone, hue, texture, pattern and opacity” after application by reason of any cause intrinsic to the coating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It has been established that the white spots and specks arise from a discolouration of the dark green coating.

</div> at the material time, Mr Wong Kwek Min (“Mr Wong”), show clearly that the affected panels lack a consistent appearance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I therefore find that the presence of the Glass Defects means that the defendant failed to meet the specification in cl 3.3.7(c) of the NPQS. The defendant is therefore in breach of the Subcontract in this respect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has Appendix A been incorporated into the Subcontract?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The defendant submits that Appendix A is not incorporated into the Subcontract. This is because cl 24.1 of the Subcontract, which refers to a list of documents that form part of the Subcontract, fails to refer to Appendix A at all. Instead, the only documents that it refers to are (a) the letter of award and the attached warranties format in Appendix C, (b) all main contract documents, drawings and specifications containing, relating and/or concerning the Subcontract works scope and (c) the defendant’s test results, technical data and drawings that are approved by the architect. As the contracting parties failed to include Appendix A in the list in cl 24.1, it must necessarily mean that the contracting parties did not intend Appendix A to be incorporated into the Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The defendant’s argument is an overly technical one. I reject it. I do not think that the omission of the reference to Appendix A in cl 24.1 of the Subcontract is any indication at all that parties did not intend Appendix A to be incorporated into the Subcontract. I accept Mr Cheng’s explanation that the express reference to Appendix C in cl 24.1 of the Subcontract is supplementary and was included in order to specify the format of the deed of warranty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Moreover, even though cl 24.1 of the Subcontract makes no reference to Appendix A, it does make express reference to the letter of award and expressly incorporates the entire letter of award into the Subcontract by reference. A closer review of the letter of award reveals several objective indications that Appendix A is an integral part of the letter of award and therefore incorporated into the Subcontract by the reference to the letter of award. The applicable legal principles are once again those summarised at [34]–[35] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91  First, the running page numbers located at the bottom of each page of the letter of award reflects that the entire document consists of 20 pages. Appendix A appears at pages 9 to 13. It clearly forms part of the 20-page letter of award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Second, the same reference number, GAE/55LOR17/SC/14-09 appears in a running header on the top left-hand corner of each page of the letter of award, including Appendix A. That is a strong objective indicator that each and every one of the 20 pages was meant to form part of the letter of award and thereby to be incorporated by reference into the Subcontract. In fact, it is undisputed that the letter of award which the plaintiff sent to the defendant did include Appendix A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Third and most importantly, each page of the letter of award was signed by the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s authorised representatives. Each page was impressed with each company’s official company seal. If the parties did not intend for Appendix A to form part of the letter of award, they would not have signed it or impressed their seal upon it. Both parties’ signatures on Appendix A coupled with their signatures on each of the other pages of the letter of award is highly probative evidence of the parties’ objective intention that Appendix A was to form an integral part of the letter of award, and therefore of the Subcontract pursuant to cl 24.1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I am therefore satisfied that Appendix A has been incorporated into the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has there been a breach of the Appendix A Specification?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiff argues that as a result of the Glass Defects, and in particular, the white spots and specks, the defendant breached the Appendix A specification that the glass panels installed have to achieve a shading coefficient value of 0.26. The function of the coloured coating is to block or control the amount of light and heat energy passing through the glass panels and into the interior of the building. The white spots and specks in the coating have compromised the coating’s function and its ability to block or control the amount of light and heat energy passing through the glass panels.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I reject the defendant’s submission. The submission conflates the cause of the <span class="font-italic">defendant’s</span><span class="font-italic"> breach of contract </span>with the cause of <span class="font-italic">t</span><span class="font-italic">he plaintiff’s loss</span>. Liability in contract is strict. The cause of the defendant’s breach of contract is irrelevant. A plaintiff claiming damages for breach of contract need prove only the <span class="font-italic">fact</span> of the defendant’s breach. The plaintiff is not required to go further and prove the <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of the defendant’s breach of contract. The only causation burden which lies on a plaintiff in a contractual claim is to show that the <span class="font-italic">loss </span>which the plaintiff claims to have suffered was caused by the defendant’s breach of contract: see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) at paras 17.002 and 17.087. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The authorities that the defendant cites to support its submission do not assist it. For example, the defendant refers to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 at [63]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, there is no reason why the “but for” test in tort cannot also be used in contract cases to determine the issue of causation <span class="font-italic">in fact</span>. Indeed, in the cases cited in the preceding paragraph, the application of the “but for” test would have yielded the same result as that decided by the courts in a commonsensical manner. For instance, in reference to the facts cited in <span class="font-italic">Monarch Steamship</span>, it could not be said that “but for” the shipowner’s breach, the claimants suffered damage to their goods as that damage would still ensue <span class="font-italic">even if </span>there was no breach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, we adopted the tortious test for causation in fact in considering the issue of causation in SME”s claims in <span class="font-italic">both </span>tort and contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 However, in the paragraph above, it is clear that the court was concerned there with whether the breach of contract had caused the loss suffered by the plaintiff rather than ascertaining the cause of the breach of contract in the first place. Thus Andrew Phang JC (as he then was) observed at [64] that “[f]or the determination of whether a defendant’s wrongful conduct is a cause <span class="font-italic">in fact of the damage to a claimant, </span>the test, which has almost universal acceptance, is the so-called “but for” test” [emphasis added]. The defendant’s reference to <span class="font-italic">Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 427 is similarly unhelpful. The Court of Appeal there was likewise concerned with applying the “but for” test of causation to demonstrate the necessary causal link between the breach and the loss claimed by the plaintiff (at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It has not been suggested that the cause of the Glass Defects is anything other than the features intrinsic to the glass itself. Since the defendant’s obligation under the Subcontract is to supply, deliver and install glass panels for the glass curtain wall that meet the contractual specifications, its failure to do is a breach of the Subcontract. It does not matter why the defendant is in breach. Determining the cause, or more specifically the mechanics of the Glass Defects, is not an element that the plaintiff has to demonstrate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As I have found at [74], [84] and [87] above, I am satisfied that the defendant has breached the Subcontract by failing to meet those specifications. The plaintiff is under no burden to prove the cause of its failure to meet those specifications. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the plaintiff prevent the defendant from rectifying the Glass Defects?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I now turn to consider the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff prevented the defendant from rectifying the Glass Defects on various occasions. The defendant’s argument is two-pronged. First, the plaintiff would not allow the defendant to rectify the glass panels without first providing documents that it was not contractually obliged to provide such as purchase orders, shipment documents, rectification schedules and a confirmation of the number of glass panels to be ordered. Second, the plaintiff failed to cooperate with the defendant by not allowing the defendant to obtain glass samples for testing and investigation.

A common thread throughout the correspondence between the parties was the plaintiff’s reiteration to the defendant that the defendant ought not to expect the plaintiff to approve a request for access to carry out replacement works which was made on the day of the intended works. Advance notice should to be given, especially in light of the fact that some of the units containing the Glass Defects had already been handed over to the subsidiary proprietors. Similarly, the request for the defendant to provide copies of purchase orders and shipping advice of the replacement glass panels, a copy of glass measurements, quantities and locations as well as a schedule from ordering to delivery to installation were all perfectly reasonable requests. This would invariably help facilitate the flow of replacement works, especially in light of the fact that by July 2016, several units had already been handed over to the various subsidiary proprietors.

</div> In an email sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors to the defendant’s solicitors on 12 September 2017, the plaintiff was clear that it had no objections to the defendant retrieving glass panel samples for analysis, provided certain requirements were met. These requirements included conditions such as requiring the defendant to specify the institution or laboratory to which the glass panels would be sent for analysis, ensuring that representatives of the institution or laboratory be present at the building premises to receive the glass panel samples and ensuring that the replacement glass panels conform to the contractual specifications. At trial, Mr Jeyalingam interpreted the latter requirement as referring to the temporary glass panels that had to be installed. He complained that it was “ridiculous” for the plaintiff to require even panels which were purely temporary to conform to the Subcontract specifications. Yet, the defendant did not make any such objection at the time the letter was sent.

The defendant is right that a literal reading of cl 2.6 – and of the phrase “as and when required” within it – suggests that the plaintiff is entitled to ask for as-built drawings at any time. But that does not in itself mean that cl 2.6 is uncertain. The most that can be said is that cl 2.6 is capable of operating unreasonably or uncommercially. Even then, a contextual interpretation of cl 2.6, bolstered by industry practice, suffices to alleviate any unreasonable or uncommercial consequences which may arise from a literal interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131  As-built drawings reflect the completed state of works in a building and are required for submission to the relevant authorities to obtain statutory approvals. It is consistent with that commercial purpose that as-built drawings can and will ordinarily be asked for and prepared only after construction works are complete. Mr Kannappan did however accept that as-built drawings may sometimes be prepared while construction works are ongoing.

On that interpretation, and on the facts of this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to call for the as-built drawings. The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s conduct was inconsistent. On the one hand, it asked for the as-built drawings, suggesting that the Works had been completed to its satisfaction. On the other hand, it was at the same time asking the defendant to rectify defects, suggesting that the Works had not yet been completed to its satisfaction.

This is because cl 2.12 purports to impose upon the defendant an obligation to provide the 10-year joint warranty as and when required by the plaintiff, the architect and the consultants. That means that the plaintiff can demand the warranty at any time, even before the Works are carried out. As the joint warranty is to remain effective for 10 years from the date of completion of the main contract, it is imperative that the completion date be known to all parties involved before the warranty can be provided. According to the defendant, the words “as and when required” in cl 2.12 are illogical, incapable of meaning or interpretation and thus make it impossible for the warranty to be furnished if called upon before that date being known or finalised.

At least in relation to cl 2.6 of the Subcontract, the defendant could argue that the as-built drawings by definition cannot depict what does not yet exist. But cl 2.12 is entirely different in nature. A 10-year joint warranty can be signed at any time. It can even be signed before the start date of the warranty is known. It is entirely possible for the defendant to warrant today but for it to only take effect in the future.

Further, a contextual interpretation akin to that employed for cl 2.6 suffices to remedy any interpretive gap between what is possibly meant and what is probably meant in the industry by the phrase “as and when required” in cl 2.12.

The defendant thus considered it justifiable to hold the warranty hostage, as a form of leverage. Indeed, Mr Jeyalingam candidly admitted this at trial.

Although I consider this in greater detail in respect of the Completion Issue below at [226]–[241], it is clear from the correspondence between the parties and the payment responses from the plaintiff that the plaintiff’s requests to the defendant related only to defects arising from the defendant’s completed Works rather than any outstanding Works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 For example, in its 26 August 2016 letter to the defendant asking for the 10-year joint warranty, the plaintiff also provided a list of “outstanding” Works. However, the list comprised only the as-built drawings, the water tightness report, the replacement of the seventh storey door and the Glass Defects.

</div> Apart from this, the plaintiff made no further reference to any works which had yet to be completed. It would be reasonable to assume that the plaintiff considered the defendant to have completed the Works. The list was referring to the rectification of defects in the completed Works, which was an entirely distinct issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The defendant’s argument is that it is incongruous for the plaintiff to demand on one hand, the replacement of the glass curtain wall, and on the other, to ask the plaintiff to provide the 10-year joint warranty. This argument too is misconceived. The crux of the argument is as follows: if the plaintiff deems the Works to be unacceptable, on what basis can it ask the defendant to issue the joint warranty? I accept the plaintiff’s submission in response that there is no reason why the plaintiff’s rejection and request for rectification of the defendant’s defective Works should excuse the defendant from its separate and independent obligation to provide the joint warranty pursuant to cl 2.12 of the Subcontract.

</div> These are entirely distinct obligations that protect distinct interests: the joint warranty is to ensure that the plaintiff and the defendant are jointly liable for any defects that <span class="font-italic">may</span> arise during the 10-year period after completion of the Works whereas the contractual entitlement for the plaintiff to demand rectification of completed Works with defects that have <span class="font-italic">already </span>arisen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Finally, even if the plaintiff had unjustifiably withheld moneys payable to the defendant under the Subcontract, this would not justify the defendant’s decision to withhold the 10-year joint warranty and somehow insulate it from contractual liability for breach of cl 2.12. Simply put, a party’s breach of a contractual obligation does not excuse the other party’s breach of a separate contractual obligation – the operative word being “separate” – one breach does not, in itself, justify another breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I therefore find that by failing to provide the plaintiff with the 10-year joint warranty, the defendant breached cl 2.12 of the Subcontract.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Water Tightness Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The plaintiff contends that the defendant’s failure to ensure that the glass curtain wall and/or the aluminium and glazing works were sufficiently watertight constitutes a breach of cl 2.2 and Appendix A of the Subcontract.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I accept the defendant’s submission as to the correct interpretation of cl 5.1 of the Subcontract. Clause 5.1 obliges the defendant to execute its works “in accordance with the drawings as well as to the satisfaction of the architect, Developer and/or the Main Contractor/Contractor”. Where drawings have been approved, the defendant is not in breach of cl 5.1 unless it deviates from the approved drawings. Commercially speaking, it is clear that neither the architect nor the plaintiff should be entitled to allege a breach of contract where the defendant has complied with approved shop drawings. To interpret cl 5.1 otherwise would effectively grant the architect or the plaintiff an unfettered contractual right to demand variations disguised as rectifications. This would render cl 13.1 of the Subcontract, governing variation works, entirely otiose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The key factual issues for me to decide are thus whether the shop drawings were approved and whether the plaintiff unreasonably prevented the defendant from carrying out the replacement works. A further question was raised at trial, which is whether the plaintiff actually incurred the costs which it claims to replace the doors. That question is one which goes to quantum. I therefore leave an analysis of that question to the assessment of damages should I find the defendant liable for a breach of the Subcontract in this respect. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the 20 April 2016 email contain approved shop drawings?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The defendant’s key argument is that it supplied and installed the seventh-storey doors in accordance with approved shop drawings.

</div> Indeed, the defendant accepted the non-compliance and agreed to change the doors.

I am not persuaded by Mr Jeyalingam’s explanation. One reason is that by 19 July 2016, the TOP had already been issued (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> on 29 June 2016). Another reason is that Mr Jeyalingam’s explanation would make sense only if a subcontractor placed the order to help the main contractor meet the TOP, but the subcontractor would not bear the expense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I accept that it is common in the construction industry for works to proceed without agreement as to payment in order not to jeopardise a handover date.

</div> It was the plaintiff who unreasonably ignored the defendant and precipitously engaged a third party to replace the doors. The plaintiff, having replaced the doors unilaterally, cannot now hold the defendant liable for the plaintiff’s alleged loss. The defendant relies, in particular, on the contemporaneous emails exchanged by the parties. This comprises the plaintiff’s email on 24 October 2016, which the defendant says the plaintiff asked the defendant to agree to replace the seventh-storey doors by “the close of business on this Wednesday, 26 October 2016”.

It is clear that the plaintiff’s request in the email for the defendant to provide a “positive response by the close of business on this Wednesday, 26 October 2016”, failing which it would “approach a third party” to carry out replacement works, was not a reference to the seventh-storey doors. Rather, the plaintiff asked the defendant to carry out rectification and replacement works for the glass panels in the glass curtain wall that had begun to show “glass delamination/glass bubbles/specks/spots/dots issues in the units”.

Thus, the void space was filled with an aluminium composite panel. At trial, Mr Tan elaborated that this was because of a difference in the site condition and the drawing condition.
