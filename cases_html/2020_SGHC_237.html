</div> where a bus conveying the plaintiff and other workers to work collided with a stationary tipper lorry that was illegally parked along the left lane. The collision took place at night on a road that was not brightly lit, and the lights of the lorry were not turned on. Justice Kan Ting Chiu found the driver of the illegally parked lorry to be 20% liable for the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Kan J considered two previous decisions (<span class="font-italic">Yang Xi Na </span>at [17]) – <span class="font-italic">Dymond</span><span class="font-italic"> v Pearce</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[1972] 1 QB 496 (“<span class="font-italic">Dymond</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Chop Seng Heng v </span><span class="font-italic">Thevannasan and others</span> [1975] 2 MLJ 3 (“<span class="font-italic">Chop Seng Heng</span>”).  In <span class="font-italic">Dymond</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a lorry was parked beneath a street lamp; the width of the lorry was just under 1/3 of the width of the carriageway, and the tail lights of the lorry were switched on. A motorcyclist collided into the lorry. At first instance and on appeal, the accident was found to be wholly attributable to the negligence of the motorcyclist, and the motorcyclist’s claim against the lorry driver failed. A majority in the Court of Appeal regarded the parked lorry to be a nuisance, but the court unanimously found that it was not the cause of the accident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 <span class="font-italic">Chop Seng Heng </span>was a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Federal Court of Malaysia. A moving lorry collided into a stationary lorry at 3am. The stationary lorry was parked along a winding road, with its lights on; conditions were misty with reduced visibility at the time. The trial judge found that the primary cause of the accident was the driver of the stationary lorry having parked it too near the exit of a blind corner, but he also found that the driver of the moving lorry had driven it around that blind corner “a bit fast in the circumstances”. The trial judge thus found the driver of the parked lorry and his employer 75% liable, and the driver of the moving lorry and his employer 25% liable. That was reversed on appeal to the Federal Court, with a majority finding that the driver of the moving lorry and his employer were wholly liable. However, Ong Hock Thye CJ dissented – he would instead have held the obstructionists wholly liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Privy Council reversed the Federal Court’s decision and restored the trial judge’s finding. Lord Edmund-Davies, delivering the decision of the court, affirmed the dissenting judgment of Ong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Chan Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Khee v Lai Siew San and others</span> [1971] 1 MLJ 253 at 254–255:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If parking a car, however recklessly, so as to cause needless obstruction to other road-users, were to be held blameless, merely because other motorists could still have room to pass, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">provided they kept a proper look-out</span>, then it would appear that the deliberate park of a car anywhere, even in the middle of the highway, should be considered equally excusable, if not justifiable, regardless of the fact that, by reason of such obstruction, other motorists had come to grief by reason of their being not fully alert. In such cases there should, in my opinion, be proper apportionment of blame, depending on the circumstances. But, to exonerate the obstructionist completely – when it is undeniable that, but for the presence of the obstruction, there could not possibly been an accident – is to ignore the principle of placing the blame fairly on those to be blamed for their acts or omissions. In this age of fast motor transport I think it is the duty of the courts to eschew excessive legalism and to require that every motorist should observe the golden rule of shewing due consideration for other road-users, or suffer the consequences of his failure to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed, but in the alternative, that he should not bear more than 10%–20% liability if there was some delay in his reaction on account of his being admittedly sleepy at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Lim Kar Bee v Abdul Latif Bin Ismail</span> [1978] 1 MLJ 109 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kar Bee</span>”), where a motorcyclist who had swerved left to avoid a child who had stepped into his path collided into steel pipes that had been left by the defendant close to the side of the road for some two years. The trial judge found that the motorcyclist had not been negligent and that the defendant was wholly liable. That decision was upheld by a majority in the Federal Court, with Ong Hock Sim FJ dissenting – he would instead have held the motorcyclist wholly liable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings on liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The judicial opinions in these cases range from the driver of the moving vehicle being wholly liable, to him not being liable at all.

The rear of the lorry had not been covered up with the canvas sheet, and the goods in the lorry were not properly secured by ropes either. The plaintiff then stopped the lorry and left it stationary in lane 3 for quite some time (about 15–30 minutes; see [18] above), while he and Mr Chew went about retrieving the goods. It was only after the plaintiff and Mr Chew had spent some time retrieving the goods that the plaintiff started securing the canvas sheet to the lorry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It appears that the plaintiff regarded the lorry with its hazard lights on and the goods as sufficient warnings to oncoming traffic. However, the lorry was in lane 3 and so were the goods that had fallen behind it, whereas the plaintiff had been standing in lane 2 at the time he was hit, and there was nothing to warn oncoming traffic approaching on that lane.

</div> The plaintiff worsened the situation by standing in the shadow cast by the lorry, which made him more difficult to spot from the perspective of a driver of an oncoming vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Even if the plaintiff had intended to use the lorry to warn oncoming traffic of the goods on the road, he ought to have set up a warning sign as well, but he did not. Moreover, the plaintiff could have served as a lookout, or he could have asked Mr Chew to alert oncoming traffic or at least watch out for their own safety, but that was not done. Instead, they apparently thought they were quite safe, even though they were walking about in the middle of an expressway.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The lorry and the fallen goods obstructed lane 3 of a four-lane highway, and were a hazard not only to oncoming traffic, but also to the plaintiff himself, as oncoming traffic in lane 3 (like the defendant’s car) might move into lane 2 (where the plaintiff eventually stood) to avoid the obstructions in lane 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The plaintiff claimed to have checked for oncoming traffic before he stepped out into lane 2, but this was not stated in his AEIC or his police report.

</div> As such, I doubt that the plaintiff had checked for oncoming traffic, as he claimed. But even if he had checked for oncoming traffic, after he last did so, he was focused on securing the canvas sheet to the side of the lorry and was not looking out for oncoming traffic. Mr Chew estimated that some ten seconds elapsed after he last saw the plaintiff at the back of the lorry; in that time, a car travelling at 80km/h (the speed limit there) would cover around 222m (at 22.22m/s).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Mr Hunter’s opinion was that at night, under street lighting conditions, one would have at best 60m of clear visibility.

</div> The fact that the defendant did not notice the stationary lorry at all, although the lorry was illuminated by a nearby street lamp and the lorry’s hazard lights were on, also supports the conclusion that he had failed to keep a proper lookout (whether because he was sleepy or otherwise). I do not accept the defendant’s submission that his failure to notice the lorry was irrelevant just because he had not collided into the lorry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Further, the defendant had pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, an offence of driving without due care and attention. He admitted that he had failed to keep a proper lookout ahead, resulting in the collision with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Under s 45A(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), the fact of the defendant’s conviction is admissible for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any issue in the proceedings, that he committed that offence; under s 45(3) of the Evidence Act, unless the contrary is proved, he shall be taken to have committed the acts and to have possessed the state of mind which at law constitute that offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Moreover, the defendant’s plea of guilt amounts to an admission by him. A court can, however, examine the reasons behind a party deciding to admit to an offence – <span class="font-italic">Ong Bee Nah v Won Siew Wan (Yong Tian Choy, third party)</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [67]–[83], a case which similarly concerned an offence of driving without due care or consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Here, the defendant was fined $800 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of six months, which would have affected his part-time employment as a private-hire driver. The defendant would not have lightly pleaded guilty if he considered himself blameless.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Although the defendant gave various reasons for pleading guilty, he acknowledged that he should bear some, but not full, responsibility for colliding with the plaintiff (see [31]–[33] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Had the defendant not been sleepy and had he kept a proper lookout, he might very well have noticed the goods and the lorry earlier, reacted sooner, given the obstructions a wider berth, and avoided colliding with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Nevertheless, in taking evasive action to avoid the goods on the road, the defendant also avoided the lorry (even though he did not notice the lorry at the time). Unfortunately, that took him on a collision course with the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s presence in the next lane, in the shadow of the lorry, played a crucial part in the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 At an earlier point in the proceedings, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had been speeding,
