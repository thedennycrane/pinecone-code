</div> The Prosecution argued that the alleged transaction took place inside the Car while Crocker was being transported from The Cathay to Grange Road. On this basis, the element of trafficking would be made out.  The existence of the alleged transaction itself would also prove possession sufficient to invoke the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. The Prosecution further submitted that the presumption under s 18(2) remains unrebutted by Ramdhan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In support of the case that the alleged transaction took place, the Prosecution made several arguments. The arguments are summarised below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Crocker testified at trial that he had passed $9,200 to Ramdhan in exchange for the D10 bundles whilst in the car. This directly proved the existence of the alleged transaction. His testimony was also consistent with his statements given to the police.

If it is proved that the alleged transaction did take place, the act of trafficking would be made out. Additionally, this would allow the Prosecution to rely on the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA to satisfy the knowledge element of the s 5(1)(a) trafficking charge, as Ramdhan would have been in possession of the D10 bundles in the course of the transaction (see [33] above).

</div> Crocker arrived at the Cathay at Handy Road at “about 12.00-something” and called Ramdhan. Ramdhan arrived by car, driven by someone unfamiliar to him. He entered the car and sat in the left rear passenger seat. Ramdhan was sitting in the front passenger seat. While inside the car, Ramdhan gave Crocker the yellow slim bag containing the D10 bundles and Crocker passed Ramdhan an envelope containing $9,200.

It was at the petrol station where Ramdhan decided that he wanted to arrange for lunch with Crocker and Firaza. Thus, he telephoned Crocker. During the telephone call, he did not ask Crocker for lunch, as Crocker had asked for a lift from the Cathay.

According to Crocker, the trip in the Car was for the purposes of facilitating the alleged transaction. This would explain why Ramdhan and Firaza felt the need to drive a significant distance just to give Crocker a comparatively short lift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In contrast, I find Ramdhan’s alternative explanation for the trip to be highly implausible. To reiterate, Ramdhan’s explanation for the trip was that he initially intended to ask Crocker for lunch, however, after calling Crocker, he decided to provide Crocker a lift from the Cathay to Grange Road. Based on the records of the CNB officers tailing the Car, the trip from the Cathay to Grange Road took a mere 5 minutes.

</div> It was clear that the trip from Toa Payoh to the Cathay took a longer period of time. I note that the Cathay is within walking distance of Dhoby Ghaut MRT station while Grange Road is within walking distance of Somerset MRT station. These two locations are essentially one MRT station apart from each other. If Crocker only needed to travel from the Cathay to Grange Road, he could simply have walked to Grange Road or alternatively travelled via the MRT. This would have taken a similar or shorter amount of time compared to troubling Ramdhan to travel from Toa Payoh to pick him up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Additionally, Ramdhan’s explanation is also implausible given his relationship with Crocker.

</div> One would expect that if Ramdhan truly intended to have lunch in Orchard, they would have parked the car somewhere in the Orchard area and proceeded with their initial plans after dropping Crocker off.

Ramdhan only started counting the money after Crocker had left the Car. By Ramdhan’s account, this money was collected from debtors a day before.  If this were true, one would have expected him to count the money soon after collecting the money from the debtors, to ensure that the correct amounts were paid. Instead, he chose to count the money immediately after Crocker left the car. It is far more likely that Ramdhan choose this time to count the money as this would be immediately after he had received the money from Crocker. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Firaza’s testimony</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Ramdhan’s own Defence Witness, Firaza, gave an account of events different from that of Ramdhan.

</div> This suggests that neither Crocker nor Ramdhan’s fingerprints were detected on the envelope. Despite this, Ramdhan had testified that he had taken money out of the A1 envelope just prior to his arrest. Moreover, it was Ramdhan’s own case that he had handled the A1 envelope the day before his arrest by placing moneylending monies into the envelope.

If these were truly moneylending monies, the money would have been arranged in a manner corresponding to the sums returned by the individual debtors (i.e. in a stack of $3,900 and a stack of $5,300). Instead, they were arranged as Crocker had described. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Before concluding my finding on the reliability of Crocker and Ramdhan’s respective accounts, I pause to note that counsel for Ramdhan argued that Crocker’s testimony was not credible for two reasons. First, Crocker was dishonest on his level of drug consumption. Second, pursuant to illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“illustration (b)”), Crocker’s evidence should be treated with caution as Crocker was a co-accused. I reject both arguments for the reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The fact that Crocker could have been dishonest about his level of drug consumption does not render the entirety of his testimony unreliable. It is not inconsistent to suggest that certain portions of an accused’s testimony are reliable and other parts are not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The fact that Crocker is a co-accused does not automatically discredit his testimony. Illustration (b) states that “the court <span class="font-italic">may</span> presume that the evidence of an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution” [emphasis added]. This illustration is phrased in discretionary terms. Additionally, I note that despite illustration (b), it is open to the court to convict an accused <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on the basis of a co-accused’s testimony, although in such circumstances it may be relevant to consider the incentive that the co-accused might have in giving evidence against the accused (see <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Gous v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 820 at [59]). In the present case, Ramdhan is not being convicted solely on the basis of Crocker’s testimony. As I have explained (see above at [61]–[71]), Crocker’s evidence is amply corroborated by the objective evidence available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In any event, there was no evidence to even suggest that Crocker had a motive to implicate Ramdhan. At trial Crocker fully admitted to possessing drugs for the purposes of reselling to other individuals. His only defence was a consumption defence and identifying the individual who had passed Crocker the drugs was irrelevant to this defence. There was also no evidence that Crocker harboured any animosity towards Ramdhan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Therefore, based on a consideration of all the points mentioned above from [52] to [75], I find that Crocker’s account is believable and reliable, and I find that Ramdhan’s testimony should not be relied upon. On this basis, the key issue of whether the alleged transaction had taken place is sufficiently resolved in favour of the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 However, in addition to the points raised above, the issue of the probative value of certain phone records and Surani’s alleged involvement was hotly contested at trial. For the sake of completeness, I will now turn to consider this issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The mobile phone records and Surani’s involvement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Prosecution argued that Crocker’s testimony was further corroborated by the objective phone records that showed a pattern of interchanging phone calls between Surani, Crocker and Ramdhan on the morning of 19 March 2014, which corroborated Crocker’s testimony that Surani had arranged for a drug transaction between Ramdhan and himself.

</div>
</div>
</div> There was a distinct possibility that “Bee Hock” was merely a codeword or a nickname crafted based on the first letter “B” of the name “Bujang” for “Bee” and “Hock” as a homophone of the word “Hawk”. Ramdhan claimed that “Bee Hock” was the name of an illegal cigarette seller in Geylang whom he bought cigarettes from regularly. I reject this claim for four reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was unlikely that Crocker would have known of the same illegal cigarette seller from Geylang. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was even more unlikely that Crocker would have chosen to save the contact of the purported illegal cigarette seller as “Bujang” which just happened to be Surani’s nickname. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ramdhan’s claim would lead to the incredible coincidence that this purported illegal cigarette seller had randomly sent Crocker a string of numbers via text message that happened to correspond with Surani’s personal bank account number. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On top of (a)–(c), it was unrealistic that Crocker, Ramdhan and this purported illegal cigarette seller would have happened to be in regular contact on the day of the alleged transaction.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I note that the Prosecution had urged me to draw an adverse inference against Ramdhan pursuant to s 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) for failing to call the purported illegal cigarette seller as a witness. Illustration (g) states that the court may presume “that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it”. I decline to exercise my discretion to draw an adverse inference as the present case does not rise to meet the exceptional circumstances required for such an inference to be drawn against an accused (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Farid bin Mohd Yusop</span> [2015] 3 SLR 16 at [47]). Nevertheless, even without the adverse inference, on the strength of the points at [83]–[85] above, I find that Surani was using a mobile phone bearing the number 81463432 at the material time.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Second, there was no motive for Crocker to implicate the Surani. In fact, Surani claimed that Crocker was his good friend.

</div>  Conversely, there was a motive for Surani and Ramdhan to disclaim any suggestion that there was a flurry of telephone calls between Crocker, Ramdhan and Surani, since this would implicate them in criminal activities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Third, the fact that the Prosecution had applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of a drug trafficking charge against Surani is not fatal to their case. Given that the charge could be reinstated against Surani at any time, the discharge not amounting to acquittal was not necessarily inconsistent to the Prosecution’s case that Surani was the coordinator of the alleged transaction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Fourth, while Surani claimed that Crocker wrote the AGC letter (which purported to exonerate Surani) willingly and Crocker claimed that he was pressured into writing it,

</div> regardless of Crocker’s motivations for writing the AGC letter, I find that the existence of the AGC letter was of little probative value, given that it was contradicted by several other pieces of evidence. The AGC letter, which was not admitted into evidence, was clearly contradicted by Crocker’s statements to the police on the day of his arrest, as well as his subsequent testimony at trial, where he implicated Surani. The AGC letter was also contradicted by objective bank records

</div> Surani claimed that Crocker was depositing the money purely as an act of charity. However, I note that the deposit of these sums would corroborate Crocker’s testimony that he was giving sums of money ranging between $200 to $300 as commissions for facilitating drug transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Therefore, I find that Surani did coordinate the transaction between Crocker and Ramdhan. This provides useful context as to how Crocker and Ramdhan had arranged the alleged transaction, and further fortifies my conclusion that the alleged transaction did take place in the manner described by Crocker.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Finding on Ramdhan’s guilt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Given my finding that the alleged transaction did take place, I am of the view that the Prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of trafficking had taken place. For similar reasons, the Prosecution has also successfully invoked the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA to establish that Ramdhan had the requisite degree of knowledge, since Ramdhan was in possession of the bundles in the course of the alleged transaction. Ramdhan did not adduce any evidence to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. Accordingly, the charge against Ramdhan is made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Crocker’s guilt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Crocker was charged with having in his possession 29.51 grams of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (see [1] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Crocker was found in possession of the D10 bundles. He admitted to having knowledge of the contents of the D10 bundles. There was no dispute on either of these two points. Hence, the elements of possession and knowledge were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. What is in dispute was whether the entire quantity of drugs in the D10 bundles was in Crocker’s possession for the purposes of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Prosecution argued that Crocker had intended to sell the entirety of the D10 bundles. They based this position primarily on Crocker’s contemporaneous statements, where he made no mention of intending to keep any portion of the D10 bundles for his own consumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the alternative, the Prosecution urged this court to find that Crocker only intended to keep a 2-week supply of heroin, with a daily rate of consumption of 5 grams. This would still put the amount of drugs that Crocker intended to traffic at above the capital weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Crocker’s case was that while some of the heroin in the D10 bundles was for the purpose of sale, he had intended to consume a significant amount of the heroin in the D10 bundles. This would have reduced the amount of drugs that he intended to traffic below the capital weight of 15 grams of diamorphine. Based on the fact the D10 bundles contained 902.5 grams of heroin which was analysed to contain 29.51 grams of diamorphine, Crocker’s case in essence was that he had intended to consume more than 443 grams of heroin, close to 50% of the amount of heroin in the D10 bundles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I pause at this juncture to note that counsel for Crocker also argued that Crocker was suffering from such abnormality of the mind that would bring Crocker’s condition within the ambit of s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA. As this is an issue for the sentencing stage, I will not consider this argument in this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The key issue before the court is whether Crocker had intended to sell an amount of drugs from the D10 bundles above the capital threshold. In my view, the evidence clearly points to the conclusion that Crocker did intend to traffic an amount of drugs above the capital weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The main plank in support of the Defence’s case is Crocker’s testimony at trial as well as certain statements made during two psychiatric examinations in 2016 to the effect that he had intended to keep approximately 50% of the bundles for his own consumption.

His statements given to the CNB in 2014 indicated a rate of 5 grams of heroin per day. In 2016, during his interview with Dr Winslow, he gave a figure of 8 to10 grams of heroin per day.

</div> However, it is unnecessary to decide on precisely which rate of consumption should be taken as accurate. This is because even taking Crocker’s case at its highest, in other words assuming that: (a) he intended to set aside a two week supply of heroin out of the D10 bundles and (b) he consumed heroin at a rate of 12 grams per day, this would indicate that Crocker intended to set aside 168 grams of heroin from the D10 bundles (which contained 902.5 grams of heroin) for his own personal consumption. This figure is inconsistent with Crocker’s claim that he intended to keep 50% of the D10 bundles for his own consumption and falls far short of the amount required to bring the amount of drugs trafficked below the capital weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As an aside, I note that there was some dispute at trial as to the precise severity of Crocker’s drug withdrawal symptoms at the time of his arrest as well as the implications this would have on his rate of consumption.

Therefore, Crocker would have to earn $39,000 <span class="font-weight-bold">÷</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>33 ≈ $1,182 of profit on average per week from his sale of heroin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Crocker purchased 2 bundles every 2 weeks, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> he purchased on average of one bundle per week, which provided him with 56 packets per week for both his trafficking and his own consumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(d) To make an average profit of $1,182 per week and bearing in mind his cost price of $4,600 per bundle per week, Crocker must therefore sell enough packets of heroin at $130 per packet to make a total revenue of $1,182 + $4,600 = $5,782 per week. In other words, Crocker needed a total revenue of $5,782 per week in order to make an average profit of $1,182 per week so as to be consistent with the objective evidence of $39,000 found on him, which were undeniably his profits from trafficking over a period of 33 weeks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Therefore, Crocker needed to sell at least $5,782 ÷ $130 per packet ≈ 44.48 or 44 packets per week to earn an average profit of $1,182 per week. That leaves Crocker with only 56 - 44 = 12 packets for his own consumption.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Accordingly, Crocker’s allegation that he consumed as much as 50% of each bundle or 28 packets each week is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">wholly inconsistent</span> with the fact that he would need to sell at least 44 packets out of the 56 packets or 78.5% of each bundle in order to earn a profit of $39,000 over his period of trafficking of 33 weeks. These calculations show that Crocker could only consume at the most 12 out of 56 packets or 21.5% of each bundle and not 28 packets or 50% of each bundle as alleged by Crocker in his defence.  His defence of consumption fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
