In return for these obscene images, the appellant procured  photographs of the victim’s breasts and vagina. The appellant then broached the topic of having the victim try to fellate him. Even when the victim did not respond, he suggested that they should met up “for a ‘blowjob’” and “kept repeating the request and offering to drive the minor to school after their meeting” until the victim eventually agreed.

Prior to their meeting, the accused instructed the victim not to wear her shorts or panties under her school uniform. The victim complied with these instructions. The appellant brought the victim to his multi-purpose vehicle (“MPV”) (“the Vehicle”) parked on the sixth floor of the Carpark. It is inside the Vehicle where the appellant penetrated the victim’s mouth and vagina, twice each, over a span of approximately 40 minutes.

In view of these arguments, the appellant seeks a sentence of not more than 14 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I will consider each of the appellant’s arguments in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presence of aggravating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 First, I reject the submission that the aggravating factors were accorded disproportionate weight. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Use of the internet</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In my view, the DJ was entitled to regard the appellant’s use of the internet to contact the victim as an aggravating factor.

</div>
</div> I take this opportunity to signal the court’s contempt for such predatory behaviour in the digital realm and accordingly find that general deterrence is a dominant consideration in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I am also satisfied that the DJ was entitled to regard the falsity of the appellant’s Facebook moniker as an aggravating factor. The usage of a false moniker, when seen alongside the appellant lying about his true age to the victim and meeting her in a multi-storey carpark instead of his home, reveals an intention to “conceal [his] identity and avoid detection” (<span class="font-italic">AQW</span> at [61]). Such intention is not displaced by the fact that the appellant’s car, where the offences were committed, bore a licence plate number or that the appellant drove the victim to school. The appellant may have regarded the likelihood of the victim recalling his licence plate number, or being noticed by her peers, as being negligible. In this case, the appellant’s speedy arrest is also a testament to the efficacy of our law enforcement agencies, and should not be credited to the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Premeditation and persistence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 As regards premeditation, I uphold the DJ’s finding that the offence involving vaginal penetration was premeditated. The court in <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian v PP</span> [2017] 3 SLR 933 at [42] held that the offences of sexual assault by digital penetration of the vagina and attempted rape were committed with “some degree of premeditation and planning” as the accused “at the very least…had sought to set the stage by sending the victim to the hotel…and …took the opportunity when it presented itself to commit the sexual assault”.  Even if the appellant did not specifically intend to commit vaginal penetration <span class="font-italic">before </span>the meeting, he had deliberately set the stage for such an opportunity to arise by making repeated advances on the victim, arranging to meet the victim in the early hours of the morning and offering to send her to school so as to coax her into meeting him. When the opportunity presented itself, he penetrated the victim’s vagina <span class="font-italic">twice</span> within a span of 40 minutes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Further, while I agree that sexual grooming is not a distinct aggravating factor from premeditation (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> <span class="font-italic">v PP</span> [2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”) at [44(c)]), it still enhances the degree of premeditation in this case. As such, the weight accorded to the evidence of sexual grooming is not so disproportionate as to invite appellate intervention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As to whether he had acted with persistence, the appellant denies this on the basis of evidence raised in the Mitigation Plea in the court below. Namely, he claims that he did not press the matter when the victim cancelled their meeting two days prior to the agreed date and that it was the victim who broached the topic of meeting again.

</div> However, even if I accept the appellant’s evidence in his Mitigation Plea, I am not prepared to disturb the DJ’s finding. The SOF clearly reveals that the appellant made repeated advances despite being initially rebuffed: when the victim failed to respond to the appellant’s invitation to  “try” fellating him, the appellant proceeded to ask if she wanted to “meet” and repeated this latter request notwithstanding the victim’s refusals.

The appellant’s arguments in question are that: (a) the victim initiated sexual intimacy after having originally said that she was unable to meet the appellant (see [13] above); and (b) that the victim expected more than simply penile-oral penetration given that she showed up without panties (“the Impugned Arguments”).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I accept that the appellant’s efforts are indicative of his resolve to change and that rehabilitation therefore factors into the sentencing equation. However, the depravity of the present offences entrenches deterrence and retribution as paramount considerations. In the final analysis, the sentence imposed must reflect the deplorable nature of the appellant’s assault on the innocence of the victim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence not manifestly excessive in light of sentencing precedents </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The court in <span class="font-italic">AQW</span> (at [41]) held that the starting point for an offence under s 376A of the Penal Code involving penile-oral penetration of a minor who is 14 years old or above, and absent any pressure or abuse of trust, is ten to 12 months’ imprisonment. It bears noting that the charge in <span class="font-italic">AQW</span> was under <br/>s 376A(2) of the Penal Code. As penile-vaginal penetration is a graver violation than penile-oral penetration (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> [2017] 2 SLR 1015 at [152]; <span class="font-italic">BPH</span><span class="font-italic"> v PP and another appeal</span> [2019] 2 SLR 764 at [62]), the starting position in this case should be in the region of 14–16 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Bearing <span class="font-italic">AQW</span> in mind, and after accounting for the differences in aggravating and mitigating factors in the relevant precedents, I find that the sentence imposed by the DJ is not manifestly excessive. I address some of the more salient precedents raised by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 First, in <span class="font-italic">GCM</span>, the appellant also received 18 months’ imprisonment under s 376A(3) of the Penal Code for penile-vaginal penetration of minor who was 13 years old at the material time. The statutory maximum imprisonment term in s 376A(3) was twice that in s 376A(2). There were two other proceeded charges under s 376A(3) and eight TIC charges; the global sentence imposed was 33 months’ imprisonment. Briefly, the appellant and victim in that case, 22 and 13 years old at the material time respectively, were alumni of a school group at their primary school. They became acquainted when helping out with the school group and exchanged handphone numbers. They subsequently corresponded via Instagram messages and the appellant performed the sexual offences in his home and at his university hostel room on three occasions over two weeks (at [83]). Certain aggravating factors in <span class="font-italic">GCM</span> – the victim’s vulnerability due to her young age and familial circumstances and the existence of <span class="font-italic">some</span> pressure exerted by the appellant (at [56]–[58]) – did not present in the immediate case. The victim in that case also tendered a victim impact statement (at [69]–[71]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having compared the circumstances of each case in totality, I accept that the offence in <span class="font-italic">GCM</span> involving penile-vaginal penetration is more aggravated. However, Aedit Abdullah J stressed that the aggregate sentence imposed in <span class="font-italic">GCM </span>“may be said to be on the lower end” and ultimately refrained from imposing a sentence beyond that sought by the Prosecution (at [89]). Considering this alongside the starting position in this case (formulated from <span class="font-italic">AQW</span>; see [24] above), the present sentence, while on the high side, does not cross the threshold of being manifestly excessive. The abuse of the internet is also an aggravating factor which does not arise in <span class="font-italic">GCM</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Next, the appellant submits that 18 months’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive in light of <span class="font-italic">PP v Chen Yongzhao Ashton</span> DAC-913178-2018 &amp; Ors (“<span class="font-italic">Ashton</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Zahier Hilmi Bin Zulkifli </span>DAC-935028-2017 &amp; Ors (“<span class="font-italic">Zahier</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Ashton</span>, the male offender created a Facebook profile, masquerading as a female, with the intention of chatting with other girls about sex. The offender (around 26 years old at the material time) added the victim (14 years old at the material time) on Facebook and the two began conversing. The offender arranged to meet the victim in real life by claiming that a “friend” of his (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, himself) was interested in the victim.

</div> For the charge involving vaginal penetration, the victim agreed to fellate and have intercourse with the offender on the condition that he paid her some money. The victim’s family was experiencing financial difficulties at that time. The offender agreed to pay her $80, met up with the victim and penetrated her vagina with his penis; he wore a condom while doing so.

</div> Eventually, the offender and victim met up in person. In respect of the charge involving penile-vaginal penetration, this was committed at the offender’s home and without a condom. Subsequently, on two separate occasions, he penetrated the victim’s vagina digitally and penetrated her mouth with his penis; these form the bases of the remaining two of three proceeded charges. The following imprisonment terms were imposed: 14 months’ imprisonment for penile-vaginal penetration, 12 months’ imprisonment for penile-oral penetration and 10 months’ imprisonment for digital-vaginal penetration. The global sentence imposed was 24 months’ imprisonment; there were nine other TIC charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Notwithstanding the greater number of TIC charges and the longer period of offending in <span class="font-italic">Zahier</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, spanning several weeks),

</div> I am not persuaded to disturb the DJ’s sentence. It is clear to me that there was no deception involved in the commission of the offences in <span class="font-italic">Zahier</span>.

</div> Consequently, the degree of exploitation of the victim in this case is more severe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For completeness, I also make brief mention of the following cases. In <span class="font-italic">PP v Qiu Shuihua </span>[2015] 3 SLR 949 (“<span class="font-italic">Qiu</span>”), the appellant received 10 months’ imprisonment for penile-vaginal penetration under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. However, the court in <span class="font-italic">Qiu</span> did not have the benefit of the decision in <span class="font-italic">AQW</span>, which clarified that the starting point for less serious assaults involving fellatio is <span class="font-italic">already </span>10–12 months’ imprisonment (see [24] above). As such, <span class="font-italic">Qiu </span>is not determinative in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">PP v Ahmad Jumaidi Bin Salleh </span>DAC-920837-2019 &amp; Ors (“<span class="font-italic">Ahmad</span>”), 12 months’ imprisonment was imposed for an offence of penile-vaginal penetration under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code.
