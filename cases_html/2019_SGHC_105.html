The Duxton Hotel has since been torn down. At the time of these alleged offences, the Complainant was 18 years of age, while each of the three accused persons was 20 years of age.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Ridhwan, the first accused, is a Singaporean male facing three charges: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”), punishable under s 376(3) of the PC, for penetrating the Complainant’s anus with his finger without her consent, in the living room of the Room, sometime on the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 1st Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) One charge of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 375(2) of the PC, for penetrating the Complainant’s vagina with his penis without her consent, in the living room of the Room, sometime in the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 2nd Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) One charge of using criminal force with intent to outrage the modesty of the Complainant punishable under s 354(1) of the PC, for sucking her nipples, in the living room of the Room, sometime in the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 3rd Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Faris, the second accused, is a Singaporean male facing two charges: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One charge of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 375(2) of the PC, for inserting his penis into the Complainant’s vagina without her consent, in the bathroom of the Room, sometime in the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 4th Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) One charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 376(3) of the PC, for penetrating the Complainant’s vagina with his finger without her consent, in the living room of the Room, sometime in the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 5th Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Asep, the third accused, is also a Singaporean male, and he faces the following two charges: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 376(3) of the PC, for penetrating the Complainant’s mouth with his penis without her consent, in the bathroom of the Room, sometime in the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 6th Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) One charge of attempted rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 375(2) read with s 511 of the PC, for attempting to insert his penis into the Complainant’s vagina without her consent, in the bathroom of the Room, sometime in the morning of 26 January 2014 (“the 7th Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In relation to a majority of these charges, the accused persons did not dispute that the relevant sexual activity had occurred between each of them and the Complainant, but argued that such activity had been consensual. Therefore, two of the main issues in contention are whether the Complainant had the capacity to give consent at the material time of the offences, and if so, whether she did in fact give such consent.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I will first set out the background before dealing with the areas of contention in greater detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The alleged offences occurred in the morning of 26 January 2014. The three accused persons and the Complainant had met for the first time on the evening prior, on 25 January 2014, at a birthday party for Mr Muhammad Elmi Ching bin Aman (“Elmi”) which was planned by his then-girlfriend, Ms Ros Izzati Atiqah binte Mohd Zulkifli (“Izzati”). This party was held in the Room, which was internally divided into two floors. On the first floor was the living room, which comprised a seating area with tables, sofas and a television. The main door, which was the only entrance and exit out of the Room, was located on this floor. A spiral staircase connected the first floor to the mezzanine level, which I shall refer to as “the second floor”. On this second floor was a bedroom containing a double bed and a cabinet, and the Room’s only bathroom, which some witnesses also referred to as the “toilet”. The bathroom layout was rectangular and on entering it, one would see a bathtub on the right, a water closet on the left, and the sink with a counter-top in front of the door. Above the sink was a mirror that faced the bathroom door. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Complainant did not know and had not met the accused persons, Elmi, or Izzati prior to 25 January 2014. Her original plan for that evening was to meet some friends and then visit a nightclub. Shortly after 10pm, however, Mr Muhammad Fadly bin Abdull Wahab (“Fadly”) messaged her and invited her to have drinks at Elmi’s birthday party. Although Fadly repeatedly urged her to come alone,

</div> There was no objection.

The basis of the objection was that the Prosecution would be seeking to admit and rely on Faris’ police statements, and that the contents of those statements – specifically, the parts relating to the Complainant’s state of consciousness in the early morning of 26 January 2014 – would be prejudicial to his defence. In this regard, Asep relied on s 258(5) of the CPC and argued that since he and Faris were charged for distinct offences, the court was not allowed to rely on Faris’ statements in determining his guilt.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, the court had the power to order, and should in the present case order, a joint trial in respect of the three accused persons, including Asep and Faris, under ss 143(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC. The relevant parts of ss 143(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Persons who may be charged and tried jointly</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">143. The following persons may be charged and tried together or separately:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) persons accused of different offences committed in the same transaction;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) persons accused of 2 or more offences which form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In relation to the court’s power to order a joint trial, s 143(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC permits joint trials to be conducted for persons accused of “different offences committed in the same transaction”. In <span class="font-italic">Tse Po Chung Nathan and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1993] 1 SLR(R) 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Nathan Tse</span>”), the Court of Criminal Appeal held that “the real and substantial test for determining whether several offences are connected together so as to form the same transaction depends upon whether they are so related to one another in point of purpose, or cause and effect, or as principal and subsidiary acts as to constitute one continuous action” (at [30]; affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Sharom bin Ahmad and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 541 at [26]). While unity in purpose or design is the main inquiry, other relevant factors include proximity in time and place and continuity in action (<span class="font-italic">Nathan Tse</span> at [31]). It is not necessary that all of four factors be present for the incidents to form part of the same transaction (<span class="font-italic">Nathan Tse</span> at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, I was of the view that the alleged offences of the three accused persons were committed “in the same transaction”. The alleged offences clearly shared a close proximity in time and place, and there was also strong continuity in action as they formed part of a chain of events which related proximally to each other. As for unity in purpose, in so far as the Prosecution’s case was concerned, the three accused persons shared similar motives and designs against the Complainant. Although there was no allegation that the accused persons had acted in concert, such an allegation was not necessary: “Community of purpose in the sense of conspiracy is not in any way necessary, though if it is present, its presence will be a further element supporting a finding that the offences are committed in the same transaction” (<span class="font-italic">Nathan Tse </span>at [31], quoting <span class="font-italic">Mitra on the Code of Criminal Procedure </span>(16th ed, 1987) at p 1385). Indeed, even if it could not strictly be said that the alleged offences were united in purpose, I was of the view that they were so proximally and circumstantially connected that the facts compelled their being treated as part of the same transaction.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this regard, I also considered the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chuan Huat and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Chuan Huat</span>”) to be analogous and persuasive. That case concerned the court’s power to order a joint trial under the predecessor provision to s 143(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). There, the wife-employer who had assaulted a domestic helper on one day, and the husband-employer who had assaulted the same helper the day after, were jointly tried even though the offences were in some sense separate and there was no allegation of conspiracy. The court reasoned as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31     Based on the foregoing, I found that the facts of the present case supported the trial judge’s decision to allow the appellants to be tried together. Not only was there an identity of purpose in the separate acts of the appellants, but there was unity of place and proximity of time. Furthermore, common sense dictates that given the facts of this particular case, viz the victim was the sole employee of both the appellants and the offences took place in the intimate setting of a household over a consecutive period of two days, it is not against the interest of justice for the appellants to be jointly tried. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any event, even if the alleged offences were not so proximate as to constitute the same transaction under s 143(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC, they would fall within s 143(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC which permits joint trials to be held for persons accused of “2 of more offences which form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character”. In my view, the present charges constituted a series of offences which shared a close physical, temporal, and circumstantial nexus. The charges also related to offences of the same or a similar character, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, sexual offences of varying severity committed against the same complainant. Similar reasoning was adopted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Rahmatullah Maniam bin Abdullah and another</span> [1999] SGHC 252 (“<span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">ahmatullah</span>”) which considered the predecessor provision to s 143(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC. There, the High Court held that two accused persons who had sexually assaulted the same victim on the same morning and at around the same place could be jointly tried, even though they had committed the offences without the knowledge or involvement of the other person (<span class="font-italic">Rahmatullah </span>at [25]), and even though there “was no indication of any common purpose or unity of purpose” (<span class="font-italic">Rahmatullah </span>at [26]), based on the following reasoning: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 As the offences in the present case are alleged to be committed against the same person during the same morning and were committed at or on the way to the same flat, I was satisfied that there was a sufficient nexus between the offences for them to be regarded as a series of offences of the same or similar character.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for the appropriate exercise of discretion in this case, I was of the view that the following factors supported the ordering of a joint trial: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I agreed with the Prosecution that given the close proximity in time and place of the alleged offences, and the significant overlap in witnesses and evidence against each of the accused persons, it was in the public interest for the court to conduct a holistic examination of the entire sequence of events that transpired in the early morning of 26 January 2014 rather than to attempt to segregate and confine the evidence to very specific and isolated instances in that morning. This would be done subject to the caveat that a confession by any of the accused persons would not be used against another accused person since the accused persons were not charged for the same offence, thereby precluding s 258(5) of the CPC from being satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If a joint trial had not been ordered, common witnesses for the trial for each accused person would have to attend separate trials to testify repeatedly about the same background facts as well as the condition of the Complainant at different points in time. This would apply to the witnesses for both the Prosecution and the Defence, including the expert witnesses who would have to repeat their evidence at each trial. This would cause unnecessary delay and expense, and there would likely also be discrepancies in the minute details which might distract the court from the material facts. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Importantly, the Complainant would have to repeat much of her evidence more than once. Whether or not the Complainant was telling the truth, it would be unjust to require her to attend court and repeat most of her evidence for the trial of each accused person, with the difference being the evidence for the occasion when each offence was allegedly committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having addressed the provisions on joint trial under s 143 of the CPC, I turn now to Asep’s argument about prejudice under s 258(5) of the CPC. The version of s 258(5) applicable at the material time stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Explanation — “Offence” as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">A</span> and <span class="font-italic">B </span>are jointly tried for the murder of <span class="font-italic">C</span>. It is proved that <span class="font-italic">A </span>said “<span class="font-italic">B </span>and I murdered <span class="font-italic">C</span>”. The court may consider the effect of this confession as against <span class="font-italic">B</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">A</span> is on trial for the murder of <span class="font-italic">C</span>. There is evidence to show that <span class="font-italic">C</span> was murdered by <span class="font-italic">A</span> and <span class="font-italic">B</span> and that <span class="font-italic">B</span> said “<span class="font-italic">A</span> and I murdered <span class="font-italic">C</span>”. This statement may not be taken into consideration by the court against <span class="font-italic">A</span> as <span class="font-italic">B</span> is not being jointly tried.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 258(5) has since been amended but the amendments do not affect the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I did not accept the argument that since the accused persons were not charged for the same offence and s 258(5) of the CPC was not satisfied here, the court should avoid a joint trial in order to prevent a cross-contamination of evidence between the accused persons. As the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 569 at [57]–[58] in an analogous context concerning the joint trial of several charges laid against the same accused person, it is possible for the court to order a joinder but with a view to analysing the evidence separately if required. Indeed, if the argument was correct, there would be few, if any, situations in which a joint trial should be ordered unless s 258(5) is first satisfied, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the accused persons are in fact tried for the same offence and one of them has given a confession affecting himself and the co-accused persons. That would mean, curiously, that the question of whether a joint trial should be ordered is dictated by the satisfaction of s 258(5) rather than whether any limb under s 143 applied. In my view, if that had been the intended position, Parliament would have made that clear. Thus, primacy must be given to s 143 in determining whether a joint trial should be ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, I granted the Prosecution’s application for a joint trial of the three accused persons and proceeded on that basis. I should add that, apart from the initial objection by Asep, at no point during the trial or at closing submissions did any of the accused persons raise any issue of prejudice as a result of the joint trial. In any event, to err on the side of caution, I have not relied on Faris’s police statements, whether or not they contain any confession, in assessing the guilt of Asep, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The ancillary hearings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on admissibility of police statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The law on the admissibility of police statements was largely undisputed in the present case. The basic and fundamental principle is that a statement must have been given voluntarily to the police by the accused before it may be admitted in trial. This principle is codified in s 258(3) of the CPC, the material parts of which read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> <span class="font-italic">Explanation 1</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> — If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> <span class="font-italic">Explanation 2</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> — If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements it seeks to admit were made voluntarily. In <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619, the Court of Appeal explained the content of the test of voluntariness in the following terms at [53] (see also <span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 319 at [14]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Although the main text of s 258(3) of the CPC mentions only “threat, inducement or promise”, it is well accepted that other forms of oppressive conduct tending to or in fact sapping the will of the accused may also negate the voluntariness of a statement. In <span class="font-italic">Tey Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1189 (“<span class="font-italic">Tey Ts</span><span class="font-italic">un Hang</span>”), the High Court explained at [88] that, under the present version of the CPC, oppression is rationalised within the framework of threat, inducements or promise, since Explanation 1 to s 258(3) states that if “a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement … such acts <span class="font-italic">will amount</span> to a threat, inducement or promise” [emphasis in original]. This stands in contrast with the former approach where oppression was a distinct ground for a finding of involuntariness (<span class="font-italic">Tey Tsun Hang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [88]). Despite this conceptual shift, however, the substantive law on oppression remains the same: “The litmus test for oppression is whether the investigation was, by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances, such as to affect the accused’s mind and will such that he speaks when he otherwise would have remained silent” (<span class="font-italic">Tey Tsun Hang</span> at [113]). I would add that the same standard applies even where the allegation is not that the accused would have remained silent, but that he would have given a different version of the statement, had he not been oppressed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ancillary Hearing in respect of Faris’ statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As mentioned, Faris challenged the admissibility of both of the police statements relied on by the Prosecution (see [28] above). Two main contentions were raised: (a) that material aspects of the statements were given in oppressive conditions and therefore not voluntary; and (b) that there were procedural irregularities during the statement-taking process which rendered the prejudicial effect of the statements greater than their probative value. At the end of the ancillary hearing, I held that both statements were admissible. I will explain my decision in relation to the two statements in sequence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Faris’ 1st Statement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I begin with the content and formalities of Faris’ 1st Statement. This statement was, on its face, recorded by ISP Tho at the PCC on 30 January 2014 from about 12.45am to 2.05am (see [28(a)] above). It was recorded in the English language and contained 14 paragraphs of prose over 5 pages:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Paragraphs 1 to 7 introduced Faris, his particulars, and the background to Elmi’s birthday party at the Duxton Hotel from 25 to 26 January 2014. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Paragraph 8 stated that at the party, Faris drank “quite a lot and… felt tipsy subsequently”. He did not pay attention to how much the others were drinking, but thought that “we all drank about the same amount” because they would refill their empty cups at the same time. Save for three individuals who did not drink, the rest of the attendees “were all tipsy”. Faris also noticed the Complainant “had been vomiting. She even vomited on the bed.” (It was not disputed that “drinking” in this context referred to the consumption of alcohol.) </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Paragraph 9 stated that the attendees decided to go to Zouk at about midnight, but observed the following of the Complainant’s condition at that time: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [the Complainant] was very drunk. We were drinking at the living room and she can’t even walk properly to the toilet at the 2nd floor. Someone helped her to get up to the toilet and she vomited inside and on the bed. … As [the Complainant] was very drunk, she cannot go Zouk. “Hazly” and “Fadly” then stayed back with her while the rest of us went to Zouk.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Paragraphs 9 and 10 recorded certain events which occurred at Zouk. In essence, Faris consumed more alcohol there and returned to Duxton Hotel with Ridhwan soon after Asep left Zouk. When Faris and Ridhwan entered the Room, Faris noticed Hazly and Fadly watching television in the living room, while the Complainant was inside the bathroom. Faris heard the Complainant vomiting and went to take a look, whereupon he “saw her in the bathtub”. Faris then went back to the living room and slept on the living room floor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The last part of paragraph 11 through to paragraph 14 of the statement are material as they were challenged as inaccurate by Faris, and they will be relied on in the analysis of the charges below (see [156]). They read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 … I took out my shirt and lay on the living room floor. I subsequently fell asleep. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 When I woke up, I realised the sky was bright and [the Complainant] was on my left. She was also lying down but her eyes were opened. Her body was turning to my side and facing me. On her left was [Ridhwan] and he was lying down and I could not see his face. On my right was a chair. The blanket was covering the 3 of us and I wanted to get up to drink some water. I then lifted up the blanket and I saw [the Complainant] was half naked. She was wearing a round neck t-shirt with length slightly above her belly button. She was also wearing a black and white short skirt. Somehow, her skirt was lifted up to her waist and I could see that she was not wearing any panties. I put the blanket down but I was already aroused. I then moved closer to her and I lay my head on her right upper arm and I put my right hand under the blanket and I used my fingers to touch her vagina. I used my fingers to rub her vagina at her “G” spot. The “G” spot was outside at the top of the vagina. I cannot remember which finger or fingers I used. I rubbed for a while and she pushed my hand away and I stopped. While I was rubbing her vagina, she looked at my [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] blankly. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 After she pushed away my hand and I stopped, I got up to get some water. I then went back to lie beside her again but I turned my body towards the right and faced away from her. At that time, [Ridhwan] was still lying beside her. A while later, I fell asleep again. When I woke up again, it was around 10 am plus or 11 am. The rest of them also started to wake up or already woke up. We then started to go off. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 I only rubbed [the Complainant’s] vagina. I did not insert my finger inside her vagina. I did not put my penis inside her vagina. I don’t know whether [Ridhwan] did anything to her but he was lying beside her. I regretted what I had done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Faris signed at least once at the bottom of each page of the statement. The final part of the statement was a paragraph which recorded, amongst other things, that ISP Tho had informed Faris prior to statement-taking that Faris may make any amendment to the statement. It also recorded that ISP Tho “did not offer any threat, inducement promise to [Faris] either before or during the recording of the statement. [Faris] gave the statement voluntarily”. This paragraph was followed by the signatures of both Faris and ISP Tho.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Faris raised two main arguments as to why his 1st Statement was not admissible. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, he contended that the statement had been given as a result of oppression. Specifically, he said that he had agreed to the inclusion of the last part of paragraph 11 until paragraph 14 of the statement, even though they were not true, because of pressure from SIO Sajari who was also present at the time of statement-taking together with ISP Tho (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 12.45am to 2.05am).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Prosecution’s case was that Faris’ 1st Statement was voluntarily given and procedurally proper. In relation to the allegations against SIO Sajari, its version was that SIO Sajari had not even been present at the taking of Faris’ 1st Statement. Instead, during the material period, she was elsewhere occupied with the handling of Ridhwan and his statements, and ISP Tho was the only person taking Faris’ statement. Thus, Faris’ allegations against SIO Sajari could only have been untruths belatedly contrived in a bid to escape liability. As for the alleged procedural irregularities, the Prosecution submitted that ISP Tho had complied with the requisite procedures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, there had been no oppression in relation to Faris’ 1st Statement because SIO Sajari was not present at the taking of this statement, and could not have acted as Faris alleged. It was, therefore, not possible for any conduct on her part to sap the will of Faris in relation to this statement. I came to this view for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, there was consistent and corroborated evidence that SIO Sajari was not present throughout the period when Faris’ 1st Statement was taken. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ISP Tho’s evidence was that on 29 January 2014 at around 11.35pm, he and two other officers placed Faris under arrest when Faris reported to the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch (“SSCB”) at the PCC. Faris was then escorted to an interview room in SSCB, where ISP Tho alone interviewed him from around 12.45am to 2.05am on 30 January 2014. This was consistent with the fact that only ISP Tho’s name was reflected on Faris’ 1st Statement. Thereafter, at around 2.15am, ISP Tho and ASP Guruswamy escorted Faris to the lock-up at the PCC. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Deputy Superintendent Amos Tang Lai Hee (“DSP Tang”) gave evidence that between 12.04am and 1.03am on 30 January 2014, he interviewed Ridhwan and took a statement from him.

On the other hand, the Prosecution said that they had not intended to rely on Faris’ 1st Statement until he took a certain position. Thus, when the parties’ cases morphed later, SIO Sajari’s oral testimony was again needed, but the field book and documents could no longer be retrieved. This was unfortunate but I did not consider it to suggest anything untoward on the part of SIO Sajari.

</div> He did not, for example, know whether the police was allowed to ask an accused person to squat and take off his shirt when taking his statement. However, when pressed further, Faris accepted that he knew that it was “not normal” for police officers to put answers into the mouths of accused persons in the statement-taking process. In my view, if his allegations about SIO Sajari were true, he would have known that the alleged misconduct was wrongful. He was simply trying to come up with an excuse as to why he did not complain about the misconduct to someone else sooner thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Indeed, Faris later conceded that he had suspected that something was wrong and that ISP Tho was merely recording whatever SIO Sajari had “suggested” to him.

Explanation 2 to s 258(3) of the CPC states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation 2.</span> — If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Faris relied on the following paragraph of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”) at [62]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Statements taken in deliberate or reckless non-compliance… in relation to procedural requirements will generally require more cogent explanation from the Prosecution to discharge its burden, as compared to where the irregularities are merely careless or arising from some pressing operational necessity. This would be because the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of a recording police officer who deliberately breaches the requirements or knowingly disregards them would necessarily be more questionable. Further, such conduct should not be encouraged. The court should be wary of accepting any explanation by way of ignorance of the correct procedures… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 However, this did not support a broad proposition that every procedural irregularity or non-compliance would render a statement inadmissible. In the present case, it is not disputed that <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>stood for the existence of a common law discretion to exclude a statement even if voluntarily taken. The test in deciding whether to exercise such a discretion is whether the prejudicial effect of the statement exceeds its probative value (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [55]). This test, while perhaps easy to state, is not so easy to apply. Where the prosecution seeks to rely on a statement, there is bound to be some probative value in it; and where the defence seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement, it is most likely the case that admitting the statement will lead to some prejudice to the defence’s case. But the central inquiry underlying this discretionary power is the court’s fundamental concern with the <span class="font-italic">reliability</span> of the police statement. Therefore, the twin factors of “probative value” and “prejudicial effect” must be assessed with this broader question of reliability in mind. This much is clear on a closer reading of <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>, where the Court of Appeal repeatedly stressed the need for the court to be satisfied of the reliability of a statement, including at [55] that “where prejudicial effect exceeds the probative value, <span class="font-italic">the very reliability of the </span><span class="font-italic">statement sought to be admitted is questionable</span>” [emphasis added]. Viewed in this light, it will become apparent that Faris’ procedural complaints did not materially impinge on the reliability of either of his statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Furthermore, as I mentioned (at [56(b)]), it was not clear if Faris’ argument was that the procedural breaches in themselves rendered his statement inadmissible, or that they facilitated the recording of an inadmissible statement taken together with the allegedly oppressive acts by SIO Sajari. It appeared that Faris was arguing the latter, since the thrust of his allegation was not so much about inadvertent inaccuracy but rather that he was coerced into signing on the 1st Statement. If so, then his argument must fail as I have rejected his account of the alleged oppression. Even if the argument was of pure procedural irregularity, I was of the view that there was no material irregularity in respect of Faris’ 1st Statement for the following reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in relation to the language in which the statement should be taken, s 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC clearly states that interpretation must be provided “if the person does not understand English”. But it was not the Defence’s case that Faris <span class="font-italic">did not u</span><span class="font-italic">nderstand</span> English at the time he gave the statement. Rather, the Defence’s case was that Faris would <span class="font-italic">prefer</span> to give his evidence in the Malay language (see [71(a)] above).

</div> Indeed, having observed and heard Faris in court, it was clear to me that Faris could understand and speak simple English. At various points when giving evidence, Faris would slip into English despite the presence of a court interpreter for the Malay language.

</div> but sought to argue that they nevertheless weighed against the accuracy and hence admissibility of Faris’ 1st Statement. I was not persuaded since in any event, as I mentioned, Faris was given the chance to and had in fact made amendments to his 1st Statement when he gave his 2nd Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the foregoing reasons, I held that Faris’ 1st Statement was admissible in evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Faris’ 2nd Statement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Turning to Faris’ 2nd Statement, this was recorded by ASP Guruswamy on 16 October 2014 from about 6.50pm to 9.00pm (see [28(b)] above). Faris raised two similar challenges in respect of the voluntariness and admissibility of this statement: (a) that it was taken in circumstances that were oppressive, and (b) that it was procedurally irregular in several aspects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Faris’ 2nd Statement was 5 pages long and recorded in question-and-answer format. There were a total of 29 sets of questions and answers, of which the following points are material: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Faris indicated that he wanted to add the following facts to paragraph 11 of his 1st Statement (Questions 1 and 2): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When I went into the toilet on the second floor of the hotel room, I saw [the Complainant] seated inside the bath tub. I went to urinate first at the toilet bowl. I saw that [the Complainant] was drunk. She was already vomiting when we had left the hotel earlier to Zouk. [The Complainant] got out of the bathtub and knocked herself out against the door. This caused the door to be slightly closed. She then stood near the door and was just standing there. I then walked towards her and she fell on me as she could not stand on her own. She then put her hands on my shoulder to support herself. She subsequently leaned back on the door and this caused the door to close. Her face was near my neck. I then lifted up her skirt and I realised that she was not wearing any panties. I opened my pants and underwear and pulled it down to my ankle level. I then started “fucking” her”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">He explained that he had not mentioned this in his 1st Statement because he was “scared to admit to my mistake” and that he decided to “come clean” now because he was “feeling scared as to when the truth will come out.” (Questions 3 and 4). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Several clarificatory questions then followed. First, Faris clarified that by “fucking”, he meant that he had penile-vaginal intercourse with the Complainant (Question 6). As for the issue of consent, Faris provided the following answers: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Q9: Did you ask [the Complainant] whether you can have sex with [her]?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A9:  When she leaned on the toilet door and the toilet door closed, I asked her whether I could have sex with her. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Q10: Did she give you a reply when you asked her whether you can have sex with her?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A10: She did not reply.

They may be summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was a dispute over the order in which ASP Guruswamy had made certain phone calls in the morning of 16 October 2014 when arranging for Faris to have his statement recorded later in the day. According to ASP Guruswamy, he had made four calls at around 10.35am. His field book, which he said he had updated immediately after making all the calls,

</div> On the other hand, Faris’ version was that ASP Guruswamy had called only him slightly after 12pm and no one else. Faris submitted that ASP Guruswamy must be lying as it made no sense that he was not recorded as the first person to whom a call was made in his field book. However, ASP Guruswamy explained that he had recorded the entry after making <span class="font-italic">all</span> the calls, and thus could not confirm that the order in the field book was the actual sequence in which the calls were made.

</div> It did not seem to me obvious that ASP Guruswamy would have known that the sequence in which he recorded the calls would later be contested. There was also no evidence from Faris’ mother, father, or then-girlfriend. In any event, the relevance of this dispute was not clear. Even if Faris’ version was taken at face value, it only meant that this entry in ASP Guruswamy’s field book was not entirely accurate.

</div> But it did not mean that any other evidence of ASP Guruswamy was unreliable or that Faris’ 2nd Statement was involuntary. Faris’ counsel did not elaborate why Faris’ argument in this regard was material. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was also a dispute about the circumstances in which police officers had picked up Faris to escort him back to the PCC for the statement to be taken. Much of this was also irrelevant, such as whether Faris was sitting with his then-girlfriend alone, or with a group of friends at that time. In so far as the escorting officers had apparently made certain threatening statements to Faris, I will consider those later separately (see [82]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) According to Faris, he arrived at the PCC at around 2.00pm.

According to Faris, ISP Tho entered the office midway through this conversation, and when DSP Burhanudeen referred to the dildo and asked Faris “Big enough or not?”, both the police officers laughed.

</div> He claimed that he was only with Faris for 25 minutes and so, while there was a short conversation about the alleged offences, there could not have been the extensive interview (including the use of a dildo as a prop) as Faris alleged. This was corroborated by an entry in DSP Burhanudeen’s field book which showed that Faris and he had arrived at the PCC at 5.50pm and that he had handed Faris over to ASP Guruswamy at 6.15pm.

</div> In so far as Faris could give a broad description of DSP Burhanudeen’s office layout, DSP Burhanudeen explained that there was a “huge window” in his office and that his door was always open. Thus, Faris could have seen his office without actually entering it.

</div> In my view, DSP Burhanudeen’s field book posed a significant obstacle to Faris’ claims. There was no suggestion that the entry was incorrect or fabricated. In any case, the relevance of this dispute was again questionable. Faris’ point was merely that the use of a dildo made him feel “shy” and “ashamed”.

</div> But he did not say that this incident had caused him to give his 2nd Statement involuntarily or to make any false allegation in the statement. Even taking his account at face value, that did not amount to oppression sapping his will and negating the voluntariness of the 2nd Statement.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Faris testified that after his 2nd Statement was taken, he told DSP Burhanudeen that he had no money or ez-link card to go home and DSP Burhanudeen gave him some coins. DSP Burhanudeen testified, however, that he had left office at around 8.32pm that evening and was at home by the time Faris’ statement-taking ended.

In any event, even if the comment had in fact been made, I did not think it amounted objectively to a threat, inducement, or promise having reference to the voluntariness of any statement by Faris.

</div> In my view, not much weight could be placed on the second explanation. There could be other reasons for why there was no record of any conversation. For example, if he had in fact made the alleged statement, he would not have been so foolish as to record it. However, I saw some force in ASP Lee’s first explanation. Although the statement “we already have your DNA” was not particularly specific, it was premised on factual assumptions of which only one who was familiar with the state of investigations would be aware. I did not think that ASP Lee would be foolish enough to make that statement in order to deceive Faris, when such an approach might backfire in that Faris might then know that ASP Lee was bluffing. It was not Faris’ case that ASP Lee had a larger role in this case than he claimed. Furthermore, Faris also did not explain how such a statement had operated subjectively on his mind and made him give an involuntary statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The second contention was Faris’ claim that ASP Guruswamy did not accurately record in the 2nd Statement what Faris had told him. Instead, the officer had allegedly consistently denied Faris’ account and recorded a different version from what Faris had said. For example:

However, ASP Guruswamy did not record these italicised nuances accurately in the 2nd Statement (see [79(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At Question 5, Faris claimed to have stated that he could not sleep properly because he had lied in his 1st Statement, but ASP Guruswamy instead recorded that Faris “cannot [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] sleep properly since this case started”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At Question 21, Faris claimed not to have said “no”, and had instead told ASP Guruswamy that the girl looked high and that she had started it. ASP Guruswamy had failed to include this in the statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I did not accept this contention for three main reasons. First, as the Prosecution pointed out, the 2nd Statement was taken in a question-and-answer format, and several questions flowed from the preceding answer. It would thus not have made sense if the answers were not recorded accurately. For instance, Questions 4 and 5 flowed as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q4: What were you scared of?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A4: I was scared to admit to my mistake. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q5: If you were scared of admitting to your mistake, what made you decide now to tell me the truth? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A5: I cannot sleep properly ever since this case started. When I report for bail, I was always feeling scared as to when the truth will come out. That is why I decided to come clean on what I did. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Question 5 started with “If you were scared of admitting to your mistake”, which was the exact answer in Answer 4. But Faris claimed in examination-in-chief that, in relation to Question 4: “I did say that I was scared. But I was---I also told him that I was scared that the girl would tell the police a different story.”

</div> When pressed in cross-examination on how the reference to “mistake” could appear in Question 5 if that had not been provided in Answer 4, Faris insisted that he had never used the word “mistake” and that he thought that the questions were unrelated.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I did not believe Faris’ explanation. Question 5 was clearly premised on Answer 4. There was no reason for ASP Guruswamy to have framed Question 5 as such if Answer 4 had not referred to a “mistake”. There was also no reason for Faris not to have at least raised some queries if ASP Guruswamy had erroneously referred to a “mistake” when that was not what Faris said. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Furthermore, Question 5 was not the only instance of a “follow up” question. Question 21, for instance, started with “If [the Complainant] still looked drunk to you, do you think…” This was a clear reference to Answer 20, which I reproduced in full above at [79(c)] and contained a reference that “I know that she looked drunk…” According to Faris, what he had in fact told ASP Guruswamy was that “the girl could stand up on her own at the bathtub and got out of the bathtub on her own. And the girl was the one who came to me and lean against my body. That was when I fell backwards and hit the door”.

</div> If Faris’ present account was to be believed, Question 21 would have made no sense at all. And it would not have been logically possible for Faris to provide an answer to Question 21, even if he thought Questions 21 and 20 were wholly distinct questions, which was itself unbelievable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Secondly, Faris was not consistent in his own testimony of how ASP Guruswamy had distorted the contents of his statement. For instance, Faris insisted that in Answer 20, he did not use the word “drunk” and had only described the Complainant as “high”. But Faris had already used the word “drunk” to describe the Complainant in Answer 2: “… I saw that [the Complainant] was drunk. …” When pressed in cross-examination to explain why he did not say that the reference to “drunk” in Answer 2 was also erroneous when specifically asked by his counsel in examination-in-chief as to the accuracy of that answer, Faris explained “[b]ecause I thought I have explained that I did not use the word ‘drunk’ to [ASP Guruswamy]. I only used the word ‘high’ to [ASP Guruswamy].”

</div> He did not deny the accuracy of Answer 2. Yet he was certain that he did not use “drunk” for Answer 20. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Thirdly, Faris’ conduct in response to ASP Guruswamy’s alleged manipulation of his 2nd Statement contradicted his claim that such manipulation had in fact occurred. According to Faris, even though he felt something was wrong and that his answers were not being recorded properly, he did not raise any issues and simply continued to answer the questions.

</div> Indeed, at the end of the recording, he had an opportunity to read the first four or five lines of the statement and allegedly knew in fact that it was inaccurately recorded. Yet, Faris made no protest and signed each page of the statement dutifully.

</div> Once again, Faris said that he did not raise the issue because he had an absolute regard for the authority of the police. For similar reasons as I have explained above (see [66]-[68]), I did not accept this explanation. In fact, by the time of his 2nd Statement, Faris clearly knew that the investigations against him were for serious offences involving harsh consequences, and that was so pressing on his mind that he had even decided to come clean and amend his 1st Statement to admit sexual intercourse (albeit on a consensual basis) rather than to deny intercourse entirely.

</div> Against that backdrop, it was not believable that he would then have been content to let incriminating inaccuracies in his 2nd Statement remain without raising any concerns immediately or subsequently complaining to the police, his parents, or his then-girlfriend. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Turning to the issue of procedural breaches, Faris made the following allegations in relation to his 2nd Statement which significantly overlapped with those he made in relation to the 1st Statement (see [71] above). Again, it was not entirely clear whether his argument was that these breaches in themselves negated the admissibility of his 2nd Statement, or that they, taken together with the allegedly oppressive conduct negated such admissibility. However, neither argument succeeded as I had rejected his account of the allegedly oppressive acts and, in any case, I did not agree that there had been any material procedural breach:

If he had been given a choice, he would have indicated a preference for Malay. For reasons as I stated above (see [76(a)]), I did not consider this a breach of s 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC. As I explained, the question was not one of preference but one of whether he could not understand English. It was Faris’ own evidence that he could understand simple English and that if he did not understand he would have sought clarification or an interpreter. Faris also said that he believed ASP Guruswamy would have arranged for a Malay interpreter if he had asked for one.

He was also not given a chance to read or amend his statement, or informed that he had the option of doing so. As I explained above (see [76(b)] above), the only statutory duty was for the statement to be “read over” to the accused after it was taken. In the present case, there was evidence that the statement was read over to him: (a) in the statement itself, a handwritten paragraph close to the end stated that “The statement was read over to me in English by [ASP Guruswamy]” and Faris’ signature was appended both above and below this paragraph; and (b) in ASP Guruswamy’s contemporaneous field diary it was recorded that “I read over the statement to Faris and he also read through it and made one amendment to his statement”.

</div> I disagreed. Asep’s statement was incriminating and its rejection would have dealt a blow to the Prosecution’s case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, I was urged to accept that the testimony of Asep’s fiancée, Ms Nurul Syafiqah Binte Sahlan (“Nurul”), corroborated Asep’s account. Asep produced phone records of a call he made to Nurul at 11.23pm on 16 October 2014, a short time after he had given his 2nd Statement.

</div>
</div> Nurul’s evidence was that Asep had told her about the alleged police misconduct in this phone call. According to her, Asep was crying and contemplating suicide because the police did not believe him, but she was able to convince him not to do so. Nurul further testified that she met with Asep the next day where he detailed some of the abuses he suffered at the hands of the police, including how he had been elbowed in the chest.

</div> However, I did not place much weight on the evidence of Nurul, given the following factors: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) One, Nurul was not an entirely independent witness as she was Asep’s fiancée. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Two, when confronted by the Prosecution with phone logs showing that her call with Asep had lasted only ten minutes, Nurul said that she was busy at that time and had to instead resort to texting Asep.

Statements taken in deliberate or reckless non-compliance of procedural requirements without a reasonable explanation would fall within this category and be excluded (see <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [61]-[62]). However, this was not the case here. The only procedural irregularity pertained to the fact that Asep had not countersigned against an amendment which he did not disavow. Further, the amended answer, that the Complainant “held [Asep’s] dick and put [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in her mouth”, appeared favourable to Asep as it implied that the Complainant had consensually performed fellatio on Asep, while the original answer, that Asep “put [his] dick into [the complainant’s] mouth”, suggested that he could have done so against the Complainant’s will. In any case, Asep did not suggest that the amended answer was less favourable to him. ASP Guruswamy conceded that the omission to get Asep to countersign against the amendment was an oversight on his part.

A perusal of Asep’s statement shows that he had signed twice on the final page of the statement, once after his answer to the final question posed to him and before the handwritten paragraph, and once again at the bottom of the handwritten paragraph. If Asep’s version is to believed, this would mean that when ASP Guruswamy had asked Asep to sign twice on the final page, there was a significant gap between the signatures in which ASP Guruswamy would later fill with the handwritten paragraph.

</div> This seemed unlikely. More importantly, this allegation was not put to ASP Guruswamy during cross-examination and it only arose subsequently during Asep’s examination-in-chief. In any event, the handwritten paragraph stated that the statement was recorded accurately without any threat, inducement or promise.

</div> ASP Guruswamy’s testimony was to the contrary. It seemed to me illogical for ASP Guruswamy to have volunteered apparently exculpatory answers on behalf of Asep (see [105(b)] above) if his goal was, as Asep suggested, to incriminate Asep. Further, this was a belated allegation on Asep’s part. Even Nurul, the only person Asep had allegedly informed about the police misconduct, did not know about this.

</div> It also became clear in the course of the ancillary hearing that Asep possessed a reasonable grasp of the English language and could have used the phrases which he sought to deny. Accordingly, I disbelieved Asep’s account that ASP Guruswamy had fabricated parts of his 2nd Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Finally, I should mention that Asep had wavered as to whether he ought to challenge the admissibility of this statement. He raised the challenge in his amended Case for the Defence served on 22 April 2016. However, midway through the trial on 11 September 2017, Asep indicated that he would no longer be mounting the challenge. He later resiled from this position and once again challenged the admissibility of the statement on 26 September 2017.

</div> There was no explanation provided by him as to these changes in position. In my view, this negatively affected his credibility. Indeed, if it were true, as he claimed, that the police misconduct was so egregious that he had intended to commit suicide after giving his 2nd Statement, there would be no conceivable reason as to why he would waver about a challenge to the admissibility of his statement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 For the foregoing reasons, I held that Asep’s 2nd Statement was admissible in evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision on the charges </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Before I turn to the charges proper, I deal first with the law on three areas which arise in relation to several of the charges that will be discussed: (a) the standard of scrutiny of the Complainant’s evidence, (b) the definition of and the principles assisting the determination of consent, and (c) the defence of mistake of fact. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Standard of scrutiny </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In all criminal cases, the burden lies on the Prosecution to prove the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, in cases where a conviction turns solely on the bare words of the complainant, the complainant’s testimony must be weighed against that of the accused, and the court should not convict unless it finds on a close scrutiny that the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is well-established that in a case <span class="font-italic">where no other evidence is available</span>, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt… but only when it is so ‘unusually convincing’ as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The “unusually convincing” standard is a cognitive aid and does not change the ultimate standard of proof required of the Prosecution (<span class="font-italic">XP v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [31]; <span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2016] 5 SLR 636 at [29]). If the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, a conviction based solely on his or her bare words would be unsafe unless there is adequate corroboration of his or her testimony (<span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The preliminary question in this case, however, is whether the unusually convincing standard even applies. I note the assumption shared by the parties that the standard applies to all of the charges in contention. Perhaps it was thought that this standard would apply to all sexual offences where there is an allegation and a denial to be weighed. But the question of applicability of this standard is, in my view, more nuanced, and regard must be had to the reason for the development of the standard in the first place: to ensure that a conviction can safely be sustained <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on the testimony of the complainant because <span class="font-italic">no other evidence is available</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Bearing this in mind, I am of the view that the unusually convincing standard does not apply to any of the charges in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In relation to the alleged offences in the bathroom on the second floor, the standard does not apply because there is other evidence available, which indeed is relatively extensive. This includes the expert opinions, the testimonies of the other witnesses present at the party, and the prior statements of the accused persons to the police. This is, therefore, not a case where there is no other evidence and the court must simply weigh the Complainant’s word against the accused’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In relation to the charges concerning the alleged offences in the living room, the unusually convincing standard is also not engaged. Although unlike the charges relating to the offences in the bathroom, the Prosecution’s case here involves reliance at least in part on the Complainant’s testimony as to the events that transpired in the living room, it remains inappropriate to apply the unusually convincing standard given that there is evidence in other forms, apart from the complainant’s testimony, that is relevant to the charge, including, again, the expert opinions, the other witnesses’ testimonies, and the police statements of the accused persons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In any event, the burden of proof remains indisputably on the Prosecution to establish each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In that light, whether the standard applies or not as a cognitive aid, it remains incumbent on the court to carefully examine all the evidence placed before it and determine if that legal standard of proof has been satisfied.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consent </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Turning more specifically to the question of consent, the material provision is s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC, which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consent given under fear or misconception, by person of unsound mind, etc., and by child</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90.

In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>”) at [96], the Court of Appeal laid down the following principles on the construction and application of s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We would identify the following as the relevant general principles: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Under s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), a person who is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which that person has allegedly given his consent has no capacity to consent. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The fact that a complainant has drunk a substantial amount of alcohol, appears disinhibited, or behaves differently than usual, does not indicate lack of capacity to consent. Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) A complainant who is unconscious obviously has no capacity to consent. But a complainant may have crossed the line into incapacity well before becoming unconscious, and whether that is the case is evidently a fact-sensitive inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Capacity to consent requires the capacity to make decisions or choices. A person, though having limited awareness of what is happening, may have such impaired understanding or knowledge as to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) In our view, expert evidence – such as that showing the complainant’s blood alcohol level – may assist the court in determining whether the complainant had the capacity to consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 A landmark decision on the issue of consent in sexual offences is <span class="font-italic">Ong Mingwee v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1217 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Mingwee</span>”). Here, one important issue was whether the victim was so intoxicated that she could not have given her consent for sexual intercourse with the accused. The High Court analysed the surrounding circumstances and found that the victim was able to provide such consent even though she was intoxicated at the material time. Relevant facts included her “deliberate and considered” decision to enter a taxi with the accused outside the club prior to the alleged offence (at [28]), and the passage of time between her consumption of alcohol and the alleged offence which meant that she “would have started to sober up” (at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defence of mistake of fact </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Section 79 of the PC provides for the general exception of defence as to mistake of fact, and it provides as follows (omitting the illustrations): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified by law</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">79.

This provision is supplemented by the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the present case, the justification by law refers to the consent of the Complainant to engage in that sexual activity with the relevant accused.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The concept of “good faith” is defined in s 52 of the PC in a negative formulation: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Under s 26 of the PC, a person has “reason to believe” a thing “if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing, but not otherwise”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Therefore, for the defence of mistake of fact as to consent to succeed, it appears that the Defence must show on a balance of probabilities that:

His evidence in court is summarised below at [154]. The defence was that the Complainant was at the material time of the alleged offences merely suffering from anterograde amnesia (also referred to as a “blackout”), wherein she lost her ability to record memories of events but did not lose consciousness or the ability to consent. Therefore, even though she could not remember as such, the Complainant had in fact consented to sexual intercourse and/or had conducted herself in a manner that led Faris to believe that she had consented to sexual intercourse.

</div> According to Dr Guo, it was possible that the Complainant could have consented to sex under the euphoric and disinhibiting effects of alcohol during this period. It was also likely that she might have had very poor memory of her actions due to a “blackout” during this period that possibly resulted from her BAC levels increasing rapidly.

At the time of trial, he was a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist with Winslow Clinic, and an Adjunct Associate Professor with the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore. The relevant parts of Dr Winslow’s report stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">How Dr. Guo concluded that the average proportion of body water available for alcohol distribution is 54% for females? </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.

The most commonly accepted rates of blood alcohol metabolization (alcohol clearance) are 0.015% for novice drinkers (15mg per hour), 0.018% for social drinkers (18mg per hour), 0.02% for regular or frequent drinkers (20mg per hour), and o.025% for heavy drinkers or alcoholics (25mg per hour) (Miller, 2010 pp170).

</div> In my view, the purported inconsistencies in Dr Guo’s evidence were not real or material. For instance, Faris highlighted that Dr Guo had opined that the Complainant could not have performed complex actions, but later under cross-examination agreed that a person in a “blackout” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, with anterograde amnesia) could have gotten out of a bathtub.

For instance, when asked, Dr Guo accepted that <span class="font-italic">if</span> Ridhwan’s version as to the facts was to be believed, then the Complainant would have been in a much milder state of intoxication and would have been able to perform the acts indicated above at [136(d)]. Similarly, Dr Winslow accepted that if it was true that the Complainant was unable to open her eyes and could not resist sleeping, she would not have been in a state of mere anterograde amnesia and could not have behaved in the manner the accused persons claimed. In the circumstances, it would beg the question to rely on expert opinion premised on a factual state that is both the premise and the conclusion to be determined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Third and relatedly, the experts were also not entirely at odds in their expert opinion. For instance, as to the Complainant’s state at between 3am to 5am, which was around or slightly before the time of the alleged offences committed by Faris and Asep in the bathroom, Dr Guo opined that the Complainant was in a state of heavy sedation, and that it would not have been possible for her to perform acts like those mentioned above at [133] as they were complex acts requiring fine coordination and strength which the Complainant did not possess at that time. Dr Winslow did not disagree that the Complainant would be in a state of heavy sedation between 3am and 5am, although he was of the view that her state could be partly due to sleepiness. He was also of the view that she could have performed the acts in question even in her state of sedation. However, Dr Winslow accepted that if her state of unconsciousness was as serious as described in the police statements of Faris (and Asep), it would have been difficult for her to perform the acts in question which required coordination. Therefore, Dr Winslow’s opinion did not rule out the possibility that the Complainant had been too sedated to perform the acts in question. On the other hand, while Dr Guo was of the view that it was impossible for the Complainant to perform such acts, it was unsafe to place too much weight on his opinion alone in view of the limitations I have mentioned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Fourth, and importantly, the experts were also in agreement that the impact of alcohol consumption on persons varied significantly, and that the most important assessor of one’s level of intoxication was his or her clinical manifestations.

</div> Similarly, Dr Winslow agreed that the assessment of a person’s level of intoxication cannot be based on her estimated BAC level alone, and must be accompanied by a clinical assessment (or, in Dr Winslow’s words, by looking at her “functioning capacity”). This is because even at a specific BAC level, the effects of alcohol manifest differently in different people.

To the extent that the Defence argues that little weight should be placed on the contents of these statements because of irregularities in the statement-taking process and/or oppression, I do not accept this submission as I have found in the ancillary hearing that there was no basis to the allegations made (see [53]-[93] above). In so far as Faris appeared to suggest that his references to “drunk” meant merely that the Complainant was “high” which apparently referred to a lesser degree of intoxication, I also do not accept this because, as Faris himself explained in court, “drunk” refers to when one does not know his or her surrounding, “high” means one knows his surrounding but is simply “a bit tipsy”, and one cannot be high and drunk at the same time.

</div> Furthermore, the word “drunk” was used in the text of Question 21, and so it would have been plainly obvious to Faris if that was not the term that he had used or intended. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Other witnesses’ accounts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Furthermore, the clinical manifestations of the Complainant and her condition at and around the material time of the alleged offence, as observed by the other witnesses present in the Room, point strongly against Faris’ account which portrayed the Complainant as the initiator and an active participant. They suggest that the Complainant was severely intoxicated, physically weak, and at least close to a state of unconsciousness. As I mentioned, both experts agreed that the most important assessor of the impact of alcoholic intoxication on an individual are the clinical manifestations of his or her condition. Therefore, the observations of the other witnesses are highly probative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Before I elaborate on the specific testimonies, I should explain that strictly speaking, these testimonies relate primarily to the Complainant’s condition during and immediately after her sexual activity <span class="font-italic">with Asep</span> rather than Faris. But it was undisputed that the Complainant’s sexual activity with Asep immediately followed her activity with Faris. Indeed, the Defence stated in the closing submissions that there was only a “short difference in time” between the Faris’ and Asep’s alleged offences in the bathroom.

Elmi and Fadly testified that the Complainant was severely intoxicated when she was helped out of the bathroom. They used words such as “unconscious”, “drunk” and “weak” to describe her condition. They also stated that the Complainant was so intoxicated that she needed to be helped by someone else to come out of the bathroom and to the first floor of the Room. In particular, I found Elmi’s evidence to be largely detailed and salient, save in relation to one point, where he agreed with a question posed to him that the Complainant was “standing on her own” in the bathroom next to the countertop of the sink.

</div> It was not entirely clear whether he meant that there was some distance between her and any other person around her, or that she was sufficiently sober as to be exerting her own strength to keep upright. Izzati could not remember the details about the Complainant’s state at that time, but confirmed that she had told Elmi to ask his friends to help the Complainant out of the bathroom a few minutes after Asep emerged. In my view, it would have been odd for her to do so had she been of the view that the Complainant was capable of getting out of the bathroom herself. Given the condition of the Complainant as described by the witnesses, I do not believe that the Complainant had, as Faris claimed in court, stepped out of the bathtub on her own, propositioned sex with him by, amongst other things, pulling down and unzipping his pants and underwear, and thereafter engaged actively in sexual intercourse with him in three different positions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I should add that it transpired during trial that in Elmi’s police statement dated 29 January 2014 at 8.00pm, he had described the Complainant as “sober” when she was helped out of the bathroom by Fadly. Faris sought to rely on this to contradict Elmi’s oral testimony that the Complainant had been “drunk”, “unconscious”, and “weak” at that time (see [162(a)] above). However, in court, Elmi recanted this part of his earlier police statement. He stated and subsequently confirmed that he had lied to the police in his earlier statement when he said that the Complainant looked “sober”, because he was trying to cover up for his friends at that time.

</div> In the circumstances, I accept Elmi’s testimony in court as a reliable account. Indeed, in my view, Elmi was a truthful and forthcoming witness in court. He made appropriate concessions when he could not remember the specifics of the Complainant’s condition and did not embellish or exaggerate his evidence even where there were opportunities to do so. There was also no suggestion of any reason for him to lie when he recanted the part of his earlier police statement on the Complainant’s condition. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the 4th Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the 4th Charge against Faris has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, the evidence taken holistically makes clear that Faris’ account of how the Complainant had propositioned him for sex and engaged actively in sex with him is untenable. The truth, rather, is that the Complainant was severely intoxicated and at least close to unconsciousness at the material time, and was in no condition to have consented to any sexual conduct. Her physical condition and level of sedation at that time meant that she could not have been and was not simply, as Faris claimed, suffering from anterograde amnesia. On the basis of the foregoing, I am also of the view that she did not in fact consent, even if she could have. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defence of mistake of fact </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In the light of the discussion above, it would be clear that Faris must have known that the Complainant was not in a condition to consent and did not in fact consent to sexual intercourse with him. Again, I emphasise that nowhere in his police statements did Faris say that the Complainant was a consenting party. Indeed, quite the opposite, Faris stated that the Complainant looked drunk and appeared incapable of giving consent in Answers 21 and 22 of his 2nd Statement (see [79(c)] above). Faris’ defence of mistake of fact must therefore fail, especially since it is he who bears the burden of establishing this defence (see [122] above).

Therefore, the main issues in dispute are (a) whether the Complainant had the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse at the material time; (b) if so, whether she in fact consented to such intercourse; and (c) whether Asep could rely on the defence of mistake of fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 As I mentioned above, I do not consider the expert evidence in the present case to be too helpful in assessing the Complainant’s capacity to consent at the material time. I thus focus on an analysis of the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Complainant’s account</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The Complainant’s account in relation to the 6th and 7th Charges is materially the same as her account in relation to the 4th Charge (see [146] to [153] above). This is so because of the close proximity in time between the incidents. Again, I am of the view that the unusually convincing standard does not apply in the present case (see [111]-[117]). Similar to my findings in respect of 4th Charge against Faris, I find that the Complainant’s account of what had occurred in the bathroom with Asep, corroborated by the evidence in other forms in the present case, provides some evidence that she did not have the capacity to consent to any sexual activity with Asep in the bathroom at the material time, and that she had not in fact consented.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Asep’s testimony in court </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 As against the Complainant’s evidence, Asep’s account in court presented a very different picture of what happened in the bathroom between him and the Complainant, and a very different picture of what the Complainant was able to do at the material time. In essence, like Faris, Asep’s defence was that the Complainant had consented to the sexual acts constituting the 6th and 7th Charge. The consent was evidenced by the Complainant allegedly nodding her head in response to Asep’s questions on whether she wanted to have certain sexual activity. The Complainant also allegedly actively participated in the sexual activity and actively moved around in the bathroom, including unilaterally lifting her leg up onto the bathtub, to facilitate certain sexual acts with Asep. Asep’s account in court may be summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When Asep entered the bathroom, he saw the Complainant standing just outside the bathtub adjusting her top.

</div> Nevertheless, Asep asked if the Complainant could fellate him. Asep did not know whether she said anything in response but thought that she had nodded her head. He then removed his pants, and she knelt down before holding his penis and putting it into her mouth.

</div> About a minute or two later, Asep helped the Complainant up and turned her around so that she would be in a “doggy position”. He then tried to penetrate her vagina with his penis, but was unable to do so as he had lost his erection. Asep then asked the Complainant if he could lick her vagina. She appeared to have nodded her head, but Elmi suddenly opened the bathroom door as he was about to kneel down to do so. This took Asep by surprise, and he reacted by closing the door and putting on his pants before leaving the bathroom, while the Complainant adjusted her skirt.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In my view, Asep’s 1st and 2nd Statements are consistent in depicting the Complainant’s severe state of intoxication which negated her ability to give consent. In both statements, Asep had repeatedly and consistently described the Complainant as “drunk”. In particular, in his 2nd Statement, Asep described the extent of her intoxication as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Before</span> Asep had any sexual activity with the Complainant, Faris had entered the bathroom and at that time, Asep was of the view that the Complainant was not “in a state to have sex with anyone or have given consent to have sex” (Question and Answer 13 of Asep’s 2nd Statement). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">After</span> Asep had sexual activity with the Complainant, the Complainant was so intoxicated that Asep stated that someone needed to carry the Complainant out of the bathroom and down to the living room (Question and Answer 16 of Asep’s 2nd Statement). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Yet, Asep insisted in court that <span class="font-italic">when</span> he had sexual activity with the Complainant, the Complainant was capable of consenting and had in fact consented to sexual activity with him. In my view, it is simply incredible that the Complainant would be in a severely intoxicated state both before and after sexual activity with Asep, but yet regained sobriety only for the material period while Asep was in the bathroom with her. In that context, in so far as Asep claimed in his 2nd Statement that the Complainant could have and did in fact consent, I find that this was simply a self-serving attempt to escape criminal liability and should be given no weight. Instead, Asep’s description of the Complainant as being “drunk” and “very drunk” in the other parts of his police statement are truthful observations of the Complainant’s condition. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Other witnesses’ accounts  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The testimonies of Elmi, Izzati, and Fadly, which I have summarised above in relation to Faris (see [160]-[164]), also apply here with equal force given the short passage of time between these alleged offences in the bathroom. As I mentioned, I find the witnesses’ recounted observations of the Complainant’s condition at the material time – and in particular that of Elmi’s – to be credible and probative. These testimonies buttress the Complainant’s evidence and they materially contradict Asep’s account of her condition in the bathroom. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Post-offence contact between Asep and the Complainant </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 In closing submissions, the Defence relied on contact between Asep and the Complainant after police investigations had commenced to support Asep’s case that the Complainant’s testimony was not reliable. Three specific instances of contact were relied on: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Asep allegedly spoke with the Complainant on the phone using the phone of a mutual friend sometime after his 1st Statement was recorded on 30 January 2014.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Second, and in any event, I do not consider that much could be made out of the Complainant’s alleged post-offence interaction with Asep. Three points should be made in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One, while it is true that in one of the Complainant’s earlier text message to her friend later in the morning of the alleged offences, she might have mentioned Asep by description as the one who was wearing spectacles and stated that she believed that he was one of the perpetrators, it was clear from the collective of her messages that she was not herself certain as to what had actually happened at the Duxton Hotel. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Two, it also seems to me that the Complainant was not clear in her own mind as to how to interact with Asep thereafter, if at all. Indeed, based on Asep’s evidence, it was not the Complainant who sought to make contact with Asep in the first two interactions but the other way round. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Three, it appears to me that the Complainant is a simple person who was more comfortable relying on her friends than her family members. In fact, the first persons the Complainant contacted later in the morning of the alleged offences, when she suspected that she had been sexually assaulted, were her friends, and she did not want to inform her parents about the matter. When she made a police report, she was also accompanied by a friend and not any family member. It appeared that she did not have the benefit of much parental guidance after the date of the alleged offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Third, I am mindful of the risks and inaccuracy of accepting the underlying premise of Asep’s submission that there should be a single mould of how a victim of sexual abuse should act. As Abdullah JC (as he then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">PP v BLV</span> at [154]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">154 I have discomfort with the notion that there is an archetypal victim of sexual abuse, or that there is any standard as to how a victim of sexual abuse should or should not have aspects of his or her life visibly affected by the abuse.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the 6th and 7th Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 For these reasons, I am of the view that the 6th and 7th Charges against Asep are made out beyond a reasonable doubt. The Complainant’s condition at the time of these offences was not different from her condition at the time of the 4th Charge (see [165] above). Accordingly, I find that she lacked the requisite capacity to consent to any sexual activity with Asep at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defence of mistake of fact </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 In so far as the defence of mistake of fact is concerned, I find that this has not been established by Asep on a balance of probabilities. Regrettably, the Defence did not elaborate on the applicability of this defence in their closing submissions except to mention it.

However, as I mentioned, I disbelieved Asep’s testimony and found that the portions of his 2nd Statement which suggested that the sexual activity between him and the Complainant was consensual were self-serving and untruthful (see [174]-[177] above). In the light of these points, and also my findings as to the severely intoxicated state of the Complainant at the material time, I find that Asep has not discharged his burden of proving that he had been mistaken in good faith at the material time that the Complainant was capable of giving consent and had in fact given her consent to the sexual activity with him in the bathroom. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">1st, 2nd and 3rd Charges – Ridhwan, living room, digital-anal penetration, rape, and outrage of modesty </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Charges against Ridhwan are for the following offences respectively, all of which allegedly occurred sometime later in the morning of 26 January 2014 in the living room of the Room (see [2] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PC, punishable under s 376(3) of the PC, for penetrating the Complainant’s anus with his finger without her consent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), punishable under s 375(2) of the PC, for inserting his penis into the Complainant’s vagina without her consent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Using criminal force with intent to outrage the modesty of the Complainant punishable under s 354(1) of the PC, for sucking her nipples. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The relevant provisions for sexual assault and rape have been reproduced above at [169] and [126] respectively.

The Prosecution based its submissions primarily on the following pieces of evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) evidence of the Prosecution’s expert witness;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Complainant’s testimony;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) other witnesses’ observations of the Complainant’s condition when she was brought down to the living room;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ridhwan’s statements to the police; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ridhwan’s actions after the alleged offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Ridhwan’s defence in relation to all three charges was that, at the material time, the Complainant had the capacity to consent and did in fact consent to the relevant sexual acts with him. He suggested that the Complainant may have consented to the relevant sexual acts while suffering from anterograde amnesia such that she simply could not remember having done so.

</div> On that premise, he submitted that he did not have the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>for the 1st Charge, and some suggestion was also made that the defence of accident under s 80 of the PC applied in his favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In the ensuing analysis, I will deal first with the issues that concern all three charges against Ridhwan, which are (a) the Complainant’s capacity to consent at the material time; (b) whether she in fact consented to the sexual acts; and (b) the defence of mistake of fact. Thereafter, I will deal with the two issues that specifically concern only the 1st Charge, which are (a) the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>for the charge, and (b) the defence of accident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Before I turn to the analysis proper, I make two observations about the chronology of events. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the exact time at which the sexual acts between Ridhwan and the Complainant took place was disputed. The Prosecution’s version was that they had taken place between 5.04am and 7.16am, the latter being the time of sunrise on 26 January 2014. Ridhwan’s position was that it happened between 7.16am and 9.54am, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after sunrise on 26 January 2014. For reasons which I will discuss below, I do not consider that the precise timing of the sexual encounter between Ridhwan and the Complainant is material. I add that the same time period covers the alleged offence underlying the 5th Charge against Faris.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, as the charges against Ridhwan concern acts in the living room which occurred sometime after the alleged offences in the bathroom, my findings above on the Complainant’s incapacity to consent to sexual acts in the bathroom do not necessarily extend to the present charges, even though they may nevertheless be relevant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consent </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In the present case, apart from the expert reports and the accounts of the Complainant and Ridhwan (including his police statements), there is less objective evidence as to the Complainant’s condition at the time of the sexual acts in the living room. Rather, the Complainant’s condition has to be inferred from evidence about other proximate points in time, which include: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) other witnesses’ observations of the Complainant’s condition when she was brought from the bathroom to the living room (which was <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> the events constituting the living room charges) and in the morning before she left the Duxton Hotel (which was <span class="font-italic">after</span> the events constituting the living room charges), </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) CCTV footage of the Complainant leaving the Duxton Hotel at around 10am on 26 January 2016, and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the post-offence conduct of the Complainant and Ridhwan after they left the Duxton Hotel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 In assessing such evidence, I reiterate the following principle which the Court of Appeal identified as salient to the determination of capacity to consent in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [96] (see full quotation at [119] above):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Capacity to consent requires the capacity to make decisions or choices. <span class="font-italic">A person, though having limited awareness of what is happening, may have such impaired understanding or knowledge as to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Expert opinions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The contents of Dr Guo’s 1st Report and 2nd Report have been discussed above at [131]-[132]. To reiterate briefly, Dr Guo estimated the Complainant’s BAC level to be between 141.57mg% and 53.57mg% from 5am to 9am on 26 January 2014. At this time, the Complainant “would have been in an early recovery stage from the [alcohol] intoxication” and it was “possible that she would have been still sedated and her judgment of her actions…still somewhat impaired”.

As I understand it, the parties’ focus on the timing of the sexual encounter with Ridhwan was mainly due to the fact that this would affect the Complainant’s estimated BAC levels, and correspondingly the likelihood of her being severely intoxicated and unable to consent. In the light of the joint conclusion that clinical manifestations are a better assessor of a person’s level of intoxication (see [144] above) and the limitations of the BAC estimates in this case (see [141] above), I do not think that a definitive finding on this issue was crucial to the outcome of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 For completeness, I add that I have some difficulty accepting Dr Guo’s evidence that anterograde amnesia would cease the moment the person suffering from one fell asleep and would not re-occur when that person awoke.

</div> this was not seriously pursued in trial and the expert testimony on the point was piecemeal. More pertinently, for reasons which will become apparent, I am of the view that Ridhwan’s account of the Complainant’s alleged active physical participation in the sexual activity with him (see [227] below) is inconsistent with the Complainant’s actual physical state at the material time. She was weak and unable even to resist falling asleep despite her awareness that she was being sexually violated. Therefore, even if the Complainant was suffering anterograde amnesia, that still does not advance Ridhwan’s present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Ridhwan further sought to undermine the Complainant’s testimony by referring to four aspects of her post-offence conduct. I am not persuaded that they materially undermine the credibility of the Complainant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 First, Ridhwan drew the court’s attention to the Complainant’s testimony that she had remained in the Room for some time after she awoke in the morning after the alleged offences (see [205] above).

</div> The Prosecution relied on this while the Defence denied that such unsteadiness was observable. Having watched the CCTV footage myself, I am unable to tell whether the Complainant was walking unsteadily at any point. The resolution of the footage was not sufficiently clear. Furthermore, it would be doubtful how much weight should be given to an unsteady gait at that time unless the unsteady gait was so obvious as to support a suggestion that she was still in some state of sedation in the living room.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The third aspect relates to the numerous text messages exchanged between the Complainant and her friends, including Affandi, after the Complainant left the Duxton Hotel. These messages suggest that the Complainant was attempting to piece together the events which occurred on 25 and 26 January 2014. While she was unsure of what exactly had transpired and did not document the specific allegations in these messages, they make clear that she suspected that she had been sexually violated by multiple men, including Faris and Ridhwan.

</div> However, the more important consideration is that little weight can be placed on the point that she did not specifically mention the issue of lack of consent in the text messages. One, I am of the view that her absence of consent is clear from the overall context and tonality of her text messages. If she had been of the view that she had consented to the sexual activity, she would not have described herself as a victim of sexual assault.

</div> Therefore, he would have been even more careful about what he was saying in the 3rd Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 When cross-examined on the discrepancy between his police statements and his version of events at trial on the Complainant’s condition when she was brought down to the living room from the second floor, Ridhwan explained that he did not know that he had to be “specific” in his statements.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-ac79bae7-feb3-4d68-9b5e-a967513f8ac5" data-toggle="modal" type="button">449</button></sup>

</div> I am of the view that this discrepancy cannot be put down to a lack of specificity. Ridhwan’s statements suggest that the Complainant required assistance to come down the staircase to the living room and even to lie down. This is clearly at odds with the version which he asserted at trial – that the Complainant made her way down on her own, with Fadly only serving as a failsafe to catch her if she fell.

</div> The difference is not simply a matter of specificity.

</div> He then acted on this plan when questioned by the police. In his 1st and 2nd Statements, Ridhwan flatly denied any sexual act with the Complainant.

</div> This was a calculated attempt on Ridhwan’s part to prevent the police from finding out that he had any sexual contact with the Complainant. It does not strike me as the actions of a person motivated by fear of being wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit. There was no explanation as to why he thought that the police would not believe him if the Complainant had consented to their sexual encounter. This point also applies to Faris and Asep for the alleged offences in the bathroom, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there was no explanation of why they were afraid that the police might not believe them if they had simply stated from the outset that the Complainant had consented to the sexual acts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(7) Inference from lies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 The fact that an accused person has lied may in certain limited circumstances amount to corroboration because it indicates a consciousness of guilt (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 302, citing <span class="font-italic">R v Lucas (Ruth) </span>[1981] QB 720 (“<span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>”)). The requirements for such corroboration were set out in <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>at 724F:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth… Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by… admission or by [independent] evidence…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 On the facts, I have no hesitation in concluding that Ridhwan’s multiple lies satisfied the test in <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>and are capable of corroborating the Complainant’s testimony against him. Ridhwan lied in relation to at least two material issues. First, in relation to whether there was sexual contact between the Complainant and him, Ridhwan had denied any form of sexual contact in both his 1st and 2nd Statements. Second, on the Complainant’s condition when she was brought down to the living room from the bathroom, I have found that he had clearly lied in his testimony in court when that evidence is compared with his police statements and the evidence of other witnesses. These lies were clearly deliberate and related to an important fact in issue, namely, whether the Complainant had the capacity to consent to the sexual acts with him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 What is also damning is the fact that Ridhwan conspired with both Asep and Faris to lie to the police and deny any form of sexual contact with the Complainant. To this end, Ridhwan also deleted incriminating messages from his phone prior to his arrest. To my mind, the inference of guilt from such series of conduct is irresistible and I do not accept his explanation that he had done so out of fear that he would not be believed if he had told the truth. No specific criminal allegation had yet been made against him at the time. Nor was there any indication that he would not be believed if he had told the truth. While I accept that not every lie warrants an inference of guilt, the calculated nature of Ridhwan’s demonstrable falsehoods sufficient persuades me that this is an appropriate case to draw such an inference. At the very least, Ridhwan’s lies meant that he was an untrustworthy witness whose testimony ought not to be accepted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the 2nd and 3rd Charges </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the totality of the evidence compels me to the conclusion that the Complainant did not have the requisite capacity to consent to the sexual acts with Ridhwan at the material time. The facts of the case fell within category (d) of the guidelines on consent identified in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [96] (see [119] above). As the Complainant’s own evidence suggests, she had limited awareness of what was transpiring and she could not resist falling asleep during the sexual acts with Ridhwan. The Complainant’s severe state of intoxication at that time, corroborated by Ridhwan’s police statements, other witnesses’ accounts, and Ridhwan’s post-offence conspiracy to cover up and other lies, demonstrate that she had lacked the ability to decide whether to engage in any sexual activity with him. In so far as Ridhwan’s testimony in court presented a different account, I disbelieve it as a fabrication arising out of a wholly self-serving attempt to escape criminal liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 I add that even if the Complainant had the capacity to consent to the sexual acts with Ridhwan, I would find beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not in fact consent to such acts for the same reasons as I have mentioned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Prosecution has proved the 2nd Charge of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 375(2) of the PC, and the 3rd Charge of outrage of modesty punishable under s 354(1) of the PC, against Ridhwan beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defence of mistake of fact </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 The second issue which relates to all three charges against Ridhwan is whether the defence of mistake of fact under s 79 of the PC is made out. Ridhwan alleged that he had mistakenly believed that the Complainant had consented to sexual intercourse with him at the material time. On the totality of the evidence, I am of the view that he has failed to prove the defence on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 First, most of the factual premise on which Ridhwan relied to substantiate his defence arose out of his testimony in court, which I have set out at [227] above and which I disbelieve. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 Second, Ridhwan also relied on the premise that it “had been so long since she had her last cup of alcohol and hours [had] passed. She had slept and she had vomited a lot of times.” I accept the undisputed expert evidence that the Complainant’s BAC levels may be lowered by vomiting and the effluxion of time.

</div>
</div> However, as I stated at [122]-[124], an element of the defence is that the mistake must be made in good faith, which requires due care and attention on the part of the accused person seeking to invoke the defence. On the facts, even if Ridhwan was in fact mistaken as to the Complainant’s consent, he cannot be said to have been labouring under such a mistake in good faith. I have found that the Complainant was still severely intoxicated when she was brought down to the living room after the offences committed in the bathroom. Indeed, the Complainant had to be helped down by another person to the living room and be placed into a lying position on the ground. Ridhwan was aware of the Complainant’s condition at that time. I have also rejected Ridhwan’s account that the Complainant had actively propositioned him for sexual activity later that morning. In that light, I am of the view that the initiation of a sexual encounter with the Complainant when she was known to be so intoxicated, purely on the basis that she had vomited and not consumed alcohol for some time, cannot without more satisfy the requisite due care and attention to sustain the defence of mistake of fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 I add that the instant case can be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Ong Mingwee</span>, where the High Court found that the defence of mistake of fact was made out on the basis that the complainant there had, amongst other things, boarded a taxi with the accused, chose not to leave the accused bedroom although she was not restrained, spoke with her mother on the phone and passed the phone to the accused, and she did not protest during sexual intercourse. On my findings, the Complainant was not in a state to have chosen to leave or to physically resist sexual activity with Ridhwan, and in that context, nothing can be inferred from her absence to protest which stemmed more from an inability to do so than a choice not to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">Mens rea<span class="font-italic"> for the </span><span class="font-italic">1st Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 I turn now to discuss the two issues specific to the 1st Charge.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 Ridhwan’s first specific defence in relation to the 1st Charge was that he did not possess the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>.

This is borne out of the similarities between the Complainant’s account of the alleged digital-vaginal penetration by Faris, and Faris’s own admissions in his police statements, which were inexplicable and not explained. I therefore disbelieve Faris’ testimony in court which denied any sexual contact in the living room. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 However, the fact that the accused person’s testimony in court is rejected does not necessarily mean that the Prosecution’s burden of proof on the existing charge is hence satisfied. In particular, two issues about the evidence troubled me: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it is not clear that it was in fact Faris and not Ridhwan who had digitally penetrated the Complainant’s vagina. In this regard, the Complainant’s evidence as to the identity of the perpetrator was weak. Further, Ridhwan’s evidence was also that he had intended to digitally penetrate the Complainant’s vagina at around the same period of time. While Ridhwan’s intention is not mutually exclusive with misconduct on Faris’ part, it does raise a question as to whether this could have been a case of mistaken identity. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it is not clear as to what in fact had transpired between Faris and the Complainant. In this regard, even if we take Faris’ police statements as the true version of his account, those statements only went as far as admitting to “rubbing” on the outside of the Complainant’s vagina. He did not say that he had <span class="font-italic">penetrated </span>the Complainant’s vagina. On the Complainant’s account, there is also the possibility that she was conflating the possible types of contact. The Complainant’s description of the sexual act in court was inconsistent, with varying descriptions of Faris’ fingers being “[inserted] <span class="font-italic">on</span> [her] vagina”
