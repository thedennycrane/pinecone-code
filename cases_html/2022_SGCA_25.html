class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 Upon the insolvency of an individual or a company, the statutory scheme set out in the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the BA”), the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”), and now the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (“the IRDA”) governs the avoidance of certain antecedent transactions. While the conditions for avoidance vary according to the particular ground of avoidance and type of transaction in issue, they are generally animated by a common policy: namely, “protect[ing] the general body of creditors against a diminution of the assets available to them by a transaction which confers an unfair or improper advantage on the other party” (<span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law </span>(Kristin van Zweiten gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode</span>”) at para 13–03). The appeals before us have brought into focus several questions relating to one such category of transactions: transactions at an undervalue within the scope of s 98 of the BA. In particular, these appeals raise for determination, for what we understand to be the first time, the question of whether the grant of security for the <span class="font-italic">existing </span><span class="font-italic">indebtedness</span> of a <span class="font-italic">third party</span> can constitute a transaction at an undervalue, and thus the applicability and scope of the principle articulated in the English case of <span class="font-italic">Re MC Bacon Ltd </span>[1990] BCLC 324 (“<span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>”) in our law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 These appeals have also provided us with an opportunity to clarify the proper interpretation and application of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA, which provides that a transaction will be at an undervalue if it is entered into for consideration the value of which is significantly less than the value provided, with both values being measured in money or money’s worth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We begin with an overview of the salient facts, a proper understanding of which is necessary to appreciate the specific legal issues raised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At all material times, Mr Ng Say Pek (“NSP”) and his son were the only two shareholders and directors of Agritrade International (Pte) Ltd (“AIPL”). NSP was also the sole shareholder and one of the two directors of Pictorial Development Pte Ltd (“Pictorial”), with the other director being his wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Pictorial owned 99% of a residential property that was NSP’s family home (“the Property”), with the remaining 1% owned by NSP in his own name.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mortgages granted to Rothstar</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Under a loan agreement dated 9 April 2019 (“the Loan Agreement”) between AIPL and Rothstar Group Limited (“Rothstar”), Rothstar agreed to extend a loan of $5m (“the Loan”) to AIPL. As security for the payment and discharge of the Loan, AIPL was to procure a third-party equitable mortgage in respect of the Property in favour of Rothstar. On 10 June 2019, NSP and Pictorial granted an equitable mortgage over the Property (“the Equitable Mortgage”) to Rothstar as security for the fulfilment of AIPL’s obligations under the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 AIPL failed to make repayment of the Loan by 16 July 2019, the date stipulated under the Loan Agreement. Thereafter, the deadline for the repayment of the Loan was extended twice, on 20 August 2019 and 4 November 2019, for a total of six months until 1 February 2020. On 27 November 2019, Rothstar, AIPL, Pictorial and NSP entered into a Deed of Discharge and Termination (“the Deed of Discharge”), under which the Equitable Mortgage was terminated in consideration of NSP and Pictorial agreeing to grant a legal mortgage over the Property to Rothstar. On 2 December 2019, NSP and Pictorial executed the legal mortgage (“the Legal Mortgage”), as security for all sums due and payable by them and/or AIPL to Rothstar. The Legal Mortgage was registered on 5 December 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On or around 21 December 2019, NSP absconded from Singapore. AIPL failed to repay the Loan by 1 February 2020. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Insolvency of Pictorial, NSP and AIPL </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 A bankruptcy order was made against NSP on 12 March 2020 and private trustees in bankruptcy (“the Private Trustees”) were appointed. On 18 March 2020, the Private Trustees lodged a caveat against the Property on the basis that NSP’s assets, including his 1% interest in the Property, vested in them upon NSP’s bankruptcy (“the Private Trustees’ Caveat”). On 30 April 2020, the Private Trustees applied to compulsorily wind up Pictorial. On 19 June 2020, Pictorial was ordered to be wound up and a liquidator (“the Liquidator”) was appointed. On 29 June 2020, the Liquidator lodged a further caveat against the Property (“the Liquidator’s Caveat”). Thereafter, AIPL was placed under judicial management. Its judicial managers filed a winding up application on 4 September 2020 and AIPL was wound up on 21 September 2020.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Commencement of proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 20 January 2021, the Liquidator and the Private Trustees applied for the Legal Mortgage to be set aside on the ground that it was a transaction at an undervalue or a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors, and for Rothstar to deliver vacant possession of the Property to them. In response, on 26 January 2021, Rothstar applied under s 127(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the LTA”) for the Private Trustees to show cause as to why the Private Trustees’ Caveat should not be removed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The winding up and bankruptcy applications against Pictorial and NSP respectively were made, and the Legal Mortgage was granted, before the IRDA came into operation on 30 July 2020. It is undisputed that the pre-IRDA versions of the BA, the CA and the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the CLPA”) are the applicable statutes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In <span class="font-italic">Rothstar Group Ltd v Chee Yoh Chuang and another and other matters</span> [2021] SGHC 176 (“the GD”), the High Court judge below (“the Judge”) held that the Legal Mortgage was void as a transaction at an undervalue. Although Rothstar had provided valid consideration for the Legal Mortgage in the form of the discharge of the Equitable Mortgage, such that s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA did not apply (GD at [50]–[51]), the Legal Mortgage was entered into at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA as the value of any consideration received by Pictorial and NSP with respect to the Legal Mortgage was significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by them. The Loan was for AIPL’s benefit, and Pictorial and NSP could not be said to have received the value of the Loan (GD at [60]–[65]). The Judge also found that Pictorial became insolvent as a result of the Legal Mortgage, and that NSP either was insolvent when the Legal Mortgage was granted or became insolvent as a result of the Legal Mortgage (GD at [70]). Further, Reg 6 of the Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act Provisions) Regulations (GN No S 293/1995) (“the Regulations”) was not available to Rothstar as against the Liquidator as it could not be said that Pictorial had granted the Legal Mortgage for the purpose of carrying on its business, or that Pictorial had reasonable grounds for believing that the Legal Mortgage would benefit it (GD at [71]–[73]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 However, the Judge found that the Legal Mortgage was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors. As consideration had been given for the Legal Mortgage, there had to be actual intent<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the part of Pictorial and NSP to defraud their creditors. The Judge found that the Liquidator and the Private Trustees had failed to prove the requisite actual intent to defraud (GD at [81]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Having found that the Legal Mortgage was void, the Judge consequently dismissed Rothstar’s application to remove the Private Trustees’ Caveat (GD at [86]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summonses for leave to raise new points on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Before we address the substantive issues arising in these appeals, we deal briefly with the parties’ applications under O 57 r 9A(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) for leave to raise several new points on appeal. The new points Rothstar sought to raise related to whether Pictorial became insolvent as a result of the grant of the Legal Mortgage; whether the Liquidator and the Private Trustees were estopped from arguing that Pictorial and NSP were insolvent or became insolvent when they granted the Legal Mortgage; and whether the Judge should have voided the Legal Mortgage in view of the previously existing Equitable Mortgage. In response, the Liquidator and the Private Trustees sought to raise new points relating to the validity and priority of the Equitable Mortgage.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 At the commencement of the hearing before us on 27 January 2022, we allowed all the applications as the new points were essentially questions of law and, as the parties confirmed, no fresh evidence was required for these points to be determined on appeal. As this court noted in <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit Fah and others v Koh Keng Chew and others </span>[2020] 1 SLR 275 at [14], an appellate court will generally be open to consider new arguments where these involve questions of law that can be answered without further evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The following issues arise for our determination in these appeals: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether the Legal Mortgage should be set aside on the ground that it was a transaction at an undervalue within s 98 of the BA. This in turn raises three sub-issues:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether the Legal Mortgage was granted at an undervalue (including whether and when the grant of security for an existing debt can constitute a transaction at an undervalue); </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) whether Pictorial and NSP were insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a result of, granting the Legal Mortgage; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the appropriate order that should be made under s 98(2) of the BA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether the Legal Mortgage was a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors<span class="font-italic"> </span>under s 73B(1) of the CLPA. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, whether the Private Trustees’ Caveat ought to be removed.<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether the Legal Mortgage was a transaction at an undervalue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 We begin with the issue of whether the Legal Mortgage was a transaction at an undervalue within the scope of s 98 of the BA, which lies at the heart of these appeals.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Legal Mortgage was granted at an undervalue </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Rothstar makes two broad arguments in support of its submission that that the Legal Mortgage was not a transaction at an undervalue. First, <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>stands for the proposition that the grant of a security cannot constitute an undervalued transaction. Second, the Judge erred in three respects in finding that the value of the consideration received by Pictorial and NSP was significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by them:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Legal Mortgage must be viewed holistically to identify the commercial bargain struck by the parties, and the court should compare the value of the Loan granted by Rothstar to AIPL with the value of the Legal Mortgage granted (which are approximately the same);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Judge erred in finding that the value of any benefit received by Pictorial and NSP from the Loan to AIPL was clearly less than the value of the Legal Mortgage granted, because the Judge should have taken into account the commercial benefit received by Pictorial and NSP from the Loan in view of the close connections between NSP, AIPL and Pictorial; and   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Judge (at [60] of the GD) incorrectly imposed a requirement that the consideration had to be received by Pictorial<span class="font-italic"> </span>and NSP<span class="font-italic"> </span>personally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Liquidator and the Private Trustees make three submissions in response. First, the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>concerns a party who has granted security for its <span class="font-italic">own </span>indebtedness, and the grant of a security for the indebtedness of a<span class="font-italic"> third party</span> (as in the present case) can constitute an undervalued transaction. Second, s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA requires the value of the consideration to be received by the insolvent party personally. Third, the value of what Pictorial and NSP received from the Loan<span class="font-italic"> </span>is significantly less than the value of what they gave up in granting the Legal Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 We first consider the proper interpretation and requirements of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA, which was the focus of the parties’ arguments on appeal. Against this backdrop, we deal with the question of whether and when the grant of security for an existing debt can constitute a transaction at an undervalue, before addressing the application of these principles to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 98(3)(</span>c<span class="font-italic">) of the BA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Section 98(3) of the BA sets out three situations in which a party can be said to have entered into a transaction at an undervalue. Leaving aside s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which deals with transactions entered into in consideration of marriage, s 98(3) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Transactions at an undervalue</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">98.</span>— … (3)  For the purposes of this section and sections 100 and 102, an individual enters into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  he makes a gift to that person or he otherwise enters into a transaction with that person on <span class="font-italic">terms that provide for him to receive no consideration</span>; … or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  he enters into a transaction with that person for a <span class="font-italic">consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided </span>by the individual.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 While s 98(3) of the BA on its face applies only to individuals, s 329(1) of the CA extends the application of these principles to companies. For convenience, we refer only to the relevant provisions of s 98 of the BA in the analysis that follows. We also note that, in cases to which the IRDA applies, such transactions would now be governed by ss 224 and 361 of the IRDA for companies and individuals respectively. However, the applicable principles remain largely unchanged, and our analysis below should apply equally to transactions at an undervalue under ss 224 and 361 of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 “Consideration” is not defined for the purposes of s 98(3) of the BA, but “would appear to have the normal meaning ascribed to it by the law of contract” (see <span class="font-italic">Goode</span> at para 13–23, commenting on the equivalent provision in s 238(4) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (“the UK Insolvency Act”)). However, it is clear from the statutory wording that each limb of s 98(3) focuses on a different aspect of consideration. Whereas s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is concerned only with the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of consideration in the contractual sense, s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) expressly requires a <span class="font-italic">comparison of value </span>between the consideration provided and the consideration received.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In undertaking the comparison of value stipulated under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), two points are key. The first is that the value comparison exercise must be undertaken from the perspective of the <span class="font-italic">grantor</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the insolvent individual or company). This point was highlighted by Millett J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>at 340G and coheres with the policy object of s 98 as a whole, which is “to <span class="font-italic">protect the interest of the general body of creditors against a diminution of assets</span> brought about by a transaction which confers an unfair or improper advantage on a particular creditor of the company” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Mercator &amp; Noordstar NV v Velstra Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 667 at [27]; see also <span class="font-italic">Velstra Pte Ltd v Dexia Bank NV </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 154 (“<span class="font-italic">Velstra</span>”) at [44]). For the purposes of protecting the <span class="font-italic">grantor’s</span> creditors, what is crucial is a diminution in the value of the <span class="font-italic">grantor’s</span> assets. Therefore, the material comparison is between the value received by the grantor and the value provided by the grantor, not the value received or provided by any other party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This leads us neatly to Rothstar’s contention that s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA does not require the court to compare the value of the consideration received by the grantor <span class="font-italic">personally</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>with that given by the grantor. It is true that there is no requirement for the <span class="font-italic">consideration</span> to have been received by the grantor directly: consideration need not move directly from the grantor to the counterparty or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span> (see John Armour, “Transactions at an Undervalue” in <span class="font-italic">Vulnerable Transactions in Corporate Insolvency </span>(Howard Bennett and John Armour gen eds) (Hart Publishing, 2003) (“Bennett &amp; Armour”) at para 2.87). However, although the relevant consideration need not have been received by the grantor directly, the <span class="font-italic">value </span>of that consideration is nonetheless relevant in the value comparison exercise under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) <span class="font-italic">only in so far as it accrue</span><span class="font-italic">s to the grantor</span>. This is aptly illustrated by the hypothetical example given at para 13–23 of <span class="font-italic">Goode</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]f G Ltd gives a guarantee to C in consideration of an advance by C to G Ltd’s parent, D Plc, and G Ltd then goes into winding-up, <span class="font-italic">while the consideration for the guarantee is the advance by C to D Plc, </span><span class="font-italic">the value of that consideration for the purpose of s.238 is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">its value to the surety, G Ltd</span><span class="font-italic">, not its value to D Plc</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 This approach is consistent with both parties’ interpretation of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span>. There, no consideration was provided by the counterparty (Artesia Bank) to the insolvent company (Velstra) directly, and what was regarded as “full consideration” for Velstra’s remittance to Artesia Bank was the extension of credit by Artesia Bank to three individuals, referred to collectively as “LH&amp;W”. At the relevant time, LH&amp;W owed Artesia Bank over US$20m, and this court held that it was fair to infer that Velstra had requested its bank to notify Artesia Bank of its incoming funds “pursuant to an arrangement made between Velstra and LH&amp;W who were related”. In the result, this court concluded that the remittance would not have been a transaction at an undervalue (<span class="font-italic">Velstra </span>at [47]–[49]). Rothstar is therefore correct to argue that <span class="font-italic">Velstra </span>demonstrates that the <span class="font-italic">consideration</span> under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) need not be received directly by the grantor. At the same time, the Liquidator is also correct to point out that Velstra had effectively benefited from the payment it made to Artesia Bank, which<span class="font-italic"> </span>supports the position that s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) requires an assessment of the <span class="font-italic">value received</span> by the grantor <span class="font-italic">personally</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 A further example may be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in <span class="font-italic">Re Thoars (decd) (No 2); Reid v Ramlort Ltd (No 2) </span>[2005] 1 BCLC 331 (“<span class="font-italic">Thoars</span>”). The grantor (Mr Thoars), since deceased, owned and controlled two companies which owed a significant debt to one of their suppliers, Ramlort Ltd (“Ramlort”). Although Mr Thoars was under no direct personal liability to Ramlort in respect of his companies’ indebtedness, he was under some pressure to arrange for the payment of this indebtedness. He executed a declaration of trust declaring that he held the benefits of a whole life assurance policy on his life on trust for Ramlort absolutely. As consideration for this declaration of trust, Ramlort made two payments: a payment of £1,100 to a third party, and a loan of £1,900 to Mr Thoars himself (see <span class="font-italic">Thoars </span>at [2] and [12]). The English Court of Appeal disagreed with the finding of the judge below that the value of the consideration received by Mr Thoars was nil. It took the view that the loan of £1,900 had to have had more than a nominal value in money or money’s worth from Mr Thoars’ point of view, notwithstanding that it was repayable on demand. Notably, the English Court of Appeal also held (in the absence of any evidence as to the circumstances in which this payment was made) that “the payment of £1,100 to the third party at, presumably, the direction of Mr Thoars, ha[d] on the face of it a value to Mr Thoars equal to its face value”. The English Court of Appeal therefore proceeded on the basis that the value received by Mr Thoars was “not substantially less than £3000” (<span class="font-italic">Thoars </span>at [120]). This, in our view, clearly illustrates the point that consideration received by a third party can nevertheless have value to the grantor, and it is this latter value that is relevant in the value comparison exercise under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 However, the fact that the value comparison exercise is undertaken from the perspective of the grantor does not mean that the grantor’s mere <span class="font-italic">perception </span>of value will suffice. At the hearing before us, counsel for Rothstar, Mr Bazul Ashhab, suggested that it was not necessary to consider whether there was actual value received by the grantor, so long as there was a perception of value by the grantor, albeit assessed objectively rather than subjectively. We disagree. In our view, there is no basis in the language of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA for the grantor’s perception of value, whether objectively or subjectively assessed, to be taken into account. Such an approach would also undermine the policy object of s 98 of protecting the grantor’s creditors against a diminution of the grantor’s assets (see [25] above). In our judgment, what matters for this purpose is the <span class="font-italic">actual </span>value received and provided by the grantor. The introduction of the nebulous concept of the grantor’s perceived value would render the value comparison exercise unworkable and arbitrary, as this perceived value would be incommensurable with the actual value provided by the grantor. In this regard, although the policy object of s 98 may overlap with the policy concern underlying unfair preferences, which are governed by s 99 of the BA, a key difference between the two statutory regimes is that the party who gives an unfair preference must have been influenced by a subjective desire to prefer the recipient (s 99(4) of the BA and <span class="font-italic">DBS Bank Ltd v Tam Chee Chong and another (judicial managers of Jurong Hi-Tech Industries Pte Ltd (under judicial management)) </span>[2011] 4 SLR 948 at [22] and [26]). In contrast, in our view, s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is not concerned with the intentions or perceptions of the grantor; its focus is instead on the <span class="font-italic">diminution in the </span><span class="font-italic">actual value</span> <span class="font-italic">of the grantor’s assets</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 This brings us to the second key point, which is that s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA requires both the value of the consideration provided and the value of the consideration received by the grantor to be assessed “in money or money’s worth”. Where the relevant consideration is received by the grantor in the form of money, the assessment of its value will generally be straightforward. The assessment of value in <span class="font-italic">money’s worth </span>may pose some difficulty. We give a few illustrative examples of the kinds of consideration with value to the grantor that is capable of being assessed in money’s worth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Feakins and another v Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs </span>[2005] EWCA Civ 1513 (“<span class="font-italic">Feakins</span>”), the consideration received by the grantor was the <span class="font-italic">discharge of his indebtedness</span> to a bank of approximately £450,000. The value of this consideration in money or money’s worth was held to be significantly less than the value of the benefit received by the other party to the transaction, which was the transfer of an asset worth approximately £1m (<span class="font-italic">Feakins </span>at [80]–[81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Buildspeed Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Theme Corp Pte Ltd and another </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Buildspeed Construction</span>”), the insolvent company (Buildspeed) had entered into a novation agreement with another company (Theme Corp), under which Buildspeed would be released from the building contract and Theme Corp would take over the performance of the building contract. The consideration received by Buildspeed comprised: (a) the <span class="font-italic">release from further performance</span> under the building contract, (b) the <span class="font-italic">release from liability</span> <span class="font-italic">for delay</span> beyond a certain date, and (c) the <span class="font-italic">release from liability for defects and other obligations</span> under the building contract in the execution of the works down to that date (<span class="font-italic">Buildspeed Construction </span>at [22]). The consideration provided by Buildspeed was the uncompleted part of the building contract (the value of which, in money or money’s worth, was the price payable by the Buildspeed’s employer for the balance works); the amount payable under an interim certificate; and a sum of retention moneys (<span class="font-italic">Buildspeed Construction </span>at [38]). The value of the consideration Buildspeed received was assessed with reference to a surveyor’s report to be significantly less than the consideration Buildspeed provided (<span class="font-italic">Buildspeed Construction </span>at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 These examples can be contrasted with cases where the relevant consideration was held <span class="font-italic">not </span>to be measurable in money or money’s worth. In <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>, the ability to apply the proceeds of charged assets otherwise than in satisfaction of the secured debt was held to be “not something capable of valuation in monetary terms and … not customarily disposed of for value” (<span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>at 340I–341A). This led Millett J to conclude that the insolvent company’s creation of a security over its assets was not a transaction at an undervalue, which we discuss in more detail at [35]–[45] below. Another illustration is provided by the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Phillips and another v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd and another </span>[2001] 1 WLR 143 (“<span class="font-italic">Phillips</span>”). Although the relevant transaction in that case was a share sale agreement under which the insolvent company had sold its shares to another company (BD), the consideration for the shares was not only the set of obligations assumed by BD under the share sale agreement, but also<span class="font-italic"> </span>the entry by BD’s parent company (PCG) into a separate sub-lease agreement under which it covenanted to pay the insolvent company the purchase price for the shares through the payment of an annual sum for four years (<span class="font-italic">Phillips </span>at [21]). The <span class="font-italic">value </span>of PCG’s covenant under the sub-lease agreement in money or money’s worth was, however, found to be nil: the covenant was “precarious” from the outset because the sub-lease agreement constituted a breach of the terms of the head leases. This meant that the head leases became terminable at any time by the head lessors, which would in turn bring to an end the sub-lease and PCG’s payment obligations thereunder. The House of Lords remarked that if a covenant with such precarious character was to have value attributed to it for the purposes of s 238 of the UK Insolvency Act, that value had to “be placed on a more firm footing than that of speculative suggestion”, and it was for the party relying on that consideration to establish its value (<span class="font-italic">Phillips </span>at [22]–[28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In our view, these non-exhaustive examples illustrate the general point that the value of the consideration must be <span class="font-italic">quantifiable</span><span class="font-italic"> in monetary terms</span>, even if the precise monetary value of the consideration cannot be immediately determined with certainty. This is necessary in order for the value of the consideration provided and received by the grantor to be meaningfully compared on the same footing. It bears reiterating that the policy object of s 98 is to protect the grantor’s creditors against a diminution in the value of the grantor’s assets (see [25] above). Abstract or intangible forms of value which cannot be quantified in monetary terms are of no value to the grantor’s creditors upon its insolvency, and as such have no place in the value comparison exercise. Further, where the value of the consideration is precarious or speculative, some evidence will be needed to establish and quantify its value in monetary terms in order to undertake an objective comparison.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Grant of security for an existing debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With the above principles in mind, we turn to the proposition that the grant of security for an existing debt cannot in principle constitute a transaction at an undervalue, for which Rothstar relies on Millett J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>, the insolvent company had granted a first mortgage debenture over its assets in favour of a bank, as security for its overdraft with that bank. The liquidator of the company applied to have the bank’s debenture set aside as either a voidable preference or a transaction at an undervalue. Millett J first held that the granting of the debenture was not a transaction for <span class="font-italic">no consideration</span> within s 238(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the UK Insolvency Act (which is <span class="font-italic">in pari </span><span class="font-italic">materia </span>to s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA) because there was consideration consisting of the bank’s forbearance from calling in the overdraft, its honouring of cheques and the making of fresh advances to the company during the continuance of the overdraft facility (<span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>at 340F). In holding that the granting of the debenture was also not<span class="font-italic"> </span>a transaction where the consideration received was <span class="font-italic">significantly less</span> than the consideration provided, within s 238(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the UK Insolvency Act (which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>to 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA), Millett J stated (at 340H–341A): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T[he applicant’s claim to characterise the granting of the bank’s debenture as a transaction at an undervalue is misconceived. <span class="font-italic">The mere creation of a security over a company’s assets does not deplete them</span> and does not come within the paragraph. By charging its assets the company appropriates them to meet the liabilities due to the secured creditor and adversely affects the rights of other creditors in the event of insolvency. <span class="font-italic">But it does not deplete its assets or diminish their value.</span> It retains the right to redeem and the right to sell or remortgage the charged assets. <span class="font-italic">All it loses is the ability to apply the proceeds otherwise than in satisfaction of the secured debt.

The definition of a transaction at an undervalue under ss 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the UK Insolvency Act is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with that under ss 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA respectively. Arden LJ (as she then was) held that it did not follow from Millett J’s holding in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span> that the grant of security could <span class="font-italic">never </span>be for no consideration under s 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), and that it was “no different from any other transaction in that respect” (<span class="font-italic">Hill </span>at [93]). This was, Arden LJ noted, consistent with Millett J’s finding in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>that consideration <span class="font-italic">had </span>been given for the granting of the debenture. However, notwithstanding her finding (at [98] of <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>) that no consideration had been given for the grant of the charges on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>, Arden LJ went on to doubt whether the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>would apply in relation to s 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), and stated that she “would provisionally not have accepted the argument that the grant of security in this case did not involve the disposition of any property right in favour of the trustees” because the value created by the debtor in granting the security (namely, “the value of the right to have recourse to the security and to take priority over other creditors”) should be taken into account (<span class="font-italic">Hill </span>at [138]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 These two UK decisions were recently considered by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Encus International Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v Tenacious Investment Pte Ltd and others </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1178 (“<span class="font-italic">Encus</span>”). While Judith Prakash J (as she then was) was not required to decide whether the approach in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>or <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>was correct or preferable under Singapore law (because no security could have been created on the facts), she expressed an <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> preference for the approach in <span class="font-italic">Hill</span> because, “[w]hile no doubt rare, it is possible that a situation will arise in which security is given without fresh consideration” (<span class="font-italic">Encus </span>at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Confronted with the two different approaches taken by the UK courts, the Judge took the view that <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>“are not inconsistent with each other and both are correct”, on the basis that <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>was decided in respect of the value comparison limb of the definition of a transaction at an undervalue, whereas <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>was decided in respect of the no consideration limb (GD at [41]–[43]). However, while the principle articulated in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>relates specifically to the value comparison limb (in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA or its counterpart in the UK Insolvency Act), and Arden LJ’s remarks at [93] of <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>relate specifically to the no consideration limb (in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA or its counterpart in the UK Insolvency Act), the scope of Arden LJ’s comments at [138] of <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>cannot be so neatly confined. Instead of seeking to reconcile <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>in the manner suggested by the Judge, in our view, it would be desirable to take a firm position on this issue. In that respect, our preference is to adopt the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>as part of Singapore law over the approach in <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>. In our judgment, the grant of security for the <span class="font-italic">grantor’s existing debt</span> will not, in principle, constitute a transaction at an undervalue, for the reasons explained by Millett J in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>has been followed in the UK, for example in <span class="font-italic">Feakins </span>(at [72]) and <span class="font-italic">Burnden Holdings (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) and another v Fielding and another </span>[2019] EWHC 1566 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Burnden</span>”) (at [503]–[504]). It has also received academic support. As <span class="font-italic">Goode</span> explains, the grant of security for a previously unsecured loan is not a transaction at an undervalue because it “does not reduce the net assets of the company but <span class="font-italic">merely attaches an existing liability to an existing asset</span>, leaving the net balance sheet figures <span class="font-italic">unchanged</span>” [emphasis added]. Instead, because its effect is “simply to allocate the asset given in security to a particular creditor instead of leaving it available for creditors generally”, it will be more appropriate to examine the impugned transaction in the context of the principles governing unfair preferences<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 13–35). Another perspective from which to view this is that, even though the grant of a security interest has value to the <span class="font-italic">chargee </span>(who is placed in a better position on the grantor’s insolvency), there is “no transfer of value” from the <span class="font-italic">grantor’s </span>point of view because its “net position is the same”: prior to the grant of the charge, the company is liable to have its assets seized by execution if it defaults on the underlying debt; and after the charge is granted, it remains liable to have them seized by enforcement of the charge (Bennett &amp; Armour at para 2.91). For these reasons, we are of the view that the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>is not only supported by the weight of authority, but also sound in <span class="font-italic">principle</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We have two further reasons for declining to adopt Arden LJ’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>. First, as Zacaroli J noted in <span class="font-italic">Burnden </span>at [505], the value of the right to have recourse to the security and to take priority over other creditors in <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>had value only from the point of view of the <span class="font-italic">creditor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(the party<span class="font-italic"> receiving </span>the security), whereas the value comparison exercise (in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA and s 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the UK Insolvency Act) requires value provided and received to be viewed from the point of view of the <span class="font-italic">grantor</span>. Second, with respect, Arden LJ’s approach may confuse a transaction at an undervalue with an unfair preference given to particular creditors (see [40] above; see also <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 13–35, footnote 131). As we have explained at [29] above, although there may be some overlap between the statutory regimes governing unfair preferences and transactions at an undervalue, each has a distinct focus and they should not be confused or conflated. We highlight that these two points are different sides of the same coin, in that Arden LJ’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>focuses, in our respectful view, incorrectly, on what the <span class="font-italic">grantee</span> of the security receives rather than on what the <span class="font-italic">grantor </span>gives up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nevertheless, the common denominator to the approaches taken in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>is that a <span class="font-italic">comparison of value </span>must be undertaken. The principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>thus applies <span class="font-italic">within</span>, and not in the alternative to, the value comparison exercise in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA. It simply reflects the logical position that where security is granted in respect of the grantor’s existing debt, the value of the consideration provided by the grantor is nil because the grant of security in these circumstances does not deplete or diminish the grantor’s assets. It follows from this that the value of the consideration received by the grantor in these situations cannot be significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by him. The suggestion made by Mr Ashhab during the hearing that the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>should apply <span class="font-italic">to the exclusion of</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the value comparison exercise in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) so long as the relevant transaction is the grant of <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ny</span> security<span class="font-italic"> </span>is, therefore, misconceived. The statutory framework governing transactions at an undervalue is set out in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), and the overriding question thereunder remains whether the value of the consideration received by the grantor is significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by the grantor. The principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>does not supplant this statutory framework even in cases involving the grant of security for an existing debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 When this is kept in mind, it becomes clear that the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>cannot be applied as a blanket rule to <span class="font-italic">all </span>grants of security for existing debts. In particular, it clearly does not apply where the relevant security is granted in respect of a <span class="font-italic">third party’s</span> existing debt.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In those circumstances, it is clear that the grant of the security <span class="font-italic">would</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>reduce the net assets of the grantor as it would impose a <span class="font-italic">new</span> liability which the grantor did not previously have. That is why the endorsement of the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>in <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>is expressly qualified as follows (<span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 13–35): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The position is otherwise, of course, where the company gives security for the indebtedness of a third party</span>, for in that situation realisation of the security does not result in the discharge of any debt owed by the company, <span class="font-italic">which accordingly suffers a loss of the charged asset</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this regard, it should be noted that <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Hill </span>and <span class="font-italic">Burnden </span>all concerned the grant of security for the grantor’s <span class="font-italic">own</span> indebtedness, not that of a third party. That having been said, Rothstar argues that <span class="font-italic">Burnden </span>was a case where security was granted by a company (BHUK) and its subsidiaries<span class="font-italic"> </span>for a loan given by the shareholders to BHUK, and that the English High Court there decided, following <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>, that a grant of security could not constitute an undervalued transaction even in this three-party context. This is, however, not borne out upon a closer reading of <span class="font-italic">Burnden</span>. At [504] of <span class="font-italic">Burnden</span>, applying the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the court clearly stated that “[c]onsidered <span class="font-italic">from the point of view of BHUK</span>, the grant of security involved no transfer of value <span class="font-italic">from BHUK</span>” [emphasis added]. <span class="font-italic">Burnden </span>thus illustrates that the comparison of value is to be undertaken from the perspective of the grantor of the security. Further, given that the loan in <span class="font-italic">Burnden </span>was made to <span class="font-italic">BHUK </span><span class="font-italic">itself</span>, it does not detract from our view that the grant of security for a third party’s debts can constitute a transaction at an undervalue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We therefore agree with counsel for the Liquidator and the Private Trustees, Mr Lee Eng Beng SC, that the scope of the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span> is limited to security granted for the grantor’s <span class="font-italic">own</span> existing debt. It does not extend to the grant of security for <span class="font-italic">a</span> <span class="font-italic">third party</span>’s debt, and such a grant of security can, in principle, constitute a transaction at an undervalue under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having set out the relevant principles, we now consider their application to the facts of the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The value <span class="font-italic">provided</span> by Pictorial and NSP was, in our view, twofold. First, Pictorial and NSP granted the Legal Mortgage over the Property to Rothstar. As we have explained at [42]–[45] above, this did deplete their assets because the existing debt secured by the Legal Mortgage was a debt owed by a <span class="font-italic">third party</span> (AIPL), and not a debt owed by Pictorial and NSP themselves. Second, on a proper construction of the terms of the Legal Mortgage, Pictorial and NSP assumed a new <span class="font-italic">primary obligation to repay the Loan</span> which had not been present under the earlier Equitable Mortgage, and which (contrary to Rothstar’s written submission) was not contingent on the value of the Property being insufficient to fully discharge the Loan. The Legal Mortgage itself and cll 1.1 and 6.7 of its Covenants and Conditions make clear that Pictorial and NSP covenanted thereunder to pay all moneys owing to Rothstar by AIPL and/or by them in respect of the Loan, and that the Legal Mortgage secured Pictorial and NSP’s new primary obligation to repay the Loan as well as AIPL’s obligation to repay the same. At the hearing before us, Mr Ashhab eventually accepted that Pictorial and NSP became liable for the Loan as primary obligors under the Legal Mortgage. That Pictorial and NSP may have had bleak prospects of repaying the Loan themselves, which Rothstar emphasised, is beside the point: what Pictorial and NSP gave Rothstar was the benefit of an additional personal<span class="font-italic"> </span>obligation to repay the Loan which they assumed, secured by the Legal Mortgage, and which gave Rothstar personal claims against them in their insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Turning to the value <span class="font-italic">received </span>by Pictorial and NSP, we first accept the Judge’s factual finding that the Loan was indeed disbursed by Rothstar to AIPL (at [57]–[59] of the GD). In our view, the Liquidator and the Private Trustees have not provided any basis for us to depart from this finding, which the Judge arrived at after having considered the evidence before him. We therefore proceed on the basis that AIPL did indeed receive the Loan. However, we disagree with the Judge’s finding that the Loan could not have constituted consideration for the Legal Mortgage because the Loan Agreement was entered into on 9 April 2019 with the Equitable Mortgage given as security for the Loan, while the Legal Mortgage was executed only on 2 December 2019 (at [45(d)] and [49] of the GD, in the context of the Judge’s analysis of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BA). In the Judge’s view, the only consideration provided for the Legal Mortgage was the discharge of the Equitable Mortgage under the Deed of Discharge (see [50]–[51] of the GD). On this analysis, the value to be assessed under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) would be limited to the value of that discharge. This, in our judgment, takes an artificially narrow view of the situation that fails to reflect the true commercial arrangement between the parties. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span> at [43], “[w]hat is the true nature of a transaction must be viewed in the light of all the relevant circumstances”, and “[t]o truncate the facts and view each event as distinct and separate would inevitably lead to a wholly erroneous conclusion, based as it does on a partial view of things”. The reality of the parties’ arrangement was that the Legal Mortgage was not granted <span class="font-italic">only</span> in consideration of the discharge of the Equitable Mortgage; instead, <span class="font-italic">both</span> the Equitable Mortgage and the Legal Mortgage that replaced it were granted by Pictorial and NSP in consideration of the <span class="font-italic">Loan</span> extended by Rothstar to AIPL. It should be borne in mind that the Loan itself was not a one-off transaction beginning and ending with the Loan Agreement on 9 April 2019: after AIPL failed to repay the Loan by the initially stipulated deadline, the deadline for repayment was extended twice until 1 February 2020. AIPL’s obligations in respect of the Loan (beginning on 9 April 2019 and continuing past 1 February 2020) thus ran parallel to the obligations assumed by Pictorial and NSP under, first, the Equitable Mortgage (which was granted on 10 June 2019), and then the Legal Mortgage (which they agreed to grant on 27 November 2019 and executed on 2 December 2019). These two sets of obligations were inextricably linked, and we therefore accept that the consideration received by <span class="font-italic">AIPL</span> in the form of the Loan is in principle relevant in assessing the value received by Pictorial and NSP from the grant of the Legal Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 However, the critical question for the purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is what the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of the Loan to AIPL was <span class="font-italic">to Pictorial and NSP</span>. The Judge found that there was no evidence of Pictorial and NSP receiving the value of the Loan or any benefit therefrom that could be assessed in money or money’s worth (GD at [60]–[61]). We see no reason to disturb this finding. Rothstar seeks to persuade us to the contrary by emphasising the close commercial relationship between NSP, AIPL and Pictorial, and urges us to conclude that the Loan conferred a commercial or practical benefit on NSP and Pictorial by increasing the cash flow available to AIPL and thus to NSP (who is a significant shareholder of AIPL) and Pictorial (because NSP, as the 100% shareholder of Pictorial, would then be able to make the necessary capital injections to support Pictorial financially). However, while we accept that the value of commercial or practical benefits can be taken into account in the value comparison exercise under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA in so far as such value is capable of being measured in money or money’s worth, the benefit Rothstar claims that Pictorial and NSP received from the Loan to AIPL is an <span class="font-italic">unparticularised and unsubstantiated</span> benefit which is said to accrue to Pictorial and NSP <span class="font-italic">mere</span><span class="font-italic">ly by dint of their association with AIPL</span>. In our view, such an amorphous benefit (if any) cannot be valued in money or money’s worth, and therefore has no place in the value comparison exercise. In this regard, no weight can be placed on the fact that Pictorial passed shareholders’ and board of directors’ resolutions in support of granting the Legal Mortgage, given that Pictorial’s sole shareholder was NSP and its only two directors were NSP and his wife. Contrary to what Rothstar contends, the close connections between NSP, AIPL and Pictorial weigh <span class="font-italic">against </span>a finding that the Loan was of any real value to Pictorial or NSP. Moreover, for the reasons we have explained at [29] above, Pictorial and NSP’s <span class="font-italic">perception </span>of the value they might receive from the transaction is irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Even if this amorphous benefit could be ascribed value for the purposes of the value comparison exercise, this value would be attenuated by the holding structure of AIPL. While AIPL’s only two directors and shareholders were NSP and his son, with NSP holding approximately 40% to 50% of AIPL’s shares, any indirect value of the Loan to NSP would still be far less than its face value as it would be shared between NSP and his son, instead of accruing solely to NSP. Any value derived by <span class="font-italic">Pictorial</span> from capital injections which might then have been made by NSP would have been even further diminished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There is, therefore, no value received by Pictorial and NSP in money or money’s worth which can be compared with the significant value provided by them. This being the case, the Legal Mortgage was a transaction entered into by Pictorial and NSP for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, was significantly less than the value in money or money’s worth of the consideration provided by them. Accordingly, we agree with the Judge that the Legal Mortgage was a transaction at an undervalue under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Pictorial and NSP were insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a result of, granting the Legal Mortgage </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The next question is whether Pictorial and NSP were insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a result of, granting the Legal Mortgage, as required under s 100(2) of the BA. The Judge found that Pictorial and NSP were indeed insolvent at the relevant time (GD at [70]). Rothstar’s case on appeal focuses on arguing that <span class="font-italic">Pictorial</span> did not become insolvent as a result of the grant of the Legal Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 We reject at the outset Rothstar’s argument, made in reliance on <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>, that Pictorial’s assets were not depleted by the Legal Mortgage because the grant of a mortgage does not deplete a company’s assets. As we have held at [42]–[45] above, the grant of a mortgage as security for the indebtedness of a third party <span class="font-italic">does</span> deplete the assets of the mortgagor. We also reject Rothstar’s submission that the Judge erred in accepting the Liquidator’s evidence that Pictorial became insolvent after it took on liability for the Loan pursuant to the Legal Mortgage. In our view, Rothstar has not provided any basis for us to overturn the Judge’s finding of fact on this point. As we have held at [47] above, Pictorial and NSP assumed an additional primary obligation to repay the Loan under the terms of the Legal Mortgage. In these circumstances, we have no doubt that even if Pictorial was not already insolvent at the time of granting the Legal Mortgage, it certainly became insolvent when it assumed an additional primary obligation to repay the Loan as a result of granting the Legal Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The final new argument raised by Rothstar on appeal in relation to Pictorial and NSP’s insolvency is that Pictorial and NSP (and therefore, the Liquidator and the Private Trustees) are estopped from arguing that they were insolvent at the time of the Legal Mortgage or became insolvent as a result thereof, because of various warranties and covenants they had made in the Legal Mortgage. Rothstar argues that Pictorial and NSP warranted in the Legal Mortgage that it would constitute valid and binding obligations; that they were not in default of any of their obligations for the payment of borrowed moneys; that Rothstar’s rights under the Legal Mortgage would not be prejudiced by any allegations of an undervalued transaction; and that it would be valid and binding notwithstanding the insolvency of Pictorial and NSP. In response, the Liquidator and the Private Trustees contend that no contractual estoppel can be raised because this would defy the statutory provisions on the avoidance of transactions at an undervalue. Parties would then be allowed to contract out of s 98 of the BA if they employed the appropriate wording, rendering it toothless and frustrating its policy object.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We agree with the Liquidator and the Private Trustees that allowing these provisions of the Legal Mortgage to estop them from arguing that the Legal Mortgage is liable to be avoided as a transaction at an undervalue would indeed subvert the statutory scheme of s 98 of the BA. It is well established that estoppel cannot operate where it would act in the face of a statute and effectively allow a state of affairs which the law has positively declared not to subsist: <span class="font-italic">Cupid Jewels Pte Ltd v Orchard Central Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 156 (“<span class="font-italic">Cupid Jewels</span>”) at [37] and <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund III Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) </span>[2019] 2 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund</span>”) at [122]. The relevant “state of affairs” here is the enforceability of the Legal Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Rothstar’s submission is similar to that rejected by this court in <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund</span>. There, it was argued that a company was estopped from seeking to avoid certain loan agreements under s 76 of the CA by virtue of certain representations it had made which allegedly amounted to clear and unequivocal representations of fact that its entry into the loan agreements would not contravene any laws, and representations in the form of promises that the company would take all necessary steps to enable it to lawfully enter into the loan agreements. In rejecting this argument, this court held that the loan agreements were part of a composite transaction caught by the prohibition in s 76(1A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), and that an estoppel would effectively permit a state of affairs where the loan agreements were not void when the court had found that s 76A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) made them so (<span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund </span>at [110]–[112] and [122]). The comments at [131] of <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund</span>, albeit made in relation to the statutory regime governing a company’s acquisition of its own shares, are also pertinent to the present case: “considerable caution must be taken before generic representations and warranties … can be relied upon to establish an estoppel” that would allow a party to “sidestep” the statutory scheme, as such widely-framed representations and warranties are commonplace in commercial contracts, and this would significantly dilute the significance of the statutory prohibitions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 We are also unable to accept Rothstar’s reliance on this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Cupid Jewels</span>. In that case, this court held that allowing promissory estoppel to apply to prevent a landlord from insisting on its strict legal remedies to recover rental arrears would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be in defiance of the Distress Act (Cap 84, 1996 Rev Ed), because the relevant provision of that Act did not <span class="font-italic">require </span>a writ of distress to be applied for by a landlord; it was “merely <span class="font-italic">permissive </span>and not mandatory” (<span class="font-italic">Cupid Jewels </span>at [38]). Rothstar contends<span class="font-italic"> </span>that s 98(1) of the BA similarly “does not mandate that an application be brought, nor prohibits any particular state of affairs”, and that s 98(2) confers on the court a wide discretion to make any orders it deems fit. This is a disingenuous reading of s 98, which is plainly not designed to confer a “special remedy” on a party (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> <span class="font-italic">Cupid Jewels </span>at [38]), but rather to implement a <span class="font-italic">regulatory scheme</span> for the avoidance of transactions upon insolvency that would diminish the pool of assets available to the insolvent party’s creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 We add that even if Rothstar’s submission is taken more narrowly, such that the provisions of the Legal Mortgage are said to estop the Liquidator and the Private Trustees from making the <span class="font-italic">factual </span>argument that<span class="font-italic"> </span>Pictorial and NSP were insolvent at the relevant time, this would also be unsustainable. In the present context, where the regulatory regime governing transactions at an undervalue and unfair preferences is engaged once the condition of insolvency is found to be satisfied, an individual or company’s state of insolvency is not a purely factual matter. Instead, whether an individual or company is “insolvent” for the purposes of s 100(2) of the BA is a matter for the court to determine, applying the statutory definition of insolvency in s 100(4) and any applicable presumptions of insolvency (such as that contained in s 100(3) for transactions entered into with associates). An estoppel purporting to preclude such a finding would “impermissibly operate in defiance of” the broader statutory scheme (<span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund </span>at [126]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We therefore affirm the Judge’s finding that Pictorial and NSP were insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a result of, granting the Legal Mortgage, and we reject Rothstar’s new arguments to the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate order under s 98(2) of the BA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Having found that the Legal Mortgage was a transaction at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA, the Judge then held that it was “void” (at [3] and [74] of the GD) and that the Liquidator and the Private Trustees were “entitled to void the [Legal] Mortgage on the ground that it was an undervalued transaction” (at [87] of the GD). With respect, we do not agree with this characterisation of the Legal Mortgage as “void” as a consequence of the Judge’s finding that it was a transaction at an undervalue. Under s 98(2) of the BA, the court has the power to “make such order as it thinks fit for <span class="font-italic">restoring the position</span> to what it would have been if that individual had not entered into that transaction” [emphasis added]. Section 98 does <span class="font-italic">not</span> provide that an undervalued transaction thereunder is void or, for that matter, voidable (see <span class="font-italic">Buildspeed Construction </span>at [50]–[51] and <span class="font-italic">Christie, Hamish Alexander (as private trustee in bankruptcy of Tan Boon Kian) v Tan Boon Kian and others </span>[2021] 4 SLR 809 at [94]). Instead, the court may, for example, make an order <span class="font-italic">releasing or discharging</span> the Legal Mortgage under s 102(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA. Thus, while the effects of the transaction are <span class="font-italic">reversible</span> in the court’s discretion, the transaction itself subsists unless and until it is discharged pursuant to an order of the court under s 98(2); it is not retrospectively avoided (see Bennett &amp; Armour at para 2.121 and <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at paras 13–02, 13–03 and 13–43).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In our view, the appropriate order under s 98(2) to restore the position to what it would have been if Pictorial and NSP had not granted the Legal Mortgage is an order discharging the Legal Mortgage with prospective effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We deal at this juncture with two further arguments raised by Rothstar as to the appropriate order. First, Rothstar submits that the original position prior to the Legal Mortgage was that the Equitable Mortgage would have subsisted to secure the Loan to AIPL, pursuant to which Rothstar would have been entitled to sell the Property and utilise the sale proceeds to satisfy the outstanding Loan. However, in our judgment, it would not be appropriate for us to make an order restoring the Equitable Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Rothstar argues that it is reasonable to surmise that, since the Legal Mortgage was registered by December 2019, it would have registered the Equitable Mortgage (and sought any necessary extensions of time) by December 2019, prior to the insolvency of Pictorial and NSP. We disagree. The Equitable Mortgage was granted on 10 June 2019, more than five months before the parties agreed to replace it with the Legal Mortgage on 27 November 2019 and executed the Legal Mortgage on 2 December 2019. In the period between those two dates, AIPL was granted two extensions for the repayment of the Loan. Yet, no steps appear to have been taken by Rothstar to register the Equitable Mortgage, or even lodge a caveat in respect of its interest in the Property thereunder. It would therefore be entirely conjectural to assume that Rothstar would have registered the Equitable Mortgage by December 2019 had the Legal Mortgage not been granted. Proceeding on the basis that only the <span class="font-italic">unregistered </span>Equitable Mortgage would have subsisted if it had not been replaced by the Legal Mortgage, the Equitable Mortgage – having not been registered within 30 days after its creation on 10 June 2019 – would have been void against the Liquidator and any creditor of Pictorial as an unregistered charge under s 131(1) of the CA. In addition, both the Liquidator and the Private Trustees would have had priority over Rothstar’s unregistered interest under s 49(1) of the LTA, by virtue of the Liquidator’s Caveat lodged on 29 June 2020 and the Private Trustees’ Caveat lodged on 18 March 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In any event, we are of the view that the Equitable Mortgage was itself likely to have been a transaction at an undervalue. Our finding that there is no evidence of Pictorial and NSP having received any value from the Loan that can be assessed in money or money’s worth for the purposes of the value comparison exercise in respect of the Legal Mortgage applies equally to the Equitable Mortgage. In addition, Pictorial and NSP are likely to have been insolvent as of 10 June 2019 when the Equitable Mortgage was granted. In this regard, we see no reason to depart from the Judge’s finding that Pictorial’s total liabilities as at 2018 were $450,932, whereas its sole significant asset was its 99% ownership of the Property which was subject to the Equitable Mortgage to secure the Loan of $5m (GD at [67]). By this time, NSP also had approximately $180,000 in total in his bank accounts, and might have had substantially greater liabilities. While there may be insufficient material before the court for us to arrive at a firm conclusion as to whether the Equitable Mortgage would have been liable to be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue, we are not persuaded that it would be appropriate to restore it in the circumstances of the present case given its unregistered status.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Second, Rothstar suggests that the court orders the Property to be sold and the proceeds applied to discharge the Loan, with the surplus (if any) to be paid to Pictorial and NSP in their respective proportions, on the ground that this would most closely approximate the effect of restoring the Equitable Mortgage. Given our decision that the Equitable Mortgage should not be restored, this argument falls away. Further, as the Liquidator and the Private Trustees point out, this would essentially be an order enforcing the Legal Mortgage pursuant to a mortgagee’s power of sale on Rothstar’s behalf. We can see no legal basis to make such an order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Accordingly, we make an order discharging the Legal Mortgage, without restoring the Equitable Mortgage or making the order for sale as suggested by Rothstar. While we are cognisant that this leaves Rothstar in the rather unenviable position of losing its security and having no effective recourse for the repayment of the Loan, we note that this was part of the risk inherent in securing a loan to one party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, AIPL) with security provided by a third party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Pictorial and NSP).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For completeness, we affirm the Judge’s finding (at [71]–[73] of the GD) that the defence in Reg 6 of the Regulations is not available to Rothstar. Regulation 6 would have applied as against the Liquidator if (a) Pictorial had granted the Legal Mortgage in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business; and (b) at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit it. Rothstar argues that the Judge erred in arriving at this finding. However, the burden of proving that the defence in Reg 6 is established lies on Rothstar, as the party resisting the making of an order under s 98 of the BA (see <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at 13–37 and Bennett &amp; Armour at para 2.111). In the present case, there is no evidence that Pictorial entered into the Legal Mortgage “for the purpose of carrying on its business”, as opposed to <span class="font-italic">AIPL</span>’s business. There is also no evidence of Pictorial or NSP receiving any benefit, or of Pictorial having reasonable grounds to believe that it (as opposed to AIPL) would obtain such a benefit, from the Legal Mortgage. We are unable to accept Rothstar’s contention that the transaction was part of Pictorial’s business because Pictorial’s only business was to hold the Property for NSP’s benefit, and NSP wanted to grant the Legal Mortgage as security for the Loan to AIPL, which was his main business; or that this benefit to NSP was a benefit to Pictorial because NSP, being Pictorial’s sole shareholder, would then have been able to make capital injections to support Pictorial. In our view, it would impermissibly strain the clear language of Reg 6 if the “business” of personal corporate vehicles was interpreted as extending to whatever the individual that incorporated them wished them to do. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Legal Mortgage was a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 We turn now to the issue of whether the Legal Mortgage is voidable as a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors under s 73B(1) of the CLPA. We agree with the Judge that the Legal Mortgage was <span class="font-italic">not </span>a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The applicable principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee v Ong and Co Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 (“<span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Wong Ser Wan v Ng Bok Eng Holdings Pte Ltd and another </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 365 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong</span><span class="font-italic"> Ser Wan</span>”) are not in dispute. The Liquidator and the Private Trustees bear the burden of proving that the elements of s 73B(1) of the CLPA are satisfied (<span class="font-italic">Wong Ser Wan </span>at [5]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Rothstar submits that there is no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding that the Legal Mortgage was not a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors. Valuable consideration for the Legal Mortgage was provided by way of the Loan disbursed by Rothstar in good faith. Further, even if NSP and Pictorial had had an intention to defraud their creditors, there is no evidence that Rothstar had notice of the same. On the other hand, the Liquidator and the Private Trustees contend that the Judge erred in holding that the Legal Mortgage was made without the intent to defraud creditors. Having found that the Legal Mortgage was of no benefit to Pictorial or NSP, the Judge should have concluded that no or nominal consideration was provided for the Legal Mortgage, and consequently that it was sufficient to show that Pictorial or NSP was deeply indebted when the Legal Mortgage was granted. In any event, Pictorial and NSP had the actual intent to defraud their creditors by granting the Legal Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In our view, the Legal Mortgage does not fall within the class of voluntary conveyances made for no or nominal consideration. We affirm the Judge’s finding (at [51] and [81] of the GD) that valid consideration was provided by Rothstar for the Legal Mortgage. In our view, this consideration took the form of not only the discharge of the Equitable Mortgage (which the Judge identified at [50] of the GD), but also, as a matter of commercial reality, the Loan extended to AIPL (see [48] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Liquidator and the Private Trustees argue, based on the Federal Court of Australia’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Commissioner of Taxation v Oswal (No 6) </span>(2016) 339 ALR 560 (“<span class="font-italic">Oswal</span>”), that a mortgage granted to secure a loan extended to a third party (and not to the mortgagor) is a conveyance for no or nominal consideration. However, we do not think <span class="font-italic">Oswal </span>stands for the proposition that the grant of a mortgage to secure a loan extended to a third party is <span class="font-italic">invariably </span>a conveyance made for no or nominal consideration. Depending on the circumstances, a loan extended to a third party at the mortgagor’s request may well constitute valuable consideration for the grant of security. In any event, as Rothstar correctly points out, the court in <span class="font-italic">Oswal </span>inferred that the mortgagor had the requisite intention to defraud her creditors from all the circumstances of the case (see <span class="font-italic">Oswal</span> at [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As the Legal Mortgage was not granted for no or nominal consideration, it must be shown that Pictorial and NSP acted with the <span class="font-italic">actual intent to defraud</span> their creditors, and that the transferee<span class="font-italic"> </span>had notice of the transferor’s fraudulent intention (see <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee </span>at [14] and <span class="font-italic">Wong Ser Wan </span>at [8]). The Liquidator and the Private Trustees cannot rely only on the indebtedness of Pictorial and NSP to raise an inference of the requisite intent to defraud. “Defraud” in this context carries the meaning of depriving creditors of timely recourse to property that would otherwise be applicable for their benefit, and the Liquidator and the Private Trustees must establish “some degree of dishonesty” on the part of Pictorial and/or NSP in order to succeed (<span class="font-italic">Wong Ser Wan </span>at [6]). We see no reason to depart from the Judge’s finding (at [81] of the GD) that actual intent to defraud has not been established. Even if Pictorial and NSP’s creditors were in fact worse off after the grant of the Legal Mortgage, there is no evidence that they granted the Legal Mortgage with the <span class="font-italic">intention </span>of putting their creditors in a worse position in this manner, or that they acted with any dishonesty in doing so. The various background facts highlighted by the Liquidator and the Private Trustees beginning from May 2019 are, as Rothstar submits, not sufficient to show otherwise. There is also nothing to suggest that Rothstar had notice of any intent on the part of Pictorial or NSP to defraud their respective creditors at the relevant time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 We therefore accept the Judge’s finding that the Legal Mortgage was not a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors that would be voidable under s 73B(1) of the CLPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the Private Trustees’ Caveat ought to be removed </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Judge dismissed Rothstar’s application to remove the Private Trustees’ Caveat on the sole basis that the Legal Mortgage was “void” (GD at [86]). For the reasons set out at [60] above, we do not agree that the Legal Mortgage’s status as a transaction at an undervalue rendered it void. Nevertheless, we affirm the Judge’s ultimate decision to dismiss this application on different grounds: namely, that Rothstar can no longer avail itself of the statutory remedy provided to caveatees by s 127(1) of the LTA once the Legal Mortgage is discharged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Once the Legal Mortgage is set aside, Rothstar would cease to have any interest in the Property as a registered legal mortgagee. Rothstar would then no longer be a “caveatee” to whom s 127(1) of the LTA provides a remedy: a “caveatee” is defined in s 4(1) of the LTA as “the proprietor or other owner of land described in a caveat and to whom notice of the caveat is required to be given”, and a “proprietor” is “any person who appears from the land-register to be the person entitled to an estate or interest in any land which has been brought under the provisions of this Act, and includes a mortgagee, chargee and lessee”. Rothstar does not appear to have lodged any caveat in respect of its claimed interest in the Property under the Legal Mortgage so as to be able to rely on s 127(6) of the LTA. On this basis, we dismiss Rothstar’s application for the removal of the Private Trustees’ Caveat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Furthermore, Rothstar’s submission that the Private Trustees lacked standing to lodge the Private Trustees’ Caveat because they had no pre-existing caveatable interest in the Property when the Private Trustees’ Caveat was lodged is wholly misconceived. Rothstar relies on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Power Knight Pte Ltd v Natural Fuel Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) and others </span>[2010] 3 SLR 82 (“<span class="font-italic">Power Knight</span>”) in support of its argument that the Property, as an asset secured by the Legal Mortgage, fell outside the general pool of assets available to the unsecured creditors (whom the Private Trustees represent). However, this reliance is misplaced. The liquidators in <span class="font-italic">Power Knight </span>were claiming no interest in the property in their own right; their interest was contingent on the company’s unsecured creditors having an interest in the property. Under s 269(2) of the CA, an order of court is necessary for the property of a company to vest in a liquidator. In contrast, s 76(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the BA provides that the property of a bankrupt individual shall vest in the Official Assignee upon the making of the bankruptcy order, without any further conveyance, assignment or transfer. Thus, by operation of the BA, NSP’s 1% interest in the Property vested in the Private Trustees on 12 March 2020 when the bankruptcy order was made. Further, pursuant to s 111 of the LTA read with s 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BA, the Private Trustees were statutorily entitled to lodge the Private Trustees’ Caveat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Private Trustees therefore had a clear entitlement to lodge and maintain the Private Trustees’ Caveat under s 115(1) of the LTA. In contrast, following the discharge of the Legal Mortgage, Rothstar would have <span class="font-italic">no </span>interest in the Property. In these circumstances, we do not think it is necessary for us to weigh the balance of convenience (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow Kon v Tan Swat Ping and others </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 881<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [89]). Even if the Private Trustees’ interest in the Property is purely economic and limited to 1% of its value (as Rothstar contends), the balance of convenience in this case plainly lies in favour of maintaining the Private Trustees’ Caveat.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Rothstar’s appeals but, for the reasons explained above, we order that the Legal Mortgage be discharged instead of declared void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As to costs, we order Rothstar to pay the Liquidator and the Private Trustees the costs of the appeals. In view of the fact that the Liquidator and the Private Trustees were represented by the same counsel and raised essentially the same arguments to oppose the appeals, we fix the costs of the appeals at $60,000 in total for both the Liquidator and the Private Trustees, inclusive of disbursements. As the new points raised by Rothstar on appeal have not ultimately succeeded, and the Liquidator’s and Private Trustees’ applications for leave to raise new points were brought in response to Rothstar’s applications, we also order Rothstar to pay the costs of the summonses, which we fix at $5,000 in total for both the Liquidator and the Private Trustees, inclusive of disbursements.

NSP was also the sole shareholder and one of the two directors of Pictorial Development Pte Ltd (“Pictorial”). Pictorial owned 99% of a property (“the Property”), with the remaining 1% owned by NSP in his own name.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 AIPL entered into an agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) with Rothstar Group Limited (“Rothstar”) under which Rothstar agreed to loan $5m to AIPL (“the Loan”). NSP and Pictorial granted an equitable mortgage over the Property to Rothstar as security for the fulfilment of AIPL’s obligations under the Loan Agreement. After AIPL failed to make repayment of the Loan by the date stipulated under the Loan Agreement and the repayment deadline was extended twice, the equitable mortgage was terminated in consideration of NSP and Pictorial agreeing to grant Rothstar a legal mortgage over the Property. Subsequently, NSP and Pictorial executed this legal mortgage as security for all sums due and payable by them and/or AIPL to Rothstar (“the Legal Mortgage”). AIPL ultimately failed to repay the Loan. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 A bankruptcy order was made against NSP, and his private trustees in bankruptcy (“the Private Trustees”) lodged a caveat against the Property. Pictorial was wound up and a liquidator was appointed (“the Liquidator”). Thereafter, AIPL was wound up.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The Liquidator and the Private Trustees applied for the Legal Mortgage to be set aside on the ground that it was a transaction at an undervalue or a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors. Rothstar in turn applied for the removal of the Private Trustees’ caveat. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Judge held that the Legal Mortgage was void as a transaction at an undervalue, but was not a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors. The Judge also dismissed Rothstar’s application to remove the Private Trustees’ caveat. Rothstar appealed against the Judge’s decision.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Transactions at an undervalue</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Whereas s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the BA”) was concerned only with the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of consideration in the contractual sense, s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA required a <span class="font-italic">comparison of value </span>between the consideration provided and the consideration received. In undertaking the value comparison exercise under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), two points were key: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[24]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 First, the value comparison exercise had to be undertaken from the perspective of the <span class="font-italic">grantor</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the insolvent individual or company). While the relevant consideration need not have been received by the grantor directly, the <span class="font-italic">value </span>of that consideration was relevant only in so far as it accrued to the grantor. Nevertheless, the grantor’s mere <span class="font-italic">perception</span> of value would not suffice; what matters was the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> value received and provided by the grantor: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">25]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[26]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Second, both the value of the consideration provided and the value of the consideration received by the grantor had to be assessed “in money or money’s worth”. This required the value of the consideration to be <span class="font-italic">quantifiable in monetary terms</span>, even if the precise monetary value could not be immediately determined with certainty. Where the value of the consideration was precarious or speculative, some evidence would be needed to establish and quantify its value in monetary terms: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[30]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The principle in the English case of <span class="font-italic">Re MC Bacon Ltd</span> [1990] BCLC 324 (“<span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>”) should be adopted as part of Singapore law, in preference to the approach in <span class="font-italic">Hill v Spread Trustee Co Ltd and another </span>[2007] 1 WLR 2404. It was supported by the weight of authority and was also sound in principle. Thus, the grant of security for <span class="font-italic">the grantor’s existing debt </span>would not constitute a transaction at an undervalue: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[40]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Nevertheless, the principle in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>applied <span class="font-italic">within</span>, and not in the alternative to, the value comparison exercise in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA. It therefore could not be applied as a blanket rule to <span class="font-italic">all </span>grants of security for existing debts. In particular, it did not apply where the relevant security was granted in respect of a <span class="font-italic">third party’s </span>existing debt. Such a grant of security could, in principle, constitute a transaction at an undervalue under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[43]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[45]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 On the facts, there was no value received by Pictorial and NSP in money or money’s worth which could be compared with the significant value provided by them. The value <span class="font-italic">provided</span> by Pictorial and NSP was twofold: first, the Legal Mortgage securing AIPL’s debt; and second, a new primary obligation to repay the Loan which they assumed under the terms of the Legal Mortgage. As for the value <span class="font-italic">received </span>by Pictorial and NSP, there was no evidence of Pictorial and NSP receiving the value of the Loan or any benefit therefrom that could be assessed in money or money’s worth. The benefit that Rothstar claimed Pictorial and NSP received from the Loan was an unparticularised and unsubstantiated benefit which was said to accrue to them merely by dint of their association with AIPL. The Legal Mortgage was therefore a transaction at an undervalue under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[47] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">49] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[51]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Pictorial and NSP were insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a result of, granting the Legal Mortgage. The Liquidator and the Private Trustees were not estopped from arguing that the Legal Mortgage was liable to be avoided as a transaction at an undervalue, as this would subvert the statutory scheme of s 98 of the BA: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">55] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The consequence of the Legal Mortgage being a transaction at an undervalue was <span class="font-italic">not </span>that it was “void”. Under s 98(2) of the BA, the court had the power to make an order to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into. However, the transaction itself was not retrospectively avoided. The appropriate order was an order discharging the Legal Mortgage with prospective effect, without more: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[60]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, [61] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Voluntary conveyances to defraud creditors </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 The Legal Mortgage was not a voluntary conveyance to defraud creditors under s 73B(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed). Valid consideration had been provided by Rothstar for the Legal Mortgage, in the form of both the discharge of the equitable mortgage and the Loan extended to AIPL. There was no evidence that Pictorial and NSP had acted with the actual intent to defraud their creditors, and there was also nothing to suggest that Rothstar had notice of any such intent at the relevant time: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">68]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[71]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">,</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">73] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[74]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Removal of the Private Trustees’ caveat</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Once the Legal Mortgage was set aside, Rothstar would cease to have any interest in the Property as a registered legal mortgagee.
