        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This claim arises out of a road traffic
                    accident. The plaintiff was a pillion rider on a motor-cycle ridden by her
                    husband, the first defendant. The motor-cycle was, unfortunately, involved
                    in a collision with a bus driven by the second defendant, an employee of the
                    third defendant. The plaintiff and the first defendant were both flung off the
                    motor-cycle and sustained injuries. The plaintiff’s case is that both the
                    first defendant and the second defendant were negligent and therefore they (and
                    the third defendant vicariously) are liable to her. The first and second
                    defendants blame each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Accordingly, the issue to be decided is whether
                    the accident was caused solely by the first defendant or solely by the second
                    defendant or whether both of them contributed to it. If both are found to have
                    been negligent, then the subsidiary issue would be how liability between them is
                    to be apportioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accident took place at about 8.45am on 12
                    July 2012. It took place inside the traffic-light controlled cross-junction of
                    Jurong Town Hall Road and Gateway Link. The third defendant’s bus No
                    SBS3059M (“the Bus”) was then being driven by the second defendant
                    along Jurong Town Hall Road in the direction of Ayer Rajah Expressway and was
                    proceeding straight across the junction. The first defendant was riding
                    motor-cycle No JNS1170 (“the Motor-cycle”) with his wife, the
                    plaintiff, riding pillion. The Motor-cycle had come from the opposite direction
                    along Jurong Town Hall Road and was making a right turn into Gateway Link in the
                    direction of Boon Lay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The collision occurred inside the junction while
                    the Bus was proceeding across it and the Motor-cycle was making a right turn.
                    The point of impact was within the junction and along the extreme left lane
                    which was the bus lane being used by the Bus at the time. The traffic lights
                    were green in favour of the Bus at the time the Bus entered the
                junction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Entering the junction from the direction of the
                    second defendant driving the Bus, there were five lanes on Jurong Town Hall Road
                    towards Ayer Rajah Expressway. The right-most lane was exclusively for vehicles
                    turning right. The remaining four lanes were for vehicles proceeding straight
                    only. About 30m or so before the junction, the left-most lane led to a slip road
                    for vehicles turning left into Gateway Link.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the opposite direction and heading towards
                    the Pan Island Expressway, which was the direction the first defendant had been
                    riding in prior to the turn, there were also five lanes. The right-most lane was
                    exclusively for vehicles turning right. There was no turning pocket along the
                    right-most lane. The remaining four lanes were for vehicles proceeding straight
                    only. About 30m or so before the junction, the left-most lane led to a slip road
                    for vehicles turning left into Gateway Link.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff and the first defendant are
                    Malaysians living in Johor Bahru who travel to work in Singapore every day. At
                    the material time, it was the couple’s usual routine to enter Singapore on
                    the Motor-cycle and for the first defendant to drop the plaintiff off at her
                    place of work in Jurong East, before proceeding to his own office in Kallang
                    Way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The route taken by the first defendant on 12
                    July 2012 was the usual route taken in the mornings when he took the plaintiff
                    to work. The plaintiff rode pillion and wore a crash helmet. In her affidavit,
                    she said that they were travelling along Jurong Town Hall Road when they reached
                    the junction with Gateway Link. The first defendant stopped his Motor-cycle to
                    check for the traffic lights and oncoming vehicles. After ensuring that the
                    lights were green in his favour and that there were no oncoming vehicles, the
                    first defendant turned right into Gateway Link with his signal on. The Bus,
                    travelling from the opposite direction, collided into the Motor-cycle when the
                    first defendant had almost completed making his right turn. The plaintiff and
                    the first defendant were flung off the Motor-cycle and the plaintiff landed on
                    the road and lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In court the plaintiff admitted that she had no
                    memory of the accident and all that she had said in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of her
                    affidavit, being the facts I have summarised above, had been told to her by the
                    first defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s evidence about the first
                    defendant having stopped at the junction and ensuring that there were no
                    oncoming vehicles before he made his right-turn cannot serve as corroboration of
                    the first defendant’s similar account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     From the plaintiff’s point of view, her
                    lack of memory is not fatal or even very significant. She was an innocent party
                    injured by events caused by the first and/or the second defendant. In this
                    situation, the law is that the proper inference to be drawn is that the
                    collision was caused either by the negligence of both the first and second
                    defendants or by the negligence of the first defendant or of the second
                    defendant and it is for the defendants to rebut the inference of negligence on
                    their part and show that they were blameless (see <em>Tan Eng Bok
                        v Kim Meng Kok</em> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 554).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The first defendant in his affidavit gave an
                    account similar to that given by the plaintiff in her affidavit. He said that at
                    about 8.45am that day he was travelling along Jurong Town Hall Road in the
                    extreme right lane. When he reached the junction of Jurong Town Hall Road and
                    Gateway Link, he stopped to check and to ensure that the traffic lights were
                    green in his favour. As they were green and as the traffic opposite to him along
                    Jurong Town Hall Road was clear, he started to make the right turn slowly with
                    his indicator turned on. Just as he was about to complete the turn into Gateway
                    Link, the second defendant, driving the Bus which was travelling from the
                    opposite direction along Jurong Town Hall Road, collided into the rear of the
                    Motor-cycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In court, the first defendant said that at the
                    time of impact he was travelling at 40km/h and that he had reached this speed
                    from a stopped position. He also agreed that the distance between the point
                    where he had stopped and the point of impact was quite short. Further, he
                    testified that whilst the plaintiff started work at 9.30am, he was supposed to
                    start work at 9am every day. He indicated that it took between 35 and 45 minutes
                    to travel from the plaintiff’s work place to his own and agreed that,
                    therefore, on the morning in question he was late. He denied that he was in a
                    hurry and had not stopped at the junction because he was late for work. His
                    position was that he was late for work every day and that his employer did not
                    mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The first defendant was charged under s
                        65(<em>b</em>) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004
                    Rev Ed) for inconsiderate driving. He stated that purely for the purpose of
                    resolving the matter quickly, he compounded the offence by paying a fine of $200
                    and accepting nine demerit points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The second defendant stated that at the
                    material time he was driving the Bus, which was plying the SBS service route 78,
                    along the bus lane of Jurong Town Hall Road from Jurong East Interchange towards
                    Gateway Link. In court, the second defendant said that he had been driving this
                    route for about a year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the material time the weather was clear,
                    the road surface was dry and the traffic volume was moderate. The second
                    defendant intended to cross the junction and proceed along Jurong Town Hall
                    Road. As he approached the junction, he noticed that the traffic lights were
                    showing green in his favour. As such, he continued to drive the Bus forward at a
                    speed of about 20 to 25 km/h. Suddenly, the Motor-cycle which was coming from
                    the opposite direction made a right turn into Gateway Link. As a result, the Bus
                    hit the rear portion of the Motor-cycle and both the first defendant and the
                    plaintiff fell onto the road. There were about ten passengers in the Bus at that
                    time. None of them was injured as a result of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Contrary to the impression given by his
                    affidavit, the second defendant admitted in court that he had not seen the
                    Motor-cycle prior to the accident. The first time he saw it was after the Bus
                    hit the Motor-cycle and he stopped.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Bus was equipped with a CCTV system which
                    recorded events both inside and outside the Bus. During the trial, relevant
                    video footage from various cameras was shown and I was able to view the second
                    defendant at the wheel of the Bus from shortly before it entered the bus-stop
                    before the junction until the Bus stopped almost immediately after hitting the
                    Motor-cycle. I was also able to see the left-hand side of the road as the Bus
                    moved along and the view directly in front of the Bus. However, there was no
                    footage showing the right-hand side of the Bus and therefore the recording did
                    not capture the movement of the Motor-cycle across the junction or the collision
                    itself although the audio portion of the recording reproduced the sound of the
                    impact. I have found the video footage very helpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The first defendant submitted that there was
                    something suspect about the fact that the CCTV recording did not reflect the
                    most crucial part of the incident, <em>ie</em>, the
                    Motor-cycle travelling across the junction. He says that this view would have
                    reflected the manner in which he rode, the estimated speed he was travelling at
                    and whether the second defendant could have avoided the accident. The first
                    defendant wants me to infer that a part of the CCTV recording has been
                    deliberately suppressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first defendant has put forward nothing to
                    substantiate his suspicion. There is no evidence that the Bus had another camera
                    in a position from which it could have captured the first defendant travelling
                    across the junction. The third defendant’s position was that it had
                    disclosed footage from all cameras mounted in and on the Bus and that it had not
                    suppressed any footage. If counsel wishes to make a submission of suppression of
                    evidence, he has to have more basis to do so than an insinuation that such
                    evidence would have been adverse to the other party. I have no reason to doubt
                    that the full video footage has been disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is indisputable in this case that the Bus
                    that was proceeding straight across the junction had the right of way since the
                    traffic light was showing green to oncoming traffic. The first defendant who
                    wanted to turn right across the junction therefore had to give way to oncoming
                    traffic and make sure that the road was clear before he made the turn. <em>Prima facie</em>, in an accident of this kind, the turning
                    vehicle is more likely to be the primary cause of the accident. This does not
                    mean, however, that the vehicle that is proceeding straight can go on its merry
                    way without regard to the possibility of turning traffic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is well established that the law requires a
                    motorist to act on the basis that there may be negligence and incompetence on
                    the part of other road users and to make allowance for them, but without having
                    to contemplate possibilities that are remote. See <em>SBS Transit
                        Ltd v Stafford Rosemary Anne Jane</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 211 at [33]
                        (“<em>Stafford</em>”). As Lee Seiu Kin J
                    observed in <em>Stafford</em>, the crux of the issue is
                    what a reasonable person would apprehend in a particular set of circumstances.
                    Whilst the facts of that case are somewhat different from the one before me, in
                    that there a turning bus collided with a pedestrian who was moving straight, the
                    court made useful observations regarding how motorists should act when
                    approaching intersections. At [37] the court stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… An intersection is that part of the road where a vehicle may cut
                        across the path of other vehicles. When a motorist approaching an
                        intersection sees a vehicle poised to make a turn across his path, the first
                        thing that he must prepare for is the possibility that the other driver will
                        make the turn before he clears the intersection. He must watch out for any
                        indication that the driver might do so. Above all, he must drive his vehicle
                        at a speed that enables him to react appropriately should this occur. The
                        last thing that he should assume is that the vehicle will definitely wait
                        for him to pass merely because he has the right of way according to road
                        traffic rules. One must bear in mind that these rules are enacted for
                        reasons of safety and to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic. Road users
                        are entitled to assume that such rules will generally be followed, and
                        indeed any person who fails to comply with any of these rules and breaches
                        the law as a result may find himself charged with an offence and punished
                        accordingly. But this assumption must be tempered with the realisation that,
                        as in any activity, human failings and weaknesses always exist.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Accordingly, while the first defendant who was
                    going to make a turn across the path of oncoming traffic had the duty give way
                    to such traffic, the second defendant was required to keep a good lookout and
                    drive in such fashion when crossing the junction that he would be able to avoid
                    or mitigate a dangerous situation that might be created by other road
                    users.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first defendant, obviously recognising
                    that he did not have the right of way, contended that he had taken all
                    reasonable care because he had stopped in the junction and had then made sure
                    that the oncoming traffic had cleared the junction before he started the
                    crossing. His story was that he was stationary for about 15 seconds and moved
                    off slowly and gradually after the oncoming vehicles had cleared the junction.
                    He was not speeding. He was not in a rush because he was always late for work
                    and his employer did not mind. When he first saw the Bus it was at the bus-stop
                    and later, after some vehicles had passed, he noticed that the Bus had left the
                    bus-stop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first defendant’s story is not
                    believable. According to him, he was able to accelerate from 0 km/h to 40 km/h
                    in a very short space of time and over a very short distance, being the distance
                    between the point at which he stopped for oncoming traffic and the point of
                    impact. The distance could not have been very much more than 15m because he
                    crossed four traffic lanes before hitting the Bus and each lane was around 3 to
                    3.5m wide. The first defendant was not riding a powerful vehicle – the
                    Motor-cycle had an engine capacity of only 125cc – and bearing in mind
                    that it was carrying two persons it is unlikely that he could have accelerated
                    to a speed of 40 km/h from a stationary position in that distance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The first defendant was late for work. He
                    admitted that his working hours started at 9am. Since it would take him at least
                    35 minutes to get to his work place from the junction, he must have known at
                    that point (8.45am) that he would be at least 20 minutes late for work. The
                    first defendant said that his employer did not mind him being late because he
                    lived in Johor Bahru but that assertion is not convincing. If the first
                    defendant’s employer was amenable to the first defendant coming in later
                    on a regular basis, he would surely have changed the first defendant’s
                    working hours and would not have required him to be there by 9am every day. To
                    me it seems more probable than not that the first defendant was in a rush that
                    morning. That the first defendant had not called his employer as a witness does
                    not assist his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The first defendant said that he started
                    making the right turn only when there was no traffic coming from the other side
                    and the only approaching vehicles that he could see were very far away. He also
                    said that at this point the Bus was at the bus-stop. It should be noted that the
                    bus-stop was about 50m away from the junction. The first defendant also said
                    that when he started moving to make the right turn, the Bus also started
                    moving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The first defendant’s evidence is
                    contradicted by the video footage. The footage shows that just as the Bus was
                    about to leave the bus-stop, there were at least three vehicles approaching the
                    junction to the right of the Bus and in front of it. One of these vehicles was a
                    fairly large van or truck. These would have been the oncoming vehicles that the
                    first defendant referred to and if the first defendant was indeed waiting at the
                    junction, they would have blocked his view of the Bus starting to move off. In
                    fact, the first defendant himself would not have been starting to move then
                    because of the presence of these vehicles approaching the junction. At the time
                    when the Bus started to leave the bus-stop, the path for the first defendant to
                    turn right was not clear, contrary to his assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Secondly, based on the video footage, from the
                    time the Bus exited the bus-stop, it was accelerating slowly and reached a speed
                    of about 23 km/h just before it reached the junction. Considering the distance
                    between the bus-stop and the junction (50m) and the speed at which the second
                    defendant was going, it would have been impossible for the Bus to collide with
                    the Motor-cycle if they had both left their stationary positions at the same
                    time, as the first defendant insisted. Even if the first defendant travelled
                    more than 15m because he was travelling in a curve, considering that he had got
                    up to a speed of 40 km/h by the time of the accident, if indeed he had left the
                    stationary spot in the junction when he said he did, he would have been clear of
                    the junction when the Bus arrived there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I conclude that the first defendant was not at
                    the junction when the Bus was at the bus-stop. Instead, as the second and third
                    defendants submit, the Bus was already approaching the junction when the first
                    defendant made the right turn without stopping first and without keeping a good
                    lookout. The objective evidence supports the proposition put forward by the
                    second and third defendants that the first defendant assumed that there were no
                    other vehicles coming after the vehicles along lanes one to four (which passed
                    the Bus at the station) had cleared the junction. He failed to notice the Bus
                    approaching in the extreme left lane. The Bus was a big bus, being a
                    double-decker, and if the first defendant had been stationary and keeping a
                    proper lookout, he would have seen it approaching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I am satisfied that the first defendant was
                    negligent. Because he was in a hurry to get to work, he did not stop at the
                    junction but, having seen the other vehicles cross it, he assumed all was clear
                    and made the right turn without noticing the Bus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This conclusion does not mean that the second
                    defendant was not negligent. The first defendant says that he should have kept a
                    proper lookout as well and points out that the Bus was equipped with a very long
                    and wide windscreen and there was also a side window on the driver’s
                    right-hand side. Accordingly, if the second defendant had just turned his head
                    to the right when approaching the junction, he would have seen the Motor-cycle
                    and been able to either slow down or stop to avoid the accident. There is some
                    force in this argument: the video footage shows clearly that from the time he
                    left the bus-stop, the second defendant looked either straight ahead or to his
                    left; he does not appear to have glanced to the right at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The second defendant says that he was not
                    negligent because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     he was travelling at a reasonable
                        speed in the circumstances;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     the speed limit along Jurong Town Hall Road is 70 km/h
                        but the speed of the Bus was not more than 23 km/h;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     there was no legal duty on him to slow
                        down automatically when he approached the junction; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     the second defendant’s view of
                        the junction was obstructed by vehicles on the right-hand
                    side.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I accept that the second defendant was
                    travelling suitably slowly and that that he did not need to slow down
                    automatically as he approached the junction. I do not accept, however, that
                    there was any evidence that as he approached the junction his view was
                    obstructed. The vehicles that were travelling along the road in front of the Bus
                    were a distance in front of him and would have crossed the junction before he
                    reached it. There is no footage showing that there were vehicles on his
                    right-hand side just as the second defendant reached the junction or when he
                    entered it. The fact that the left-hand front portion of the Bus hit the rear of
                    the Motor-cycle shows clearly that the Motor-cycle had almost completed the turn
                    when the collision took place. In the circumstances, I think it more likely than
                    not that if the second defendant had been looking to his right he would have
                    seen the Motor-cycle as it began its turn and would have been able to warn it or
                    brake or try and take evasive action. It is clear from the video footage that
                    the second defendant was completely shocked by the accident and only became
                    aware of the Motor-cycle’s presence after impact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second defendant had the right of way but
                    he also had a duty to take care so as to avoid or mitigate the consequences of
                    the mistakes of other road users. An experienced driver, he should have known of
                    the possibility that another motorist might try to cross the junction too early.
                    He should have kept a better lookout so that he would have been prepared to deal
                    with such a situation. I find that the second defendant was negligent as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Having found both the first and second
                    defendants to have contributed to the accident by their negligence, the question
                    that remains is how, between themselves, liability should be apportioned. In my
                    judgment, the first defendant was definitely more to blame than the second
                    defendant because he crossed the junction when he should not have without regard
                    to the presence of oncoming traffic. If the second defendant had seen the
                    Motor-cycle, he may have been able to avoid the accident but that is not
                    certain. His responsibility must be less. I consider that as between the
                    defendants, liability should be apportioned 85% to the first defendant and 15%
                    to the second defendant and consequently to the third defendant as
                well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the reasons given above, there will be
                    judgment for the plaintiff against all the defendants for damages to be
                    assessed. As between the defendants themselves, their liability is fixed at
                    85:15 in favour of the second and third defendants. The parties have given me
                    their submissions on costs. I fix the costs payable to the plaintiff up to
                    the end of trial at $17,000 plus reasonable disbursements. The sum of $17,000
                    takes into account the fact that there were three defendants, that the trial
                    took one full day and that parties put in written closing submissions. <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the plaintiff, the defendants shall be jointly
                    and severally liable to pay, but between themselves liability for costs shall be
                    apportioned in the same ratio as damages.</p>
