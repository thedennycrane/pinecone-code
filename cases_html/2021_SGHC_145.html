The law in this area is well-settled, and I set out the general principles applicable here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 A statement is considered to be defamatory if it tends to (<span class="font-italic">Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 2 SLR 751 at [36]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) cause the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The defamatory nature of a statement may come about in two broad senses, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</span> [2010] 1 SLR 52 at [26]: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) in their natural and ordinary meaning, which includes any meaning capable of being inferred from the offending words standing on their own in addition to their literal meaning; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) in their innuendo meaning, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in some other meaning (apart from the natural and ordinary meaning) which, although not defamatory from the viewpoint of the ordinary reasonable person, is nonetheless defamatory from the viewpoint of people with knowledge of the special meaning of the offending words or the relevant extrinsic facts.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 It is the natural and ordinary meaning of the published statements which takes up most of the appellant’s and the respondent’s submissions.  In construing the natural and ordinary meanings of offending words, the general principles are as follows (<span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 506 (“<span class="font-italic">Bernard Chan”</span>) at [18]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the natural and ordinary meaning of a word is that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable person;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) as the test is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended to convey is irrelevant;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can read between the lines and draw inferences;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) where there are a number of possible interpretations, some of which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only the defamatory one;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus “the bane and the antidote must be taken together”; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) the ordinary reasonable reader will take note of the circumstances and manner of the publication.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Before I proceed to consider each of the published statements in detail, I note that a common thread of the appellant’s submissions in relation to each set of statements is that the respondent’s reputation had not suffered, as she already had a poor reputation even prior to the making of the statements.  I reject this submission.  As I pointed out to counsel for the appellant during the hearing, the test for defamation is whether a statement <span class="font-italic">tends </span>to cause the plaintiff’s reputation to be lowered in the eyes of right-thinking members of society generally.  It is not whether the defamatory words <span class="font-italic">actually</span> caused such lowering.  Words which are defamatory of a person remain as such even if they do not really lower him in the estimation of those to whom the words were uttered: <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong</span> [1983–1984] SLR(R) 745 at [11]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first set of statements: the January 2019 Facebook statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 From 5 to 9 January 2019, the appellant wrote 4 separate times in the “Comments” section of the respondent’s Facebook page.

Instead, the appellant contends that the District Judge erred by failing to understand that many of the words used were colloquialisms and would have been understood by readers of the Facebook page of the respondent differently.  For example, the words “cheapskate” and “free loader” simply meant that the respondent got the dashboard camera from Revology for free.

</div>  The appellant did not make any submissions about the meaning found by the District Judge in relation to the use of the word “poser” to describe the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 There is little doubt in my mind that the appellant’s contentions in relation to the first set of statements are without merit.  The ordinary meaning of the words “cheapskate” and “free loader” is that the respondent is a person who will try to take advantage of others to obtain things for free.  Applying the test described above (at [10]), this is clearly defamatory of the respondent, because it would lower her reputation in the eyes of an ordinary, right-thinking member of society.  I am unable to understand how a colloquial understanding of these words can mean anything else.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As for the use of the term “cyber bullying”, I think that the appellant has conflated the question of whether the published words are defamatory with the question of whether he has managed to prove the truth of his statements.  I agree with the District Judge that the use of the words “cyber bullying” to describe the respondent’s actions meant that the respondent was trying to exert undue pressure on Revology using her social media presence to get what she wanted.  That is defamatory of the respondent.  As to whether this imputation is true, that will be considered later when I consider the respondent’s defence of justification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Finally, I find the meaning the appellant suggests as the natural and ordinary meaning for “black heart” to be quite strained.  Instead, I agree with the District Judge that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words is that the respondent is an evil person with ill intentions, and that this meaning is defamatory.  Alternatively, I accept that the respondent has made out its pleaded case that the words “black heart” do bear the higher meaning that the respondent is a malevolent and malicious person.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second set of statements: the February 2019 Facebook statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On 27 February 2019, the respondent wrote a long Facebook post, which read as follows:

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At the oral hearing of the appeal, the appellant also attempted to argue that all he was referring to was that the respondent had lied about there being no gap between the fairings and the body of the motorcycle before she sent the motorcycle to Revology on 4 December 2018.  The words in the second set of statements did not mean that he was accusing the respondent of falsely claiming that Revology had damaged her motorcycle’s fairings.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my judgment, it is quite clear that the thrust of what was being conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable reader would have been that, in light of the linked video evidence of the state of the respondent’s motorcycle in May 2018, she had clearly lied in her blogpost concerning Revology having damaged her motorcycle’s fairings, and that she had lied in the SCT proceedings in order to get Revology to pay for damage which she knew was not caused by them.  While it is true that the appellant had posed a series of questions about the respondent’s complaint against Revology, the clear suggestion is that the respondent had made up this complaint, when she knew the damage to her motorcycle fairings already existed even before she had sent the motorcycle to Revology on 4 December 2018.  This is clear from the sarcastic reference to the respondent’s “very serious eye sight problem” for claiming to have not seen the gap in the motorcycle’s fairings until the visit to Revology on 4 December 2018, and the words “lies will be lies” and “[k]arma is also real”.  It is in this context that the questions posed by the respondent must be read in order to ascertain the meaning to be attributed to the words published.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I did not accept the point made by the appellant that he was only referring to the fact that the respondent had lied about there not being a pre-existing gap between the motorcycle fairings and its body, and not about any damage to the fairings caused by Revology.  This was an untenable argument given that his Facebook post actually states “[the respondent] accused Revology Bikes of breaking her fairings clip on December”, before referring to the specific parts of the video which he claims shows that the gap was already present.  This obviously was intended to convey the point that the presence of the gap prior to 4 December 2018 shows that the motorcycle fairings were already damaged by then.  This is also made clear by his statement towards the end of his post where he states: “I have also confirmed with an authorised Ducati supplier and workshop and they even quoted that replica fairings are very likely to break”.  To my mind, this reference to the respondent’s motorcycle’s fairings being likely to break is a clear indication that the appellant was referring to the damage to the fairings and not just the gap that existed before the motorcycle was sent to Revology on 4 December 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Thus, I find that the District Judge was entirely correct in deciding that the second set of statements conveyed the meaning that the respondent was a liar.

As already mentioned, the test for the meaning to be ascribed to an alleged defamatory statement is an objective one.  An ordinary, reasonable reader would read the WhatsApp message, together with the link to the longer Facebook post of 27 February 2019, as conveying the meaning that the respondent is a cheat, and that she had cheated by making a false claim to the SCT that Revology had damaged her motorcycle’s fairings.  I do not agree that the use of the word “ah?” or the laughing face emoji would somehow transform the meaning to a less serious one, or would render the allegation no longer defamatory.  I do not accept that the use of the word “ah” has a specific meaning in Singlish, as contended by the appellant.

More significantly, the link that was provided in the WhatsApp group message to the appellant’s Facebook post, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the second set of statements, which would provide the reader a detailed account of why the respondent is alleged to be dishonest, shows that this was not meant to be a light-hearted joke by the appellant.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I accept the arguments raised by the appellant in this respect.  When one examines the words used by the appellant in his 22 May 2019 comment on the Samsung Facebook page, it is clear that he was merely expressing the view that there are other motorcyclists that Samsung should have considered, who may not be social media influencers.  His point is that, if Samsung had done more research and checked with people in the “biking community”, they would have found out about other capable young men and women motorcyclists in Singapore.  That would be the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that he had used.  I do not think that the District Judge was correct in concluding that the meaning of the words was that the respondent was “not worthy” of being featured in the Samsung advertisement.  I find that the words used do not denigrate the respondent in this manner, but instead convey the view that there are other bikers that may be also worthy of consideration, if only Samsung had done their research.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At the oral hearing for the appeal, the respondent suggested that the phrases “I hope you start to take this more seriously” and “do some homework and fact finding before hiring an influencer” contained a certain venom and sting, and that the appellant’s comment was actually a “put down” of the respondent.  While I agree that the words used by the appellant were rather blunt and quite confrontational, I do not think that the overall meaning being conveyed is the one found by the District Judge, which is that the respondent is “not worthy” of being featured in the Samsung advertisement.  Rather, as already mentioned, the point that is conveyed is that there are other bikers who may be better representatives for Samsung.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the alternative, the respondent had pleaded at first instance that the fourth set of statements was defamatory by way of innuendo.

</div> This argument was not pursued in written submissions before me.  However, counsel for the respondent revived this contention during the hearing before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 A plaintiff who alleges innuendo bears the burden of proving the following elements (<span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004 at [106]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) there are facts extrinsic to the words, where such facts give rise to a defamatory imputation; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) those facts were known to one or more of the persons to whom the words were published; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) knowledge of those extrinsic facts could cause the words to convey the defamatory imputation on which the plaintiff relies, to a reasonable person possessing knowledge of those extrinsic facts. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The lateness of the respondent’s contention aside, I was not persuaded that the fourth set of statements constituted an innuendo.  Even in its pleadings and submissions at first instance, the respondent’s arguments in relation to innuendo failed to identify any pertinent extrinsic facts.  For instance, in its closing submissions at first instance, the respondent suggested that:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">By way of innuendo, the 4th Defamatory Statement as a whole suggests that there are many other capable people Samsung could have engaged “who can show you what dirt biking means”. This implies that the Plaintiff is not a capable and competent dirt biker, and that Samsung had erred by engaging the Plaintiff instead of others who are better riders and can better represent the biking community and/or Samsung.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The reasoning here does not refer to any extrinsic facts; instead, it is solely and inescapably rooted in the words of the fourth set of statements themselves.  It is an inference from the words published, which is often described as a “false innuendo”.  That argument is ultimately no different from one based on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, because such would include inferential meanings.  The respondent did not draw my attention to any extrinsic facts at the hearing before me either.  In my view, without identifying any such extrinsic facts, the argument that the fourth set of statements was defamatory by innuendo fails at the first hurdle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 For these reasons, I find that the meaning ascribed by the District Judge to the fourth set of statements is not borne out by the words used, whether by the ordinary meaning of the words or by innuendo.  In fact, none of the meanings pleaded by the respondent in relation to the fourth set of statements are made out.  The statements do not describe the respondent as an incompetent motorcyclist, or that she was not capable of being a serious representative for Samsung, or that she was an undesirable as a social media influencer to represent Samsung.  All these pleaded meanings are strained and unnatural readings of the words actually used by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defence of justification </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I turn next to consider the appellant’s pleaded case of justification, and his appeal against the findings of the District Judge that the defamatory statements were not justified.  In this regard, I will consider only whether the appellant has justified the first three sets of defamatory statements.  Given my finding that the fourth set of statements is not defamatory, there is no need for me to consider any defences in relation to those statements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the defence of justification to succeed, a defendant need only prove that the “sting” of a defamatory statement is true or substantially true: <span class="font-italic">Bernard Chan</span> at [43]–[44].  It is also well-established that the burden is on the defendant pleading justification as a defence to prove that the sting of the defamatory statements is true: <span class="font-italic">Bernard Chan</span> at [43].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It follows from my analysis of the first set of statements above that the stings of the libel therein are that (i) the respondent was trying to take advantage of Revology by taking the camera from them without paying for it (the “first sting”); and (ii) she used her position as a social media influencer to unfairly pressure Revology to get what she wanted (the “second sting”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for the second and third set of statements, the sting of the libel is that the respondent made a false claim in the SCT proceedings that Revology had damaged her motorcycle’s fairings, when she knew in fact that the damage already existed before she sent the motorcycle to Revology on 4 December 2018 for the camera to be removed and reinstalled (“the third sting”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I will consider whether each of the three stings have been justified by the appellant on the evidence before the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first sting</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The appellant argues that he is justified in describing the respondent as a “free loader” and a “cheapskate” because other Internet users have used these words to describe her as well.

First of all, the appellant was neither a party to the SCT proceedings nor a privy of Revology.

But it cannot be said that this principle has any role to play in the present proceedings.  The appellant has not been harassing or vexing the respondent with multiple suits.

He was defending himself by trying to show that it is true that the respondent had made a false claim against Revology that they had damaged her motorcycle’s fairings.

The appellant points to the fact that, if one examines the video carefully, one can see that there is a gap between the fairings and the motorcycle’s body.

</div>  I noted that Mr Sim’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief was silent on this point about the gap in the motorcycle’s fairings, and the broken catches.  It was only when Mr Sim was cross-examined that he raised this point about the gap indicating that the fairings’ catches were already broken.

</div>  I found this to be rather unsatisfactory.  Since this was a critical part of the appellant’s case, in that he had to prove that Revology did not damage the respondent’s motorcycle’s fairings, this point should have been clearly set out in Mr Sim’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and not just raised only during the course of his oral evidence.  As a result of this, one could fairly say that the respondent was taken by surprise by this evidence, and that she did not have an opportunity to fully deal with this evidence by calling, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, an expert witness to deal with the question of whether the existence of a gap between her fairings in May 2018 meant that the catches of the fairings were already broken by then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 There is an even greater difficulty faced by the appellant in terms of the evidence on this issue.

The issue here is the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>(1893) 6 R 67, the effect of which was aptly summed up in <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [42]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is clear that the allegation of cheating is precisely of such seriousness and importance that it needed, in the name of fairness, to have been put to the respondent if the appellant wished to persist in making it.  In this case, the respondent never had a chance to respond in her oral evidence to this allegation against her.  That being the case, I cannot fathom how the appellant expects this Court to come to a finding on the evidence that the respondent was indeed out to cheat Revology in her claim against them in the SCT proceedings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In addition, I do not think that the appellant has satisfactorily dealt with another critical piece of evidence in relation to an admission by Revology that they were responsible for the damage to the respondent’s motorcycle.  Let me explain.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 On 5 December 2018, the respondent had contacted Mr Sim of Revology and informed him of the damage to her motorcycle’s fairings.  Photographs of the gaps between the fairings were sent to Mr Sim.  On 7 December 2018, the respondent received a WhatsApp message from one Jerome Lee (“Mr Lee”), another director of Revology.

</div>  In my judgment, the appellant should have called Mr Lee to give evidence because he was the person who sent the two WhatsApp messages on 7 and 8 December 2018 to the respondent.  It is not satisfactory that Mr Sim was the one who was called to explain what his fellow director had stated.  He may be speculating as to the reasons for Mr Lee’s statements.  Consequently, I gave little weight to Mr Sim’s belated and second-hand explanations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I also find that the respondent has given a clear and cogent explanation as to when she first noticed the gaps in her motorcycle fairings, and how these differed significantly in size from the ones that were pre-existing.  As already mentioned, her evidence is supported by the screenshot from the video taken in May 2018, and the photographs she sent to Mr Sim on 5 December 2018.  The respondent also gave consistent evidence as to how she first came to find out about the damage to her motorcycle’s fairings on 7 December 2018, when she had sent her motorcycle to Bikeworkz to be repaired, which was two days after the first visit to Revology.

</div>  The appellant has appealed against these awards, which he describes as excessive and unwarranted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 While the appellant’s appeal is against the whole of the District Judge’s decision, and so extends to the final injunctions granted by the District Judge as well, the appellant did not address the final injunctions in either written or oral submissions before me.  In any event, I find that there is no basis to disturb the District Judge’s grant of the final injunctions, save that the injunctions in relation to the fourth set of statements in May 2019 should be set aside, given my finding that those statements are not defamatory of the respondent.  I turn now to address each of the categories of damages in dispute, bearing in mind that damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for the injury to his reputation and the hurt to his feelings, and not readily quantifiable by mathematical calculation: <span class="font-italic">Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 46 at [147].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The starting point in respect of general damages is my finding that the fourth set of statements is not defamatory of the respondent, which indicates that the award of $40,000 as general damages must be adjusted downwards.  In this regard, the respondent has not cross-appealed on the quantum of general damages she was awarded by the District Judge.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In considering the appropriate adjustment, two of the usual factors relevant to the determination of the quantum of general damages (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another and another appeal</span> [2010] 4 SLR 357 at [7]) are particularly germane: the position and standing of the plaintiff; and the extent of publication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The appellant argues that the respondent is not a professional, but simply an influencer on social media.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  Since an influencer on social media can become famous or infamous for reasons that have nothing to do with having a good reputation, the appellant argues that the respondent is not entitled to an award of general damages that is comparable to that for professionals.  I accept this argument as a matter of principle, but I think it does little to help me decide the appropriate quantum of general damages.  Also, the District Judge did not equate the respondent to that of a professional when she decided on the quantum of general damages.  All the District Judge observed was that the respondent was a “professional social media personality with [an] extensive number of followers”.

</div>
</div>
</div>  I agree with the District Judge that these considerations are not irrelevant in determining the appropriate quantum of general damages.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In my view, the respondent’s position as an influencer on social media, with a significant number of followers, makes her position more akin to that of a performing artiste, such as a singer or an actor.  In this regard, I place some weight on the fact that the unchallenged evidence is that the respondent made her living from being an influencer on social media, and that her reputation and “brand” would be important to her, although not in the same way that a doctor’s or lawyer’s reputation would be.  Nonetheless, I do not think that it can be seriously disputed that an influencer’s profile, following, and number and type of sponsorships would all be relevant factors in assessing the appropriate quantum of damages for defamation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 A further, more relevant consideration is the extent of the publication of each of the three sets of statements, which is something that the District Judge did not appear to have considered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The first set of statements would have been published to more people than the other two sets of statements.  This is because the first set of statements was published by the appellant on the respondent’s Facebook page, which was publicly available.  Also, the evidence is that the respondent had more than 40,000 followers on her Facebook page at the time when the first set of statements were published.  This number had increased to over 50,000 by the time of the trial.

</div>  While the possibility exists that the message was circulated thereafter by these WhatsApp group members, no evidence of such circulation was tendered before the court.

</div> well after the alleged defamatory statements that were the subject of the suit.  The posts were also not raised during the trial, which took place on 2, 15 and 27 October 2020; nor was there any attempt by the respondent to adduce them in evidence.  It was only at closing submissions that these documents were put before the court.  As such, the appellant did not have the opportunity to address and explain these social media postings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I agree with the appellant that the District Judge erred in this regard.  The key point here is that the relevant facts that are relied on for the claim for aggravated damages must be properly pleaded by the plaintiff.  This is so that the defendant can have a chance to respond and explain why these should not be considered in deciding the question of damages.  In cases where the court decides on liability first, and then orders an assessment of damages, this issue is not so acute because the factors that will be relied on for the appropriate quantum of damages will be fleshed out in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of the plaintiff in the assessment phase or, at the very least, specifically particularised by the plaintiff in the lead up to the assessment hearing.  However, in this case, I find that the appellant did not have a proper opportunity to respond in his evidence in relation to the social media postings he made from 12 August 2020 to 2 October 2020.  At the very least, the respondent’s counsel should have sought leave from the District Judge to adduce these documents into evidence and cross-examined the appellant on them, if the respondent wanted to rely on these documents for the purposes of submitting that aggravated damages should be ordered.  In this regard, the respondent accepted in the course of the oral submissions before me that the social media postings ought <span class="font-italic">not</span> to have been taken into account for the purposes of assessing quantum, but only to show that the appellant’s malice and lack of remorse.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 However, even if one were to disregard the documents annexed to the respondent’s closing submissions, there are sufficient factors in this case that would warrant an award of aggravated damages.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The factors which the court can take into account in deciding whether to award aggravated damages are not in dispute.  These factors were authoritatively set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 86<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55], citing <span class="font-italic">Gatley on Libel and Slander</span> (Patrick Milmo &amp; WVH Rogers eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 1998) at pp 212–213:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The conduct of a defendant which may often be regarded as aggravating the injury to the plaintiff’s feelings so as to support a claim for ‘aggravated’ damages includes a failure to make any or any sufficient apology and withdrawal, a repetition of the libel; conduct calculated to deter the plaintiff from proceeding, persistence by way of a prolonged or hostile cross-examination of the plaintiff …, a plea of justification which is bound to fail; the general conduct either of the preliminaries or of the trial itself calculated to attract wide publicity; and persecution of the plaintiff by other means.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Three of these aggravating factors are particularly relevant in the present case:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the appellant refused to apologise.  This was even though he was aware that the respondent had succeeded in the SCT proceedings against Revology.  At that stage, he should have re-considered his allegations against the respondent.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the appellant pursued a hopeless defence of justification.  I find it especially troubling that the appellant did not even adduce any proper evidence to show that the respondent was dishonest; instead, he simply insisted that he was justified in claiming that the respondent was a cheat.  Even if one takes the view that the appellant really believed in the truth of his allegation against the respondent that she had made a false claim against Revology, I find that this belief was not a reasonable one, or one that was grounded on any proper evidential basis.  As such, I find that the plea of justification was unreasonably maintained by the appellant at the trial.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, I find that the circumstances do demonstrate that the appellant harbours ill-will and feeling towards the respondent.  He was motivated by spite, and a misplaced sense of injustice.  The liberal use of expletives and the derogatory words he used, particularly in relation to the first set of statements, show this quite clearly.  I agree with the District Judge

</div> that the conduct of the appellant in tagging the respondent’s sponsors and business partners along with other motorcycle workshops in his second set of defamatory statements shows that he was acting maliciously.  There was no conceivable reason for the appellant to have done this, other than the fact that he must have had a dominant motive to damage the respondent.  In short, I find that there is evidence of actual malice on his part.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Taking into account all these factors, I find that the appropriate amount of aggravated damages in this case to be the amount of $15,000. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion       </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96   For the reasons set out above, I allow the appeal in part.
