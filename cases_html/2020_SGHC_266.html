While the Prosecution and the Defence agree that this is a relevant factor, the areas of disagreement are (a) whether the victim can be considered vulnerable by virtue of having been asleep when the accused first inserted his finger into her vagina; and (b) the implications of the victim being just above the threshold age set out in s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. I shall address these two points in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The accused took advantage of the victim when she was asleep. When the accused first inserted his finger into the victim’s vagina, she felt pain and was awoken. She opened her eyes and saw the accused. The accused also noticed she had been awoken as he saw her opening her eyes. This did not stop him and he continued inserting his finger into her vagina, molested and fondled her breasts and kissed her lips. The victim was too shocked and afraid to respond or resist the accused’s perverse sexual advances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I turn now to the implications of the victim’s age.

It is clear that Thean J was assessing the victim’s vulnerability relative to the class of victims falling within the scope of ss 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span>376(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>below 14 years of age). However, that is not the appropriate comparison in this case. As the victim in this case does not fall within ss 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span>376(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, the court should have regard to<span class="font-italic"> </span>the <span class="font-italic">entire class</span> of “young victims”. On that basis, given that she was only 14 years old at the time of the offence, the victim in this case falls on the more vulnerable side of the spectrum. The accused should consider himself fortunate that the victim was just over 14 years old. If these offences had been committed a few months earlier when the victim was below 14 years old the accused would have faced the more severe statutorily prescribed punishment of a minimum of eight years’ imprisonment and a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment with mandatory caning of not less than 12 strokes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Psychological harm caused to victim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, I turn to the psychological harm caused to the victim, which the Prosecution contends is another relevant offence-specific factor. Victims of such crime will sustain some kind of psychological harm. It varies from victim to victim and this also depends on the aggravating features of each case. As Dedar Singh Gill J observed in <span class="font-italic">BMU</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([15] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39], the “deleterious effects of the offence on the victim had already been built into the serious nature of the offence and the criminal sanctions that follow”. Therefore, in order for this factor to apply, the harm must be to an extent that is “beyond that that is usually associated with the offences in question” (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BQW </span>[2018] SGHC 136 at [43]), otherwise, this would be “giving that harm double weight” (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BMR </span>[2019] 3 SLR 270 at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In this case, it is evident that the accused’s criminal acts have resulted in substantial harm to the victim, not just in those several long minutes during which the offence was committed, but also in the aftermath of the incident. The victim has experienced emotional turmoil, nightmares, deterioration in familial relationships and loss of motivation.

</div> She has had to suffer for the accused’s actions, and the severe consequences that the accused’s acts have had (and continue to have) on her cannot be understated. However, as appalling as these consequences are, they do not rise above that associated with the offence of sexual assault by penetration. As such, I do not consider such harm an applicable offence-specific factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TIC charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I turn now to the presence of the TIC Charge, which I consider to be an aggravating factor. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> ([15] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [64(a)], while “a court is not bound to increase a sentence merely because there are TIC offences, it will normally do so where the TIC offences are of a similar nature”. In this case, the TIC Charge is not only similar to the Charge, it is for the exact same offence as the Charge. In other words, the accused <span class="font-italic">repeated</span> his offence some three weeks after the first incident. The victim was forced to undergo the same traumatic experience. In my view, this warrants an uplift in the accused’s sentence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indicative starting sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">BPH</span> ([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal similarly identified the twin offence-specific factors of abuse of trust and vulnerability. Based on this, the Court of Appeal at [69] concluded that the case “fell at least in the middle of Band 2”. Given the presence of the same two factors in this case and the TIC Charge, I find that an appropriate starting point is 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane, which is in the middle of Band 2. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mitigating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Accused’s plea of guilt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I shall now deal with the mitigating factors. The Prosecution acknowledges that the accused’s timeous plea of guilt has mitigating effect.

</div> The rationale underlying such mitigating effect is three-fold: (a) the plea of guilt can be a subjective expression of genuine remorse and contrition; (b) the plea of guilt spares the victim the ordeal of having to testify, thereby saving the victim the horror of having to re-live the incident; and (c) the plea of guilt saves the resources of the State which would otherwise have been expended if there was a trial (see <span class="font-italic">Regina v </span><span class="font-italic">Millberry </span>[2003] 1 WLR 546, cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>([15] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [66] and [71]). In this case, I find that an appropriate discount should be given for the fact that the accused entered a timeous plea of guilt. A generous discount would not be appropriate as the accused had committed very serious and heinous offences against his very young niece.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Accused is a first time offender</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As regards the accused’s clean record and lack of antecedents, this is not a mitigating factor but simply a neutral factor.

</div>
</div> Accordingly, I find that the accused’s sentence should be reduced by four weeks to take into account the time he spent in remand. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In summary, my findings on sentence are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Based on the offence-specific factors and the aggravating features in this case, an appropriate indicative starting sentence is 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane, which is in the middle of Band 2. My analysis of the offence-specific factors is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The accused abused his position of responsibility and breached the trust reposed in him. He stood in a quasi-parental position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the victim, and it was the accused’s relationship of responsibility and trust with the victim that gave him the opportunity and access to offend against the victim. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The victim was a young and vulnerable victim as she was only 14 years old at the time the offence was committed. The fact that the victim was just above the threshold age provided in ss 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span>376(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code shows that she was especially vulnerable relative to the general class of “young” victims. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) While the accused’s criminal acts have undoubtedly resulted in substantial and severe harm to the victim, such harm does not rise above that associated with the offence of sexual assault by penetration. That does not mean that the court has marginalised or downplayed the trauma suffered by the victim. Rather, it is the unfortunate reality that such level of trauma is often experienced by victims of sexual assault by penetration. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In view of the accused’s mitigating factors, particularly his timeous plea of guilt and his genuine remorse, balanced against the aggravating factors, the indicative starting sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane should be adjusted downwards to 11 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. The accused’s custodial sentence is to be further reduced by four weeks to take into account the time he spent in remand before he was released on bail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the reasons set out above, I sentence the accused to ten years and 11 months’ imprisonment, and eight strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The accused is a sole breadwinner with three young children. His long incarceration will undoubtedly cause undue hardship to members of his immediate family who are innocent of the crimes that he had committed but his family members have to suffer the collateral harm. I urge the Prosecution and the Singapore Prison Services to assist the accused’s family wherever possible while the accused is punished for his crimes. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gail Wong and Sheryl Yeo (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vigneesh s/o Nainar and Sadhana Devi d/o Daevnrd Rai (Law Society Pro Bono Services) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
