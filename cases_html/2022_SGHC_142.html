On the evidence before me, I was satisfied that Mr Kawana and Mr Lim – as the persons who had taken the photographs at the Hotel photo-shoots – were the authors of the Raw Images. I rejected the defendants’ argument in their closing submissions that Ms Lee should be regarded as “the sole author” of the Raw Images.

I should add that it was never pleaded – nor was any evidence given – that Wave had acted as the Hotels’ agent in engaging Mr Kawana’s photography services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The law is clear that where no direct contractual relationship exists between the alleged commissioning party and the person who takes the photographs, the former does not in such a situation acquire the copyright in the photographs under s 30(5) of the Copyright Act: <span class="font-italic">Wang Choong Li v Wong Wan Chin </span>[2015] 4 SLR 41 (“<span class="font-italic">Wang Choong Li</span>”) at [61] to [64]. Indeed, the position of the Hotels in this case may be likened to that of the respondent bride in <span class="font-italic">Wang Choong Li</span>, who contracted with the appellant bridal boutique owner for the provision of wedding services including photography services. The wedding day photographer was engaged by the appellant. The High Court noted that there was no documentation showing a direct contractual relationship between the respondent and the said photographer, nor any testimony to that effect. There was nothing in terms of instructions that the respondent would have been expected to give to the said photographer before the event as to the scope of the work required, terms of payment, or requirements as to the precise services or equipment that would be deployed. As the High Court noted, the respondent had engaged the appellant to provide photography; and this must mean that there was no intention for the respondent to enter into a contract with the photographer. The High Court added that finding that agency arose between the respondent and the appellant in respect of the dealing with the wedding day photographer was highly artificial: the court accepted the appellant’s submission that an agency was not in the contemplation of either the appellant or the respondent. The court held that in the absence of any evidence of an actual commission of the wedding day photographer by the respondent, copyright in the photographs taken by the photographer did not reside in the respondent for the purposes of s 30(5) of the Copyright Act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The observations which the High Court made of the respondent’s position in <span class="font-italic">Wang Choong Li</span> are apposite in the present case. Based on the evidence adduced, it was clearly Wave – and not the Hotels, or even the defendants acting on behalf of the Hotels – who had commissioned Mr Kawana to take the Raw Images at the Hotel photo-shoots. Applying s 30(5) of the Copyright Act, I was satisfied that Wave owned the copyright in the Raw Images taken by Mr Kawana.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I should add that documentation as between Mr Kawana and Wave supported the above finding.

In gist, my reasons were as follows. First, in order for s 30(5) of the Copyright Act to apply in the case of photographs, the party purporting to rely on it (the alleged commissioning party) must have made an agreement for valuable consideration with the photographer “for the taking of a photograph”. In the present case, having examined the evidence, I agreed with the plaintiffs that the agreement between Wave and the Hotels was not an agreement for the taking of photographs”. Rather, it was an agreement for Wave to operate as a “one-stop shop” for the Hotels, providing branding, design and marketing services of which photography constituted but one supporting function.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Second, even assuming the agreement between Wave and the Hotels was an agreement for the taking of photographs, I was satisfied that the operation of s 30(5) had been excluded by agreement between the parties, <span class="font-italic">per</span> s 30(3). In gist, I found that the Hotels had accepted Wave’s reservation of copyright in the Final Photographs by accepting the Reservation Clause in Wave’s Production Estimates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I now elaborate on my findings in respect of these two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The agreement between Wave and the Hotels was not an agreement for the taking of photographs</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Wave’s role as a “one-stop shop”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, insofar as the agreement for Wave’s services was concerned, Mr Ohletz’s evidence in his US deposition was that Wave’s client was the Hotel, and that the general manager of the relevant hotel would usually sign off on Wave’s Production Estimate for a job.

</div> However, he was unable to put forward any evidence of the Final Photographs having been used by any vendor other than Wave to create marketing and promotional materials for the Hotels.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For the reasons set out above, I found that the agreement between Wave and the Hotels was not an agreement for the taking of photographs within the meaning of s 30(5) of the Copyright Act. Instead, it was an agreement for Wave to provide the Hotels with a “one-stop solution” to their branding, design and marketing needs; and as Mr Ohletz himself put it, photography was one component of this “one-stop solution”, but photography was not what Wave was hired to do. In the circumstances, s 30(5) did not apply so as to vest in the Hotels the copyright in the Final Photographs; the copyright remained with Wave.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The plaintiffs’ alternative argument that the Final Photographs did not constitute “photographs” within the definition in s 7 Copyright Act</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiffs also argued in the alternative that s 30(5) had no application in this case because the Final Photographs did not constitute “photographs” within the definition given by s 7 of the Copyright Act.  According to the plaintiffs, the Final Photographs – having been created as a result of extensive editing and manipulation of the Raw Images – could no longer be regarded as “photographs” insofar as a photograph was understood to involve the “capturing or recording of light on a particular medium”. The plaintiffs cited, as the basis of this argument, the Court of Appeal (“CA”)’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Singsung Pte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (t/a L S Electrical Trading) </span>[2016] 4 SLR 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Singsung</span>”). I should point out, however, that the CA made it clear in its judgment that its views on the definition of a “photograph” were “provisional” and remained “open for further consideration and analysis in an appropriate case” (at [106] of <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span>). In any event, given the findings I made in respect of the agreement between Wave and the Hotels, I did not find it necessary to make any ruling on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Hotels had accepted Wave’s reservation of copyright in the Hotel Photographs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Further and in any event, even assuming the agreement between Wave and the Hotels was an agreement for the taking of photographs, I found that the operation of s 30(5) had been excluded by agreement between the parties <span class="font-italic">per</span> s 30(3) of the Copyright Act, because the Hotels had accepted Wave’s reservation of copyright in the Final Photographs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The provision of Production Estimates</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As alluded to earlier (at [14]), Ms Lee’s evidence was that from “the very beginning when Wave began working with GHM, from 1995 onwards”, Wave would provide a Production Estimate to the Hotel and to GHM in respect of each job. The provision of such Production Estimates formed part of Wave’s standard procedure; and the only occasions when they were not provided to a client before commencement of work were “either ad-hoc jobs that Wave was asked to carry out at the last minute, or for re-prints of stationery where the price of printing had already been previously provided to the GHM Entities under/or the Hotels and had remained unchanged”.

</div> Although in his AEIC Mr Meier claimed that there were occasions when Wave issued invoices first and only got the Hotels to sign the Production Estimates later, he admitted in cross-examination that he had no personal knowledge of the evidence which he had cited in his AEIC (exhibit HJM-4) to support this claim. According to Mr Meier, he was not involved in dealing with the documents in HJM-4: they were provided to him by the “legal team” for the purposes of his AEIC; and he could not even recall if he had ever seen these documents before the preparation of his AEIC.

</div> The dates of the Production Estimates in exhibit HJM-4 – which related to Hotel photo-shoots at the Chedi Chiang Mai and the Lalu – showed that these Production Estimates were issued <span class="font-italic">before</span> the relevant Hotel photo-shoot. Thus, insofar as Production Estimates were exhibited in HJM-4, they actually refuted Mr Meier’s claim about such estimates having been issued by Wave much later and only after invoices had been sent. The Production Estimates in respect of the first Hotel photo-shoot for the Chedi Chiang Mai was dated 23 June 2004 and stated clearly that it was for a photo-shoot scheduled for “end of August / beginning of September”. This was followed by an invoice dated 10 August 2004. As for the Production Estimate for the second photo-shoot for the Chedi Chiang Mai, this was dated 16 February 2006 and stated clearly that it was for a photo-shoot scheduled for “beginning June 2006”. This was followed by an invoice dated 25 September 2006.

During cross-examination, Ms Fraser was obliged to concede that exhibit AF-3 appeared to show that the Production Estimate was issued by Wave first, before the issuance of the purchase order by the Hotel. She also conceded that leaving aside exhibit AF-3, she could not produce any other evidence to show that Wave had issued Production Estimates only after the work of the Hotel photo-shoots was done.

</div> If the terms were amended as a result of such negotiations, Wave would issue fresh Production Estimates to reflect the amended terms; and once the negotiations were complete, the Hotels would accept the Production Estimate by signing it, by instructing Wave to proceed with the work, or by issuing a purchase order on the terms of the Production Estimate. Ms Lee’s evidence in this respect was not seriously disputed by the defendants.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In sum, therefore, the Production Estimates for the Hotel photo-shoots would have been issued for the very purpose of obtaining the Hotels’ agreement to the terms contained therein; and there would often have been negotiations between Wave and the management of the Hotel on these terms before the Hotel’s eventual acceptance of a Production Estimate for a particular job. In the circumstances, there appeared to be no basis for the defendants’ allegation that the Reservation Clause in these Production Estimates must have been “unilaterally inserted” by Ms Lee without Mr Ohletz’s attention (and presumably, that of the Hotels’ management) being drawn to the clause. Indeed, I found it telling that the defendants were unable to articulate with any coherence the further steps that should have been by Ms Lee to bring the Reservation Clause to GHM’s and the Hotels’ attention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The defendants’ contention that the Reservation Clause was not brought to their attention  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 During cross-examination, Mr Ohletz was asked about Production Estimates on which he had put his signature.

</div> given that Wave worked with the Hotels and GHM for a not inconsiderable period of 13 years, it was reasonable to expect that if the Hotels wanted to have the copyright in the Final Photographs, they would have raised this “when negotiating the terms in the Production Estimate – or at the very least, at some point in the course of the 13 years”. Yet there was no evidence at all of the Hotels having brought up any objections to the Reservation Clause.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I would also add that it did not appear to me the Hotels would have found Wave’s reservation of copyright in the Final Photographs to be commercially “unworkable” or “impossible”. As noted above (at [56]), GHM – in developing and managing the Hotels – aimed to achieve a consistent “look and feel” among all the hotels and resorts under their management; and it was with a view to achieving this consistency that the Hotels contracted with Wave for a “one-stop solution” to their branding, design and marketing needs. Photography was only one of the supporting services in the suite of services provided to the Hotels; and in line with the concept of a “one-stop solution” that would ensure a consistent “look and feel” across the various Hotels, the Final Photographs were created <span class="font-italic">by Wave</span> only for use in the marketing and promotional materials produced <span class="font-italic">by Wave</span>. Save for an incident involving the Andaman (which I will deal with later and which was characterised as an instance of unauthorised use of the Final Photographs), there was no evidence that during the tenure of Wave’s working relationship with the Hotels and GHM, third-party vendors were brought in to produce marketing and promotional materials using the Final Photographs. Given the context in which Wave and the Hotels were operating, therefore, there was nothing at all “unworkable” about Wave’s reservation of the copyright in the Final Photographs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Apart from Mr Ohletz, Mr Meier also gave evidence that he had not noticed the Reservation Clause in the Production Estimates provided by Wave.

</div> Although Mr Meier stated that he was unable to say whether these various persons who reviewed the Production Estimates would have noticed the Reservation Clause, it appeared to me highly improbable that a single-sentence clause in plain sight would have escaped the notice of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the various hotel staff who reviewed the Production Estimates over the 13-year period that Wave did work for the Hotels. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Further and in any event, even if all the personnel from the Hotels and from GHM failed to read the Reservation Clause throughout the 13 years of their interaction with Wave, the law is clear that failure by a contracting party to read or to understand a term of a contract will not preclude such a party from being bound by the term. In <span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another </span>[2019] 2 SLR 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko</span>”), the appellant was the sub-contractor in a construction project who had signed a contract with the Contractor (the respondent). The appellant sought to restrain the respondent from calling on a banker’s guarantee it had provided. One of the issues for determination on appeal was whether the appellant was precluded from relying on the ground of unconscionability by an exclusion clause in the Particular Conditions of Subcontract. The same exclusion clause also appeared in the Particular Conditions of Main Contract. The appellant argued that this exclusion clause could not have been incorporated into the Subcontract because it was not given a copy of either the Particular Conditions of Subcontract or the Particular Conditions of Main Contract at the time of contracting. In rejecting this argument, the CA held (at [58]) that it was “a well-established principle that in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, a party is bound by all the terms of a contract that it signs, even if that party did not read or understand those terms”. Thus, for example, if a term in a signed contract incorporated some or all the terms of a separate document by making reference to those terms, the parties to the contract would be bound by those separate terms even if they had no knowledge of what those terms were at the time of contracting; and this principle would hold true even if the terms of the separate document sought to be incorporated contained exclusion clauses like in <span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko</span> ([59] of the CA’s judgment).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) The Hotels’ acceptance of the Reservation Clause</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In the present case, the Reservation Clause appeared in the same document which contained other terms on which Wave and the Hotels contracted (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>price and scope of work).

</div> The Setai Club was not managed by GHM: it was a separate entity from the Setai Miami which GHM did manage. Sometime in June 2006, it was discovered that The Setai Club had reproduced on its website Hotel Photographs taken at The Setai Miami and at other Hotels. On 23 June 2006, Mr Jenni emailed Mr Kendall Oei – the GHM Director then overseeing legal affairs – to ask for the latter’s advice (“do we sue?”).  Mr Oei subsequently emailed Ms Lee on 26 June 2006 at 10.24 am to ask her for “any documents to show that Wave / GHM own the photo”. After receiving from Ms Lee copies of Wave’s 2005 contract with Irieeyes and Wave’s Production Estimate, Mr Oei sent her the following email at 2.36 pm on 26 June 2006:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Many thanks for sending copies of the photos on the Setai Club website as well as copies of your agreement with the photographers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Waves supported by GHM may have to file an IP violation suit against the Setai Club</span>.

His initial request to Ms Lee was for documents which would show that “Wave / GHM own the photos” – but tellingly, after receiving from Ms Lee the copies of Wave’s agreement with Irieeyes and Wave’s Production Estimate, he told Ms Lee in no uncertain terms that it was Wave who would be able to sue The Setai Club for IP violation (albeit with GHM’s support) – and that it was Wave who would receive the monetary compensation arising from any such suit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I add that although Mr Ohletz alleged in cross-examination that Mr Oei “wouldn’t know” whether the Hotels owned the copyright in the photographs, he could not provide any basis for this allegation, apart from making the irrelevant observation that Mr Oei “was not living in Singapore” and that he (Mr Ohletz) was supposed to be “the main contact for [Ms Lee]”.

According to Ms Lee, Mr Oei informed her that “The Andaman’s conduct was unacceptable, as the Hotel had infringed the copyright in the Hotel Photographs owed by Wave”; and he assured her he would speak to The Andaman on her behalf.

</div> Ms Lee’s account of events struck me as being honest: she maintained her account of events under cross-examination and made no attempt to embellish it. I accepted her assertion that the incident involving The Andaman had taken place as she described.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Like the incidents involving The Setai Club and The Lalu, this incident involving The Andaman demonstrated that GHM’s senior management had acknowledged Wave as the owner of the copyright in the Hotel Photographs. Mr Oei’s actions in all three incidents were wholly contrary to the defendants’ case that the Hotels owned the copyright. I should also point out that in the incidents involving The Setai Club and The Lalu, Mr Oei’s statements to Ms Lee were documented in the emails sent. The authenticity of these emails was never challenged; and Mr Oei’s statements therein were clear and unambiguous. If the defendants wanted to suggest that Mr Oei “wouldn’t know” what he was talking about or that he meant something very different from what he actually said, it was up to the defendants to summon him as a witness and to put their suggestions to him. They elected not to do so and thus had no basis at all for these suggestions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (a)(1): Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Having regard to my findings at [53] to [91], I was satisfied that the plaintiffs had established that Wave owned the copyright in the Raw Images and the Final Photographs (collectively, the Hotel Photographs) at the time of their creation. As to which Wave entity – Wave-S, Wave PL or Wave Studio Singapore – would have owned the copyright to the Hotel Photographs produced in each of the numerous Hotel photo-shoots conducted by Wave over the years, the list is set out in the table at Annex F to the plaintiffs’ closing submissions. The defendants have not challenged the accuracy of this list. In gist, Wave-S owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs created in the 13 Hotel photo-shoots it carried out in the period between 13 December 2000 and 23 December 2004; Wave PL owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs created in the 5 Hotel photo-shoots it carried out between 24 February 2005 and 1 June 2005; and Wave Studio Singapore owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs created in the 11 Hotel photo-shoots it carried out between 14 August 2005 and 24 October 2007.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue (a)(2): On whom the present owner of the copyright in the Hotel Photographs is for the purposes of this suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiffs submitted that the third plaintiff, Wave Studio US, was the present owner of the copyright in the Hotel Photographs by dint of a series of copyright assignments over the years. Having reviewed the documentary evidence adduced, I accepted the plaintiffs’ submission.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Under s 194(3) of the Copyright Act, an assignment of copyright must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the assignor. It was not disputed that the assignments relied on by the plaintiffs met this requirement. It was also not disputed that an assignment of copyright would not necessarily assign the right to sue in respect of past infringements of the copyright (George Wei, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore</span> (SNP Editions, 2nd Ed, 2000) at para 12.5). In the absence of an express assignment of accrued causes of action, the court would go through an exercise in construction to determine whether the parties to the copyright assignment had intended to assign the right to sue for past infringements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 First, in respect of Wave-S’ copyright, I found that this had been assigned to the third plaintiff as follows. Wave-S was a sole proprietorship; and it was not disputed that legally, there would have been no distinction between Wave-S’ assets and Ms Lee’s personal property. On 21 February 2007, Ms Lee filed a Notice of Cessation of Business for Wave-S.

This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract.  If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In respect of (b) and (c), the CA noted that the business efficacy test and the officious bystander test were “used in conjunction” and “complementarily remain the prevailing approach for the implication of terms under Singapore law”. The CA also alluded to a number of cases in which it had been held that “in addition to business efficacy and obviousness, the implied term must be reasonable and equitable, capable of clear expression; and not contradict any express term of the contract”. In the view of the CA, these additional requirements simply restated “the basic overriding principle that a term is not to be implied into a contract lightly” (at [98]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applying the principles to the facts of this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Applying the above principles to the present case, I should point again to my finding that the Reservation Clause reserving copyright in the Hotel Photographs to Wave had been accepted by the Hotels and incorporated into the agreement between them and Wave. In other words, the reservation of copyright by Wave was an express term of the agreement between the Hotels and Wave. To imply a term into the agreement whereby the copyright in the photographs was assigned to the Hotels would be directly to contradict this express reservation of copyright by Wave. To borrow the words of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>: such a term would “necessarily fail the officious bystander test”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Second, as the plaintiffs pointed out, even assuming for the sake of argument that the Reservation Clause had not been incorporated into the agreement between the Hotels and Wave, the fact remained that Wave had included the clause in the Production Estimates issued for the Hotel photo-shoots. This meant that at the time of contracting, Wave had no intention to assign the ownership of the copyright in the Hotels. In other words, the proposed implied term would also fail the business efficacy test: had this proposed implied term been put to both parties at the time of contracting, at least one party would <span class="font-italic">not </span>have responded. “Oh, of course”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Much of the defendants’ case on the “necessity” for an implied term assigning the copyright in the Hotel Photographs to the Hotels appeared to be premised on the argument that it would “not be possible operationally” to seek Ms Lee’s (or more accurately, Wave’s) consent “each and every time GHM Hotels use her photographs”.

</div> I did not find this argument persuasive. As I pointed out earlier, Mr Ohletz himself repeatedly stressed that it was GHM’s objective – in developing and managing the Hotels – to achieve a consistent “look and feel” among all the Hotels; and it was with a view to achieving this consistency that the Hotels contracted with Wave for a “one-stop solution” to their branding, design and marketing needs. Mr Ohletz went so far as to state that “many times” GHM would recommend that all GHM Hotels use Wave’s services “even at the opposition of owners due to cost considerations”.

Save for the incident involving the Andaman, there was no evidence that during the tenure of Wave’s working relationship with the Hotels, third-party vendors were brought in by the Hotels to work on marketing and promotional materials using the Hotel Photographs.  In fact, it would not have made sense for them to do so since it would not have been efficient for the Hotels and/or GHM to liaise with and instruct multiple service providers for marketing collaterals – whereas with “more than 10 years’ experience of working with GHM”, Ms Lee was very familiar with GHM’s vision for how the “promotional/marketing collaterals” should be “styled”:

</div> and that was how they ran their case at trial. The general rule is that parties are bound by their pleadings, and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties have not put into issue (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span>at [38]). The defendants failed to show the existence of any circumstances in this case which would justify departing from this general rule. Indeed, a proposition that the second defendant owned the copyright in the Final Photographs by virtue of an “implied assignment” from the plaintiffs would be so fundamental and important to the defendants’ case that there should be no reason to omit pleading it in the defence. This omission was fatal to any attempt to rely on a purported defence of an “implied assignment” of copyright. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Further, and in any event, it was equally plain from the defendants’ pleadings that they never pleaded the existence of an express contract between the second defendant on the one hand and Ms Lee and/or Wave on the other.  Instead, their closing submissions on this belated claim of an “implied assignment” appeared to proceed on the basis that the court should “imply” an assignment of copyright if it could be shown that such an assignment was “necessary in the circumstances”; and that such an assignment was necessary in the present case for various reasons (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to allow the second defendant to implement a uniform “branding concept” for all the Hotels managed by GHM).

</div> However, the only way in which an implied assignment of copyright could arise would be if there were an express contract in the first place between the second defendant on the one hand and Ms Lee and/or the Wave entities on the other: in such a scenario, the second defendant would then have to make out a case for implying a term whereby copyright was assigned from the rightful owner (whether Ms Lee or one or more of the Wave entities) to it. It would not be possible to have an implied term in the absence of an express contract (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Higgins Danial Patrick v Mulacek, Philippe Emanual</span> [2016] 5 SLR 848 at [51]).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I have earlier set out at [105] to [106] the three-step process established by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>for considering the implication of terms in a contract. In addition, the plaintiffs cited the judgment of Lightman J in <span class="font-italic">Robin Ray v Classic FM Plc </span>[1988] ECC 488 (“<span class="font-italic">Robin Ray</span>”), which I found helpful.  In <span class="font-italic">Robin Ray</span>, the plaintiff was a writer and broadcaster on classical music while the defendant was a radio station. The action concerned the parties’ intellectual property rights in certain documents containing proposals for how the tracks on the defendant’s music recordings should be categorized and cataloguing over 50,000 items of classical music compiled by the plaintiff over five years. These documents were prepared while the plaintiff was engaged to the defendant under a consultancy agreement; and the defendant then compiled a database in which the contents of the other documents were substantially reproduced. Differences arose between the plaintiff and the defendant over the latter’s right to exploit the database by making copies and granting licences to foreign radio stations to use those copies. It was not disputed that the defendant was entitled to copyright in the database and that the defendant was entitled to use and make copies of the database for the purpose of broadcasting from its own radio station in the UK. What was disputed was whether the defendant had any additional rights.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In considering what terms if any were to be implied, Lightman J approached the question by pointing out firstly (at [45]) that the general principles governing the respective rights of the contractor and the client in the copyright in a work commissioned by the client were as follows. First, the contractor “is entitled to retain the copyright in default of some express or implied term to the contrary effect”. Where Parliament intended the act of commissioning alone to vest copyright in the client, “the legislation expressly so provides” – but in all other cases, the client “has to establish the entitlement under some express or implied term of the contract”. Referencing the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Liverpool City Council v Irwin</span> [1977] AC 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Liverpool</span>”), Lightman J noted that for a term to be implied, it must be reasonable and equitable; it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; it must be so obvious that it “goes without saying”; it must be capable of clear expression; and it must not contradict any express term of the contract. He then went on to hold as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(W)here (as in the present case) it is necessary to imply the grant of some right to fill a lacuna in the contract and the question arises how this lacuna is to be filled, guidance is again to be found in Liverpool.  The principle is clearly stated that in deciding which of various alternatives should constitute the contents of the term to be implied, the choice must be that which does not exceed what is necessary in the circumstances.  In short a minimalist approach is called for.  An implication may only be made if this is necessary, and then only of what is necessary and no more.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A)ccordingly if it is necessary to imply some grant of rights in respect of a copyright work, and the need could be satisfied by the grant of a licence or an assignment of the copyright, the implication will be of the grant of a licence only…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If necessity requires only the grant of a licence, the ambit of the licence must be the minimum which is required to secure to the Client the entitlement which the parties to the contract must have intended to confer upon him.  The amount of the purchase price which the Client under the contract has obliged himself to pay may be relevant to the ambit of the licence.  Thus in <span class="font-italic">Stovin-Bradford v Volpoint Properties Ltd</span>, where the Client agreed to pay only a nominal fee to his architect for the preparation of plans, he was held to have a licence to use the plans for no purpose beyond the anticipated application for planning permission.  By contrast in <span class="font-italic">Blair v Osborne &amp; Tompkin,</span> where the client was charged the full RIBA scale, his licence was held to extend to using the plans for the building itself.  Guidance as to the approach to be adopted is provided in a passage in the judgment of Jacobs J in <span class="font-italic">Beck v Montana Construction Pty Ltd</span>, cited with approval by Widgery LJ in <span class="font-italic">Blair v Osborne &amp; Tompkin</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to me that the principle involved is this; that the engagement for reward of a person to produce material of a nature which is capable of being the subject of copyright implies a permission or consent, or licence in the person giving the engagement to use the material in the manner and for the purpose in which and for which it was contemplated between the parties that it would be used at the time of the engagement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(T)he licence accordingly is to be limited to what is in the joint contemplation of the parties at the date of the contract, and does not exist to enable the Client to take advantage of a new and unexpected profitable opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In giving judgment for the plaintiff, Lightman J found (at [29]) that while the plaintiff was not a joint author of the database, the defendant was not a joint author of the documents in question; and there was no question of the plaintiff’s copyright having been subsumed in the copyright in the database (at [35]). As such, when the defendant copied the documents and sold them abroad without the plaintiff’s consent, it had breached his copyright. The contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant was that of independent contractors, and not employer-employee (at [37]). The defendant was “buying” the plaintiff’s “distinctive help and expertise” in getting its UK national station’s playlist “up and running”; and the consultancy agreement contemplated, as at the date of contracting, that the plaintiff’s work would be used to enable the defendant to broadcast in the UK. It followed that the only necessary implication was the grant of a licence to the defendant to use the copyright material for the indefinite future for this purpose and for this purpose only (at [48]–[50]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applying the principles to the facts of this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In considering the defendants’ submissions regarding the grant of an implied licence to the Hotel owners and/or the second defendant, I bore in mind my earlier finding regarding the absence of any express contract between Wave and the defendants (above at [113]). Insofar as the defendants were arguing for the implication of a contractual term giving the second defendant a licence to use the Hotel photographs, any such implication could only be in the context of the contract between Wave and the Hotels.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Applying the principles established in <span class="font-italic">Sem</span><span class="font-italic">bcorp Marine</span> and <span class="font-italic">Robin Ray </span>to the present case, I found no basis for implying that the Hotel owners and/or the second defendant had a “perpetual and unrestricted” implied licence from Wave to use the Hotel Photographs for general branding, marketing and/or advertising purposes.

It will be noted that the defendants’ case, as put to Ms Lee, suggested that the amount of consideration paid by the Hotels was such that the parties must have jointly contemplated it would include the price of a “perpetual and unrestricted” licence for the Hotels to use the photographs for whatever marketing collateral they wanted from whichever vendor they chose.

For one, it was wrong of Ms Chng to give the impression that Memphis West had charged The Legian Bali US$10,000 for exactly the same things that Wave had charged S$54,600 for. It was clear from Wave’s Production Estimate that the amount of S$54,600 not only included items related to the photo-shoot but also items such as airfare, excess baggage and travel insurance – whereas Memphis West’s quotation of US$10,000 was stated to be for “5 days’ photography”, with items such as airfare, excess baggage, travel insurance, accommodation and meals to be borne separately by the Hotel. More fundamentally, evidence of what another vendor chose to charge a Hotel some 5 years after Wave ceased contracting with the Hotels could not be evidence of what Wave and the Hotels must have contemplated at the time of Wave’s engagement. I agreed with the plaintiffs that only the evidence of the contracting parties’ intentions at the time of contracting would be relevant to determining whether a term should be implied.

Having regard, however, to the evidence of how the  CD-ROMs came to be provided, this suggestion did not appear to me to be borne out. First, Ms Lee’s evidence was that the provision of the CD-ROMs to the Hotels and GHM served a two-fold purpose: as “proof of the work done during the photoshoots”; and “as a catalogue of the photographs generated during a particular project by Wave, from which the Hotels and/or GHM could review the Hotel Photographs and select the photographs that they wanted to feature or incorporate into the design of the marketing collaterals”.

</div> The eventual selection of which photographs to use in the Hotels’ marketing collaterals would then be done by Mr Ohletz. It was only in February 2004 – at the Hotel photo-shoot at The Leela Goa – that Wave started the practice of forwarding the photographs in CD-ROMs instead of on contact sheets.

</div> The defendants did not dispute the above process. In other words, the use of CD-ROMs was something that only came about much later. This undisputed evidence thus supported the plaintiffs’ submission that the provision of photographs in CD-ROMs was a continuation of Wave’s established practice of providing the Hotel Photographs to the Hotels and GHM for them to select photographs for use in the marketing collaterals. The provision of the CD-ROMs did not in any way demonstrate that the Hotels and/or the defendants were allowed to use the photographs without seeking Wave’s consent. In this connection, it should be reiterated that apart from the incident involving The Andaman (which according to Ms Lee was characterised by Mr Oei as an instance of unauthorised reproduction of Wave’s copyrighted photographs – see [89] above), there was no evidence that in the course of their working relationship with Wave, the Hotels had regularly – or even occasionally – engaged third-party vendors to produce marketing collaterals using the Hotel Photographs created by Wave.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It should also be reiterated that according to Ms Lee, it was the Andaman incident that led to Mr Oei advising her to “print a copyright notice” on the inner ring of the CD-ROMs “to make it clear that Wave owned the copyright in the works on the CD”; and this was what she did from September 2006 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In the defendants’ cross-examination of Ms Lee, much was made out of the fact that she appeared to believe that CD-ROMs in “read-only” format were incapable of having their contents copied by users.

</div> While Ms Lee might have been mistaken in her belief, what was significant about her testimony was that it showed clearly the absence of any intention on her part to allow the Hotels and/or the defendants to copy or otherwise to use the photographs in the CD-ROMs without her consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In relation to the CD-ROMs of the Hotel Photographs, the defendants also brought up in their closing submissions an incident involving the production by Wave of 1000 CD-ROMs for The Chedi Muscat. The second defendant had requested Wave to produce these 1000 CD-ROMs in August 2005, apparently for the purpose of marketing the Hotel. The defendants claimed that Wave did not try to charge a licence fee for the use of the photographs in the preparation of the CD-ROMs and that this meant therefore that the second defendant had “unrestricted rights to use the Final Photographs for marketing, branding, promotion and advertising”.

Despite the Hotel and GHM having already received CD-ROMs of the Final Photographs from the Hotel photo-shoots, they still went back to Wave when they wanted further marketing collaterals in the form of the 1000 CD-ROMs; and it was Wave that designed the CDs and prepared the 1000 CD-ROMs pursuant to their Production Estimate.

</div> The defendants submitted that Wave had not done so and that this militated against Wave’s claim of copyright ownership in the photographs. Again, I found no merit in the defendants’ submission. From the evidence, Wave had made their reservation of copyright clear beyond doubt by the inclusion of the Reservation Clause in the Production Estimates and of the copyright notice on the inner ring of the CD-ROMs. As such, even assuming for the sake of argument that Wave had omitted to request the return of the CD-ROMs after they stopped working with the Hotels and GHM, I did not think this necessarily meant that they must not have owned the copyright in the photographs to begin with. I stress that I say “<span class="font-italic">even assuming for the sake of </span>argument” because in truth, the defendants had no grounds whatsoever to make the above submission. For one, Wave’s alleged failure to request the return of all CD-ROMs containing the Hotel Photographs after they stopped working with the Hotels should have been pleaded by the second defendant, since it constituted a material fact on the basis of which the latter disputed the plaintiffs’ copyright ownership in the photographs: Order 18 rule 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). Having failed to plead this material fact, the defendants also failed to adduce any evidence from any witness to substantiate the allegations of Wave’s purported omission and/or the purported reasons for it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Quite apart from having no evidence to substantiate their allegations about Wave’s alleged omission to request the return of the CD-ROMs and the reasons, these allegations were not put to Ms Lee in cross-examination, despite her having stated repeatedly her position on Wave’s ownership of the copyright in the Hotel Photographs and the purposes for which the CD-ROMs of these photographs were provided to the Hotels. As the plaintiffs pointed out, this was a clear violation of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>[1893] 6 R 67, which requires that any matter on which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief of a witness must generally be put to her so that she has an opportunity to explain the contradiction.

Instead, I accepted Ms Lee’s evidence that these CD-ROMs were provided for two reasons: first, as proof of Wave’s work in the Hotel photoshoots; and second, as a catalogue of the photographs from these photo-shoots, from which the Hotels and/or GHM could select photographs for use in marketing collaterals to be produced by Wave.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) “Interior Design”, “American Airlines” and “Conde Nast Traveler” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Aside from the CD-ROMs, the defendants also contended that Ms Lee had on several occasions allowed the Hotels and GHM to use the Hotel Photographs without charging any licence fee.

</div> as a “case that could be give [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] some guidance” on the subject of implied licences, they failed to explain exactly why this case was relevant – especially since <span class="font-italic">Gabrin</span> did not actually involve an implied licence.  The case involved <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>photographs taken in 1997; and one of the issues the court had to determine was whether the photographer (Mr Gabrin) retained copyright or whether the company which had commissioned the photographs (Stiff Records) had acquired copyright, and if so, in which photographs. On this issue, Patten J held that having heard the evidence, he was satisfied that it had been agreed between Stiff Records and Mr Gabrin that the latter would retain the copyright in any photographs he took which were not purchased by Stiff Records for use on a record sleeve. Patten J noted that “It [was] accepted that additional payments were made for record sleeves, and that such payments carried with them either the copyright or very extensive rights to use, and licence the use of, the photographs in connection with the recordings”. In contrast, the evidence showed that “(f)or everything ese, a restricted licence to use the shots for publicity or advertising purposes sufficed, and the £50 fee [paid by Stiff Records] meant that they obtained the right to use these photographs comparatively cheaply”: Stiff Records clearly understood that this “relatively small fee” was “not intended to pass the copyright in such photographs”; and they “were not prepared to pay for that” (at [23], [25]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The defendants were at pains to emphasise that in <span class="font-italic">Gabrin</span>, although the court had found that “parties did not contemplate that the payment made to the photographer would cover a licence to use the photographs for all purposes”, the “key point” was that “there were express terms for additional usage”.

The defendants did not dispute the reproduction of the 242 photographs in “The Magazine”. As seen earlier (at [22] to [25] above), they ran the case that the copyright in these photographs belonged to the Hotels or the second defendant, not the plaintiffs; alternatively, that the Hotels and/or the second defendant had an implied licence to use the Hotel Photographs as they wished for their general marketing purposes. Since the allegedly infringing acts were not disputed and since I had rejected the defendants’ case on copyright ownership and implied licence, it followed that infringement of the plaintiffs’ copyright was made out.  In this connection, I noted that the first defendant pleaded in its defence that it performed “different functions” from the second defendant within the GHM group; that it was not involved with the services provided by Wave to the Hotels; and that it had nothing to do with publishing “The Magazine” and/or with the content of the GHM websites.

</div> This was not challenged by the defendants during Ms Lee’s cross-examination. Instead, as mentioned earlier, the defendants’ case at trial focused on the issues of whom owned the copyright in the photographs; and alternatively, whether the Hotels and/or the second defendant had an implied licence to use them. Again, since the allegedly infringing acts were not disputed and since I had rejected the defendants’ case on copyright ownership and implied licence, I was satisfied that infringement of the plaintiffs’ copyright was made out.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In respect of (c), it was not disputed by the defendants that “The Magazine” was printed in Switzerland and copies would then be distributed to the Hotels which the second defendant managed.

Ms Lee gave evidence that this was an address from which both the first and the second defendants operated;

If the second defendant had in fact been the producer as well, there was no need to refer to it by a different appellation within the same “Imprint”: indeed, it made no sense to do so.

It was not disputed that Mr Ohletz, Ms Fraser, and Mr Meier were all not involved in the publication of “The Magazine”, whereas Ms Chng only joined GHM after the publication of the first three issues.

Yet, just a month later on 21 July 2021, the defendants suddenly indicated at a pre-trial conference before the Senior Assistant Registrar that Mr Jenni might no longer be giving evidence; and this was confirmed via letter from defence counsel on 30 July 2021 – just four days before AEICs were due to be filed.

</div> My reasons were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Laches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The doctrine of laches is “properly invoked where essentially there has been a substantial lapse of time coupled with circumstances where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver thereof; or where by his conduct and neglect he had, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable  to place him, if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted”: per the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cytec Indu</span><span class="font-italic">stries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Cytec</span>”, at [46]), which judgment was cited with approval by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>”, at [44]). The inquiry is a “broad-based” one and “it would be relevant to consider the length of delay before the claim was brought, the nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant, as well as any element of unconscionability in allowing the claim to be enforced” (<span class="font-italic">Cytec</span>, at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 In <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>, for example, where the dispute centred on a joint investment involving the purchase of shares in a company, the respondent commenced proceedings in 2013 based on events which had occurred between 1999 and 2000, to seek an account of the shares and sale proceeds thereof. One of the key issues for determination by the court was whether the doctrine of laches could be invoked by the appellant. The court at first instance ruled that it could not. On appeal, however, the CA held that even based on the respondent’s calculation of the period of delay involved in his commencement of proceedings, there was still a “rather significant delay” of ten years (at [52]). In the CA’s view, there was a direct causal link shown between such inordinate delay and the prejudice suffered by the appellant in terms of the evidence available; and it was unconscionable for the respondent to seek an account from the appellant after such an inordinate delay, especially when the joint investment had been carried out on a relatively informal basis with limited documentation (at [56], [59]).     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 In the present case, I found that the second defendant could not even cross the first hurdle of establishing inordinate delay by the plaintiffs. To recap: Ms Lee’s evidence was that she had first discovered Hotel Photographs featured on the websites of several travel agencies sometime in 2012.

</div> When it was put to her in cross-examination that this meant the only way Wave could have found out about “The Magazines” before March 2014 was to visit the Hotels, Ms Chng claimed that “from the period before 2007”, Ms Lee “was most of the time in the office” and would surely have known that “at least the first eight editions…are there”.

</div> In other words, Ms Chng never had any personal interaction with Ms Lee at the GHM office. There was thus no basis for her evidence that “before 2007” Ms Lee would have been at the GHM office “most of the time”, or that Ms Lee would have realised from such purported visits the existence of the first eight issues of “The Magazine”.  Moreover, in cross-examination, Ms Chng was obliged to concede that her evidence about Ms Lee having found out about “at least” the first eight issues “from the period before 2007” could not be true because the first two issues of “The Magazine” were only released in January 2007 and July 2007 respectively;

However, this suggestion was never put to Ms Lee in cross-examination: instead, she was asked in cross-examination if she could point to an invoice or a bill for the licence fee charged on that occasion; and her response was that she could no longer find the document as she did not even have a home anymore.

</div> Given that the defendants failed to challenge the meaning to be given to the term “expenses” during their cross-examination of Ms Lee, I did not think they should be permitted to bring such a challenge belatedly in their closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In the interests of completeness, there are two other things I will deal with briefly. First, I noted that in seeking to establish the defence of laches, the defendants also relied in their closing submissions on the alleged failure by Wave to request the return of the CD-ROMs of Hotel Photographs after they stopped working with the Hotels from 2008 onwards. I have set out my findings in respect of this issue at [133] to [134] in these written grounds and will not repeat them here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Second, the defendants brought up two emails – one sent on 28 April 2006

</div> Unfortunately, these emails were couched in vague and ambiguous terms. For example, Mr Fong’s email simply contained a request from him to Ms Lee to go to a website so as to download some photographs: without elucidation from Mr Fong, it was not possible to determine what he was referring to.  Neither Ms See nor Mr Fong was called as a witness to elucidate the contents of these emails; and none of the defendants’ witnesses even referred to these emails during the trial.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 To sum up on the issue of laches: I accepted Ms Lee’s evidence that she had found out about the copyright infringements only in December 2012. It was not disputed that the plaintiffs’ US proceedings were commenced on 31 December 2013, and that they had commenced the proceedings in Singapore in February 2018, after the US court made its findings on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> in March 2017.

In that sense the doctrine of acquiescence may be defined as quiescence under such circumstances that assent may reasonably be inferred from it and is no more than an instance of the law of estoppel words or conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 As I noted earlier, the defendants relied in their closing submissions on the same evidence in respect of the defence of laches and the defence of acquiescence. In gist, the defendants referred to a number of incidents in an attempt to argue that they showed the plaintiffs being aware of Hotel Photographs being used and doing nothing to collect licence fees or otherwise to assert their copyright. I have set out my findings in respect of the incidents cited by the defendants (see [171] to [<span class="font-weight-bold">Error! Reference source not found.</span>]) and will not repeat them here. For the reasons I have explained, I did not accept the defendants’ argument that these were incidents which demonstrated the plaintiffs’ knowledge of Hotel Photographs being used and their failure to collect licence fees or otherwise to assert their copyright. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Just as they failed to establish laches, so too the defendants were unable to establish acquiescence.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Estoppel by convention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 As for the defence of estoppel by convention, the law requires that for this defence to apply, parties must have acted on an incorrect assumption of law or fact which both sides must have shared or acquiesced in; further, that the party seeking to rely on this defence must show that it is unjust or unconscionable to allow parties to go back on the said assumption: see <span class="font-italic">Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 200 at [49].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The second defendant pleaded in its defence that it and the plaintiffs had “acted on the assumption that the Hotel Photographs could be used by the 2nd Defendant for general branding, marketing and/or advertising purposes”.

</div> I found this submission to be misconceived: it was not disputed that the Final Photographs were created by editing and manipulating the Raw Images and thus necessarily encompassed those elements of the Raw Images which were copyright-protected. As such, any unauthorised reproduction of the Final Photographs would infringe not only the copyright in the Final Photographs but also the copyright in the Raw Images.

Ms Lee and Wave Studio Singapore are the first and the second plaintiffs in this suit. While Wave PL was dissolved on 1 August 2008, I also found in any event that the Wave-S copyright, the Wave PL copyright and the Wave Studio Singapore copyright were validly assigned to the third plaintiff Wave Studio US and are now owned by Wave Studio US (see above at [93]–[101]). On the basis of my findings on copyright ownership, there was no question that the plaintiffs had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>– <span class="font-italic">per</span> the <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span> test – to seek the declarations set out in prayers 40(a), 40(b), 40(d) of the statement of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 As for prayer 40(e), which was premised on an alternative scenario whereby Mr Kawana and/or Irieeyes were the original owners of the copyright in the Raw Images created at the hotel photo-shoots, my findings on copyright ownership made it unnecessary to consider the declaratory relief sought in this prayer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The defendants also objected to the declaratory relief prayed for at paragraphs 40(a) to 40(f) of the statement of claim. In gist, prayers 40(a) to 40(f) sought declarations as to the owners of the copyright in the Hotel Photographs were at the time of their making and the present owner of the copyright in these photographs. The defendants claimed that the declarations were sought for the purpose of assisting the plaintiffs in their US proceedings; and that caselaw prohibited the grant of such declarations. In this respect, the defendants’ arguments were predominantly based on a passage extracted from the commentary in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 (Volume 1)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (Sweet &amp; </span>Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span>”) (at 15/16/4) on Order 15 rule 16 of the Rules of Court, in which it was stated that a declaration would not be made “<span class="font-italic">merely to enable the plaintiff to utilise it in a foreign action</span>”. Two authorities were cited by the authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> for this statement: <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>and <span class="font-italic">Guaranty Trust of New York v Hannay &amp; Co </span>[1915] 2 KB 536 (“<span class="font-italic">Guaranty Trust</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Insofar as the defendants appeared to believe that the court must be barred without exception from granting a declaration which would be used in foreign proceedings, such a belief was grounded in a misunderstanding of the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> extract (see above at [198]) and the two authorities cited therein. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200  In <span class="font-italic">Guaranty Trust</span>, the defendants (who were based in England) bought cotton from dealers in America who drew a bill of exchange on the defendants for the price. The plaintiffs (who were based in America, with a branch office in England) bought the bill of exchange and sent it to the defendants with the bill of lading and other documentation. The bill of exchange was accepted by the defendants who paid it on maturity. It turned out that the bill of lading was a forgery: no cotton had been shipped under it. The defendants sued the plaintiffs in America for the amount of the bill of exchange which they had paid. It was not disputed that the law of England applied to the case. Subsequently the plaintiffs brought an action in England seeking declarations to the effect that in presenting the bill for acceptance with the bill of lading attached, they had not represented the bill of lading to be genuine and were not bound therefore to repay the bill amount. They also sought an injunction to restrain the defendants from proceeding further with the action in America, on the ground that the action was vexatious and likely to cause injustice and expense. The defendants filed an application under Order XXV, r.4 (<span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with our present-day Order 15 rule 16) to strike out the plaintiffs’ claims for the declarations on the ground that they disclosed no cause of action. This striking-out application was dismissed by the first-instance judge whose decision was affirmed on appeal by a majority of the English CA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 Of the two judges in the majority, Pickford LJ opined (at 562) that the effect of Order XXV, r.4 was “to give a general power to make a declaration whether there be a cause of action or not, and at the instance of any party who is interested in the subject-matter of the declaration”. On the particular facts of <span class="font-italic">Guaranty Trust</span>, he noted that the defendants were entitled to bring their action in America and could only be prevented from doing so on the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Logan v Bank of Scotland</span> [1906] 1 KB 141. If the plaintiffs failed to establish their rights in that way, they should not be allowed to obtain it indirectly by way of the declarations (at 564–565) – but Pickford LJ went on to conclude that this did not go towards the power of the court to make the declarations sought.  In his view, the court had jurisdiction to make a declaration that a person was not liable in an existing or possible action, though it would likely only do so in “a very exceptional case”. He was of the view, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that it was not a proper case for the summary procedure of striking-out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The other judge in the majority, Bankes LJ, was similarly of the view (at 572) that Order XXV, r.4 did not require an applicant such as the plaintiff (whom he referred to as the respondent) in <span class="font-italic">Guaranty Trust </span>to establish a legal cause of action.  In his view, Order XXV, r.4 applied where a party was seeking relief or in whom a right to seek relief was alleged to exist: “relief” was not confined to relief in respect of a cause of action. In this particular case, Bankes LC opined (at 574) that if the plaintiffs’ claim for a declaration were to be decided without reference to the claim for an injunction, then the plaintiffs’ action would not be maintainable because the claim for a declaration was not in itself a claim for relief. However, the view he took of the plaintiffs’ case was that what they really wanted was to stay the proceedings in America, and that the claim for the declarations was “merely ancillary to the claim for an injunction”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 From these judgments, it was clear that the majority in <span class="font-italic">Guaranty Trust</span> did not lay down any general rule to the effect that the courts would never grant a declaration intended to be used in foreign proceedings, or that to seek such a declaration would be to pursue an invalid or improper purpose. In respect of the comment in the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>extract that a declaration would not be made “<span class="font-italic">merely</span> to enable the plaintiff to utilise it in a foreign action”, the source for it appeared to be Bankes LJ’s statement (at 574–575) that “(t)he claim for a declaration is not in itself a claim for relief”, and that if the plaintiff could not establish any ground for relief from any further proceedings in the American courts, its application to the court would be “merely a request to the Court to supply them with evidence in a convenient form for use in the American action” – which was not a proceeding within Order XXV, r.4. This was not a concern in the present case, because the declarations sought as to the ownership of copyright in the Hotel Photographs were not sought by the plaintiffs “merely” to enable them to utilise such declarations in the US proceedings. To borrow the words of Bankes LJ, the plaintiffs’ prayers for declarations as to copyright ownership were not “merely a request to the Court to supply them with evidence in a convenient form for use in the American action”. In the first place, it was clear that in the present suit, the plaintiffs’ assertion of their copyright in the Hotel Photographs was vehemently disputed by the defendants: as the plaintiffs pointed out,

</div> both sides had agreed prior to the trial that the list of disputed legal issues included the question of which entity owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs, as well as the question of whether the copyrights had been validly assigned as between Wave-S, Wave PL, Ms Lee, Wave Studio Singapore and Wave Studio US. I agreed with the plaintiffs that given the issues in dispute, it was necessary for them to seek declarations that would firmly resolve the legal position; hence the prayers for the declarations set out in prayers 40(a) to 40(f). In other words, these declarations were not sought “merely” for use in the US proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204   Second, it was not disputed that in respect of the US proceedings, the second defendant had successfully applied in the US courts for those proceedings to be struck out against it on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, and that in so applying, it had argued that Singapore was the natural forum for determination of the issue of copyright ownership vis-à-vis the Hotel Photographs. This argument was accepted by Judge Seibel in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, who held that copyright ownership was “likely to be a matter of Singapore law”.

</div> As against the remaining defendants in the US proceedings, Judge Seibel granted a stay of those proceedings; and in this connection, it is important to note that the stay was agreed to by all remaining parties on the basis that they “recogniz[ed] that whether or not GHM infringed any of Plaintiff’s [Wave Studio US] alleged copyright will inform the resolution of Plaintiff’s claims against the other Defendants who allegedly received Plaintiff’s photographs from GHM”.

</div> It was expressly contemplated by the US court, therefore, that the issues of whether the third plaintiff owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs and whether GHM had infringed that copyright would be decided by a Singapore court; further, that the Singapore court’s decision would inform the resolution of the US proceedings against the other defendants therein. Given this procedural background (which the second defendant could not be ignorant of), there was no basis for the defendants to argue that any intended use of the declarations in the US proceedings was an invalid or improper purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 As for <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span>, which was the other authority cited in the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>extract relied on by the defendants, the reasons for the CA’s refusal to grant the declaration sought in that case were clearly explained in its judgment.  Those reasons did not assist the defendants at all in the present case. In brief, in <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span> had obtained an arbitration award against Pertamina and sought to enforce the award in Hong Kong by obtaining and serving a charging and garnishee order against a 99% subsidiary of Pertamina called Petral. The appellant believed that Petral had sent a sum of more than US$36,236,518-65 to its wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore (PES) in order to defeat the garnishee order. The appellant filed an originating summons (“OS”) in the Singapore High Court to seek a declaration that the sum of US$36,236,518-65 was held by PES on trust for Petral, as well as an order that PES repay this sum to Petral in Hong Kong. In upholding the High Court’s dismissal of the OS, the CA held (at [18]) that “in order to establish <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi</span> [to seek declaratory relief], a plaintiff must show that he had a “real interest” in bringing the action”; and that related to this was “the idea that the court would only entertain a suit for a declaration if there was a “real controversy” between the parties to the action for the court to resolve”. It was in this context that the CA found the appellant had not shown that it had any right to make a claim to the US$36,236,518-65. The only two parties who had any claim to the sum were Petral and PES, who had no dispute between them as to the status of the sum (at [20]). The CA agreed (at [19]) with the High Court that “a plaintiff should not be able to commence proceedings seeking a declaration that A owed money to B, when the plaintiff was neither A nor B”. In the present case, the plaintiffs in the present case were not in any such position. It would be absurd for the defendants to claim that the plaintiffs had “no real interest” in bringing this action or that there was no “real controversy” between the parties for the court to resolve.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 In sum, on the prayers for declaratory relief, having found for the plaintiffs on their claims of copyright ownership in the Hotel Photographs and of infringement by the defendants, I granted the declarations sought in prayers 40(a), 40(b), 40(c), 40(d), 40(f), 40(h) and 40(i) of the statement of claim.  The prayers in paragraphs 40(e) and 40(g) were not necessary in view of my findings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On injunctive and other non-declaratory relief </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 In light of my findings on copyright ownership and infringement, I also granted the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs 40(j), 40(q) and 40(r).  These were, respectively, an injunction under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act to restrain the defendants, their officers, employees, servants and agents from further infringing the plaintiffs’ copyright in the Hotel Photographs; an order under s 120 for the delivery up to the plaintiffs of all infringing copies of the Hotel Photographs in the defendants’ possession; and an order under s 120A for forfeiture to the plaintiffs or the destruction upon oath of any infringing copies of the Hotel Photographs or any articles used for making infringing copies of the Hotel Photographs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On whether the plaintiffs were entitled to seek both damages under s 119(2)(b) and an account of profit under s 119(2)(c) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 It will be recalled that the trial of this action was ordered to be bifurcated on the issues of liability and damage. After I gave my decision on copyright ownership and other liability-related issues on 18 January 2022, parties requested time to put in additional written submissions to address the further directions needed in relation to the remaining prayers in the statement of claim and on costs. A further hearing was held on 22 March 2022 to allow parties to respond orally to each other’s additional written submissions; and I gave my decision on the same day. I now address in these written grounds the issues which were raised in relation to the remaining prayers for relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 In respect of monetary remedies, the plaintiffs had prayed in paragraphs 40(k), 40(l) and 40(m) for damages under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), an account of profits under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and statutory damages under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) respectively. At the conclusion of the trial, I had informed parties after giving my decision that I was inclined to grant only one of these prayers and that the plaintiffs were to choose in priority among these three remedies. The plaintiffs subsequently wrote in stating that they had elected to pursue the remedies of damages to be assessed under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and an account of profits under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)

On a plain reading of the two provisions, it was impossible to arrive at the position advocated by the defendants. s 119(2B) states that the types of reliefs referred to ss 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) are mutually exclusive <span class="font-italic">except as provided for in s 119(2A)</span>. s 119(2A) expressly provides for the court to be able to “<span class="font-italic">also make an order</span>” under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) for an account of any profits that can be attributed to the infringement and that have not been taken into account in the computation of damages under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

</div> If the defendants meant by this statement that I had already ordered on 18 January 2022 that the plaintiffs could only choose either the remedy of damages to be assessed or that of an account of profits, this was plainly an incorrect representation of my directions. The transcript of the hearing on 18 January 2022 showed that after remarking that I was “inclined to grant only one of [the] three prayers” set out in prayers 40(k), 40(m) and 40(l) and “would therefore require the plaintiffs to choose in priority among the three options”, I had expressly stated that I would “hear parties on this before dealing with prayers 40(k), 40(m) and 40(l)”.

</div> That was precisely why both sides had requested time to put in additional written submissions and why there was a further hearing on 22 March 2022.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 At the hearing on 22 March 2022, the defendants’ counsel brought up a point about the differing natures of a hearing for the assessment of damages and a hearing for an account of profits. In this, he was not wrong, since an assessment of damages would involve the hearing of evidence on the losses suffered by the plaintiffs, whilst an account of profits would involve the hearing of evidence on the profits made by the defendants. However, this point about the differing natures of the two hearings <span class="font-italic">per se</span> did not support the argument that s 119(2A) rendered the two remedies mutually exclusive. In any event, the plaintiffs had never submitted that the account for profits must be heard at the same time and within the same hearing as the assessment of damages. On my querying him, the plaintiffs’ counsel confirmed

Because of the bifurcation of liability and damages in the present case, no evidence was led during the trial on the matters which the court needed to consider under s 119(4) in determining whether an award of additional damages was “appropriate in the circumstances”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Given my views on the plaintiffs’ prayers in paragraphs 40(k) to 40(n), it followed that the issue of interest (at paragraph 40(t)) should also be reserved to the damages tranche. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Further directions on damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Both the plaintiffs and the defendants requested that the assessment of damages be heard before me.

Under O 22A r 9(1) where an OTS made by a plaintiff (a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the OTS was made, and (b) is not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains a judgment not less favourable than the terms of the OTS, the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the OTS was served and costs on the indemnity basis from that date (unless the court orders otherwise). The plaintiffs submitted therefore that they should be entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from 5 January 2021 onwards.

The court in <span class="font-italic">Ram Das</span> also highlighted an example of a non-monetary claim where an OTS was made: see <span class="font-italic">Mopi Pte Ltd v Central Mercantile Corporation (S) Ltd </span>[2001] SGHC 328, where the defendants’ OTS dealt only with the use of a disputed trade mark and provided for the plaintiffs’ cessation of use of that trade mark and the payment of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 From the terms of O 22A r 9(1), the costs consequences specified therein apply if two conditions are satisfied: first, the OTS was not withdrawn and had not expired before the disposal of the claim (“the Validity Requirement”); and second, the judgment is not less favourable than the terms of the OTS (“the Favourability Requirement”): see <span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">NTUC Foodfare</span>”) at [15].

</div>). This proposed consent judgment essentially required the defendants to agree that the plaintiffs owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs, that no licence (whether express or implied) was granted to any third parties to reproduce or deal with the Hotel Photographs in any manner, and that the defendants had infringed the plaintiffs’ copyright in the Hotel Photographs despite knowing that neither they nor their current or former clients ever had any copyright or license to reproduce or deal with the photographs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That the plaintiffs would waive their claims against the defendants for damages arising from the causes of action raised in the suit;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) That the defendants would pay the plaintiffs’ standard costs in the suit as at the date of acceptance of the OTS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) That within 30 days of acceptance of the OTS, the defendants would deliver up to the plaintiffs all copies of the Hotel Photographs and/or any articles used for making the copies of the Hotel Photographs; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) That the defendants agreed that they did not have any defences to the infringement of the third plaintiffs’ copyrights to the Hotel Photographs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 In <span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another v PT Bumi International Tankers and another appeal </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 267 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Bumi</span>”), the CA held (at [8]) that “generally speaking, the element of compromise should be present in an offer to settle… It should contain in it an element which would induce or facilitate settlement”. The CA elaborated on this in <span class="font-italic">Resorts World at </span><span class="font-italic">Sentosa Pte Ltd v Goel Adesh Kumar and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1070 (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In determining whether an offer to settle is reasonable, serious or genuine, it would suffice that there is a legitimate basis for the offer made and the offer is not illusory – in other words, the offer should “not [be made] just to entail the payment of costs on an indemnity basis” (PT Bumi at [8]), and should not be one where “the offeror effectively [expects] the other party to capitulate (PT Bumi at [14]). There is no strict necessity for the offer to provide for each head of the contested claim. Nor is there any requirement for the offer to bear some proportionality to the claim. To hold otherwise would suggest that a modest but realistic offer will not be treated as a reasonable, serious or genuine offer for the purposes of O 22A as long as the sum offered is substantially less than the amount claimed. Such an interpretation would undermine the very purpose of O 22A, which is designed to protect a defendant who has made a realistic effort in response to an inflated claim from escalating costs should the eventual judgment be less than the amount offered. In the same way as it is for the plaintiff to quantify his claim amount, it is likewise a defendant’s right to assess the likely sum which the plaintiff may be awarded in order to protect himself from adverse costs consequences by making an appropriate offer to settle. At the end of the day, if the offer is more than the judgment sum, then the costs consequences under O 22A would be engaged even if the offer made is significantly less than the amount claimed, provided that, as stated above, the offer has a legitimate basis and is not illusory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 In resisting in oral arguments on 22 March 2022 the plaintiffs’ submission that their OTS was a serious and genuine offer, the defendants’ counsel argued that “this was not an offer that would have resolved the matter as it goes well beyond what would have been the ambit of this case as it required admissions that the plaintiffs would have gone on to use in the US courts, and if accepted on those terms, would have denied the defendants any redress or defences if joined as third parties in the US action”.

Insofar as counsel’s objection seemed to be that the making of these admissions would deprive the defendants of potential “redress or defences” if they were joined as third parties in the US proceedings. I must point out firstly that no evidence was produced by the defendants to substantiate this statement. Certainly, what documentary evidence I had of the terms on which Judge Seibel struck out the US proceedings against the second defendant and stayed the proceedings against the remaining defendants did not suggest that agreement by the defendants to the proposed consent judgment “would have denied the defendants any redress or defences if joined as third parties in the US action”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 Second, insofar as counsel appeared to suggest that the OTS was not reasonable or serious or genuine because it contemplated subsequent use of the admissions in the US proceedings, the legal reasoning behind this suggestion were not explained, nor were any authorities cited in support of it. As I noted earlier (see above at [204]), in striking out the US proceedings against the second defendant and staying those proceedings against the remaining defendants, the US court expressly contemplated that the issues of whether the third plaintiff owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs and whether GHM had infringed that copyright would be decided by a Singapore court; further, that the Singapore court’s decision would “inform the resolution of the [the plaintiffs’] claims against the other defendants”. Given this procedural background (which the defence was amply aware of), it was not at all clear why any intended use of the admissions in the proposed draft judgment would have gone “well beyond what would have been the ambit of this case”, or why such intended use would preclude the OTS from being “reasonable, serious or genuine”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 Having considered parties’ arguments and having scrutinised the terms of the OTS, I was satisfied that it was a serious and genuine offer. There was clearly an element of compromise present in the offer, in that the plaintiffs would waive their right to damages arising from the causes of action raised in the suit. The OTS had a legitimate basis and was not illusory. Contrary to defence counsel’s contention, I also did not see anything unreasonable either about the terms of the proposed consent judgment, given that the parties were all aware that the US proceedings had been stayed in order for the plaintiffs to obtain a ruling from the Singapore courts on the issues of copyright ownership and infringement which would inform the resolution of their claims before the US courts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">On the satisfaction of the Validity Requirement and the Favourability Requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 As summarised above, O 22A r 9(1) requires two conditions to be satisfied before the costs consequences specified therein can apply: first, the OTS must not have expired or been withdrawn before the final disposal of the claim on appeal (“the Validity Requirement”); and second, the judgment obtained must be “not less favourable” than the terms of the OTS (“the Favourability Requirement”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 In respect of the Validity Requirement, the OTS served by the plaintiffs was not subject to an expiry date; and it has not been withdrawn by the plaintiffs: the defendant’s counsel himself acknowledged as much.

</div> Somewhat oddly, however, the defendants’ counsel argued that the OTS was still “capable of being accepted” up to the “doorstep of the appeal” and that the costs consequences specified under O 22A r 9(1) should therefore “not flow”. I say this was somewhat odd because this was not a case where the offeree was trying to accept or had purported to accept an OTS after judgment was given. Counsel said that there were still “outstanding issues of AD and so on”, and that “the issue is not finally disposed of”

</div>.  Though not fully articulated, his argument appeared to be that the OTS remained open for acceptance all the way up to (and past) the assessment of damages, and that the defendants might still do better than the terms of the OTS (or the plaintiffs might do worse) at the assessment, such that it would be somehow unfair at this stage to impose on the defendants the costs consequences specified in O 22A r 9(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 I did not find any merit in the above argument. In <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong</span>, the CA made it clear that an OTS would be regarded as remaining open for acceptance “so long as there is an outstanding matter not disposed of which is within the scope of the [OTS]”. In the present case, where the trial was bifurcated on the issues of liability and damages, all outstanding matters in respect of liability had been disposed of by the judgment which I gave in favour of the plaintiffs: declarations on the rightful owners of the copyright and on the defendants’ infringement of that copyright had been granted in the plaintiffs’ favour; orders for injunctive relief and for the delivery up and forfeiting of infringing items has been given; and damages were to proceed for assessment. In my view, it was plain that the OTS had ceased to exist on account of the fact that all outstanding matters relating to liability had been disposed of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 As to the Favourability Requirement, it was also plain that this had been satisfied. The plaintiffs’ OTS had called for the defendants to admit (by way of the proposed consent judgment) that the plaintiffs owned the copyright in the Hotel Photographs, that no licence was granted to any third parties to reproduce or deal with the Hotel Photographs, and that the defendants had infringed the plaintiffs’ copyright in the Hotel Photographs despite knowing that neither they nor their current or former clients ever had any copyright or license to reproduce or deal with the photographs. The declaratory reliefs I granted to the plaintiffs (at [194] to [206] above) in terms of prayers 40(a), 40(b), 40(c), 40(d), 40(f), 40(h) and 40(i) essentially gave the plaintiffs what they had sought in the proposed consent judgment. Further, since they were now entitled to proceed to have damages assessed, as the plaintiffs’ counsel pointed out, even assuming they received only nominal damages at the assessment, they would have done better than the terms of their OTS, since those terms would have bound them to waive their right to seek any damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the costs and disbursements due to the plaintiffs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In sum, I was satisfied that the costs consequences set out in O 22A r 9(1) were applicable in this case. The plaintiffs were thus entitled to have their costs from 5 January 2021 onwards assessed on an indemnity basis. It was not disputed that costs on the indemnity basis would usually be assessed on the basis of a one-third uplift on the costs which would be given on the standard basis: <span class="font-italic">per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Lim Eng Hock Peter</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1052 at [83].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 On this basis, the plaintiffs contended that in respect of the costs of the proceedings on liability, they should be awarded costs of $426,750 as well as disbursements totalling $131,052-93. The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs should be entitled only to the sum of $130,000 in costs. The defendants also disputed the plaintiffs’ entitlement to several items of disbursements; in particular, the items relating to the plaintiffs’ share of the transcription fees and witness supervision fees and the fees paid for the mediations on 5 April 2019 and 26 October 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 In assessing the appropriate quantum of costs, I took into account the fact that this was a moderately complex case both legally and evidentially.  While the legal issues which parties had to address were not in my view novel, they did span a fairly broad range, from copyright and contract law, to equitable doctrines such as laches and acquiescence, to the principles governing the grant of declaratory relief. The evidence in this case was quite voluminous, as it covered nearly two decades of documentary evidence: there were a total of 9 volumes of agreed bundles of documents as well as 2 volumes of plaintiffs’ bundles of documents. Over and above this, counsel obviously had to contend with the fact that witnesses were recalling events some years – even decades – in the past. All of this would have had a bearing on the level of skill, specialised knowledge and responsibility and the time and labour expected on counsel. I also took into account the fact that the bulk of the work required for the trial on liability – the drafting of AEICs, the conduct of the trial and the preparation of written submissions – took place after 5 January 2021. The trial was conducted over a total of 9 hearing days. Although the defendants argued that parties were not in court for the entire day on three of the hearing dates, the work which counsel needed to do for the conduct of the trial would hardly stop the moment they were no longer before the court: considerable time would still have had to be spent doing other getting-up for the following day’s hearing.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 In light of the above factors, I was of the view that the $130,000 figure proposed by the defendants was far too low. On the other hand, the $426,750 figure proposed by the plaintiffs was rather on the high side. It appeared that counsel had derived this figure by taking the highest point of the scale given in Appendix G to the Supreme Court Practice Directions for each major stage of the proceedings on liability. I did not agree with this approach. The highest point of the Appendix G scale should be applied only to cases involving highly complex legal and/or evidential issues. The present case being one of moderate complexity, it would be reasonable to take the mid-point of the scale, while bearing in mind the fact that the range of costs stated in Appendix G serve as a guide and is not intended to be a set of inflexible rules. I add that the plaintiffs requested a number of extensions of time for the filing of their AEICs and written submissions; and the resulting delay (though not substantial) – would have caused some degree of disruption (though not substantial), which should count against them by way of a small discount on their costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 Bearing the above considerations in mind, I assessed that a reasonable figure for the plaintiffs’ costs of the proceedings on liability would be $300,000 (excluding disbursements).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 As to the disbursements, I did not agree with the plaintiffs that they should be entitled to claim the fees paid for the mediation on 5 April 2019 and 26 October 2020. Insofar as the plaintiffs asserted that it was the defendants who had refused to settle the parties’ dispute at the mediation sessions, there was no basis for me to accept the accuracy of this assertion: as the defendants observed,

</div>
</div> it could just as well be said that the plaintiffs were the ones who had refused to settle the parties’ dispute by way of mediation; and since the proceedings in mediation were confidential, there was no way the trial court would be in a position to determine which side had behaved unreasonably in the mediation. More fundamentally, the costs of the mediation were not in any event costs incurred in the legal proceedings before the court. For these reasons, I disallowed the item of disbursement relating to the mediation fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 In the interests of completeness, I add that I found the defendants’ objections to the disbursements relating to the plaintiffs’ share of the transcription costs and the witness supervision costs (for witnesses testifying remotely) to be unmeritorious. Both items were in my view costs reasonably incurred in the legal proceedings before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 Taking into account the removal of the item relating to mediation fees, the disbursements to be paid to the plaintiffs would come to $110,615-93.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mahesh Rai s/o Vedprakash Rai, Yong Wei Jun Jonathan and Samuel Soo Kuok Heng (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) and Llewelyn Gordon Ionwy David, Tan Lin Yin Gladys and Moh Huixian Estelle (David Llewelyn &amp; Co LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Narayanan Sreenivasan SC, Ang Mei-Ling Valerie Freda, Tan Xin Ya and Cheong Wei Yang Daryl (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Jing Han Alvin (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for non-party Agoda Company Pte Ltd (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

As part of their services, they executed photo-shoots to take photographs of these hotels and resorts and edited these photographs: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[12]–[13].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 In 2013, the second plaintiff discovered that some of these photographs had appeared in the defendants’ in-house online magazine. Issues of this magazine were available for download from websites owned or operated by the defendants and distributed to hotels managed by the defendants and the hotel’s guests: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[16].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">3 The third plaintiff had previously commenced proceedings for copyright infringement against the second defendant (and other defendants) in the United States. The suit against the second defendant was dismissed on the grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, and the proceedings against the other defendants were stayed pending the resolution of the proceedings in Singapore: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[17].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s ground of decision</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 The copyright over the photographs belonged to the plaintiffs. Applying s 30(5) of the Copyright Act, the copyright in the raw photographs taken by the photographers was owned by the plaintiffs, who had commissioned the photographers to do so: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[44].</span> s 30(5) did not apply to vest ownership of the copyright in the Hotels, as the agreement between the plaintiffs and the hotels was not to commission the plaintiffs to take the photographs, but for the plaintiffs to operate as a one-stop shop to provide branding, design and marketing services for the hotels: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[50], [60].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 Even if the agreement between the plaintiffs and the hotels was for the taking of photographs, the operation of s 30(5) did not apply as <span class="font-italic">per</span> s 30(3) Copyright Act, it had been excluded by agreement between the parties. The Hotels had accepted that the plaintiffs had reserved copyright over the photographs by way of Reservation Clauses in the Production Estimates provided to the Hotels and to the defendants: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[51], [62], [67], [72], [79]–[81].</span> The parties’ conduct evinced that that members of the defendants’ senior management team had acknowledged that copyright lay with the plaintiffs: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[83]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[91].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 The present owner is the third plaintiff, by dint of a series of copyright assignments over the years: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[93].</span> By way of the 7 July 2013 Assignment, the third plaintiff had also been validly assigned the right to sue for past copyright infringements: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[101].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 There was no “implied term” as between Wave and the Hotels that the copyright in the photographs “shall be assigned to the owners” of the Hotels. Applying the test for implying terms into a contract from <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte and another </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193, such an implied term would directly contradict the plaintiffs’ express reservation of copyright and hence fail the officious bystander test: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[107].</span> Further, the inclusion of the Reservation Clause in the Production Estimates suggests that the plaintiffs had no intention at the time of contracting to assign copyright ownership to the Hotels, and this implied term would hence also fail the business efficacy test: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[108].</span> There was also no necessity for such an implied term as it would not have been efficient for the Hotels and/or the defendants to liaise with multiple service providers: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[109].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 The defendants had never actually pleaded that there was an implied assignment of the copyright to the second defendant. Their omission to plead this proposition was fatal to their submission of an implied assignment of copyright: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[112].</span> Moreover, in the absence of any pleading regarding the existence of an express contract between the plaintiffs and defendants, there was no basis for the court to find that an implied assignment to the second defendant existed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[113]–[115].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 The defendants’ alternative argument that the second defendant had an implied license from the Hotel owners to use the photographs also failed as in the agreement between the plaintiffs and the Hotels, the parties’ intention was for the plaintiffs to use the photographs in the marketing materials it produced, and not for them to be used by any other vendor: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[124]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 The second defendant had infringed upon the copyright over the photographs by doing the following. It had reproduced them in its in-house magazine with the plaintiffs’ licence or consent. It had communicated the photographs to the general public by making the magazine issues available for download on its website. It had also imported copies of the magazine into Singapore for the purpose of distribution for the purpose of trade, or by way of trade exhibiting it in public, when it knew or ought reasonably to have known that the making of these publications was carried out without the licence and/or consent of the plaintiffs: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[15</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]–[154].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 Although the first defendant’s defence that it had nothing to do with the publishing of the magazine or the defendants’ website, the court found that the first defendant had, together with the second defendant, jointly published and/or produced the first six issues of the magazine: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[163].</span> There was evidence to demonstrate its involvement in the management of the hotels and the services provided by the plaintiffs to the hotels: at<span class="font-weight-bold"> [156]. </span>The imprint on the first six issues of the defendants’ magazine used two different appellations which clearly referred to two different entities, one of which was the first defendant: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[162].</span> The defendants’ failure to call as witness Mr Hans Jenni – a material witness to whom they attributed responsibility for publishing the magazine, led to an adverse inference being drawn against them, strengthening the plaintiffs’ evidence of the first defendant’s joint involvement in publishing the first six issues of the magazine: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[164]–[165].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 The defence of laches did not apply. There was no inordinate delay by the plaintiffs – the second plaintiff had found out about the copyright infringements only in December 2012, the proceedings in the US had been commenced in December 2013, and they had commenced the proceedings in Singapore in February 2018 after the US proceedings were dismissed in March 2017: at<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[184].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 The defence of acquiescence also did not apply. The defendants were not able to establish that the plaintiffs knew of the hotel photographs being used and did nothing to assert their copyright: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[186].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">14 The defence of estoppel by convention was similarly unsuccessful. Given that the second plaintiff was found to have been telling the truth when she testified to having discovered the copyright infringements only in December 2012, the plaintiffs could not have acquiesced to any assumption made by the second defendant prior to December 2012: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[189].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">15 The plaintiffs had locus standi to seek declaratory relief: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[196].</span> The court is not barred from granting a declaration intended to be used in foreign proceedings, and these declarations sought were not sought merely for use in the US proceedings. Neither was any intended use of the declarations in the US proceedings an invalid or improper purpose: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[203]–[204].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">16 Reading ss 119(2A) and 119(2B) of the Copyright Act together, the plaintiffs are not obliged to elect between remedies of damages to be assessed under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or an account of profits under s 119(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[213]–[216].</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">17 The plaintiffs’ offer to settle was a serious and genuine offer – it had an element of compromise present, had a legitimate basis and was not illusory, and the terms of the proposed consent judgment were not unreasonable: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[231]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> The Offer to Settle was valid as it had no expiry date and had not been withdrawn, although it had since ceased to exist on account of the fact that all outstanding matters relating to liability had been disposed of: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[233]–[234]. </span>The judgment was not less favourable than the terms of the Offer to Settle: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[235].</span> The cost consequences set out in O 22A r 9(1) Rules of Court were applicable: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[236].</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
