<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties, whom I shall refer to as husband
                    and wife, were married on 15 January 1993 in Budapest, Hungary. The wife is
                    Hungarian and the husband is Canadian. Both are Singapore permanent residents.
                    There are two children of the marriage, both sons, born in 1995 and 2000. In or
                    about 2001 to 2002, the husband left the family to live with another woman, [D].
                    The parties entered into a Deed of Separation (“the Deed”) on
                    19 February 2003. The husband filed the divorce petition on
                    16 February 2006, and the decree <em>nisi</em>
                    dissolving the marriage was obtained on 28 April 2006 and the ancillaries
                    were dealt with separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The ancillary hearings have been long and
                    tumultuous, involving numerous summonses taken out by both parties, and spanning
                    more than four years. The ancillary orders made by me on 25 November 2010
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     The husband and wife shall have joint
                        custody of the children, namely, [E] and [F], with the husband having care
                        and control of [E] and the wife having care and control of
                    [F].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     The husband
                        shall have access to [F] as follows:</p>

                            school to 9.00pm. The husband is to pick up [F] from school and return
                            him to [Property 1].</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Alternate weekends from Friday after school till
                            Sunday 8.00pm.</p>

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Alternate public holidays
                            from 10.00am to 8.00pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       [F]’s birthday on alternate

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       On
                            [E]’s birthday, access to [F] from after school to
                        9.00pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">(The wife did not apply for access to [E] as she
                        preferred that [E] see her voluntarily.)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     The husband shall pay $3,500 per month for the
                        maintenance of [F] with effect from February 2010.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        husband shall pay the sum of $3,600 per month for the rent of the
                        residential premises of the wife and [F] with effect from March
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     The husband

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_g"></a>(g)     Other
                        household expenses (including supplemental rental and employment of maid)
                        shall be borne by the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_h"></a>(h)     The husband shall pay $1 per month, nominal maintenance
                        for the wife until further order.</p>

                        receipt of her share in the 25% of the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_m"></a>(m)     There will
                        be no order as to costs.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_o"></a>(o)     Liberty to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The husband has appealed against (i) and (k) of
                    my order above. I now give my reasons for my order that the wife is to receive
                    25% of the matrimonial assets, consisting of S$985,000 and 11.5 million [G]
                    Commodities shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The husband is presently the managing director
                    of [G] Commodities Pte Ltd (“[G] Commodities”). [G] Commodities is
                    a company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The wife is an associate
                    medical director with [H] Development Pte Ltd. As mentioned earlier, the
                    husband had left the family around 2001 to 2002 for [D] and parties subsequently
                    decided to enter into the Deed. The Deed was comprehensive and included all
                    ancillary matters such as custody, care and control of the children, maintenance
                    for the children and the wife, as well as division of matrimonial assets. More
                    crucially, cl 11 of the Deed read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11</b>
                
              <b>Assets excluded from division</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both parties agree that asset(s) acquired by either party from the date of
                        this Deed will remain as asset(s) of the acquiring party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the time of execution of the Deed, the
                    husband was the managing director of [J] Asia Pte Ltd (“[J]
                    Asia”). However, subsequent to the execution of the Deed there was a
                    buy-out of [J] Asia by [K] Holdings Pte Ltd (“[K] Holdings”)
                    which was completed on 12 February 2004. The husband remained as the
                    managing director of [J] Asia. As a result of the buy-out, the husband received
                    a stock option dated 28 June 2004, which provided that the husband could
                    acquire 25% of the current issued and paid up share capital of [J] Asia for S$1
                    within the next three years from the date of the option, provided that if after
                    the exercise of the option, [J] Asia’s annual audited consolidated profit
                    and loss accounts reflected a loss for three consecutive financial years, the
                    husband would have to pay $500,000 for his 25% stake. The husband exercised the
                    option on the very same day. [J] Asia was later renamed [K] Asia Pte Ltd
                    (“[K] Asia”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       [K] Holdings was a major shareholder of [G]
                    Commodities. Subsequently, on 10 July 2006, both [K] Holdings and the
                    husband sold their shares in [K] Asia to [G] Commodities. The husband received
                    11.5 million [G] Commodities shares, estimated to be worth around S$12m, and
                    S$985,000 in consideration for his 25% stake in [K] Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As the buy-out of [J] Asia and the transfer of
                    the shares to the husband occurred after the execution of the Deed, the
                    husband’s assets consisting of 11.5 million [G] Commodities shares and
                    S$985,000 (“the husband’s assets”) would therefore <em>prima facie</em> fall under the exclusion cl 11 of the Deed.
                    However, the wife’s position was that the option was given for his efforts
                    in brokering the sale of [J] Asia to [K] Holdings prior to the execution of the
                    Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The question of when the issue of a buy-out of
                    [J] Asia arose became pertinent in order to ascertain when the husband’s
                    assets were acquired, and whether they were acquired by the husband’s
                    efforts expended during the marriage or after separation. The Family Court gave
                    orders on 4<sup></sup>February 2010 for the husband to answer interrogatories posed to
                    him by the wife’s counsel, as well as to disclose documents relating to
                    the sale and purchase of [J] Asia, with a view to determining if the shares were
                    part of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The governing provision with regard to the
                    division of matrimonial assets is s 112 of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”):</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">any other asset of any nature acquired during
                                the marriage by one party or both parties to the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has
                        been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has
                        not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by
                        both parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear that the [G] Commodities shares and $985,000 fell within
                        s 112(10)<em>(b)</em> of the Act as assets that
                    were acquired <em>during</em> the marriage by the husband.
                    The question is whether cl 11 of the Deed should prevail
                nevertheless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is evident from s 112 of the Act that
                    in deciding on the division of matrimonial assets the court must take into
                    account all relevant matters but has the discretion in weighing the relevant
                    factors to come to a just and equitable division for both parties. Ultimately,
                    the court has the power and the discretion to decide what is just and equitable
                    and arrive at a fair conclusion for both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the Deed binding?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before me, the husband submitted that the Deed
                    was prepared and drafted by the wife’s solicitors, M/s Rodyk &amp;
                    Davidson, based on the wife’s instructions. Further, both parties had the
                    benefit of competent and independent legal advice as to the terms and effects of
                    the Deed as affirmed in Recital 1.3 of the Deed. As such, the husband submitted
                    that as the wife was the one who had requested for the Deed to be entered into,
                    it was unfair for her to argue to set aside the Deed. In addition, the husband
                    also submitted that the wife had received the full benefit of the clauses in the
                    Deed until December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, the wife’s version of events
                    was that she had entered into the Deed primarily to secure the interests of the
                    children and the Deed was drawn up based on the husband’s disclosure of
                    his income, benefits and assets. Subsequently, the husband had breached various
                    clauses in the Deed and there was also non-disclosure of material facts and
                    assets by the husband. The wife therefore argued that the Deed should be set
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The wife submitted that the husband had made
                    numerous breaches of the Deed by insisting that the children and the wife move
                    out of their family home, an apartment at [Property 3], into cheaper
                    accommodation; reducing the children’s and the wife’s maintenance
                    unilaterally; and replacing the children’s nanny without the wife’s
                    prior consent in contravention of clauses in the Deed providing for the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     More importantly, the husband appeared to have
                    failed to disclose an increase of 10% in his local and off-shore income, a
                    British Club membership, as well as profit shares of US$60,000 paid to the
                    husband from [J] Asia and the 25% stock option he was to receive from [J] Asia.
                    As such, the wife submitted that the Deed ought to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With regard to the issue of the wife’s
                    maintenance, it was stated in cl 7.2.1 that the wife’s maintenance
                    would be “subject to review” in the event that there is a
                    “material change in the Husband’s financial circumstances”.
                    However, the Deed contemplated a change with respect to the maintenance of the
                    wife only, and not the children. As such, a unilateral reduction of the
                    children’s maintenance would be a breach of the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It can be said that the mere fact that the
                    parties had executed a Deed did not mean it was the be-all and end-all. In
                        <em>TQ v TR and another appeal</em> [2009]
                    2 SLR(R) 961 (“<em>TQ v TR</em>”),
                    it was held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    It is clear, in our view, that as the ultimate
                            power resides in the court to order the division of matrimonial assets
                            ‘in such proportions as the court thinks <em>just
                                and equitable</em>’ ... a prenuptial agreement <em>cannot</em> be construed in such a manner as to
                                <em>detract from</em> this ultimate power.
                            However, this does not mean that such a prenuptial agreement cannot
                            (where <em>relevant</em>) be utilised to <em>aid</em> the court in exercising its power pursuant
                            to s 112 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    ... how much weight is to be allocated to a
                            prenuptial or postnuptial agreement in each case must ultimately depend

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    ... The ultimate aim of the court is (in accordance
                            with s 112(1) of the Act, ... to arrive at a division of
                            matrimonial assets that is both <em>just and
                                equitable</em> as between the parties. We pause to observe
                            that this approach (mandated by s 112 of the Act) is, in fact,
                            flexible and permits the court to consider other developments and
                            changes that have taken place since the marriage (many of which are
                            encompassed within the factors mentioned in s 112(2)
                            itself).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     While the court is to have regard to the
                    executed Deed (amongst all other circumstances) under s 112(2)<em>(e)</em> of the Act in deciding whether to exercise its
                    powers under s 112(1) and if so how; it should be noted that the courts
                    “[would] be especially vigilant and [would] be slow to enforce agreements
                    that [were] apparently not in the best interests of the child or the children
                    concerned” (see <em>TQ v TR</em>). Additionally, the
                    decision in <em>TQ v TR</em> held that an agreement between
                    parties “<em>cannot</em> be enforced <em>in and of itself</em>” [emphasis in original]. The
                    terms of an agreement would only constitute one of the factors that the court
                    should take into account in arriving at its decision as to the proportions in
                    which the matrimonial assets concerned are to be distributed. Even if <em>prima facie</em> the court would not lightly set aside an
                    agreement between parties, the court has liberty to decide that an agreement
                    ought not to apply if the court does not consider it just and
                equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Turning now to the present circumstances,
                    Recitals 1.5 and 1.6 of the Deed provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.5    Each party has <b><em>disclosed to
                                the other full details</em></b> of the income, earning capacity,
                            property and other financial resources and the financial needs
                            obligations and responsibilities <b><em>which each has now
                                and is likely to have in the foreseeable future</em></b> in
                            accordance with the Schedule of Monthly Allocations annexed
                            herein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.6    Both parties <b><em>acknowledge that
                                they have been given the opportunity to inspect</em></b> the
                            financial documents and records of the other and that <b><em>disclosure to each party by each party has been full and
                                relevant</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This would, in essence, mean that both the husband and the wife had
                    agreed to disclose full details of their income, earning capacity, property and
                    other financial resources as well as their financial needs, obligations and
                    responsibilities prior to entering into the Deed. Further, Recital 1.5 provides
                    for full disclosure of income, earning capacity, property and other financial
                    resources which each party has “now” and is “likely to have
                    in the foreseeable future”. The husband therefore had an obligation to
                    disclose the stock option or any other benefit if he had knowledge at the time
                    parties entered into the Deed – that there was a likelihood he would be
                    receiving it in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In addition, Recital 1.6 provides that both
                    parties acknowledge that the disclosure by each party has been full and relevant
                    at the time of execution of the Deed. However, where either party had not in
                    fact given full and relevant disclosure to the other prior to the latter signing
                    the Deed, the aggrieved party should not be held to Recital 1.6. Further, as has
                    been observed earlier, the division of matrimonial assets is not purely a matter
                    of contract despite the existence of the Deed. In dividing matrimonial assets,
                    the court has the ultimate power to decide what is just and equitable for the
                    parties, and this principle is of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     This brings us to the issue of whether the
                    husband had fulfilled Recitals 1.5 and 1.6 by giving full and relevant
                    disclosure, and consequently if parties ought to be held to cl 11 of the Deed.
                    Clause 11, and by extension the entire Deed, should not be binding on the wife
                    if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     the husband failed to disclose the
                        stock option; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     the wife satisfies the court that he knew or ought to have known that
                        he would be receiving the stock option at the time they entered into the
                        Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The husband’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In order to determine if the husband knew or
                    ought to have known that he would be receiving the stock option, the starting
                    point is to examine when the question of the buy-out of [J] Asia
                arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The husband averred in an affidavit dated 28
                    October 2008 that [J] Asia was going through financial difficulties and
                    that the stock option was extended to him by [K] Holdings “due to the
                    uncertainty of the business prospects” of [J] Asia. He further mentioned
                    that [K] Holdings had granted him the option as it had “wanted to ensure
                    that [he] was committed to the company and that [he] would work hard to secure
                    their investment in [J] Asia”. Additionally, the husband attributed
                    his 11.5 million [G] Commodities shares and S$985,000 to mere good fortune.
                    According to him, he was “simply very fortunate in [his] decision to
                    become a shareholder of [[J] Asia] at a time when the shares were not only
                    worthless but even a liability. At the time all [he] was trying to do was save
                    [his] job and secure [[K] Holdings’] support. [He] could have never
                    imagined such an outcome”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, the husband’s own evidence in a
                    previous maintenance summons taken out by the wife when the husband had
                    unilaterally reduced the children’s and her maintenance on 4 October 2004
                    revealed the husband did not become owner of the shares serendipitously:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    In late 2003, due to my parent company in Holland
                            experiencing financial difficulties, the Singapore company which I work
                            for also nearly went under. <b><em>Fortunately, I found a
                                buyer and brokered the take-over by a Singapore incorporated company
                                (‘[K]’)</em></b>. [K]’s directors decided to
                            retain my services. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This suggested that the husband was in fact
                    instrumental in the buy-out by [K] Holdings and was not a mere bystander. At the
                    time of the hearing of the maintenance summons, as the division of matrimonial
                    assets had not become contentious, the husband had perhaps let his guard down
                    and was frank in his evidence then. It could not be that he was mistaken as to
                    his role since his evidence in the maintenance summons was given only eight
                    months after completion of the buy-out. To my mind, the husband would have had a
                    greater incentive to downplay his involvement in the buy-out transaction in his
                    later affidavits. I was therefore more inclined to accept the husband’s
                    earlier evidence that he had “brokered” the buy-out by [K]
                    Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In addition, in the documents produced by the
                    husband on 2 and 9 July 2010, it was apparent that the husband had been
                    instrumental in the buy-out deal by [K] Holdings of [J] Asia. The husband was
                    described as indispensable, an “angle of the triangle” in the
                    buy-out deal, in an e-mail dated 23 February 2004 from one [L] of [M] Corporate
                    Finance BV (a mergers and acquisitions consultancy firm which facilitated the
                    takeover of [J] Asia) addressed to the directors of [K] Holdings and the
                    husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On top of that, an e-mail dated 19 March 2004
                    sent by [N], the main director of [K] Holdings to the chief executive officer of
                    [J] Holding BV (“[J] Holding”), [O], read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[K] has a corporate policy to reward CEOs with stock options and as ...
                        mentioned ... [[K]’s] taking over is conditional on [the husband]
                        staying. [[K] has] decided to give [the husband] an attractive 25% shares in
                        the company. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This clearly showed that a condition of [K] Holdings’ agreement
                    to buy-out [J] Asia was that the husband would remain as the managing
                    director of [J] Asia. As it was a corporate policy, it was likely to have
                    surfaced early in the negotiations, incentivising a more pro-active role by the
                    husband in the buy-out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It was likely that a deal of some sort had
                    previously been struck between [K] Holdings and the husband before the buy-out.
                    This can be gleaned from an e-mail dated 6 November 2003 from [L] to [N] prior
                    to the transaction, assuring [N] that he would:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... take only a minimal risk since [the husband] who [had] the expertise
                        and who [was] fully aware of all aspects, processes and details of the
                        company and its subsidiaries [would] remain in office and [would] as such
                        form an instrumental part of the organization.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Furthermore, in an unrelated hearing in [case
                    name redacted], the husband had, under cross-examination, given evidence that he
                    had substantial control and authority in [J] Asia, at pp 1305–1313 of the
                    notes of evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And as someone who was working in the field, it is rather frustrating to
                        be determined, or to have your trading fate determined by somebody who is
                        sitting very far away and has very little knowledge of what is going on on
                        the ground, whereas in [J], the idea of structuring my own warehousing
                        arrangements, the book was mine, to put together as I pleased.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was not exactly sure why we had two holding companies, and since I have

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It was therefore unlikely that the husband had
                    no inkling of the buy-out that was to occur shortly after the execution of the
                    Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">[O]’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     [O]’s affidavit also served to
                    substantiate the wife’s claim that the 25% stake in [J] Asia was in fact a
                    reward for the husband’s involvement in brokering the buy-out by [K]
                    Holdings, which was under way before the execution of the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     An e-mail from the husband to [O] on 26
                    November 2003, read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As you know [the CEO of [J] Shanghai] has advised us as early as last year
                            [<em>ie</em> 2002] that he intended to stay only
                        until the end of this year. It is my understanding, from him that he was
                        waiting to see how things with the sale of [J] Asia would un-fold before
                        making his move.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was apparent that discussions about the sale of [J] Asia had
                    already been under way from as early as 2002, and the husband would have had
                    knowledge of an imminent buy-out at the time of execution of the
                Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     [O], in his affidavit, said that the husband
                    had furnished a report dated 2 September 2002 that recommended that “the
                    most efficient way to achieve [growth for [J] Asia was] is to have [[J] Holding]
                    inject capital into [[J] Asia]” but as this was not possible “an
                    outside investor” would have to be found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     [O] added that the husband’s prognosis
                    for the future of [J] Asia was bleak, and in his reports to [J] Holding, he had
                    forecasted that [J] Asia would be wound up if the shareholders in [J] Holding
                    did not inject more capital or sell [J] Asia off. It was on the basis of the
                    husband’s dismal forecast of the company that the decision was taken by
                    [J] Holding to sell off [J] Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This led to [O]’s conclusion (at
                        [31] of his affidavit dated 27
                    August 2010):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[This] shows that from as early as 2002, he was already aware of the fact
                        that selling [J] Asia was most likely the only way out. We therefore may
                        infer that [the husband] had set his own course and made his choice by
                        signing a non-competition agreement with [K] Holdings on
                            21<sup>st</sup> April 2003, which paved the way for the
                        eventual sale of [J] Asia to [K] Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In addition, the husband had on 22 November
                    2002, sent an e-mail to [O] asking whether further consideration had been
                    given to the possibility of [J] Asia’s management taking equity in the
                    company, which would include the husband himself. On 24 January 2003, the
                    husband once again e-mailed the shareholders of [J] Asia raising questions about
                    the proposed increase of his profit share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This evidence by [O] supports the wife’s
                    claim that the husband had always been frustrated by the fact that he could not
                    claim a stake in [J] Asia, as it was a family-owned company, and that the
                    husband had actually engineered the buy-out by [K] Holdings in order to edge out
                    the [O] family and to acquire substantial equity for himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Furthermore, the husband had exercised the
                    stock option on the very same day it was given to him, on 28 June 2004. This
                    showed that the husband was confident of the success of [J] Asia after the
                    buy-out, despite the bleak outlook for the company which he had painted to [J]
                    Holding prior to the sale; it also suggested that the real reason for the
                    husband’s insistence on the buy-out of [J] Asia was to remove the [O]
                    family from the company. It also served to emphasise the husband’s
                    eagerness to receive equity in the company, supporting the wife’s position
                    that the husband had engineered the buy-out transaction for the purpose of
                    acquiring equity in [J] Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the light of this, it was for the husband
                    to produce evidence to prove that the buy-out was conceived after the execution
                    of the Deed and that the stock option was a real windfall. However, as can be
                    seen from the succeeding paragraphs, he failed to provide any such
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Husband’s lack of full and frank disclosure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The determination of whether the
                    husband’s stock option ought properly to be regarded as part of the
                    matrimonial assets to be divided between the parties was highly dependent on the
                    husband’s full and frank disclosure of the relevant papers in his
                    possession, in particular those documenting the discussions and negotiations
                    with respect to and the rationale for the grant of the stock option. However,
                    the husband failed time and again to comply with his duty of full and frank
                    disclosure to the court, as seen in the instances listed below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     He failed to disclose in his first
                        Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AAM”), filed on 2 October
                        2006, the cash consideration of S$985,000 and the 11.5 million [G]
                        Commodities shares. The husband only disclosed an approximate amount of
                        S$36,000 in his bank accounts and his CPF moneys.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the husband’s affidavit filed
                        on 4 January 2007 in support of his application in Summons No [xxx] of 2007
                        (“SUM [xxx]”) to uphold cll 10 and 11 of the Deed, he once
                        again failed to disclose the same assets, <em>ie</em>,
                        the sum of S$985,000 and 11.5 million [G] Commodities shares. Neither did he
                        disclose a [Property 2] which he had bought subsequently using the S$985,000
                        as part payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     At the hearing of SUM [xxx], the district judge presiding at the
                        hearing specifically questioned if all assets had been disclosed in the
                        husband’s AAM. Despite that, the district judge was not informed of
                        the existence of the [G] Commodities shares and the
                    S$985,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        wife, on multiple occasions, sent requests to the husband for information in
                        respect of any shares he may have possessed in [J] Asia, but his
                        response was that all his shares and benefits had already been disclosed in
                        his IR8A form, when in truth they had not.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_e"></a>(e)     The wife later discovered his assets in [J] Asia
                        by chance and obtained an order of court on 22 May 2008 to set aside the
                        earlier order dated 11 May 2007 which the husband had obtained in SUM [xxx],
                        on the grounds that it was obtained by misrepresentations. This was affirmed
                        on appeal by Justice Woo Bih Li in the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_f"></a>(f)     On 4 February 2010, District Judge
                        Masayu Norashikin ordered the husband to disclose all documents,
                        correspondence or memorandums relating to the sale of [J] Asia and in
                        respect of the stock option granted to the husband, as well as to answer
                        interrogatories by the wife’s counsel. The husband was contumacious
                        with respect to discovery and evasive in answering the interrogatories. His
                        response to the discovery order made against him was inconsistent,
                        oscillating between the two positions that he either did not possess the
                        requisite documents or that they did not exist. On 1 April 2009, the husband
                        stated that the request was oppressive and that he did not have the
                        documents requested. On 8 December 2009, the husband stated that the
                        documents requested “simply” did not exist. However, on
                        22 February 2010, the husband reverted to his earlier position that he
                        did not possess the documents and that all relevant documents had earlier
                        been produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_g"></a>(g)     Notwithstanding the husband’s insistence that he did not possess the
                        documents and/or, alternatively, that they did not exist, he managed to
                        produce a voluminous bundle consisting of 288 pages of documents on
                            2<sup></sup>July 2010, after this court had, on 1 July 2010, warned that
                        an adverse inference might be drawn against him if he failed to comply
                        without just excuse. However, as this court observed, the set of documents
                        tendered on 2 July 2010 remained incomplete.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_h"></a>(h)     On 9 July 2010, the husband produced a further
                        set of documents spanning 553 pages in respect of the 4 February 2010
                        discovery order made against him. However, despite the voluminous documents
                        produced, only two brief e-mails pertained to the reasons as to why the
                        husband was granted the option to purchase 25% of [J] Asia’s
                        shares for S$1. The e-mails were dated 19 March 2004 and 1 April 2004
                        respectively, and were written by [N] of [K] Holdings to [O], the CEO
                        of [J] Holding and the director of [J] Asia until 6  March 2006 as
                        well as the sole shareholder of [J] Asia until 12  February 2004.
                        The first e-mail mentioned that [K] Holdings’ takeover of [J] Asia was
                        conditional on the husband remaining in the company and that he was to
                        receive “25% shares in the company”. The second e-mail
                        clarified that “the shares for [the husband were] not share transfers
                        but stock options”. Other than those two brief e-mails, there was no
                        discovery of any e-mail, memorandum, letter or minute evidencing discussions
                        or negotiations between the husband and [K] Asia or [K] Holdings or the
                        latter’s board decision to give the husband the stock
                    option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Court of Appeal in <em>Wee
                        Ah Lian v Teo Siak Weng</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 347 held that
                    full and frank disclosure was paramount and that, in its absence, the court was
                    entitled to draw inferences adverse to the party who failed to comply. There
                    have been many instances where the court had chosen to disbelieve a party owing
                    to a lack of full and frank disclosure by that party, and demonstrated its
                    readiness to make adverse inferences against the errant party, such as in
                        <em>Koo Shirley v Mok Kong Chua Kenneth</em> [1989]
                    1 SLR(R) 244, as well as <em>Tan Siew Eng (alias Tan
                        Siew Eng Irene) v Ng Meng Hin</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 474,
                        <em>inter alia</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The husband had ignored his duty of full and
                    frank disclosure time and again in the proceedings. I did not accept his
                    argument that his failure to disclose his assets, when he filed his AAMs and
                    when asked by the district judge below, was due to his belief that the assets
                    were irrelevant, the stock option having been granted after the execution of the
                    Deed. Clearly, the assets fell within s 112(10)(<em>b</em>) of the Act and he ought to have disclosed the existence of
                    the assets while maintaining that they ought to be excluded as matrimonial
                    assets under cl 11 of the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The husband’s initial insistence that he
                    did not possess any of the documents requested for in the 4 February 2010
                    discovery order, and subsequently, after my warning of an adverse inference
                    being drawn against him on 1 July 2010, his incremental disclosure of the
                    documents in his possession on 2 July and 9 July 2010, showed that the husband
                    was intentionally flouting his duty of full and frank disclosure to the court.
                    In the event, only two of the documents produced by the husband related to the
                    issuance of the stock option by [J] Asia to him, as mentioned in [40(h)] above.
                    It was difficult to believe that there was no record of negotiations or
                    discussions as to the level of incentive or reward. It was even more
                    unbelievable that an important corporate decision such as the award of a 25%
                    stake in [J] Asia to the chief executive officer would not have been the subject
                    of any resolution, written memorandum, e-mail or letter documenting the issuance
                    of the stock option in the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I therefore drew an adverse inference that the
                    husband’s reluctance to disclose those assets, as well as his failure to
                    disclose the relevant documents, more likely than not meant that if revealed the
                    documents would have shown that at the time of execution of the Deed he knew or
                    ought to have known that he would receive some form of benefit from the buy-out.
                    Taking into account all the circumstances, it would appear more likely than not
                    that the husband had known of the likelihood of receiving the stock option or at
                    least some form of benefit when he executed the Deed on 19 February 2003. The
                    wife had signed the same believing the husband’s false representation that
                    he was not likely to have any other property in the near future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The husband had thus contravened Recital 1.5
                    of the Deed by not fully disclosing the assets and benefits he was likely to
                    receive in the foreseeable future, despite the knowledge that he would or was
                    likely to receive the same at that time. It would therefore be unjust and
                    inequitable to hold the wife to Recital 1.6 as there had been no full and
                    relevant disclosure, and equally unfair to hold her to cl 11 of the Deed, when
                    she had been unaware of the stock option or other benefit that the husband knew
                    he would or was likely to receive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of the [G] Commodities shares and S$985,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Given that the [G] Commodities shares and the
                    S$985,000 are matrimonial assets and that cl 11 of the Deed ought not to
                    prevail, we next have to decide on her fair share of the assets. In deciding
                    what is just and equitable for division between parties, it is relevant to
                    consider factors such as:</p>

                        of the Act); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party,
                        including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in
                        the carrying on of his or her occupation (see s 112(2)<em>(g)</em> of the Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The husband maintained that he was granted the
                    stock option due to the “uncertainty of the business prospects” of
                    [J] Asia, when it was bought over by [K] Holdings. He submitted that the stock
                    option made him personally liable to [K] Holdings for the entire purchase cost
                    of the company from [J] Holding, suggesting that the stock option was in
                    fact a liability rather than an asset for him. The husband also argued that [K]
                    Holdings granted him the Option Agreement to take a 25% stake in the company to
                    ensure that he was committed to the company and that he would work hard to
                    secure their investment in [J] Asia, suggesting that the stock option was for
                    future services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On the other hand, the wife submitted that the
                    primary purpose of the stock option was to provide compensation or reward for
                    the husband’s past services in [J] Asia, as well as to give recognition to
                    his expertise in warehousing management and the running of [J] Asia’s
                    business in the Asia Pacific region. The wife submitted that the stock option
                    was also granted for the husband’s role in brokering the sale of [J] Asia
                    to [K] Holdings. Finally, the wife’s position was that the stock option
                    was also granted for the husband’s expertise and knowledge, which was
                    acquired during the marriage with her support.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I find it difficult to accept that the stock
                    option was to reward the husband for his past services in [J] Asia. For reasons
                    earlier stated, it is more likely that it was partly to reward him for his role
                    in facilitating and brokering the buy-out of [J] Asia. Further, in the e-mail
                    dated 6 November 2003 from [L] to [N] referred to in <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above, [N] was assured that in the buy-out he was taking
                    only a minimal risk as the husband, who had the expertise and was fully aware of
                    all aspects, processes and details of the company and its subsidiaries, would
                    remain in office as an instrumental part of the organisation after the buy-out.
                    This lent support to the wife’s position that the stock option was also
                    granted to retain the husband for his experience and knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     
          <em>Grich v Grich</em>,
                    1996 Conn Super LEXIS 3451 (“<em>Grich</em>”), is of assistance, where it was held in that case
                    that the object of the stock option plan was stated to be to provide key
                    employees of the company additional incentives to continue and increase their
                    efforts on the company’s behalf and to remain in the employ of the
                    company. The Superior Court of Connecticut found that the husband:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... could not have arrived at his advantageous position at [the company]
                        as a ‘key employee’ without the prior concentration of his time,
                        energies, and labor [<em>sic</em>] in the computer
                        industry. From the evidence presented it is clear that his concerted effort
                        was aided significantly by the [wife] who helped to further his career
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was even held that the unvested stock options were part of the
                    marital estate and were subject to equitable distribution between the spouses.
                    This reasoning was adopted by our Court of Appeal in <em>Chan
                        Teck Hock David v Leong Mei Chuan</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 76.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The reasoning in <em>Grich</em> is apropos in the present case. The wife was supportive of
                    her husband’s career when they were based in China. She single-handedly
                    shouldered the burden of looking after the young family in a foreign country,
                    enabling the husband to focus his energies in his work and render himself
                    indispensable to the company. Prior to their relocation to Singapore, the wife
                    had just begun working as a resident surgeon in an American clinic in China.
                    However, for the benefit of her husband’s career, she relocated to
                    Singapore. While in Singapore, she was unable to practice as her degree was not
                    recognised here. Her husband left the family soon after the family’s
                    relocation to Singapore and their younger son’s birth in 2001. The wife
                    thus brought the younger son up as a single mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The wife’s indirect contributions to the
                    family and her support and assistance to the husband undoubtedly led to the
                    husband being valued as an asset to the company and put him in a position to
                    negotiate for a 25% stake in [J] Asia, which eventually converted into 11.5
                    million [G] Commodities shares and S$985,000. It was only just and equitable
                    that the wife be given a share of those assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Under the Deed, the husband agreed to the wife
                    having a 50% share of the matrimonial assets. I could have taken that division
                    as being what both parties considered just and equitable, applied that same
                    percentage in dividing the 11.5 million [G] Commodities shares and the $985,000.
                    However, I had regard to the fact that the marriage had lasted only ten years up
                    to the time of the execution of the Deed (13 years as at date of decree
                        <em>nisi</em>). Moreover, I doubted that the
                    husband would have been ready to share equally if he had fully disclosed what he
                    would or was likely to obtain in the near future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I therefore awarded the wife a 25% share of
                    the 11.5 million [G] Commodities shares and the $985,000, leaving undisturbed
                    the earlier agreed division of the other matrimonial assets. With respect to the
                    [G] Commodities shares the husband was to take all steps necessary to transfer
                    25% of the same to the wife’s CDP account, particulars of which were to be
                    notified by the wife’s solicitor to the husband’s.</p>
