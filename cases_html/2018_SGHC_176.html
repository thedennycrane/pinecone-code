He did not “keep it”. He just “left it there”.  As he knew that CNB officers were around, he could not do “anything with it”, but to leave “it by itself”. Jumaat told his friend to “ask his friend” to “come and collect it now”.

Jumaat claimed that during the phone call, which was about four minutes long, Siva did not feign ignorance as to who Ravi was. In fact, Jumaat asked Siva to inform Ravi to come and collect the drugs from him and if Ravi could not come, for Siva to do so himself. According to Jumaat, Siva agreed to this.

The disagreements were over the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Based on the entire facts and circumstances of the case, the Prosecution’s position was that Jumaat placed an order for the drugs with his Malaysian supplier prior to 13 August 2015, and then took delivery of them for the purpose of trafficking the drugs on 13 August 2015. In the course of the transaction, Jumaat paid a sum of $18,500 for the drugs. He also cut open two cabbages which contained the drugs as the drugs were meant for him. In fact, the Prosecution contended that Ravi was a fictional character, and Jumaat intended to <span class="font-italic">sell </span>the drugs for a profit, and not merely to deliver the drugs to Ravi.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Turning to the defence, Jumaat’s position was that he did not know that the drugs were <span class="font-italic">hidden</span> in the cabbages. On the morning of 13 August 2015, he was asked by Siva to assist in the collection of vegetables which were then to be collected by Ravi. He did not know Ravi. He agreed to do so. He had nothing to do with the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500, and he cut open the cabbages because he thought they looked different. It was only then that he realised that the cabbages contained the drugs.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As the key factual disputes were pertinent to all three elements of the charge, I shall analyse the evidence, and then state my findings accordingly. Thereafter, I shall discuss why, in light of my findings on the key factual disputes, I accepted that the three elements of the charge had been established beyond a reasonable doubt against Jumaat. In this connection, I group the key factual disputes into three main areas. First, the parties disagreed over the nature of the arrangements made for the collection on 13 August 2015, and when the arrangements were made. Second, there was a dispute as to whether Jumaat dropped the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 into the Lorry. Third, the parties disagreed as to the reasons why Jumaat proceeded to open up two of the cabbages shortly after collecting them. I shall now deal with each area in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The factual disputes</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arrangements for the collection of the cabbages         </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I turn to the first area of dispute, concerning the arrangements made for the collection of the cabbages. To reiterate, the Prosecution’s position was that Jumaat had placed the order for the drugs prior to the morning of 13 August 2015, and he then collected the drugs on the morning itself. Jumaat claimed that it was a last minute request for help by Siva on the very morning of 13 August 2015, and he thought that he was merely collecting and delivering vegetables only.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Based on the evidence of Hari, on 12 August 2015, Koma had arranged for Hari to deliver cabbages containing “medicine” to a “bald guy” in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. At about 7.00pm on 12 August 2015, Hari collected the cabbages. On the way to Ang Mo Kio on 13 August 2015, Hari simply had to call Koma to ask “the bald guy” to take delivery: see [21] to [23] above. In other words, by the evening of 12 August 2015, the delivery was scheduled to take place, and the recipient was to be a person in Ang Mo Kio. On the morning of 13 August 2015, there was no change in the venue. Nor was there any indication that there was any change in the recipient. Hari simply communicated with Koma to ask the recipient to take delivery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In addition, I noted that from the phone records, Siva had contacted Jumaat on the days prior to the drug transaction, on 10, 11 and 12 August 2015.

</div>
</div>
</div> In particular, on 12 August 2015, there was a call between Siva and Jumaat that took place at 7.47pm. This would have been after Hari had agreed to carry out the delivery, and around the time Hari actually collected the drugs. It should also be highlighted that while Jumaat referred to his contact as Siva, and Hari referred to his contact as Koma, they were both communicating with the user of the Malaysian number. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 To my mind, it was implausible for Siva to call early in the morning at 4.49am, to seek Jumaat’s almost immediate help to collect the items on his behalf. There was every possibility that Jumaat might not have agreed to help. While it might be true that generally, Jumaat would be awake to prepare food for his food stall that time in the morning, he might not be available that morning. As such, if Siva needed Jumaat’s help to collect a consignment from Malaysia, Jumaat’s account was unbelievable in that Siva did not ask for help earlier on the previous days. It would be quite remiss of Siva not to secure the agreement for Jumaat to assist in advance, especially since the details of the drop off were being confirmed by Koma with Hari on 12 August 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Upon consideration, I agreed with the Prosecution that prior to the morning of 13 August 2015, Jumaat had already made certain arrangements for the delivery. There was cogent evidence of planning and coordination prior to 13 August 2015 for the delivery of the cabbages at a specific location to a specific person, and these plans did not change on 13 August 2013. Given the planning and coordination involved, I was of the view that Jumaat knew that the arrangements went beyond merely collecting vegetables and involved collecting the items contained within the vegetables. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Even if I were to be wrong about the timing of the arrangements, and that the arrangements were made with Jumaat only on the morning of 13 August 2015, I remained of the view that Jumaat knew that the arrangements went beyond the mere collection of vegetables. According to Jumaat, it was the first time Siva had requested for his help. This was a collection in the wee hours of the morning, from persons in a Malaysian Lorry (who were unknown to Jumaat), and for further delivery to Ravi (who was also unknown to Jumaat). In cross-examination, Jumaat admitted that he did not know what Siva’s full name was, where he lived or his family. He was not aware that Siva was dealing or selling vegetables.

</div>
</div>
</div> Despite all the above, Jumaat claimed he did not find the request “weird” in any way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In light of the surrounding circumstances, Jumaat’s position that he merely responded to a last minute request for help made by Siva purely to collect vegetables was not credible, and I rejected it. He knew that he was collecting <span class="font-italic">more </span>than just the vegetables. I was fortified in this view by the very clear evidence to show that in carrying out this collection, Jumaat had prepared in advance an amount of $18,500, and had dropped the blue plastic bag with the cash into the Lorry. I shall discuss this shortly. At this juncture, I should highlight that I did not accept the Prosecution’s position that Jumaat had placed the order for the drugs for himself with the intention to sell the drugs to others. This point will be expanded on at [90] and [94].   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The blue plastic bag of cash dropped into the Lorry </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Next, I turn to address the question whether Jumaat dropped the blue plastic bag of cash into the Lorry. Jumaat claimed that he did not do so. He surmised that the cash was from customers of CCL Impex (S) Pte Ltd (“CCL Impex Singapore”) for the vegetables delivered to them by Hari and Mohd Nor. Having evaluated all the evidence, I was unable to accept Jumaat’s denial. These are my reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 To begin with, the CCTV footage showed that when Jumaat left his flat at about 5.39am, there was a blue plastic bag in the front basket of the bicycle. Jumaat stated that his bicycle would be parked along the corridor (outside his flat). However, he claimed that his children would get a plastic bag from the food stall, put their rubbish into the plastic bag and then place the plastic bag in the bicycle, rather than dispose of their rubbish in the flat. This was rather contrived. Furthermore, even if there was such a plastic bag with rubbish, it was surprising that Jumaat did not dispose of it on the fourth floor of Block 506, instead of bringing it down with him to the void deck.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Jumaat also referred to samples of the blue plastic bags seized from the food stall (“D1”, “D3” and D4”), to show that the blue plastic bags in question seized from the Lorry (“F1” and “F1A”) were different from those found at the food stall. While the blue plastic bags were not identical, I found this to be a neutral factor. It seemed to me that the blue plastic bag caught in the CCTV footage was very likely to be the same blue plastic bag which contained the cash of $18,500. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Even if I were to be wrong on this point, the evidence of SSSgt Eng and Sgt Hidayat was that they saw Jumaat holding onto a blue plastic bag when he approached the Lorry at about 6.25am on 13 August 2015. When the Lorry moved off, they noticed that Jumaat was no longer holding on to the blue plastic bag (see [10] above). I saw no reason to doubt the officers’ evidence. They corroborated each other’s evidence, and they candidly admitted that they did not see Jumaat drop the blue plastic bag into the Lorry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Next, I turn to the evidence of Hari and Mohd Nor. Hari testified that after the cabbages were passed to the “bald guy”, the “bald guy” threw a blue plastic bag into the Lorry. Mohd Nor picked up the blue plastic bag and passed it to Vikineswaran who then passed it to Hari. The blue plastic bag was tied. Hari then testified that upon feeling the blue plastic bag, he believed that the blue plastic bag contained money. Mohd Nor’s testimony corroborated Hari’s account (see above at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I pause here to note that while it was an unchallenged fact that Jumaat collected the cabbages from the Lorry, Hari and Mohd Nor testified that they were unable to identify Jumaat as that “bald guy” whom they passed the cabbages to. This showed that the two witnesses had no interest to implicate Jumaat. Further, Mohd Nor only spoke of what he knew. For instance, he did not speak of the phone conversation between Hari and Koma while they were in the Lorry. I found both witnesses to be credible, and I accepted their evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In addition to all of the above, the DNA evidence linked Jumaat inextricably to the sum of $18,500 in the blue plastic bag. To reiterate, Jumaat’s DNA was found on one of the four rubber bands, F1A3, used to secure one bundle of cash found in the blue plastic bag (see above at [20]). Jumaat tried to cast doubt on the forensic evidence by alleging that the exhibits of this case were contaminated. Specifically, he alleged that there was a cross-transfer of Jumaat’s DNA to F1A3 from the properties seized from his person to F1A3, such as the rubber band tying the cash seized from him (see above at [44(b)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Jumaat’s allegation was without merit. The blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 and the rubber band F1A3 were seized from the Lorry which was at a separate location from where Jumaat was arrested and his personal belongings seized (see above at [11] and [17]). The blue plastic bag was seized by SSgt Fardlie (who was wearing gloves), and who placed the items into a polymer bag which was held by and later sealed by SSgt Tay.

</div> It is also important to bear in mind that both officers did not have any physical contact with Jumaat prior to this. On the other hand, Jumaat’s personal belongings were seized and collected by Sgt Hidayat at a different location and at a different time. They were placed into a tamper-proof polymer bag and sealed.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 From the evidence of SSgt Fardlie, SSgt Tay and Sgt Hidayat, and bearing in mind that these items were seized by different CNB officers in different locations and at different times, I accepted that the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 and F1A3 were placed in one tamper-proof polymer bag and sealed and the personal belongings seized from Jumaat were placed in a separate tamper-proof polymer bag and sealed. I found it implausible that exhibits were contaminated such that Jumaat’s DNA could be transferred to F1A3. Having considered the evidence of Insp Nizammudin, I also rejected the contention that there was a transfer of the DNA during the photography process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The fact that Jumaat’s DNA was on F1A3 meant that he had handled the money found in the blue plastic bag recovered from the Lorry. This indicated that initially, Jumaat was in possession of the sum of $18,500, separated into four bundles with each bundle tied up by a rubber band, either from the time he left his flat or at the latest, from the time he left the food stall, Subsequently, he passed the money placed in the blue plastic bag to the persons in the Lorry after he collected the cabbages from them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 At this juncture, I should state that in a contemporaneous statement recorded from Hari on 13 August 2015 at 8.00am by Sergeant Yogaraj s/o Ragunathan Pillay, Hari said that the money in the blue plastic bag was passed to him by the persons he had delivered CCL Impex Malaysia’s vegetables to.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I agreed with the Prosecution that at the point of arrest, Hari knew that the blue plastic bag was a key piece of incriminating evidence against him in relation to the illegal transaction, and he sought to lie about its origin. I did not rely on Hari’s contemporaneous statement on the purpose of the payment. It was clear that the delivery to the “bald guy” arose from Hari’s arrangement with Koma, and had nothing to do with his employment with CCL Impex Malaysia. As stated above, Hari’s evidence was corroborated by Nor’s account. Further, Nor also testified that neither he, Hari nor Vikneswaran had collected any money from the persons they delivered vegetables to on 13 August 2015.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In addition, according to the testimony of the managing director of CCL Impex Malaysia and CCL Impex Singapore, Chua Zhong Sheng, CCL Impex Malaysia would not receive any payment from the parties they delivered vegetables to. CCL Impex Malaysia has only one client, which is CCL Impex Singapore. CCL Impex Singapore would receive orders for vegetables from their Singapore customers and the Singapore customers would make payments directly to CCL Impex Singapore. CCL Impex Singapore would then compile the orders from their customers and place the orders for vegetables with CCL Impex Malaysia which would then deliver the vegetables to CCL Impex Singapore’s clients. As such, CCL Impex Malaysia would not and need not receive any form of payment from CCL Impex Singapore’s customers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 By all of the foregoing, not only did Jumaat know that he was not merely collecting vegetables, he also knew that the eight cabbages he collected had valuable items within them. When he placed the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 inside the Lorry after collecting the eight cabbages, he meant it to be in exchange for the delivery of the items contained within the eight cabbages. The sum of $18,500 is substantial. The handing over of this substantial amount in the course of the transaction completely demolished Jumaat’s claim that he was merely tasked to collect vegetables, and no more.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cutting open the cabbages </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Third, I turn to the act of cutting open the cabbages. Within minutes of collecting the plastic bags containing the cabbages from the Lorry, Jumaat cut open the wrapping of two of the cabbages, and peeled open the leaves. He did enough to ascertain the two cabbages contained a bundle of drugs each. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I agreed with the Prosecution that if Jumaat’s case was true and that he was merely collecting the vegetables for Siva to pass on to Ravi, there was no reason for Jumaat to do so. In his statements and in giving evidence in court, Jumaat explained that he thought the cabbages looked strange or different, and he opened them to check on them. He also tried to explain that this was because the cabbages were packed in a “different” way (as they were wrapped within two layers of plastic rather than in newspaper). He also said that if he did not remove the wrappings, the cabbages would rot and smell.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I found Jumaat’s explanations illogical. If his role was merely to collect the vegetables and later pass them on to Ravi, he could have just called Siva to inform him of how the cabbages were wrapped, and the state of the cabbages. He should also have spoken to Siva to ask for permission to check on the cabbages. After all, Jumaat said the cabbages did not belong to him. Taking the decision to unwrap not just one, but two of the cabbages, and then to peel open the leaves, so as to satisfy his own concerns was not the action of someone whose task was merely to collect vegetables for a friend. On the contrary, Jumaat’s conduct was far more consistent with that of someone expecting items to be in the cabbages, and proceeding to inspect the items contained within. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on conviction  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 With these key factual findings in mind, I turn to deal with the elements of the charge.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Possession of the drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 At the material time, Jumaat was in possession of the cabbages which contained the drugs. This crucial fact was not disputed by Jumaat. As such, s 18(1) of the MDA was triggered, and Jumaat was presumed to be in possession of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In this connection, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng </span><span class="font-italic">Comfort</span>”) at [34] to [35] that once the Prosecution proves that the thing in issue, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the container,<span class="font-italic"> </span>exists and that the accused has possession of the thing in issue, the accused is presumed to possess the drug which is contained in the thing in issue. To rebut the presumption, an accused has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drug in his possession. The most obvious way is to establish “that the accused did not know that the thing in issue contained that which is shown to be the drug in question”. The Court of Appeal highlighted that the inquiry does not, at this stage, extend to the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drug. This was a separate inquiry in relation to the second issue.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As I found above, Jumaat made the arrangements to collect the cabbages, and he dropped the blue plastic bag with the cash in exchange for the cabbages. Thereafter, he cut open two of the cabbages to inspect the items. I had no doubt that he knew that there were valuable items hidden within the cabbages. Accordingly, Jumaat had failed to rebut the presumption of possession of the drugs within s 18(1) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Knowledge of the nature of the drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As Jumaat was presumed to be in possession of the drugs, s 18(2) of the MDA applied, and Jumaat was presumed to know the nature of the drugs in his possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Once again, I turn to <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>, where, at [36] to [37], the Court of Appeal stated that once the presumption of knowledge has been invoked, it is for the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drugs. The Court of Appeal elaborated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 … The court assesses the accused’s evidence as to his subjective knowledge by comparing it with what an ordinary, reasonable person would have known or done if placed in the same situation that the accused was in. If such an ordinary, reasonable person would surely have known or taken steps to establish the nature of the drug in question, the accused would have to adduce evidence to persuade the court that nevertheless he, for reasons special to himself or to his situation, did not have such knowledge or did not take such steps. It would then be for the court to assess the credibility of the accused’s account on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 At the risk of repetition, Jumaat made the arrangements for the collection of the cabbages to take place in the wee hours of the morning, and prepared the hefty sum of $18,500 in exchange. He clearly knew that there would be items of substantial value contained within all the cabbages. Yet, he proceeded to assist with the collection, and took possession of the items.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I should add that Jumaat was not a naïve individual, and well knew the risks of dealing with drugs. He admitted as much in his statements, in the context of explaining that he would not get involved in drug dealings: see [29] and [34] above. In his evidence, again, Jumaat claimed that he had noticed the presence of CNB officers around the food stall before he collected the eight cabbages containing the drugs.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> He went ahead to collect the eight cabbages because he genuinely thought that he was collecting vegetables for Siva instead of drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 On the evidence, I did not accept this claim. If he was aware of the presence of the CNB officers, it was surprising that when he thought that the cabbages were strange or different, he proceeded to cut open the first cabbage. It was even more incredible that after finding heroin in the first cabbage, he continued to cut open the second cabbage. Further, after he found the drugs in the cabbages, Jumaat had every opportunity to inform the CNB officers of the drugs he found in the cabbages. Jumaat did not take any steps to inform them and he kept silent when CNB officers moved into the food stall to arrest him. Given Jumaat’s conduct, I did not think he was aware that the CNB officers were present in the vicinity that morning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In light of all of the above, Jumaat’s assertion that he did not think there was anything more to the task cannot be believed. Given the suspicious surrounding circumstances and his actions, Jumaat had simply failed to discharge his burden to rebut the presumption of knowledge within s 18(2) of the MDA. I should add that it was the Prosecution’s position that based on all the surrounding facts and circumstances, Jumaat had <span class="font-italic">actual </span>knowledge of the nature of the drugs. I did not think it necessary to make any finding on this. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Turning to the last element of the offence, I found that on Jumaat’s own evidence, the drugs were meant to be passed to Ravi. This would fall within “give”, “send” or “deliver” within the meaning of “traffic”. It was therefore clear that Jumaat possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 This was further supported by the sheer quantity of the drugs involved which made it highly unlikely that Jumaat possessed the drugs for personal consumption. To reiterate, the drug exhibits contained not less than 147.98 grams of diamorphine. This was far in excess of the quantity which would trigger the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the MDA, if applicable (at 2 grams) and the quantity which would attract the death penalty (15 grams). Indeed, where the quantity of drugs is large, a court may draw the inference that a recipient intended to traffic in them: <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1979-1980] SLR (R)<span class="font-italic"> </span>710. In any case, Jumaat did not raise the defence of consumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I should, however, state that I did not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the drugs were meant for Jumaat, in that Jumaat intended to <span class="font-italic">sell </span>the drugs for profit. While Jumaat made arrangements for the collection and delivery of the drugs, and handed over a substantial payment in this process, without more, there was simply insufficient basis to find that his purpose was to sell the drugs. In the course of a drug transaction, a person entrusted to collect and deliver the drugs could also be tasked to hand over a payment or to collect a payment. The Prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Jumaat’s purpose was to traffic by selling the drugs. In any case, such a finding was not necessary to establish the third element. I shall, however, revisit this issue again in due course at [94] onwards. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In light of the foregoing, I found that the elements of the charge against Jumaat had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted Jumaat of the charge. In coming to this conclusion, I should state that for reasons including the implausible claim made by Jumaat as to the last minute arrangements regarding the transaction, the illogical reasons proffered as to why he cut open the two cabbages, and the vain attempt to deny that he dropped the blue plastic of cash into the Lorry in the face of incontrovertible evidence, I did not find Jumaat to be a credible witness.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I now turn to my decision on sentence. The prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death. There is an alternative sentencing regime in s 33B of the MDA, allowing the court the discretion to impose a mandatory term of imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane. For a court to have the discretion to impose the alternative sentence, an offender must show that his acts fell within s 33(B)(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv) of the MDA and must also receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. Section 33B(4) of the MDA also provides that the decision to give or withhold such a certificate is at the sole discretion of the Public Prosecutor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In <span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34], the Court of Appeal observed that it is the offender who bears the legal burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in a drug trafficking offence was restricted only to the activities listed under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. Further, at [111], the Court of Appeal remarked that the offender’s reasons for carrying out his acts of trafficking are matters uniquely within his knowledge, and it would be difficult for him to convince a court that he is a courier if he chose not to explain his actions at trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Courier exception </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 For the purpose of conviction, I found that the Prosecution had not proved that Jumaat intended to sell the drugs. For the purpose of sentencing, the Prosecution submitted that Jumaat had not proved on a balance of probabilities that he was merely a courier. Specifically, the Prosecution made two main points against finding Jumaat to be a courier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 First, the Prosecution relied on the field diary extract to show that Ravi was a fictional character made up by Jumaat, and that it was not true that he was simply collecting the drugs for Siva for collection by Ravi. To reiterate, the field diary extract contained the record of the phone call made from Jumaat’s handphone to the Malaysian phone number in the presence of SSSgt Eng, Sgt Hidayat and Sgt Dadly after Jumaat was arrested (see [39] above). The field diary extract showed that when Jumaat asked Siva during this phone call when Ravi was coming to collect the drugs, Siva’s reply was “Who is Ravi?”. Jumaat repeated the same question a number of times during the phone conversation and received the same reply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As set out in [44(c)] above, Jumaat contended that the field diary extract was inaccurate. During the conversation, Siva did not feign ignorance of Ravi. I saw no basis to doubt the contemporaneous entry within the field diary made by SSSgt Eng. There was no reason for Sgt Hidayat not to properly inform SSSgt Eng of the contents of the conversation, and for SSSgt Eng not to record the conversation inaccurately. Further, under cross-examination, Sgt Hidayat and Sgt Dadly both confirmed the gist of the conversation as recorded in the field diary extract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Be that as it may, I placed little weight on the contents of the conversation in assessing whether Jumaat was a courier. Siva coordinated the drug deal. This was a phone call made at 10.42am, almost four hours after the arrests of Jumaat, as well as Hari, Mohd Nor and Vikeswaran. By then, Siva might have appreciated something to be amiss, as he appeared to be concerned about the whereabouts of the three men in the Lorry, and asked Jumaat where they were. I should not speculate. The point to be made is that Siva’s denial of any knowledge of Ravi may be for a number of reasons. Siva’s denial did not detract from the consistency of Jumaat’s evidence that he was to collect the cabbages, and then to pass them on to someone, whether or not the person was actually named Ravi. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Second, the Prosecution also relied on Jumaat dropping the blue plastic bag containing $18,500 into the Lorry as evidence that Jumaat was purchasing the drugs to sell them. I noted that the collection of money by an offender in the course of the delivery of drugs does not usually take someone outside of the courier exception. This may be seen to be “an ordinary occurrence in the course of the handing and taking over of drugs”, and thus <span class="font-italic">incidental </span>to the delivery of drugs. Of course, this would be different if the offender is really <span class="font-italic">selling </span>the drugs: <span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed </span>at [86]. It is always a fact specific inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As stated above, I rejected Jumaat’s contention that the sum of $18,500 formed payment for vegetables by customers of CCL Impex Singapore. Given the nature of the defence, there was no further explanation from Jumaat about the money. Nonetheless, in my view, the handing over of the sum of $18,500 alone remained incidental to the collection and delivery of the drugs. Without more, it did not render Jumaat the actual purchaser of the drugs, and the one who would then <span class="font-italic">sell </span>the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The fact of the matter is that there was no evidence that Jumaat intended to divide, repack or change the drugs in any manner, so as to sell or distribute the drugs. For instance, as contended by Jumaat, no drug paraphernalia was found at his flat or at the food stall. Further, there was no evidence that Jumaat was involved in other acts such as recruiting couriers, sourcing for supplies and or identifying potential customers. Nothing was put before me to indicate that he was someone with a wider and larger role in drug deals or a drug ring, so as to bring him outside the courier exception in relation to this offence in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 At the end of the day, Jumaat had been consistent in his defence that he was collecting the drugs on Siva’s request to pass on to someone else. There was no basis not to accept this position. The passing of cash should be seen to be an <span class="font-italic">incidental </span>act. I accepted Jumaat’s evidence, and found that Jumaat had proved on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Certificate of substantive assistance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 However, for the second requirement, the Public Prosecutor did not issue Jumaat with a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. In light of the foregoing, Jumaat could not avail himself of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA. As such, I passed the mandatory death sentence on him. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lau Wing Yum and Zhuo Wenzhao <br/>(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;<br/>Jason Peter Dendroff (J P Dendroff &amp; Co), Teh Ee-von (Infinitus Law Corporation), Loh Guo Wei Melvin (Continental Law LLP) for the accused.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
