</div> [WDT] replied through KhattarWong on 30 April 2020 saying she had been led to believe that the plaintiff would be applying to court under rule 786 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 and “was expecting service of the application”. She requested once again that the plaintiff make “the necessary application in Court for a determination of the alleged gift”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 There followed further correspondence between KhattarWong and WongPartnership before the present application was filed on 29 September 2021 (HCF/OSP 9/2021, “OSP 9”). According to the plaintiff, it “also received requests from the other beneficiaries” that it apply to “the Family Justice Courts for the Court’s directions in relation to the alleged gift”; and it filed the present application “in order to obtain closure and… to eliminate the uncertainty of an action being brought by [WDT] at some potential in the future [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] against the Estate or against the other beneficiaries after the relevant gifts [had] been distributed in accordance with clause 9 of the Will”.

In the hearing before me, [WDT] sought to rely on the exceptions established in a trio of English authorities – <span class="font-italic">In re Rose; Rose v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [1952] Ch 499 (“<span class="font-italic">Re. Rose</span>”), <span class="font-italic">T </span><span class="font-italic">Choithram International SA &amp; ors v Pagarani &amp; ors</span> [2001] 2 All ER 492 (“<span class="font-italic">Choithram</span>”), and <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span> – for her alleged right to have the sum of US$1.5 million paid to her.  I will deal with each of these authorities in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Re. Rose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The first of the authorities which [WDT] relies on is <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic">. Rose</span>. The exception it establishes to the maxim that equity will not assist a volunteer is pithily summarized by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">BTB &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">anor v BTD</span> [2019] 4 SLR 1289 (“<span class="font-italic">BTB</span>”): namely, that in a case where a settlor has done all that is necessary to transfer title to the donee but the transfer has not happened for reasons outside of his control, equity assumes the equitable interest to be in the donee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Re. Rose</span>, the deceased transferred 10,000 shares in a company to his wife, and a further 10,000 shares to another party, using the forms required by the company’s articles of association which authorised the directors to decline to register any transfer. The transfers were executed on 30 March 1943 and the forms were delivered to the company for registration, but it was only on 30 June 1943 that the transfers were registered in the books of the company. The deceased died on 16 February 1947. The Crown claimed estate duty on the shares on the ground that the gifts of the shares were not completed before 10 April 1943, the date which the parties agreed was the relevant date before which the gifts must have been completed to avoid duty under the combined effect of several statutory provisions. The first-instance court held that duty was not payable on the shares; and on appeal, the English Court of Appeal (“CA”) upheld its decision. The CA held that the deceased had done everything in his power by executing the transfers to transfer to the transferees his legal and beneficial interest in the shares; that accordingly, the transferees had become beneficial owners of the shares; and that between the date of the execution of the transfers and the registrations of the transfers, the deceased could not have asserted any beneficial title by virtue of his position as registered holder.  Having regard to the form and operation of the transfers, the nature of the property transferred and the necessity for registration in order to perfect the legal title, coupled with the discretionary power in the directors to withhold registration, pending registration the deceased was in the position of a trustee of the legal title in the shares for the transferees. In the circumstances, the gifts of the shares were held by the CA to have been completed on 30 March 1943; and on that date, <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> possession and enjoyment of the shares had been assumed by the transferees to the entire exclusion of the deceased of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise. No estate duty therefore became payable in respect of the shares upon the deceased’s death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 At the hearing before me, it was argued on behalf of [WDT] at one stage that by signing the 14 September 2016 letter which contained her “instructions” to her “Bankers and Lawyers”, the Deceased had done all that she “thought” she needed to do.

</div> When pressed, however, counsel for [WDT] conceded that the test was not whether the settlor had done all that she “thought” she needed to do: the principle of the <span class="font-italic">Re. Rose</span> cases actually required that the settlor should have “done all within [her] power to procure the transfer” of the property (<span class="font-italic">per </span>the English CA in <span class="font-italic">Kaye &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">ors v Zeitel &amp; anor</span> [2010] 2 BCLC 1, “<span class="font-italic">Zeitel</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Zeitel</span>, for example, the deceased had delivered to the intended transferee (one Stefka) of a share in a company the pre-signed stock transfer form, but had not delivered to Stefka the share certificate which was required for her to be registered as a member. It was not disputed that the whereabouts of the share certificate were unknown. Nevertheless, the CA held that there were various means by which the deceased could have procured the creation of a duplicate share certificate; that he had not equipped Stefka with the title documentation that she needed in order to be registered as a member of the company “whereas he could have done”; and that unlike the donors in <span class="font-italic">Re. Rose</span>, he “had not, therefore, done all in his own power to transfer to her, or to procure the transfer to her”, of the said share.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 [WDT]’s next argument was that in the present case, the Deceased had “clearly done all that she could” by giving instructions to WongPartnership during the video call on 25 August 2016 about her intention vis-à-vis the US$1.5 million cash gift”.

I say this last item was critical because it is not disputed that up until the time of her death on 16 December 2016, the Deceased had yet to identify the specific bank account (or accounts) from which the funds for the intended US$1.5 million cash gift were to be transferred. Indeed, at the hearing before me, counsel for [WDT] conceded that she had no instructions as to how many bank accounts – or how many US$ bank accounts – the Deceased held prior to her death.

</div> In the absence of instructions from the Deceased as to the specific bank account (or accounts) from which the funds for the US$1.5 million were to come, it would not have been possible for her lawyers and bankers to effect the intended cash gift – even with a signed Deed of Gift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I add that since [B] was the one who brought up the need for instructions to be given to the bank for the funds transfer, and since it is not disputed that [B] was liaising with WongPartnership on the Deceased’s behalf, the Deceased herself must have been aware of the need for instructions to be given to the relevant bank. As [B] noted in her email reply to WongPartnership, this was what had been done “the last time” the Deceased made a cash gift to [WDT].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At certain points in the submissions made on [WDT]’s behalf, the position taken by her counsel appeared to be that it was not necessary for the Deceased to execute a Deed of Gift in order to make the cash gift of US$1.5 million to [WDT] because the 14 September 2016 letter sufficed to make clear her intention to make the cash gift. However, even assuming for the sake of argument that the Deceased’s intention did not need to be expressed in the form of a Deed of Gift, it is still not possible to conclude that by signing the 14 September 2016 letter, she had done “all within her power” to procure the transfer of the US$1.5 million to [WDT]. Firstly, I do not think it can be disputed that the Deceased never took any steps to ensure the 14 September 2016 letter was brought to the attention of her lawyers and / or her bankers: from [B]’s notarised statement,

</div> it appears that the Deceased simply handed over the letter to [B] after signing it, without any further instructions to convey it to WongPartnership – or anyone else, for that matter.

</div>
</div>  I do not see, however, that this remark in any way assists [WDT], especially when one considers the context in which it was made. In <span class="font-italic">Choithram</span>, the donor (“P”) intended to leave much of his wealth to charity by setting up a foundation which would receive most of his assets when he died. To that end, he executed a trust deed setting up the foundation. The deed was expressed to be between P as the settlor and seven persons (including P himself) as the trustee. Upon signing this deed, P made an oral declaration of gift of all his wealth to the foundation.  He also instructed the accountant of his companies to “transfer all [his] wealth with the companies to the Trust”. After P’s death, his first wife and her children brought proceedings against the companies and the trustees in the British Virgin Islands, claiming that the gift to the foundation had been ineffective. They prevailed at first instance and on appeal to the CA of the British Virgin Islands, as it was held that there had been an imperfect gift which could not be enforced against P’s estate. The companies and the trustees appealed to the Privy Council, who allowed their appeal. The Privy Council held that although the words used by P were those “normally appropriate to an outright gift”, in light of the facts of the case, they were “essentially words of gift on trust”.  It must be noted that the in his judgment, Lord Browne-Wilkinson made it clear that the specific facts on which the Privy Council based this construction of P’s words were “novel”. It was in this context that Lord Browne-Wilkinson remarked that “(a)lthough equity will not aid a volunteer, it will not strive officiously to defeat a gift”. Indeed, that remark was followed by the observation that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the words used by [P] are those normally appropriate to an outright gift – ‘I give to X’ – in the present context there is no breach of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Milroy v Lord </span>if the words of [P’s] gift (to the foundation) are given their only possible meaning in this context.  The foundation has no legal existence apart from the trust declared by the foundation and trust deed.  Therefore the words ‘I give to the foundation’ can only mean ‘I give to the trustees of the foundation trust deed to be held by them on the trusts of the foundation trust deed’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span>, Arden LJ noted (at [60]) that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Choithram</span> was an illustration of the manner in which “equity has tempered the wind [of the principle that equity will not assist a volunteer] to the shorn lamb [the done] by applying a benevolent construction to words of gift”. As Arden LJ put it:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A)n imperfect gift is not saved by being treated as a declaration of trust.  But where a court of equity is satisfied that the donor had an intention to make an immediate gift, the court will construe the words which the donor used as words effecting a gift or declaring a trust <span class="font-italic">if they can fairly bear that meaning </span>and otherwise the gift will fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The italicised words (above) are important. Plainly, not every case of an imperfect gift will be capable of being saved by the court construing the words of (apparent) gift as words “declaring a trust”. In the present case, [WDT] has not pointed to any specific words of gift spoken or written by the Deceased which can fairly be construed as words declaring a trust over the amount of US$1.5 million. Most (if not all) of [WDT]’s case has been focused on the 14 September 2016 letter; and there is nothing in the letter which can fairly be said to amount to “words declaring a trust”. Indeed, at one point in her oral submissions, counsel for [WDT] stated that the Deceased “<span class="font-italic">just wanted to give her daughter </span>[WDT]<span class="font-italic"> the money</span>”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Additionally, in <span class="font-italic">Choithram’s</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case, there was evidence identifying the assets which P intended to gift to the foundations as his credit balances with the companies and his shares in the companies (at 497). In fact, he had given instructions to the accountant of the companies to transfer all of his (P’s) balances with the companies and all his shares in the companies to the trustees of the foundation; and prior to his death, the accountant had already altered the entries in the books of one of the companies by deleting P as the creditor and substituting the foundation. In other words, there was no doubt in <span class="font-italic">Choithram’s</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case as to the specific trust property being vested in the body of trustees (or more accurately, in P as one of the trustees of the trust he had established).  This is to be contrasted with the present case, where there is no certainty at all as to the alleged trust property: as pointed out earlier, the Deceased never identified the specific bank account (or accounts) from which the funds for the US$1.5 million were to come.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For the reasons given above, I find that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Choithram</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has no application on the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pennington</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I address next the applicability of the English CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span>. In the written submissions filed on [WDT]’s behalf, <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span> was cited for the proposition that “if [a gift] is made imperfect by a third party, once there is clear evidence of [the donor’s] intention, the gift should be held perfected”. However, counsel did not explain in her submissions which “third party” was alleged to have caused the Deceased’s gift of US$1.5 million to be “made imperfect”. Nor was this made clear in [WDT]’s affidavit evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In any event, counsel did not cite the actual passage(s) in the judgments in <span class="font-italic">Pennington </span>from which she had gleaned the proposition that “if [a gift] is made imperfect by a third party, once there is clear evidence of [the donor’s] intention, the gift should be held perfected”; and with respect, I do not think the decision in <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span> stands for any such proposition at all.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span>, C intended to transfer 400 of her shares in a company to her nephew (H) and to make him a director in the company. To become a director, Harold was required under the company’s articles of association to hold at least one share. C signed a share transfer form and gave it to the company’s auditors, who wrote to H to inform him of the share transfer and asked that he complete a prescribed form of consent (“form 288A”) to act as a director.  H was informed that no further action was required on his part. In fact, the company’s articles of association required certain steps to be followed before the shares could be transferred to H – but these steps were not taken.  Instead, the share transfer form was retained by the company auditors; and neither C nor the auditors (nor H for that matter) took any further action on it prior to C’s death. C died having made a will in which she made specific gifts of the balance of her shareholding but did not refer to the 400 shares. The issue before the court was whether the purported gift of the 400 shares to H amounted to an equitable assignment of the shared to H prior to C’s death, or whether the shares fell into the residue of C’s estate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The first-instance judge held that C had – by executing the share transfer form – effected an equitable assignment of the beneficial interest in the shares.  The appeal by the residuary beneficiaries of C’s estate was dismissed by the English CA which upheld the finding that there had been an equitable assignment to H of the beneficial interest in the shares.  Arden LJ – with whose reasoning Schiemann LJ agreed – pointed out that while there were a number of valid policy objectives behind the rule that equity would not assist a volunteer, there were “countervailing policy considerations which would militate in favour of holding a gift to be completely constituted”. These included preventing the donor from acting in a manner which was unconscionable. In <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span>, Arden LJ proceeded “on the basis that a principle which animates the answer to the question whether an apparently incomplete gift [was] to be treated as completely constituted” was that a donor would “not be permitted to change his or her mind if it would be unconscionable, in the eyes of equity, vis-à-vis the donee to do so” (at [64]). Arden LJ noted that there was “no comprehensive list of factors” which would make it unconscionable for the donor to change his or her mind: it “must depend on the court’s evaluation of all the relevant considerations”. In <span class="font-italic">Pennington</span>, the relevant facts which went towards establishing the element of unconscionability were as follows. C had made the gift of her own free will; C had told H about the gift and signed a form of transfer which she delivered to the company’s auditors for them to secure registration; and a partner in the company’s auditors, acting as C’s agent, had told H he need take no action. Additionally, H had agreed to become a director of the company without limit of time, which he could not do without shares being transferred to him. In Arden LJ’s judgment (at [64]), if C had changed her mind (say) on 10 November 1998 (the date on which she executed her will), the court “could properly have concluded that it was too late for her to do this as by that date [H] signed the form 288A, the last of the events identified above, to occur”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In short, therefore, <span class="font-italic">Pennington </span>establishes the proposition that an apparently imperfect gift can be treated as completely constituted if the circumstances are such that it would be unconscionable for the donor to recall the gift. As counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out, it is clear from the judgments in <span class="font-italic">Pennington </span>that the element of unconscionability in that case arose from H’s knowledge of the intended gift of shares (he was informed of it) - and his reliance on it (he became a director of the company, which he could not have done without the shares being transferred to him). In contrast, in the present case, there is no evidence that prior to the Deceased’s death, [WDT] even knew of the intended gift of US$1.5 million – much less relied on it. [B] was the person who liaised with WongPartnership all along regarding the Deceased’s intention to make the gift; and from [B]’s notarized statement, it would appear that [WDT] only came to know of the intended gift when [B] gave her the 14 September 2016 letter after the Deceased’s death. Indeed, in oral submissions at the hearing, counsel for [WDT] acknowledged that there was no action by the Deceased in this case which could be said to make it unconscionable for her (or the estate) to resile from the intended gift.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It should be added that in <span class="font-italic">Pennington, </span>Arden LJ held that there was a “further basis” on which the appeal could be dismissed. In gist, she was of the view that when the partner in the company’s auditors wrote to H on C’s instructions to inform him of the gift and to tell him there was no action that he needed to take, the words used by the partner “should be construed as meaning that [C] and, through her, [the partner] became agent for [H] for the purpose of submitting the share transfer to the company”. As Arden LJ put it (at [67]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is an application of the principle of benevolent construction to give effect to [C’s] clear wishes. Only in that way could the result “This requires no action on your part” and an effective gift be achieved. [H] did not question this assurance and must be taken to have proceeded to act on the basis that it would be honoured.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I do not think this additional line of reasoning in the judgment is of any assistance to [WDT], since there is no evidence of [B] informing [WDT] about the intended gift prior to the Deceased’s death and / or constituting herself [WDT]’s agent for the purpose of completing the transfer of the US$1.5 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Finally, and perhaps most fundamentally, the Deceased never identified the specific bank account (or accounts) from which the funds for the US$1.5 million were to come. This makes it impossible to say that there was an equitable assignment to [WDT] of the beneficial interest <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">a specific asset</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the reasons given above, I find that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Pennington </span>has no application on the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Donatio mortis causa</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the written submissions filed on behalf of the plaintiff, counsel sought to address potential arguments based on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">donatio</span><span class="font-italic"> mortis causa </span>and that of proprietary estoppel, which – as it turned out – [WDT] elected not to pursue. In the interests of completeness, I should make it clear that I did consider the plaintiff’s submissions and agreed with counsel that neither doctrine was of any aid to [WDT].     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For a valid <span class="font-italic">donatio</span><span class="font-italic"> mortis causa</span> to arise, there are three requirements in law which must be fulfilled (<span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng v Ho Yee Fong</span> [2011] 3 SLR 125 at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a gift must have been made in contemplation of impending death.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">gift must have been made upon the condition that it is to be absolute and complete only on the donor’s death. The condition need not be express and will normally be implied from the fact that the gift was made when the donor was ill.</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Third, there must have been delivery of the subject matter of the gift, or of something representing it, which the donee accepts. When the donor delivers the property, he must intend to part with dominion over it, rather than with mere physical possession.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 All three requirements were not made out in the present case. First, the gift was not made in contemplation of the Deceased’s impending death, as the Deceased herself stated in her 14 September 2016 letter that she wanted to make this gift as an expression of gratitude for [WDT]’s love and the care shown towards her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, from [B]’s description in her notarized statement of the Deceased’s communications with her, it was clear that the Deceased intended the cash gift to take effect while she was still alive: it was not meant to be “absolute and complete” only upon her death. According to [B], the Deceased asked her on 7 September 2016 whether [WDT] had received the US$1.5 million yet; and when she was told that the money had not been given yet, she “urged” [B] to “help her gift the sum of US$1.5 million as soon as possible”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Third, there was no “delivery of the subject matter of the gift, or of something representing it”, which [WDT] accepted. In <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng</span>, the presence of delivery was established through the execution of a formal transfer of the property which was then sent for registration (at [15]). In <span class="font-italic">Sen v Headley </span>[1999] 2 WLR 1308, the house was held to have been transferred to the plaintiff by way of <span class="font-italic">donatio</span><span class="font-italic"> causa mortis</span> as the deceased had told the plaintiff when she visited the deceased in hospital three days before his death, that the house was hers and that the key to a steel box containing deeds to the house were in her bag (at 1311). In contrast, in the present case there was no transfer of the sum of US$1.5 million or any part of it – nor was [WDT] given anything representing the gift (for example, completed documentation for the transfer of funds). In fact, [WDT] could not have accepted any delivery of the US$1.5 million Gift as she remained in the dark about the Deceased’s intention to make the Gift until after the latter’s death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proprietary estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As for proprietary estoppel, this is usually the remedy resorted to in cases where the representations relied on relate to the acquisition by the representee of an immediate – or more or less immediate – interest in the property in question. In such cases, “the representor is estopped from denying that the representee has the proprietary interest that was promised by the representation in question”: <span class="font-italic">Thorner</span><span class="font-italic"> v Major </span>[2009] 1 WLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Thorner</span><span class="font-italic"> v Major</span>”) at [20]. There are three elements which must be established for proprietary estoppel to be made out: <span class="font-italic">Thorner</span><span class="font-italic"> v Major </span>at [29]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A representation or assurance made to the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Reliance on it by the claimant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Detriment to the claimant in consequence of his (reasonable) reliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 On the first element alone, it is clear that the doctrine of proprietary estoppel cannot apply in the present case: it is undisputed that [WDT] received no representation or assurance that the Deceased intended to make the US$1.5 million Gift to her.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the interests of completeness, I will add that even assuming for the sake of argument that a representation had been made, the second element of reliance by [WDT] would also not be established.

She only came to know of the 14 September 2016 letter when [B] gave it to her after the Deceased’s death. There was no question, therefore, of [WDT] relying on any representation or assurance about the US$1.5 million Gift: all that [WDT] did for her mother was done independently of any thought of or reliance on recompense or reward. Since there was no reliance, there also could not be any question of consequential detriment (the third element). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On prayers 1 and 2 of OSP 9</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the reasons given above, I am satisfied that [WDT] does not have a valid claim against the Deceased’s estate for the sum of US$1.5 million to be paid to her prior to the distribution of the estate. I therefore grant an order in terms of prayers 1 and 2 of OSP 9.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On prayer 3 of OSP 9 and on [WDT]’s claim for “legal costs incurred by her since March 2018”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In prayer 3 of OSP 9, the plaintiff has asked for the costs it incurred in respect of this application to be paid out of the estate in priority to the interests of the beneficiaries under the Will. Prior to the filing of OSP 9, the other three beneficiaries of the Will – who are [WDT]’s siblings – had already indicated their consent to the costs of the application being borne by the estate.  [WDT]’s position on this issue appears to be somewhat more equivocal. She does not appear to have signed the same consent form that the other three beneficiaries did, but at the same time she has not presented any coherent arguments as to why the plaintiff’s costs should not be paid out of the estate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I do not think it can be doubted that OSP 9 was brought in order that a “question… which [had] arisen in the administration of the trusts” could be determined (<span class="font-italic">In re Buckton; Buckton v Buckton</span> [1907] 2 Ch 406, “<span class="font-italic">Buckton</span>”, at 414): given [WDT]’s insistence on payment of the US$1.5 million, the plaintiff needed certainty as to whether this alleged gift of US$1.5 million constituted a debt or a liability of the estate which had to be paid before the distribution of the estate. In the circumstances, I regard the plaintiff’s costs as “necessarily incurred for the benefit of the estate” and grant an order in terms of prayer 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">Buckton</span>, Kekewich J held that where the trustees of a will or settlement “ask the Court to construe the instrument of trust for their guidance, and in order to ascertain the interests of the beneficiaries, or else ask to have some question determined which has arisen in the administration of the trusts”, the “costs of all parties” should be regarded as “necessarily incurred for the benefit of the estate”: in <span class="font-italic">Buckton</span>, Kekewich J ordered the costs of all parties to the application in that case to be taxed as between solicitor and client and paid out of the estate. Kekewich J also held that there could be cases where – for reasons of convenience – the application was made by some of the beneficiaries instead of the trustees, but the application was similarly “necessary for the administration of the trust”: he regarded this second class of cases as differing in form but not in substance from the first, and held that in such cases, the costs of all parties would also be “necessarily incurred for the benefit of the estate regarded as a whole”. There was, however, a “third class of cases differing in form and substance from the first, and in substance, though not in form, from the second” (<span class="font-italic">pe</span><span class="font-italic">r </span>Kekewich J at 414):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this class the application is made by a beneficiary who makes a claim adverse to other beneficiaries, and really takes advantage of the convenient procedure by originating summons to get a question determined which, but for this procedure, would be the subject of an action commenced by writ, and would strictly fall within the description of litigation.  It is often difficult to discriminate between cases of the second and third classes, but when once convinced that I am determining rights between adverse litigants I apply the rule which ought, I think, to be rigidly enforced in adverse litigation, and order the unsuccessful party to pay the costs.  Whether he ought to be ordered to pay the costs of the trustees who are, of course, respondents, or not, is sometimes open to question, but with this possible exception the unsuccessful party bears the costs of all whom he has brought before the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The plaintiff contended that [WDT] was not entitled to have her costs of OSP 9 paid out from the estate because she had essentially taken an adverse interest against the estate for her own benefit: according to the plaintiff, [WDT]’s position was no different from  the third class of cases described by Kekewich J in <span class="font-italic">Bu</span><span class="font-italic">ckton</span>; and the court should “regard this form of cases as adverse litigation and follow the usual costs framework for civil cases”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I agree with the plaintiff’s characterisation of [WDT]’s position in the present application. Her claim for payment of the US$1.5 million was made in her capacity as an alleged creditor of the estate; and it was certainly a claim which was adverse to the other beneficiaries, since she was asking that the amount of US$1.5 million be paid to her before any distribution of the estate to the beneficiaries could take place. But for the plaintiff’s filing of OSP 9, [WDT]’s claim “would be the subject of an action commenced by writ, and would strictly fall within the description of litigation” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Kekewich J at 415 of <span class="font-italic">Bu</span><span class="font-italic">ckton</span>). As it was, following the plaintiff’s filing of OSP 9, [WDT] continued to pursue in these proceedings her claim to be paid the sum of US$1.5 million prior to any distribution of the estate. I do not find it possible to say, in these circumstances, that [WDT]’s costs in OSP 9 were ““necessarily incurred for the benefit of the estate regarded as a whole” or that her costs should fall on the estate and thus the beneficiaries as a whole.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Given the plaintiff’s submissions and given the view I take of [WDT]’s position in these proceedings, it would seem to follow that she should be ordered to pay the costs of this application now that she has failed in her claim to be paid the US$1.5 million ahead of any distribution of the estate. Somewhat surprisingly, however, despite arguing that [WDT] should be subject to “the usual costs framework applicable for civil cases”, the plaintiff has not sought an order for [WDT] to pay its costs, but has simply submitted that she should not be entitled to have her costs paid by the estate. Since the plaintiff is not seeking costs from [WDT] personally, I will not make such an order. I order instead that [WDT] is to bear her own costs of OSP 9.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I note that [WDT] has actually asked not only for her costs in OSP 9 but “for legal costs incurred by [her] since March 2018”, on the basis that these legal costs were incurred by her in “trying to get the Plaintiff to make this Application”.

</div> it appears that she believes it is the plaintiff who should pay her costs. Counsel’s submissions did not elaborate on the legal basis for saying that the plaintiff should pay the legal costs incurred by [WDT] since March 2018; and I am unable to think of any plausible basis.

</div> it appears that her real complaint is that the plaintiff demonstrated “bad faith” in “reneging” on its “offer” on 27 May 2019 to make the application to court, and that the plaintiff’s conduct in “reneging” on its “offer” caused her to incur “extensive legal costs” over the next “2.5 years” to “bring the plaintiff back to today’s court application”. If this is indeed [WDT]’s real complaint, however, then her claim for the recovery of monies spent on legal costs in the last “2.5 years” is really a claim for damages arising from some alleged breach by the plaintiff. I add that I use the term “breach” in a very loose sense because it is not at all clear from [WDT]’s affidavit – nor from her counsel’s submissions – what rights of hers the plaintiff is supposed to have infringed or what obligations it is alleged to have disregarded. In any event, it is not permissible for [WDT] to circumvent the processes established by law for the pursuit of civil claims by seeking an order in OSP 9 for the payment of her legal costs for the last “2.5 years”. I decline to make any such costs order in her favour.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wah Hsien-Wen, Terence and Mok Zi Cong (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Spring (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
