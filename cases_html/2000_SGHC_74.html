<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>GROUNDS

OF JUDGMENT</strong></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1 In this action, the plaintiffs who were employed by the

defendants as sub-contractors to carry out rectification works and supply the materials as

required in respect of Hilltop Apartments, Singapore claimed the sum of $385,008.32 being

the balance due for work done and materials supplied. In response, the defendants denied

owing any sum to the plaintiffs and counter-claimed the sum of $400,637.53 against the

plaintiffs. This was the balance of what the defendants in their amended Defence and

Counterclaim loosely described as "back charges" (as to which I will revert

later). 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 At the conclusion of the trial I decided that the plaintiffs had

proved their claims of $340,008.32 but not the claim for "Preliminaries" of

$45,000.00. Of the so-called "back charges", the plaintiffs admitted that

$52,037.20 were due and payable to the defendants for the work done and materials supplied

by the plaintiffs which the plaintiffs had done and supplied for them and these were

identified as those items which were the subject-matters of 5 invoices. The invoice

numbers were identified as CS/059/0197, CS/009/0197, CS/005/0157, CS/030/0397 and

CS/015/0397. Accordingly, on the third day of the trial, I entered "judgment for the

defendants for $52,037.20 in extinguishment of the [claims under] the 5 invoices <b>as

parties have agreed" </b>(words within square brackets and emphasis added). As this

admitted amount was a liquidated sum, it was a compensating debt and the defendants were

allowed by me to set-off this debt from his debt of $340,008.32 which I found due and

payable by them to the plaintiffs. They were mutual debts which I had determined and they

mutually cancelled each other out in respect of each party’ respective causes of

action: see <i>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd v Torie Construction Pte Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 884</nobr>. Accordingly, judgement was entered for the plaintiffs in the reduced sum

of $287,971.12. As the plaintiffs had failed in their claims for Preliminaries, which

should not have taken the time it did and for other reasons which I will deal with later,

I awarded to them 80% of the costs. However, the defendants were ordered to pay to the

plaintiffs interest at 6% on the sum of $287,971.12 from the date of writ up to payment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 Instead of dismissing the defendants’ counterclaims which they

defectively described in their Defence and Counterclaim as "back-charges", I

only struck them out for the reasons which will be set out later. In announcing my

decisions, I took pains to state to the parties that the defendants were at liberty to

institute fresh proceedings to claim for labour and materials allegedly supplied by them

to complete the rectification works as set out in the affidavit in chief filed on behalf

of the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 On 17 February 2000 the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal against

the orders I made. I now set out the history and nature of the pleadings, the facts which

emerged and the reasons which led to the orders made.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p>The claim</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The plaintiffs filed the writ on 2 September 1998 and they claimed

against the defendants the sum of $385,008.32 for work done and materials supplied under

the sub-contract. The final contract sum was stated to be $757,605.22 inclusive of GST.

The previous payments of $372,596.22 was deducted. The claim was the balance. The

defendants filed their Defence and Counterclaim on 7 September 1999. Para 2 of the Defence

and Counterclaim averred, quite defectively, that "the true accounts between the

plaintiffs and the defendants" were as follows:</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The defendants explained that the amendments which reduced their

claims came about as a result of their settlement with their employers and owners of the

apartments. The defendants’ claim for liquidated damages which was not pleaded in

their Defence &amp; Counterclaim, but which was claimed in the affidavit of Tan Chye Seng

filed on their behalf was withdrawn. As the application was not opposed, I granted the

application to amend.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 As expected, plaintiffs’ counsel applied to strike out various

paragraphs of the affidavit evidence in chief of both Tan Chye Seng and S R Sivakumar

which were filed on behalf of the defendants. They were all set out in the

plaintiffs’ submissions on this preliminary issue. I need not repeat them. They all

relate to what has been defectively and ambiguously described as "Back Charges"

in the sum of $348,238.57 plus GST. It was a much reduced figure compared to the original

claim of "Contra Charges" of $657,641.08. The constituent items, as elaborated

in the two affidavits in question, were in substance claims for special damages. The

amounts were quantified. But the causes of action and the material particulars were not

pleaded at all. There was no averment that there was a breach of the material terms of the

sub-contract. The alleged defective works, both in terms of nature and extent, were not

identified. According to counsel for the defendants, the defendants had to compensate

owners of the apartments in Hilltop Apartments and part of the "Back charges"

was made up of the compensation which the defendants alleged by way of affidavit evidence

they had to pay to the owners of the apartments. All these different claims were

unhelpfully compressed under the master item described as "Back Charges".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 It is a settled rule of procedure under O18 r. 7 of the Rules of

Court that "every pleading must contain, and contain only, a statement in summary

form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim…":

see <i>Banner Investments Pte Ltd v Hoe Seng Metal Fabrication &amp; Engineers (S) Pte Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 461</nobr>. Plainly, the verbal shorthand "Back charges" did not disclose

any cause of action and ran foul of the rule. It is also settled rule of procedure that I

could not hear any evidence led in any affidavit evidence in chief and proceed to make

material findings on matters not pleaded: see <i>United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd v

Masagoes</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 766</nobr>. The plaintiffs’ application to strike out the

paragraphs in the two affidavits was allowed with cost. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 After striking out the paragraphs because the causes of action were

not pleaded or because they were special damages and were not pleaded, I had two courses

open to me: either to dismiss the counterclaim or to strike it out with liberty to the

defendants to institute fresh proceedings. I decided on the latter course, having regard

to all the circumstances. In the preceding interlocutory proceedings between them, the

defendants had deposed to the nature of their counterclaims. The defendants had attempted

to answer them in those proceedings. On the first day of the trial, plaintiffs’

counsel in fact told me that he was "prepared to meet the defendants’

counterclaims for materials and labour allegedly supplied". But he indicated that he

was not in a position to meet any other claims such as for special damages or for the

price of materials supplied as a result of the alleged breaches of the sub-contract by the

plaintiffs. He did not have the causes of action and the particulars. He did not apply for

an order to dismiss the counterclaims which were described vaguely as "Back

Charges" and did not take up the point about striking out the relevant paragraphs in

question on the ground that they had not been pleaded. Instead parties wanted to negotiate

and settle their disputes over this project as well as those involving another project at

the Sinsov Building.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 The plaintiffs took the further step of negotiating and agreeing

with the defendants that they would accept liability and quantum over the five invoices

mentioned above but they disputed the rest. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 It is true that all issues between the parties to a piece of

litigation should be disposed off and in principle it is wrong to truncate a trial and

have parts of what are actually one transaction, broadly speaking, tried by more than one

action. Hence the res judicata rule that a judgment after a trial settles the issues and

all other issues which would to have been raised, tried and adjudicated upon. I was

prepared to depart from this general rule because of the conduct of the plaintiffs who

had, in a sense, led the defendants on with the not unreasonable expectation that they

would defend the counterclaim, having in substance known what they were, although they

were not pleaded. I was not willing to allow a further amendment by the defendants to

elaborate on and plead the "Back Charges" according to the usual rules of

pleadings because (1) the documents and the affidavits were not organised; and (2) there

were no particulars of the special damages. An adjournment would have been one way to get

the case ready for continued trial. But in my judgment, it was far neater for the

defendants to institute fresh proceedings on the counterclaim and it was only responsible

on my part to deal with the claims. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 I now turn to my rejection of the plaintiffs’ claim of $45,000

under Bill 1 for "Preliminaries and General." In the plaintiffs’ offer of

30 May 1996 which appeared in the FINAL SUMMARY, they added by words in handwriting the

following: "(For Supervision Costs only)" for which they put down the figure of

$82,500.00. The defendants’ award contained the FINAL SUMMARY which had the item

"PRELIMINARY AND GENERAL" and the amount put against it was $45,000.00. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 I concluded that the plaintiffs’ earlier and limited meaning

ascribed to this item, which in this business usually covers a contractor’s site

office, site staff, own tools and machinery and transport of workers, was never at any

time accepted by the defendants. Their award, which was accepted by the plaintiffs who

proceeded with the works on the basis of the award, must therefore in this respect carry

the usual meaning. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 It was also contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that the

defendants did not object to the plaintiffs’ definition of what constituted

"preliminaries and general". That was in one sense true as a matter of fact. But

that was beside the point. The defendants did not accept the definition by repeating them.

As the words were omitted, that expression must be taken as referring to the ordinary

preliminary and general items in any building contract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 In fact, in an earlier affidavit affirmed by Eng Meng Chor on 27

October 1998 he deposed under para 14.4(4) that the preliminaries of $45,000.00 were for

"transporting of workers, own tools and machinery, site office and site staff".

The claim of the plaintiffs was based on the provision of two site supervisors (one of

whom included Mr Eng himself) who kept an eye on the work of the plaintiffs’

sub-contractors. No evidence was led by the plaintiffs regarding transport of workers,

provision of own tools and machinery, site office (of which there was none provided in

fact) and site staff. The plaintiffs’ claim therefore was not proved. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 As there is no appeal against my decision allowing the claims of the

plaintiffs, I need only say that it was refreshing to hear the defendants’ witnesses

honestly admitting the claims of the plaintiffs.</p>
