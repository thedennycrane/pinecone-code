<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case highlights the
                    problems that arise when phone conversations between a
                    bank’s relationship manager and a client, during which
                    the client may instruct the relationship manager to make
                    investments on his behalf, are not recorded. The main issue
                    is whether an investor instructed his relationship manager
                    to purchase financial products known as accumulators on his
                    behalf, thereby making him liable to make payments
                    associated with these accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Crédit
                    Industriel et Commercial (“CIC”), is a French
                    bank registered as a foreign company in Singapore, and it
                    carries on a private banking business in
                        Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant, Mr Teo Wai
                    Cheong (“Teo”), is a former private banking
                    client of CIC. Teo’s relationship manager at CIC was
                    one Ms Ng Su Ming (“Ng”). Ng had also been
                    Teo’s relationship manager at Citibank from 2004 to
                    2006. When Ng left Citibank for CIC in 2006, she persuaded
                    Teo to open a private banking account with CIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the course of opening a
                    private banking account with CIC, Teo signed three standard
                    form contracts with CIC. These formed the overarching
                    contractual documents governing the relationship between CIC
                    and Teo.</p>

                    CIC’s Account Opening and Custodian Agreement (Natural

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The portions in the Risk
                    Disclosure Statement which are relevant to this suit are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Introduction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To all clients intending to undertake financial
                        transactions ... with [the Bank].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The intention of this statement is to draw your
                        attention to the fact that there is some degree of
                        financial risk associated with the financial
                        transactions mentioned above. You should be prepared to
                        carry the burden of these and all other risks and the
                        Bank will not be responsible for any losses arising from
                        your transactions unless the same is caused by the
                        Bank’s wilful misconduct. Accordingly, before
                        deciding whether to transact you must understand the
                        nature, terms and conditions and risks associated with
                        the transactions and consider whether such trading is
                        suitable for you in light of your financial condition
                        and investment objectives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In particular, you should make such enquiries, take
                        such care and consult such professional advisers, as
                        would be the case had you traded and/or entered into the
                        transactions without the assistance of the Bank. You
                        should make your own appraisal of or investigation of
                        the advantages, disadvantages and risks of a particular
                        transaction and should not rely solely on the Bank to
                        advise you of the same, and the Bank shall not be
                        obliged at any time to provide such advice. If you are
                        in doubt or do not fully understand a transaction, you
                        should refrain from entering into it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Paragraph 8
                        titled “Margin Trading”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You should be aware that you may sustain a total loss
                        of the initial margin and any additional funds that you
                        deposit with the Bank to maintain a position. If the
                        market moves against you, you may be called upon to pay
                        substantial additional margin at short notice to
                        maintain the position. If you fail to do so, your
                        position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be
                        liable for any resulting deficit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The high degree of leverage due to the small margin
                        requirement that is often obtained in currency, options
                        and futures trading can work against you as well as for
                        you. The use of leverage can lead to large losses as
                        well as large gains. Losses may exceed the amount of
                        margin deposited by you with the Bank and you will be
                        liable to the Bank for any shortfall between the margin
                        deposited and the loss occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Paragraph 16
                        titled “Further Risks”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bank highly recommends that you consult your
                        lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, brokers and other
                        professional advisers before making such investment.
                        Accordingly, if you enter into transactions with the
                        Bank, the Bank will assume that you understand and
                        accept the characteristics and risks associated with
                        such transactions.</p>

                        will indemnify the Bank against any loss or liability

                    Claim (Amendment No. 3),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    while keeping in mind that the precise features of any given
                    accumulator will vary according to the terms of the contract
                    by which it is established:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Briefly, the Accumulator is a structured financial
                        product where:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    A client (i.e., the Defendant)
                            agrees to purchase a certain pre-determined quantity
                            of shares of a particular listed company at a
                            pre-determined price (usually called the
                                “<b>Forward
                                </b><b>Price</b>” or the “<b>Strike </b><b>Price</b>”) which is below the
                            market price on the day the Accumulator is
                            contracted (the “<b>Initial
                                </b><b>Price</b>”). The client thus has the
                            opportunity to purchase shares of a particular
                            listed company at a discounted price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    The Accumulator has an early
                            termination feature which is called the
                            “knock-out”. This occurs when the
                            market price of the share counter reaches or exceeds
                            the “knock-out” price at any time
                                (“<b>knocked</b>-<b>out</b>”). A knock-out price is
                            set at a level above the Initial
                        Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    Where the Accumulator provides
                            for a guarantee purchase, a client is obliged to
                            purchase a pre-determined quantity of shares at the
                            Forward Price irrespective of the market price of
                            the shares (the “<b>Guaranteed </b><b>Purchase</b>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d.    At the end of each
                            pre-determined observation period (which could be
                            daily, weekly or monthly), if the market price of
                            the share counter closes at or above the Forward
                            Price, the client is obliged under the Accumulator
                            to accumulate a pre-determined quantity of shares at
                            the Forward Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">e.    However, in the event that the
                            market price of the share falls below the Forward
                            Price, the purchaser is then obliged to accumulate
                            double of the pre-determined quantity of shares at
                            the Forward Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">f.    The Accumulator would continue
                            for a pre-determined number of scheduled observation
                            periods (usually one year) unless the Accumulator is
                            terminated or knocked-out prior to its
                            maturity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">g.    In the event that the
                            Accumulator is not knocked-out and continues for its
                            full term (usually one year), the maximum amount
                            that the purchaser is liable under the Accumulator
                            is the cost of purchasing double of the
                            pre-determined quantity of shares for each scheduled
                            observation period at the Forward Price and any
                            Guaranteed Purchase (the “<b>Maximum </b><b>Obligation</b>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">h.    The client also has the option
                            under the Accumulator to terminate the Accumulator
                            prior to its maturity or before it is knocked-out.
                            This would enable the client to manage any loss
                            incurred under the Accumulator.</p>

                    through Ng is as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Ng would
                        call CIC’s Private Banking Advisory department
                        (“PBA”) to obtain the current market price
                        of a particular share counter and the indicative forward
                        and knock-out prices of the related
                    accumulator;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, Ng would (i) convey to Teo
                        the recommendations of research analysts on the share
                        counter and the indicative forward and knock-out prices
                        of the related accumulator; and (ii) obtain Teo’s
                        instructions on the range of the indicative initial,
                        forward and knock-out prices and the approximate range
                        of the maximum obligation within which Teo was willing
                        to purchase the accumulator (it is noted that Teo
                        disputes (b)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, Ng would
                        repeat (b) in relation to her other
                    clients;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, Ng would contact PBA to place
                        either (i) a consolidated order for an accumulator
                        on the share counter at certain initial, strike and
                        knock-out prices; or (ii) several orders for
                        several accumulators on the same share counter at
                        different initial, strike and knock-out
                    prices;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, PBA would place Ng’s
                        order(s) with CIC’s counterparties, such as DBS
                        Bank and Goldman Sachs, and then inform Ng if and when
                        the order(s) has been filled;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, Ng would
                        allocate to each client his proportion of the
                        accumulator(s) in accordance with his instructions, and
                        Ng’s Client Support Officer would record the
                        allocation in CIC’s system; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_g"></a>(g)     Seventh, CIC would
                        send confirmation notes and term sheets detailing the
                        terms of the accumulators purchased by its clients to
                        their residential addresses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This
                    process results in two sets of contracts. The first set is
                    formed when CIC enters into accumulator transactions with
                    other banks and the second set is formed when CIC
                    subsequently enters into accumulator transactions with its
                    clients. Under the first set of contracts, CIC’s
                    counterparties are obliged to deliver shares to CIC in
                    return for payment. Under the second set of contracts, CIC
                    is obliged to deliver shares to its clients, who are obliged
                    to pay for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Between 20 July 2007
                    and 3 October 2007, twenty equity accumulators were
                    purchased under Teo’s CIC account. These transactions
                    are listed in the table below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The subject matter of this
                    suit is the last five CE accumulators, <em>i.e.</em> entry numbers 15 to 19 in the Table of
                    Accumulators. These will be referred to individually as the
                    Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh CE Accumulators
                    respectively (given that the First and Second CE
                    Accumulators, being the non-disputed accumulators at entry
                    numbers 12 and 14 respectively in the Table of Accumulators,
                    were established earlier) or collectively as the
                    “Disputed Accumulators”. In this case, CIC
                    claimed that Teo instructed Ng to purchase the Disputed
                    Accumulators on his behalf, whereas Teo denied this. Apart
                    from this central dispute, CIC and Teo also presented two
                    very different versions of events. I will first set out
                    their respective cases before I make findings on what, on a
                    balance of probabilities, had transpired between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I now set out CIC’s

                    Teo’s instructions, that is, within the range of the

<p class="Judg-1">After
                    the set-off, the total outstanding amount due from Teo to
                    CIC was S$6,408,196.77 (S$8,193,773.33 minus
                    S$1,785,576.56).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As Teo had insufficient
                    funds in his account and failed to pay the total outstanding
                    amount of S$6,408,196.77, CIC extended various loans to Teo
                    to cover this sum, which CIC had paid to its counterparties.
                    On 27 May 2009, CIC issued a conclusive certificate of
                    indebtedness pursuant to clause 1 of the Banking Facility
                    Letter certifying that the total amount due from Teo to CIC
                    as of 29 August 2008 was S$6,459,519.83, being the sum
                    of the principal (S$6,408,196.77) and the total interest
                    accrued (S$51,323.06). Thereafter, CIC instituted the
                    present suit to claim this amount from Teo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Apart from arguing that
                    Teo had in fact authorised the purchase of the Disputed
                    Accumulators, CIC raised an alternative argument that Teo
                    was estopped from denying that he authorised the purchase
                    because he did not raise any issue about these accumulators
                    until around 20 November 2007, despite having received
                    the term sheets, confirmation notes and statements of
                    account detailing the terms of the accumulators at around
                    16 October 2007. Even at the 20 November 2007
                    meeting, Teo did not deny that CIC had entered into the
                    Disputed Accumulators pursuant to his instructions.
                    Teo’s silence and inaction, CIC argued, induced CIC to
                    believe that the Disputed Accumulators were authorised by
                    him and led CIC to continue paying for the CE shares
                    delivered under the terms of the Disputed Accumulators.
                    Further, at CIC’s request, Teo remitted additional
                    funds for the purchase of CE shares under the Disputed
                    Accumulators thereby affirming his obligations under the
                    Disputed Accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Teo’s case was that

                    claimed that Ng had not obtained instructions from him on

                    or the approximate maximum obligation in respect of the

                        11 October 2007, Ng telephoned Teo to request for
                        funds to enlarge his account but did not mention the
                        Disputed Accumulators and the Sembcorp

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 16 October
                        2007, Ng contacted Teo and requested Teo to place more
                        funds with CIC for accumulator transactions. When
                        queried, Ng revealed that she had entered into the
                        Disputed Accumulators and the Sembcorp Accumulator for
                        Teo, and that the maximum exposure under these
                        transactions was about S$9 million. Teo was shocked and
                        told Ng that she had no authority to enter into these
                        transactions. He informed Ng that he was not going to
                        accept these transactions and instructed her not to
                        enter into further accumulator transactions on his
                            behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     On 18 October
                        2007, Ng contacted Teo and informed him that the
                        Sembcorp Accumulator had been knocked out. At Ng’s
                        request, Teo agreed to accept the Sembcorp Accumulator
                        transaction. Ng then informed Teo that the maximum
                        exposure for the Disputed Accumulators was 13,500 shares
                        per day and requested that Teo accept the transactions
                        but Teo refused to do so. Teo then requested Ng to
                        furnish him with a breakdown on all previous
                        accumulators done under his account. At Ng’s
                        request, Teo agreed to give her a month to resolve the
                        issue of the Disputed Accumulators with her superiors.
                        Thereafter, Teo waited for Ng’s reply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     On 5 November
                        2007, Ng requested for a sum of S$160,000 to pay for the
                        First CE Accumulator, the Second CE Accumulator and the
                        Sembcorp Accumulator. Teo complied and issued a cheque
                        for the said sum to CIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     On
                        13 November 2007, Ng informed Teo that her
                        superiors had lectured her and wanted her to persuade
                        Teo to reassign the accumulators to his other investment
                        account, mortgage his house or transfer more funds from
                        his Citibank account. Teo refused to accept the Disputed
                        Accumulators transactions and maintained that they were
                        unauthorised (<em>i.e.</em> he
                        never gave Ng any instructions to enter into the
                        Disputed Accumulator transactions and Ng basically went
                        on a frolic of her own to purchase those Disputed
                        Accumulators without his knowledge.) On the same day, Ng
                        sent an e-mail to Teo, attempting to persuade Teo to
                        accept the Disputed Accumulators by attaching a Merrill
                        Lynch Report on CE.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_f"></a>(f)     On
                        15 November 2007, Ng telephoned Teo and made a
                        further attempt to persuade him to accept the Disputed
                        Accumulator transactions. Teo refused and reminded Ng to
                        produce a detailed breakdown on all previous
                        accumulators done under his account. In view of the
                        declining stock market and with a view to terminating
                        his dealings with CIC, Teo also instructed Ng to sell
                        the CE shares accumulated under the First and Second CE
                        Accumulators as well as his Neptune Orient Line shares.
                        Ng also sent an e-mail to Teo, attaching further
                        information on CE and Teo replied via e-mail that the
                        attachment was old news. Teo also stated that the
                        investment was risky and “banging so hard on a
                        company like CE was something I will never
                            do.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>

                        19 November 2007, Ng contacted Teo and revealed for
                        the first time that the number of shares to be
                        accumulated would double if the market price of the
                        share were to fall below the discounted price, and hence
                        Teo had to accumulate 27,000 shares per day under the
                        Disputed Accumulators. Ng informed Teo that CIC had
                        insisted that Teo accept the Disputed Accumulators,
                        reassign the accumulators to his other investment
                        account, mortgage his house or transfer more funds from
                        his Citibank account. Teo refused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>

                        20 November 2007, Teo met with Kwek to complain
                        about the Disputed Accumulators. Teo informed Kwek that
                        although he had instructed Ng to limit his exposure in
                        accumulators to about $1 million, Ng had entered into CE
                        accumulators way in excess of the limit and the
                        authority given to her. Kwek did not want to commit on
                        the matter and arranged for Teo to meet with CIC’s
                        general manager.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As Teo’s position
                    was that he had not authorised the purchase of the Disputed

                    it be the sums required to purchase the accumulated shares
                    or the closing-out costs for the Disputed

                    also claimed that he did not, at any time, represent to CIC
                    that he would pay for the Disputed Accumulators or remit
                    monies to his account for such a purpose.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Teo also argued
                    that, in any case, CIC should have closed-out the Disputed
                    Accumulators upon discovering that they were disputed in
                    October 2007 in order to mitigate the closing-out costs and
                    the amount due in respect of the CE shares accumulated under
                    the Disputed Accumulators, instead of five months
                        later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>
                    Further, Teo argued that he had not requested for loans or
                    agreed to obtain loans from CIC, and that CIC was not
                    entitled to impose loans on him. Therefore, he argued, CIC
                    is not entitled to the interest that they are
                        claiming.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Finally, Teo
                    counterclaimed against CIC. Teo argued that CIC had
                    wrongfully realised his assets and/or set off his monies
                    maintained with CIC, and that CIC was obliged to repay all
                    such sums and monies due and owing to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Teo also claimed
                    damages in respect of what he claimed to be the wrongful
                    liquidation of his assets with CIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">History of the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This suit was first tried
                    before a Judicial Commissioner, who found that Teo had
                    instructed Ng to purchase the Disputed Accumulators and gave
                    judgment for CIC on its claims (see <em>Crédit Industriel et Commercial v Teo Wai
                        Cheong</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1149). Teo then
                    lodged an appeal against the Judicial Commissioner’s
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On appeal, the Court of
                    Appeal was of the view that CIC should disclose certain
                    information and documents, which related to orders for the
                    Disputed Accumulators made by CIC’s other clients
                    – identified as “Client A”,
                    “Client B” and “Client C”
                    – and which were previously withheld on the ground of
                    banking secrecy, because such evidence was relevant in the
                    light of Ng’s practice of consolidating orders and
                    because such disclosure would not breach banking
                        secrecy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>
                    Accordingly, the Court of Appeal exercised its powers under
                    s 37(4) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) and directed CIC to produce copies of the
                    following transcripts/documents (with only the names of
                    CIC’s clients or former clients and/or account numbers

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     CIC duly disclosed these
                    materials and parties made submissions on the relevance of
                    the Newly Disclosed Materials. As the Court of Appeal was
                    unable to conclude that the findings of fact of the Judicial
                    Commissioner would have been the same if he had seen the
                    Newly Disclosed Materials, or if they had been subjected to
                    cross-examination by counsel for Teo, it set aside the
                    judgment of the Judicial Commissioner and ordered that a new
                    trial be fixed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    Accordingly, a re-trial was fixed before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The re-trial</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ng’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On the first day of the
                    re-trial, CIC informed the court that Ng would not be
                    appearing in court as a witness for CIC during the re-trial.
                    CIC applied for Ng’s affidavits of evidence-in-chief
                    and her oral evidence from the first trial to be admitted as
                    evidence for the re-trial pursuant to section 33 of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap. 97) (“EA”) on the basis
                    that she could not be found. I allowed the application and I
                    now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 33 of the EA
                    states the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Relevancy
                            of certain evidence for proving in subsequent

                            relevant for the purpose of proving in a subsequent
                            judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same

                            states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found

                            expense which under the circumstances of the case
                            the court considers unreasonable subject to the
                            following provisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the proceeding was between
                                the same parties or their representatives in
                                interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the adverse party in the
                                first proceeding had the right and opportunity
                                to cross-examine; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the questions in issue
                                were substantially the same in the first as in
                                the second proceeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the first trial, Ng
                    filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief and a supplementary
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief and both were admitted into
                    evidence. Ng also took the stand and was cross-examined
                    under oath by Teo’s counsel on all aspects of the
                    affidavits. It is clear that all of this evidence is
                    “evidence given by a witness in a judicial
                    proceeding” and is “relevant for the purpose
                    of proving” in this re-trial, which is “a
                    subsequent judicial proceeding”, “the truth of
                    the facts which it states”. Teo did not dispute that
                    the first trial and the re-trial are proceedings between the
                    same parties, and that the questions in issue are
                    substantially the same, given that neither party has amended
                    its pleadings. The real fight occurred over the issues of
                    whether Ng “cannot be found” and whether Teo
                    could be said to have “had the right and opportunity
                    to cross-examine” Ng on all relevant matters during
                    the earlier judicial proceedings in view of the fact that
                    the Newly Disclosed Materials were not made available
                    then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     CIC argued that Ng, who to
                    its knowledge was resident in Dubai, could not be found
                    because after a re-trial of this suit was ordered on
                    11 April 2011, CIC made the following attempts to
                    locate her to no avail:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 16 May
                        2011, CIC tried to contact Ng on her Dubai mobile phone
                        number and her Singapore mobile phone number but failed.
                        CIC also sent an e-mail to Ng’s last known e-mail
                        address but did not get any response.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 16 June
                        2011, CIC’s representative, Kwek, visited
                        Ng’s parents’ residence in Singapore, where
                        Ng used to reside when she was based in Singapore, but
                        Ng’s father said that he did not know how to
                        contact Ng. Kwek told Ng’s father to ask Ng to
                        contact CIC if he managed to speak to her. However, Ng
                        did not contact CIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     On 26 July 2011, CIC
                        issued a subpoena to testify against Ng and on
                        29 July 2011, attempted but failed to serve the
                        subpoena on Ng at her parents’ residence in
                        Singapore. Further attempts to serve the subpoena on Ng
                        on 7 August 2011 and 13 August 2011 were also
                        unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the period of 15 August 2011
                        to 22 August 2011, CIC’s representative
                        visited Café Paparotti, a restaurant in Dubai where Ng
                        was last known to be working at, but was told that Ng no
                        longer worked at the restaurant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_e"></a>(e)     On
                        7 September 2011, CIC sent a letter by courier to
                        Ng’s last known address in Dubai but was informed
                        that the letter could not be delivered to Ng. On the
                        same day, CIC sent a letter addressed to Ng to her
                        parents’ residence in Singapore but did not
                        receive an acknowledgment of receipt of the
                        letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_f"></a>(f)     On 9 September 2011, CIC sent a
                        letter to Ng’s parents requesting their assistance
                        in contacting Ng but did not receive an acknowledgment
                        of receipt of the letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_g"></a>(g)     On 24 September 2011,
                        CIC’s representative visited Ng’s
                        parents’ residence but was unable to contact Ng or
                        her parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_h"></a>(h)     On 28 September 2011, CIC placed
                        an advertisement in The Straits Times requesting for Ng
                        to contact CIC. CIC also arranged for a similar
                        advertisement to be published in an English newspaper in
                        Dubai.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_i"></a>(i)     CIC received advice from Dubai
                        counsel that without knowledge of Ng’s present
                        address, there is no procedure under Dubai law to compel
                        Ng to give evidence in the court of a foreign
                        jurisdiction, or for evidence given in a Dubai court to
                        be used in foreign proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Teo’s counsel, in
                    turn, argued that the “cannot be found” limb
                    of s 33 of the EA required CIC to use its best efforts to
                    locate Ng and that CIC had not done so. He argued that CIC,
                    being a big international bank, should have hired a private
                    investigator in Singapore and/or Dubai to find out where Ng
                    was. Teo’s counsel ventured to suggest that CIC was
                    not keen on Ng returning to court and facing further
                    cross-examination, and that CIC would rather have Ng’s
                    evidence be accepted without having been tested against the
                    Newly Disclosed Materials. In particular, he highlighted one
                    of these documents, a draft e-mail dated 19 November
                    2007 which Ng meant to send to Teo but never did (the
                    “Draft E-Mail”), and the comments which the
                    Court of Appeal made on it. I set out this e-mail in
                    full:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Firstly, with regards [<em>sic</em>] to our conversation last week on
                        Tues [<em>sic</em>] evening, I
                        would like to thank you for <em>acknowledging that due to our almost 3 years
                            partnership you would be seeing through the
                            accumulators on the China Energy shares as per our
                            discussion</em>. I have sold off 150,000 worth
                        of China Energy Shares on
                            16<sup>th</sup> November at a share
                        price of 1.1628 per share as per our conversation on
                            15<sup>th</sup> of November. Going
                        forward, I will still be updating you consistently and
                        discussing with you how we will move forward as the
                        market unfolds in the coming months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You may not be aware that one of China Energy’s
                        biggest shareholders is the *ASEAN China Investment Fund
                        Limited which is actually a SINO-SWISS partnership
                        between a [<em>sic</em>] Swiss
                        Government and UOB Venture Management Limited. They have
                        95,000,000 shares. The biggest shareholder of the ASEAN
                        China Investment Fund Limited is China Development Bank.
                        This is a good indication of the positive direction of
                        China’s alternative energy sector as the world and
                        China continues its search for alternative fuel sources
                        as oil prices continue to rise. And China Energy
                        Limited’s position as one of the biggest
                        Dimethanol producers would mean that it is poised to
                        capitalize on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, you have already picked up 404,000 shares
                        of China Energy. We are accumulating 13500 shares per
                        day for 360 days at a strike price of an average of
                        S$1.60. As I have mentioned to you previously, the
                        collateral shortfall is currently at USD 4,500,000 and
                        it is the Bank’s view that you could mitigate this
                        shortfall with the greatest urgency.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Teo pointed out that one of the reasons which the
                    Court of Appeal gave for ordering a re-trial was that the
                    italicised words in the Draft E-Mail “may or may not
                    support Ng’s evidence. They are ambiguous and Ng
                    should testify and be cross-examined on what she meant by
                    those words”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There is no local case
                    authority on the meaning which ought to be given to the
                    phrase “cannot be found” in s 33 of the EA.
                    For guidance on this matter, it is useful to refer to the
                    commentary on a substantially similar provision, s 33 of the
                    Indian Evidence Act 1872, in Sarkar’s Law of Evidence
                    (Sixteenth Edition) (2007) (Volume 1) at page 853:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a party cannot find a witness, then he is, as it
                        were dead to him; and his depositions in a cause between
                        the same parties may be read, provided that he
                        endeavoured to find him, but could neither see him, nor
                        hear of him... The court must be satisfied that there
                        has been no collusion and that the search has been
                            <em>bona fide</em>... <b>It is not sufficient for him to show simply
                            that he is ignorant as to where the witness is. He
                            must go further and prove affirmatively to the court
                            that he has used due diligence.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agreed that “due diligence”,
                    instead of “best efforts” as Teo’s
                    counsel proposed, is a more appropriate threshold for the
                    “cannot be found” limb of s 33 of the EA, as
                    it could not have been Parliament’s intention to
                    require a party to show that it has spared no time and
                    expense in its search, in order to qualify under s 33 of the
                    EA. On the facts of this case, I found that the requirements
                    of s 33 of the EA for admitting the evidence of Ng at the
                    first trial were met. I found that CIC had used due
                    diligence by exploring many avenues and expending much time
                    and effort in its search for Ng from the time that the Court
                    of Appeal ordered a re-trial to the time of the commencement
                    of the re-trial. I did not think that s 33 of the EA went so
                    far as to require a private investigator to be hired in this
                    case and Teo’s counsel was not able to produce any
                    authority to the contrary. Further, there was nothing in the
                    evidence to show that CIC’s search was not <em>bona fide</em>, and I did not accept the
                    suggestion that CIC might have been quite happy for Ng not
                    to testify at the re-trial. In fact, Ng’s absence
                    could equally be seen as CIC’s lost opportunity to ask
                    Ng to explain the ambiguities which the Court of Appeal
                    found in the Newly Disclosed Materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the issue of whether
                    Teo had in the first trial the right and opportunity to
                    cross-examine Ng on the evidence which is sought to be
                    admitted, CIC submitted that Teo had this right and
                    opportunity and in fact did cross-examine Ng comprehensively
                    on the contents of her affidavits. On the other hand, Teo
                    submitted that this limb of s 33 of the EA was not fulfilled
                    because Teo’s counsel only had the opportunity to
                    cross-examine Ng against the documents that were before the
                    court at that time; he did not have the opportunity to
                    cross-examine Ng against the Newly Disclosed Materials.
                    Again, Teo’s counsel emphasised the Draft E-mail and
                    the comments which the Court of Appeal made on
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Certainly, it would be
                    ideal if Ng was present as a witness before me to give
                    evidence afresh. She could then, in her affidavits of
                    evidence-in-chief for the re-trial, deal with the Newly
                    Disclosed Materials and be asked to explain any ambiguities
                    and discrepancies. Teo’s counsel would then have the
                    full opportunity to cross-examine Ng against the backdrop of
                    all the documents before this court for the re-trial,
                    including the Newly Disclosed Materials. More importantly, I
                    would have been able to observe her demeanour as a witness
                    whilst testifying under oath before me. However, given that
                    Ng cannot be found, in my opinion through no fault of either
                    CIC or Teo, the question is where we should go from here. It
                    cannot seriously be argued that the Court of Appeal meant to
                    say that if Ng could not be cross-examined on the Draft
                    E-Mail and on the other Newly Disclosed Materials, then all
                    of the evidence that she had previously given, and on which
                    she had been cross-examined at length by Teo’s counsel
                    during the earlier trial, should be excluded entirely.
                    Surely the more sensible approach would be to admit the
                    evidence that she had given at the first trial and, when
                    deciding what weight to give it, to consider that there are
                    also the Newly Disclosed Materials which may or may not
                    support her evidence, together with whatever submissions
                    which the parties may make on these materials. In any event,
                    I am of the view that provision (b) in s 33 of the EA has
                    been sufficiently satisfied on the facts to allow Ng’s
                    evidence to be admitted in the re-trial before
                me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For the above reasons, I
                    allowed CIC’s application and ordered for the costs of
                    the application to be in the cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The issues in this case
                    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, whether
                        Teo instructed Ng to purchase the Disputed Accumulators
                        on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, if (a) is answered in the
                        negative, whether Teo is estopped from denying that he
                        had authorised Ng to purchase the Disputed Accumulators
                        on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, if (a) or (b) is answered in
                        the positive, what CIC is entitled to claim from
                        Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, if (a) and (b) are answered
                        in the negative, what Teo is entitled to claim from
                        CIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Teo instructed Ng to purchase the
                Disputed Accumulators on his behalf</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I will now consider the
                    evidence before this court and determine if it is, on the
                    whole, more consistent with CIC’s case (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> to <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above) or Teo’s
                    case (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above), and
                    whether CIC has proved on a balance of probabilities that
                    Teo had instructed Ng to purchase the Disputed Accumulators
                    on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events of 2 October 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 2 October 2007,
                    there were various recorded telephone conversations between
                    Ng and one “Lillian” from CIC’s PBA, and
                    transcripts of these conversations have been provided.
                    According to Ng’s and Teo’s telephone records,
                    there were also telephone conversations between Ng on the
                    one hand and Teo, Client A, Client B and Client C on the
                    other. These calls were not recorded. Ng and Teo have given
                    evidence on what was said during the calls between them but
                    there is no evidence on what was said during the calls
                    between Ng and her other clients. From the evidence, the
                    chronology of events on 2 October 2007 which are

<p class="Judg-1">From the above, it can readily be seen that there
                    was an opportunity for Client A (if he had ordered the
                    purchase of 6,500 CE accumulator shares per day at 8:29 am)
                    and Client B (if he had ordered the purchase of 6,000 CE
                    accumulator shares per day at 8:33 am) to give Ng
                    instructions to purchase a total of 12,500 CE accumulator
                    shares per day <b><em>before</em></b> Ng
                    placed the combined order of 12,500 CE accumulator shares
                    per day with PBA in <b><em>three</em></b>
                    tranches, which resulted in the Fifth CE Accumulator (5,000
                    CE shares per day ordered at 9:01 am and established at 9:14
                    am), the Fourth CE Accumulator (5,000 CE shares per day
                    ordered at 9:18 am and established at 9:22 am) and the Third
                    CE Accumulator (2,500 CE shares per day ordered at 9:22 am
                    and established at 9:36 am). Additionally, there was an
                    opportunity for Teo (if he had ordered the purchase of 7,500
                    CE accumulator shares per day at 9:34 am) and Client C (if
                    he had ordered the purchase of 3,500 CE accumulator shares
                    per day at 9:54 am) to give their instructions to Ng
                        <b><em>before</em></b> Ng placed the
                    combined order of 11,000 CE accumulator shares per day in
                    two tranches with PBA, which resulted in the Sixth CE
                    Accumulator (ordered at 10:32 am and established at 11:39 am
                    for the first tranche, and ordered at 11:44 am and
                    established at 11:56 am for the second tranche making a
                    total of 11,000 CE shares per day). The evidence supports
                    CIC’s position that Ng after taking all the
                    clients’ orders does not necessarily place out the
                    orders with PBA in one tranche. Depending on the
                    circumstances and the price movements, she might choose to
                    combine her clients’ orders and then place them out
                    with PBA in two or more tranches at different times of the
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I have to stress at this
                    juncture that it is not inconceivable for Client A, Client B
                    and Client C to place orders with Ng by giving her an
                    indicative range of the approximate size of their orders or
                    the maximum size of their orders, rather than by stating
                    that their orders have to be exactly a certain quantity of
                    accumulator shares per day because there is no certainty
                    that orders placed by CIC with its counterparties will
                    always be fulfilled to the full extent. In other words, a
                    client may place an order for between 10,000 and 13,000 CE
                    accumulator shares per day, but the actual order fulfilled
                    may be 11,000 CE accumulator shares per day, or it may even
                    be less, say, 9,000 CE accumulator shares per day.
                    Basically, there is no guarantee that all the orders
                    initially requested by Ng’s clients would be
                    fulfilled. It follows therefore that the exact size of the
                    orders fulfilled and subsequently attributed to a particular
                    client cannot be used as a conclusive indication that the
                    orders originally placed with Ng by that client must
                    necessarily be of that size. For instance, if the actual
                    order fulfilled for Client C was 3,500 CE accumulator shares
                    per day, it does not necessarily mean that Client C had in
                    fact originally ordered exactly 3,500 CE accumulator shares
                    per day (in the absence of other evidence), as Client C
                    could well have ordered a maximum of 5,000 CE accumulator
                    shares per day or ordered between 3,000 and 5,000 CE
                    accumulator shares per day, but the order was only fulfilled
                    to the extent of 3,500 CE accumulator shares per day,
                    leaving the balance unfulfilled. This however does not
                    detract from the usefulness of the above Simplified Table of
                    Events of 2 October 2007, which is principally to
                    determine if there was indeed an opportunity in terms of
                    “timing sequence” for instructions to be first
                    given by the various clients, and thereafter for orders to
                    be placed with PBA, leading either to a complete or partial
                    fulfilment of the orders as the case may be. If it could be
                    shown that there was no phone call or SMS at all between Ng
                    and Teo, prior to the placing of orders by Ng with PBS,
                    whether on the day itself <em>i.e</em>.
                    2 October 2007 (or even perhaps late in the day before
                        <em>i.e.</em> 1 October 2007,
                    after the close of the Singapore Exchange), then clearly Ng
                    would not have received any instructions from Teo to
                    purchase the CE accumulators on 2 October 2007. The
                    Simplified Table of Events of 2 October 2007 helps to
                    ascertain that position. In this case, it is clear to me
                    that there was an opportunity for Teo to give the
                    instructions that eventually led to 7,500 CE accumulator
                    shares per day being purchased for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The peripheral issue,
                    which Teo’s counsel kept highlighting at the trial, is
                    whether it would have been right for Ng to redistribute to
                    Client A, Client B, Client C and Teo the total of 23,500 CE
                    accumulator shares per day purchased at different times on
                    2 October 2007 at marginally different initial prices
                    between S$1.74 and S$1.8109, and with correspondingly
                    marginally different strike prices between S$1.5834 and
                    S$1.6335, and with marginally different knock-out prices
                    from S$1.7922 and S$1.8489 according to the Table of
                    Allocation, whilst keeping the actual total orders from each
                    of the clients the same. For instance, should Ng have
                    distributed only the Fifth, Fourth and Third CE Accumulators
                    (totalling 12,500 CE shares per day) to Client A (getting
                    6,500 CE shares per day) and Client B (getting 6,000 CE
                    shares per day), and only the Sixth CE Accumulator
                    (totalling 11,000 CE shares per day) to Teo (getting 7,500
                    CE shares per day) and Client C (getting 3,500 CE shares per
                    day); as opposed to distributing such that Client A, Client
                    B and Teo were given a combination of the Fifth, Fourth,
                    Third and Sixth CE Accumulators but still receiving the
                    total number of accumulators within the parameters of the
                    orders they had originally placed with her on 2 October
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Since the defence of Teo
                    was that he never gave any instructions at all to purchase
                    even a single CE accumulator share on the 2 October
                    2007, I do not think that the method of allocation used by
                    Ng (see Table of Allocation), which may be thought to be
                    less fair than if the “time sequence” factor
                    had been taken into account, is going to help Teo to show
                    that he could never have placed any order for CE accumulator
                    shares and that he never did place any order that resulted
                    in 7,500 CE accumulator shares per day purchased for him on
                    2 October 2007 -- whether or not it should have been
                    7,500 CE accumulator shares per day all coming from the
                    Sixth Accumulator, or the same total of 7,500 CE accumulator
                    shares per day coming from a combination of the Fifth,
                    Fourth, Third and Sixth Accumulators, which have only
                    marginally different strike and knock-out
                prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Having established that
                    the 9:34 am call on 2 October 2007 had presented an
                        <em>opportunity</em> for Teo to
                    give Ng instructions to purchase CE accumulators on that day
                    for him, the next question is what was <em>actually</em> said during this call. To discern
                    what was likely to have been said, I now examine the events
                    before and after the call. It can be seen from the Table of
                    Events of 2 October 2007 that it was Teo who initiated
                    contact with Ng on 2 October. Although there is no
                    record of the content of his SMS sent at 7:47 am, there is a
                    record of Ng’s reply just two minutes later at 7:49
                    am. She was indeed very quick with her SMS response to Teo
                    on that day. I wondered why it was so urgent for Teo to send
                    an SMS early in the morning to Ng. It certainly could not be
                    for social matters or mere market updates or discussions.
                    More likely than not, it was for business transactions that
                    need to be carried out which are time sensitive. CIC argued
                    that it is apparent from Ng’s reply that Ng was
                    responding to Teo’s query on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the status of the US market and this
                    meant that Teo was considering entering into more
                    accumulator transactions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Ng
                    updated Teo that the US market had performed very well the
                    night before and opined that the rally in the US market
                    should continue when she sent an SMS to Teo with the
                    following message: “Ok, last night us very good.
                    Rally shld continue.” It is very significant to note
                    that Ng, in this SMS, wanted to know whether she could
                    purchase more accumulators for Teo and she had in fact
                    specifically asked Teo “Can I do somemore?”
                    <em>i.e</em>. purchase more
                    accumulators for him. Ng also suggested that Teo consider
                    China Energy, Cosco and Ferrochina accumulators when she
                    ended her SMS by saying, “Looking at china energy,
                    cosco, ferrochina.” Ng’s SMS reply, sent at
                    7:49 am, was however only received by Teo at 9:34 am after
                    Teo disembarked an airplane in Penang and switched on his
                    phone. I am inclined to believe that when Teo saw Ng’s
                    SMS asking him whether she could purchase more accumulators
                    for him, Teo wasted no time in responding and he immediately
                    called Ng (approximately 6 seconds later), apparently rather
                    urgently at 9:34:06 am. This 9:34:06 am call from Teo to Ng
                    lasted 2 minutes and 22 seconds. During cross-examination,
                    much time was spent trying to establish whether Teo had
                    first read Ng’s SMS and then called her or whether he
                    had first called Ng and then read her SMS. Teo said that he
                    could not remember. Whatever the order might have been,
                    given that Ng’s question in her SMS (“Can I do
                    somemore?”) had not been answered, it was very likely
                    that she would have asked Teo again during the telephone
                    conversation whether he wanted to buy more accumulators.
                    Indeed, Teo admitted that it was more likely than not that
                    she asked him if he wanted to buy more CE
                        accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> CIC’s case is
                    that it was during this call that Teo authorised the
                    purchase of CE accumulators on his behalf. Ng’s
                    testimony at the first trial was that Teo authorised her to
                    purchase the CE accumulators on his behalf during this call.
                    Teo, on the other hand, gave evidence that during this call,
                    Ng told him that the Second CE Accumulator (<em>i.e.</em> item number 14 in the Table of
                    Accumulators) and the second Cosco accumulator (<em>i.e</em>. item number 13 in the Table of
                    Accumulators) which he had previously established had been
                    knocked out, and Teo instructed Ng to sell his Cosco shares
                    but keep his CE shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> He was adamant
                    that if Ng had asked him whether he wanted to buy more CE
                    accumulators, he would have said no.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Teo gave several reasons
                    to support his argument that he could not have authorised Ng
                    to purchase CE accumulators during the 9:34 am call. For the
                    purpose of analysis, the following three stages will be
                    considered: the instructing stage, the ordering stage and
                    the allocating stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     With respect to the
                    instructing stage, it was argued that Ng could not have
                    accepted Teo’s alleged instructions to purchase CE
                    accumulators during the 9:34 am call because Ng was informed
                    before the call that her order for 5,000 CE accumulator
                    shares per day placed at 9:22 am, presumably for Client A
                    and Client B (at entry number 8 of the Table of Events of
                    2 October 2007), could not be fully filled and that DBS
                    Bank did not want to establish anymore CE
                        accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>
                    This argument is misconceived. It was open to Ng in those
                    circumstances to accept instructions from Teo to establish
                    CE accumulators because upon receiving Teo’s mandate,
                    Ng would have the power but not the obligation to establish
                    accumulators on Teo’s behalf. In any case, there were
                    other counterparties apart from DBS Bank which CIC could,
                    and in this case did, deal with, such as Goldman
                    Sachs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For the ordering stage, it
                    was argued that Teo could not have given instructions to
                    purchase CE accumulators of up to S$6 million during the
                    9:34 am call because after this call, Ng had five further
                    telephone conversations with Lillian but did not place any
                    orders for CE accumulators. It was only at 10:32 am that Ng
                    finally placed an order for CE accumulators, and this was
                    not an order for S$6 million worth of accumulators, but for
                    US$1 million worth of accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> These
                    arguments fail to take into account the discretion which
                    must necessarily be given to relationship managers. Save
                    when there are contrary instructions and as long as they act
                    within the terms of their mandate, relationship managers may
                    decide how to combine the orders from various clients, the
                    number of tranches to split up each order into, the size of
                    each tranche and the time that they should place each
                    tranche with PBA depending on the prevailing market
                    conditions and other factors which would ordinarily be taken
                    into account when making investment decisions. Thus, for
                    example, even if immediately after the 9:34 am call, Ng was
                    able to establish S$6 million worth of accumulators within
                    the range of the initial, knock-out and strike prices
                    allegedly instructed by Teo, I do not think that she had no
                    discretion to wait if for some reason she thought it better
                    to do so, such as if she thought that she might be able to
                    get a better deal later in the day. In any case, it is not
                    Teo’s allegation that Ng had delayed the placing of
                    orders for an unacceptable amount of time or for
                    unacceptable reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Teo further argued that Ng
                    placed orders for him before he had an opportunity to
                    instruct her to do so, as Ng had placed orders for the Third
                    to Fifth CE Accumulators before his 9:34 am call to Ng.
                    However, the Simplified Table of Events of 2 October
                    2007 and the Table of Allocation will show that Ng did not
                    place an order for Teo before speaking with him: Ng had
                    secured 12,500 CE accumulator shares per day in three
                    tranches under the Third to Fifth CE Accumulators for orders
                    which she made <b><em>after</em></b> speaking
                    with Client A and Client B but before speaking with Teo, and
                    correspondingly, Ng had allocated the <b><em>same</em></b> number of 12,500 CE accumulator shares
                    per day under the Third to Sixth CE Accumulators to Client A
                    and Client B. Similarly, <b><em>after</em></b> speaking with Teo and Client C, Ng
                    secured orders of 11,000 CE accumulator shares per day in
                    two tranches under the Sixth CE Accumulator, and
                    correspondingly allocated the <b><em>same</em></b> number of 11,000 CE accumulator shares
                    per day to Teo and Client C under the Third to Sixth CE
                    Accumulators. The Table of Allocation clarifies how Ng made
                    the allocations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In relation to the
                    allocation stage, it was argued that since Ng stated that
                    she would only enter into a transaction after she had
                    received her clients’ instructions, the Third to Fifth
                    CE Accumulators ordered by Ng before she spoke with Teo must
                    have been ordered for Client A and/or Client B and not Teo;
                    yet, shares to be delivered under the Third to Fifth CE
                    Accumulators were allocated to Teo. In response, CIC
                    submitted that Ng only consolidated and allocated her
                    confirmed transactions at the end of each day to each of her
                    clients, thereby explaining why shares to be delivered under
                    the Third to Fifth CE Accumulators were allocated to Teo. I
                    find that even if Teo’s argument is correct, it does
                    not lend much weight to Teo’s case that he had not
                    authorised the purchase of any CE accumulators; all that can
                    be said is that Teo should only have been allocated shares
                    under the Sixth CE Accumulator, instead of shares under the
                    Third to Sixth CE Accumulators. However, this is not the
                    position that he has taken in this case and therefore I need
                    not examine the propriety or otherwise of what CIC said was
                    Ng’s consolidation and allocation
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I will however make this
                    observation. On the facts before me, CIC is not buying the
                    accumulators on behalf of Client A, Client B, Client C and
                    Teo as their agent. If that were the case, then perhaps it
                    is arguable that CIC should not be consolidating and
                    thereafter, re-allocating and re-distributing the CE
                    accumulators bought on that day for each of them. Instead,
                    CIC arguably should have approached PBA to place separate
                    and discrete orders for each client without combining any of
                    their orders, when making purchases on their behalf.
                    However, CIC’s counterparties such as DBS Bank and
                    Goldman Sachs may not be too interested in dealing with
                    small orders and if they do, they may not quote good prices
                    for the small orders. Where orders from individual clients
                    are small, relationship managers may choose to consolidate
                    their clients’ orders into larger orders before
                    placing them with PBA and perhaps better prices could be
                    obtained on account of bulk orders, which if secured can
                    later be sub-divided and distributed to their clients,
                    whilst keeping the quantities allocated to each client the
                    same as or within what each client has originally ordered.
                    Hence, assuming that CIC was acting only as an agent for Teo
                    and assuming that Teo had placed an order with Ng for 7,500
                    CE accumulator shares per day on 2 October 2007 at 9:34
                    am, and if the argument is that Ng should have instructed
                    PBA to approach DBS Bank or Goldman Sachs to specifically
                    secure an order for the same exact amount of 7,500 CE
                    accumulator shares per day <b><em>soon
                        after</em></b> obtaining Teo’s instructions at
                    9:34 am (instead of delaying it to 10:32 am and 11:44 am), I
                    think it would then be likely that the 7,500 CE accumulator
                    shares secured for Teo on that day would be at the initial
                    price of about S$1.795, a strike price of S$1.6335 and a
                    knock-out price of S$1.8489 (based on the parameters
                    governing the third CE Accumulator, which was established at
                    about 9:36 am on that same day). One has to bear in mind
                    that the share price may fluctuate throughout the day. It
                    would appear that the price of CE shares on the Singapore
                    Exchange started at a high of about S$1.81 at about 9:00 am
                    when the market opened on 2 October 2007, and then
                    stayed fairly stable for the next 40 minutes or so at about
                    S$1.795, before gradually slipping downwards by 4½
                    cents to S$1.74 by about 11:40 am and 11:56 am as can be
                    seen from the initial prices for CE shares set out in the
                    Table of Accumulators and the times at which the
                    corresponding CE accumulators were established as set out in
                    the Simplified Table of Events of 2 October 2007. It is
                    obvious to me that Ng was delaying placing out the orders
                    with PBA so that she could get better initial prices and
                    therefore correspondingly lower strike prices for
                    accumulation, when she noticed a slight weakening in the
                    price of CE shares as the morning progressed. Ng was
                    obviously trying to do her best for all her clients. She was
                    proved right in that her later orders on that day, which she
                    had delayed placing, were secured by her at much better
                    prices <em>i.e.</em> a lower initial
                    price of S$1.74, a lower strike price of S$1.5843 and a
                    lower knock-out price of S$1.7922 (as can be seen from the
                    details at item 18 in the Table of Accumulators for the
                    Sixth CE Accumulator, which were placed out much later in
                    two tranches at about 10:32 am and near noon time at about
                    11:44 am, and which were eventually secured at about 11:39
                    am and 11:56 am respectively).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I calculated that the
                    maximum total obligation (which is to include the doubling
                    effect when the spot price falls below the strike price) for
                    a year’s accumulation (based on approximately 252
                    trading days in a year) at the rate of 7,500 CE accumulator
                    shares per day multiplied by two, and at the strike price of
                    S$1.6335 that would likely be applicable at 9:36 am on
                    2 October 2007 would have been <b>S$6,174,630</b> (<em>i.e.</em> See item 15 of the Table of
                    Accumulators for the Third CE Accumulator established at
                    9:36 am on 2 October 2007, which has a total obligation
                    of $823,284 when the accumulation obligation is at the rate
                    of 1,000 CE accumulator shares per day. Multiplying that by
                    7.5 will give the maximum total obligation of <b>S$6,174,630</b> for a CE accumulator
                    that requires accumulation at 7,500 CE accumulator shares
                    per day). Compare that with the maximum total obligation of
                    the 7,500 CE accumulator shares per day that were actually
                    distributed to Teo, which comes to a slightly lower figure
                    of <b>S$6,046,178</b> (<em>i.e.</em> Add up the total obligations
                    for the 7,500 CE accumulator shares per day from item 15 to
                    item 18 in the Table of Accumulators as follows: S$823,284 +
                    S$1,614,514 + S$1,629,130 + S$1,979,250 = <b>S$6,046,178</b>). If CIC had strictly acted as
                    an agent and promptly bought an exact amount of 7,500 CE
                    accumulator shares per day at about 9:34 am specifically for
                    Teo without co-mingling Teo’s order with the orders of
                    Ng’s other clients, Teo would have been worse off by
                    some <b>S$128,452</b> being the
                    difference between <b>S$6,174,630</b>
                    and <b>S$6,046,178</b> (<em>i.e.</em> Teo would have been slightly
                    worse off by about 2% in so far as his maximum obligation is
                    concerned for this order.) I therefore cannot see any reason
                    for Teo to complain when Ng watches the market and the price
                    movements of the CE shares and when she delays placing out
                    the orders upon noticing an intra-day weakening in the CE
                    share price with a view to securing a better deal for all
                    her clients, and when she combines the orders and later
                    re-allocates them in a manner she thinks would be fair to
                    all her clients. In this case, Teo came out better off than
                    if Ng had immediately placed out Teo’s order with PBA
                    and secured the order immediately for him at about 9:36 am.
                    In any case, it is my view that CIC is entitled to
                    consolidate their clients’ orders for the day before
                    purchasing the corresponding amounts in various tranches
                    from its counterparties, namely DBS Bank or Goldman Sachs;
                    and after securing the orders in bulk on that day for
                    itself, CIC is entitled to re-distribute them to their
                    various clients to fulfil individual orders. The principal
                    reason is that CIC is not acting as an agent separately for
                    each client. CIC is in fact acting as a principal party
                    selling smaller, repackaged accumulators separately to
                    Client A, Client B, Client C and Teo from the pool of
                    accumulators that CIC has purchased or secured for itself on
                    that day. In this case, CIC even prepares its own
                    accumulator term sheets to evidence the transaction between
                    itself and its clients, although the details may have been
                    extracted from the corresponding accumulator term sheets
                    from DBS Bank or Goldman Sachs that evidence the terms of
                    the accumulator contracts between DBS Bank/Goldman Sachs
                    with CIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In other words, after CIC
                    has successfully secured bulk orders from DBS Bank or
                    Goldman Sachs, CIC is not prohibited from subdividing the
                    big pool of accumulators that CIC has purchased for itself
                    for the purpose of acting as a principal seller to sell
                    smaller re-packaged quantities of accumulators from that
                    pool to Ng’s clients, namely Client A, Client B,
                    Client C and Teo. CIC has greater flexibility when it is
                    dealing as a principal (and not strictly as an agent)
                    vis-à-vis its own clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Accordingly, there is no
                    merit whatsoever in the argument that just because Teo had
                    been allocated from the pool of CE accumulators (<em>i.e.</em> the Fifth, Fourth and Third)
                    which were purchased by CIC from DBS Bank <b><em>before</em></b> Teo called Ng at 9:34 am on
                    2 October 2007, it must follow that those Accumulators
                    were not authorised by him. The second and final phone call
                    between Teo and Ng on 2 October 2007 was made by Teo to
                    Ng at 5:35 pm. Ng gave evidence that during this call, she
                    informed Teo that she had established the Third to Sixth CE
                    Accumulators. Teo denied this. Although he could not
                    remember what the conversation was about, he stated that he
                    might have called to ask Ng whether she had sold his Cosco
                    shares pursuant to his instructions in the 9:34 am
                        call<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.Although there
                    is some merit to CIC’s suggestion that this would not
                    have taken over three minutes, I do not think that the case
                    turned on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In summary, during the
                    9:34 am call on 2 October 2007, Teo had an opportunity
                    to give Ng instructions to purchase CE accumulators (at
                        [46]) and it was
                    likely that there was a discussion on whether to purchase CE
                    accumulators (at [50]). I find that the way in which Ng
                    received instructions to purchase CE accumulators (at
                        [52]), placed
                    orders for CE accumulators (at [53] and [54]), and allocated the CE accumulators
                    established (at [44], [45] and [55]) on 2 October 2007 does not rule
                    out the possibility that Teo had instructed Ng to purchase
                    7,500 CE accumulator shares per day during the 9:34 am call.
                    In my view, from the totality of the circumstances, in
                    particular the timing and sequence of the events, and the
                    content of Ng’s SMS sent at 7:49 am, it is more likely
                    than not that instructions to purchase CE Accumulators had
                    been given by Teo to Ng on 2 October 2007, which
                    resulted in the purchase of a total of 7,500 CE accumulator
                    shares per day for Teo on that same day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events of 3 October 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     On 3 October 2007,
                    there were various recorded telephone conversations between
                    Ng and Lillian and transcripts of these conversations have
                    been provided. According to Ng’s and Teo’s
                    telephone records, there were also telephone conversations
                    between Ng on the one hand and Teo, Client A and Client B on
                    the other. These calls were not recorded save for one call
                    between Ng and Client A. Ng and Teo gave evidence on what
                    was said during the calls between them. From the evidence,
                    the chronology of events on 3 October 2007 which are
                    material to this dispute is as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Again, for CIC’s
                    case to stand, there must have been, at the very least, an
                    opportunity for Client A, Client B and Teo to give Ng
                    instructions to purchase accumulators before Ng placed
                    orders for the Seventh CE Accumulator and the Sembcorp
                    Accumulator. This is the case here, as there were three
                    calls between Ng and Client A from 6:55 pm to 7:54 pmon the
                    evening of the previous day after the close of the market
                        <em>i.e.</em> on 2 October
                    2007 (see entry numbers 23 to 25 in the Table of Events of
                    2 October 2007) during which CIC alleged that Client A
                    gave Ng instructions to establish the Seventh CE Accumulator
                    and the Sembcorp Accumulator, a call between Ng and Client B
                    at 10:15 am on 3 October 2007 (see entry number 3 in
                    the Table of Events of 3 October 2007) and a call
                    between Ng and Teo at 10:27 am on 3 October 2007 (see
                    entry number 4 in the Table of Events of 3 October
                    2007), before Ng proceeded to place consolidated orders with
                    PBA for the Seventh CE Accumulator and the Sembcorp
                    Accumulator at 10:29 am on 3 October 2007 for Client A,
                    Client B and Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Once again, having
                    established that the 10:27 am call presented an opportunity
                    for Teo to give Ng instructions to purchase CE accumulator
                    shares and Sembcorp accumulator shares on his behalf, the
                    next question is what was actually said during this call. To
                    discern what was likely to have been said, I now examine the
                    events before and after the 10:27 am call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     From 9:27 am to 10:09 am
                    on 3 October 2007, there were four calls between
                    Lillian and Ng, where Ng had requested and obtained quotes
                    for Sembcorp and CE accumulators. Ng also told Lillian that
                    she would take orders and then let Lillian know what they
                    were. The fact that Ng had specifically told Lillian that
                    she would take clients’ orders first and then let
                    Lillian know subsequently what they were indicates clearly
                    to me her intention to seek her clients’ instructions
                    first. Her conduct at this point of time does not, on a
                    balance of probabilities, indicate to me that Ng was a
                    client relationship manager who was going to act on a frolic
                    of her own to place orders willy-nilly, or who was going to
                    use her clients’ accounts to trade for herself or to
                    take positions without the client’s knowledge and
                    consent in order to benefit personally from those positions
                    when the trades turn out in her favour and to foist those
                    positions on her clients when the trades turn out against
                    her. In any event, there is clear evidence from Kwek that it
                    is virtually impossible for Ng to do that, given the various
                    internal controls, notification systems, client accounts and
                    payment systems operated by CIC. Basically, Ng will be found
                    out very quickly if she were to buy accumulators behind the
                    back of her clients so to speak, or if she were to misuse
                    her clients’ accounts and overdraft/credit facilities
                    to take positions on accumulators for her own personal
                    benefit. Second, because the strike price is always set at a
                    discount to the initial price at the time of purchase of an
                    accumulator, one will only know later whether the trade will
                    turn out to be favourable. The spot price basically must
                    fall below the strike price and remain below the strike
                    price for the trade to be unfavourable. By that time, a
                    client, upon receiving independent notification of the
                    trades which were truly not his, would certainly be alarmed
                    and would have reported the whole matter to CIC. Ng would
                    soon be caught for her wrong doing perhaps even before she
                    can profit from those trades. Given the strict controls
                    within CIC, my assessment is that Ng would not likely take
                    on such a huge risk on a balance of
                probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     From the Table of Events
                    of 3 October 2007, it can be seen that four minutes
                    after Ng obtained quotes for the Sembcorp and CE
                    accumulators and told Lillian from PBA that she would take
                    orders and get back to Lillian, Ng made an unsuccessful
                    attempt at 10:13:56 am to reach Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Ng then talked to Client B
                    and thereafter, she managed to speak to Teo at 10:27 am. It
                    is very significant to note that less than a minute after
                    finishing her 10:27 am call to Teo, Ng placed with Lillian
                    orders for the Seventh CE Accumulator and the Sembcorp
                    Accumulator. CIC’s case is that it was during this
                    10:27 am call that Teo instructed Ng to purchase CE and
                    Sembcorp accumulators. CIC further alleged that Ng called
                    Teo at 11:00 am to inform him that those accumulators had
                    been established. Teo, on the other hand, stated that the
                    10:27 am call was about whether to sell the shares in his
                    account, including the CE and NOL shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> When asked to explain
                    why there was a need for Ng to call him again only about
                    thirty minutes later at 11:00 am, he stated that he could
                    not remember but she could have been reporting the share
                    prices to him and again discussing with him whether to sell
                    his CE and NOL shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> The lack of a
                    satisfactory explanation from Teo for the second call from
                    Ng at 11:00 am and the close proximity between the calls
                    where Ng first obtained quotes from Lillian for the CE and
                    Sembcorp accumulators and the subsequent calls where Ng
                    talked to Client B and Teo, followed immediately by the call
                    where Ng placed orders with Lillian, suggest strongly to me
                    that Teo must have instructed Ng during the 10:27 am call to
                    purchase the CE and Sembcorp accumulators. Both the
                    proximity of timing and sequence of calls are highly
                    probative to show that Ng had sought and obtained
                    instructions from Teo before she proceeded to order the CE
                    and Sembcorp accumulators for Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It was accepted by both
                    parties that when Lillian conveyed Ng’s order for CE
                    accumulators to Vera (see entry number 6 in the Table of
                    Events of 3 October 2007), a mistake was made such that
                    instead of an order being placed for S$86,500 worth of CE
                    shares per week, an order was placed for 86,500 CE shares
                    per week, resulting in an over-order of about 33,500 shares
                    per week. Teo alleged that Ng allocated the excess shares to
                    Teo without Teo’s consent to cover up Lillian’s
                        mistake.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>
                    When cross-examined at the first trial, Ng gave evidence
                    that she had realised Lillian’s error but did not
                    correct it because apart from the order that she had placed
                    with Lillian, she had other orders to fill, and 86,500 CE
                    shares per week fell within the range of shares that she had
                    been instructed to order for all of her clients.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Ng’s
                    evidence is supported by the contemporaneous note written by
                    Ng on 3 October 2007 setting out how shares to be
                    delivered under the Seventh CE Accumulator were to be
                    allocated amongst her three clients. When asked why she did
                    not place all her clients’ orders together when she
                    spoke to Lillian, Ng explained that depending on the market,
                    she may place a full order or orders in
                        tranches.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> I note that this is
                    consistent with how Ng placed her orders in tranches on
                    2 October 2007 and I accept Ng’s evidence that
                    this was her practice. I also accept her explanation for not
                    correcting Lillian’s error because it is unlikely that
                    Ng would risk civil and criminal liability just to cover up
                    her colleague’s error, when her evidence during
                    re-examination at the first trial was that she knew of an
                    easier and more sensible way of rectifying the
                    mistake:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I accept Ng’s
                    evidence that the unwinding costs would be minimal if
                    unwinding is done quickly and the price of the CE
                    Accumulators is not likely to have moved much after a day or
                    so, unless there has been a violent and drastic market fall
                    similar to the event on Black Monday on 19 October
                    1987, when stock markets around the world crashed within a
                    short space of time. Nothing of that sort happened on
                    3 October 2007 and I am inclined to believe that
                    unwinding costs, if done quickly on the same day or the very
                    next day, would not be significant. If CIC wanted to, it can
                    of course also temporarily warehouse these excess orders
                    resulting from mistakes made by staff, and sell them later
                    to its other clients. If CIC has no intention of taking
                    positions on these excess accumulators (due to internal
                    policies or otherwise), then CIC could have easily unwound
                    them the very next day at the latest, thereby incurring for
                    itself not very significant unwinding costs, as I do not
                    believe that the market or spot price of CE shares would
                    have moved very much between 3 October and
                    4 October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Teo also alleged that
                    there was a further mistake on 3 October 2007, this
                    time made by Ng when she placed orders with PBA using
                    figures which took into account the potential doubling
                    effect, whereas PBA placed orders with its counterparties
                    using figures which did not take into account the doubling
                    effect. Teo argued that this resulted in Ng placing twice as
                    many orders than she had been instructed to, and that Ng had
                    then dumped the excess on Teo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>
                    CIC, on the other hand, responded that there was no mistake
                    because the established practice between Ng and PBA was that
                    the figures Ng gave to PBA would <em>not</em> take into account the doubling effect,
                    and it was also industry practice <em>not</em> to include the doubling effect when
                    banks placed orders with their counterparties. I accept
                    CIC’s evidence on its internal practices and on the
                    practices of the industry it is in, since it is CIC and not
                    Teo who would know best about these industry practices. In
                    any event as between CIC and Teo, it would appear from the
                    previous undisputed accumulator transactions that the manner
                    in which (a) instructions and orders were given to Ng; and
                    (b) the fulfilled orders from DBS and Goldman Sachs were in
                    turn later sold by CIC acting as principal to Teo as the
                    buyer, shows that the accumulator transactions between CIC
                    and Teo were done on the same basis as the industry practice
                    as described by CIC. I therefore reject the argument of Teo
                    that Ng had placed twice as many orders as she had been
                    instructed to because of the doubling effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In summary, the sequence
                    of events on 3 October 2007 leads me to believe that
                    Teo had in fact instructed Ng to establish the Seventh CE
                    Accumulator and the Sembcorp Accumulator (from [63] to [68][67]). I find on a balance
                    of probabilities that Ng had not dumped shares on Teo in
                    order to cover up a mistake, whether committed by PBA (at
                        -[69]) or
                    allegedly by Ng (at [70]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events after 3 October 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The events after
                    3 October 2007 further point towards Teo having
                    instructed Ng to purchase the Third to Sixth CE Accumulators
                    on 2 October 2007 and the Seventh CE Accumulator on
                    3 October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Teo’s inaction for more than a
                month after 3 October 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It is not disputed that
                    after 3 October 2007, there were no further
                    conversations between Teo and Ng until 11 October 2007.
                    Ng gave evidence that this was because the Disputed
                    Accumulators and the Sembcorp Accumulator were still running
                    and both Ng and Teo were waiting for the stock market to
                        improve.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Teo did not have
                    any satisfactory explanation for the gap in communication
                    between him and Ng during this period. He alleged that it
                    was only during a telephone conversation with Ng on
                    16 October 2007 that he discovered that Ng had entered
                    into the Disputed Accumulators and the Sembcorp Accumulator
                    on his behalf. Yet, he did not raise any issue or complaint
                    to CIC’s management until more than a month later on
                    20 November 2007. To explain the delay, Teo claimed
                    that he had on 18 October 2007 acceded to Ng’s
                    request for a month to resolve the issue of the Disputed
                    Accumulators with her superiors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> CIC’s
                    position is that this story is made up by Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I do not accept
                    Teo’s explanation for several reasons. First, it is
                    difficult to believe that Teo would have been willing to
                    give Ng a month to resolve the issue of what he claims to be
                    the unauthorised trades that she did behind his back. It
                    seems strange that Teo should rely on the very person whom
                    he says got him into this big mess to get him out of it. Teo
                    sought to explain the generosity that he displayed towards
                    Ng by saying that she had been his relationship manager
                    since her Citibank days and that he trusted her. This trust
                    seems completely misplaced especially when one considers
                    Teo’s allegation that Ng had already on two previous
                    occasions established accumulators under Teo’s account
                    without authorisation. It would have made a lot more sense
                    for Teo to complain directly to Ng’s superiors,
                    instead of trusting her to own up to her mistakes on her own
                    accord. Further, there is no reason to give Ng a grace
                    period of a full month, when he could simply have spent a
                    few minutes to call up and lodge an official complaint with
                    CIC in simple, clear and unambiguous terms that those trades
                    were never ordered by him. It was not as if Teo was
                    intellectually incapable of doing that. Second, Teo’s
                    behaviour after 18 October 2007 was inconsistent with
                    his claim that he had on that day given Ng one month to
                    resolve the matter. If Teo’s story is true, Teo should
                    have been anxious to obtain updates from Ng in the days
                    after 18 October 2007 on whether the issue had been
                    resolved. Yet, Teo was not interested in knowing whether Ng
                    managed to resolve the issue with her superiors. Not only
                    did he not initiate any contact with Ng, Teo even failed to
                    answer or return Ng’s two calls on 2 November
                    2007 (which was the scheduled settlement date for three of
                    the Disputed CE Accumulators) and Ng’s two calls on
                    5 November 2007. Teo’s actions are more
                    consistent with an evasive client trying to delay or avoid
                    paying what is owed than with a furious client hounding his
                    errant relationship manager for a speedy resolution of the
                    huge financial mess created by the latter. Third, even on
                    Teo’s version of events, it should have soon become
                    clear to Teo that Ng was not resolving the matter for him
                    and this should have led Teo to lodge a complaint with
                    Ng’s superior much earlier than he did. According to
                    Teo, Ng gave him the first update on the matter on
                    13 November 2007, but it was bad news for Teo –
                    Ng said that her superiors wanted her to persuade Teo to
                    accept liability on the accumulators. Thereafter, Teo
                    claimed that Ng made several attempts (on 13, 15 and
                    19 November) to persuade him to accept the
                    accumulators. Yet, not only did Teo continue to wait the
                    month out before confronting Ng’s superiors directly,
                    he also continued to deal with Ng on matters pertaining to
                    his account (see <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> below). Fourth,
                    if it were indeed true that Ng had used Teo’s account
                    and entered into the disputed accumulator trades behind his
                    back (<em>i.e.</em> without his
                    knowledge, instructions and authorisation), this would be a
                    serious criminal offence committed by Ng, and given the
                    delays and the failure of Ng to sort out the financial mess
                    to Teo’s account created by Ng’s criminal act, I
                    would have expected Teo to report this matter to the
                    Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) or the
                    police without further delay. Teo never reported to the CAD
                    or the police nor did he threaten Ng that he would do so if
                    she failed to resolve the matter. During the trial, Teo was
                    unable to provide any satisfactory explanation for his
                    conduct. Teo’s conduct after 3 October 2007 is
                    plainly inexplicable and inconsistent with his version of
                    the facts. Thus, it can only be inferred that Teo made no
                    protest to CIC’s management about the Disputed
                    Accumulators from 3 October 2007 to 19 November
                    2007 because the Disputed Accumulators were authorised by
                    him. This also explains why Teo did not lodge a police
                    report against Ng: he should know that making a false police
                    report is a crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Teo’s issuance of a cheque for
                S$160,000 to CIC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It is not disputed that on
                    7 November 2007, Teo issued to CIC a cheque for
                    S$160,000 (“the Cheque”). The Cheque was used
                    to pay for CE shares delivered to Teo under the Disputed
                    Accumulators. CIC claimed that Teo had issued the Cheque to
                    CIC for this purpose. On the other hand, Teo claimed that Ng
                    told him that the money was for shares to be delivered under
                    the First and Second CE Accumulators and the Sembcorp
                        Accumulator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> It
                    is difficult to believe Teo’s claim since Teo had on
                    2 October 2007 already instructed Ng to use the funds
                    in his account to pay for the shares acquired under the
                    First and Second CE Accumulators and confirmation notes
                    showing the debit of his account were sent to
                        him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Under
                    cross-examination, Teo conveniently claimed not to have read
                    the letters sent to him by CIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Additionally, I find it
                    difficult to believe that Teo did not know at that time that
                    he had more than sufficient funds in his account to pay for
                    the shares delivered to him under the undisputed First and
                    Second CE Accumulators. Even though he might not have known
                    the exact amount available in his account, he would still
                    have known that he had several hundred thousand dollars in
                    cash in his account, which would have been more than ample
                    to cover these payments. He would also have realised that
                    the money available in his account would have increased from
                    original amounts he deposited with CIC as a result of the
                    profitable run he was having with his accumulator
                    transactions prior to these Disputed
                Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     If Teo had truly never
                    ordered any of the Disputed Accumulators, it should have
                    made no sense to him that Ng would be asking him for money
                    to top up his account at this point of time. All the earlier
                    undisputed accumulator transactions had been knocked out
                    already. Further, given the money earlier deposited by Teo
                    with CIC coupled with the substantial profits he made on the
                    earlier accumulator transactions, why should there be any
                    need to pay $160,000 to CIC? Teo does not need to be a
                    genius to realise that. Instead of finding out what the
                    $160,000 was for, I find it inexplicable on Teo’s
                    version of events that he should even send any money at all,
                    let alone a cheque for such a large sum of $160,000 to be
                    deposited with CIC at the request of Ng. However, on
                    CIC’s version of events, this behaviour of Teo makes
                    complete sense. It is in fact very strong evidence
                    corroborating Ng’s evidence that Teo had in fact given
                    instructions to her to purchase the Disputed
                    Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     To sum up, if Teo’s
                    version of the facts were true, then Ng’s request for
                    money must have raised a warning flag for him, and he would
                    have exercised great care before paying the money. Also,
                    since it was Teo’s case that he had been aware of the
                    unauthorised transactions since 16 October 2007, he
                    must have known that as long as the issue remained
                    unresolved, there would be outstanding liabilities in
                    relation to these disputed transactions in his CIC account,
                    and there was no reason for him to issue a cheque to CIC
                    without any qualifications or reservations as the payment of
                    $160,000 can only be for and in relation to his outstanding
                    liabilities under these disputed transactions. Thus, the
                    paying of the cheque can only be consistent with Teo having
                    authorised the purchase of the Disputed
                Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Sale of shares acquired under the
                undisputed accumulators to pay for shares to be acquired under
                the Disputed Accumulators</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     On 16 November 2007,
                    CIC sold 180,000 CE shares on Teo’s behalf. 60,000 CE
                    shares were acquired by Teo under the First and Second CE
                    Accumulators, whereas the remaining 120,000 CE shares were
                    acquired by Teo under the Disputed Accumulators. CIC claimed
                    that Teo had instructed CIC to sell these shares (which
                    included those from the undisputed accumulators) and to use
                    all the sale proceeds as payment for some of the CE shares
                    which had been delivered under the Disputed Accumulators.
                    Teo claimed that he had only instructed CIC to sell shares
                    accumulated under the First and Second CE Accumulators but
                    not shares accumulated under the Disputed Accumulators.
                    However, confirmation notes reflecting the sale of the CE
                    shares, including those accumulated under the Disputed
                    Accumulators, were sent to and received by Teo, who did not
                    raise any objection. Teo conveniently alleged that he did
                    not read any of these confirmation notes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>. Teo also claimed that CIC
                    had unilaterally used the sale proceeds to acquire shares
                    accumulated under the Disputed Accumulators without his
                    knowledge. However, once again, he must have known that at
                    the time of the sale, the issue of the Disputed Accumulators
                    had not yet been resolved and thus there would be
                    outstanding liabilities in relation to these transactions in
                    his CIC account; yet, he did not seek to withdraw the sale
                    proceeds arising from the sale of the undisputed 60,000 CE
                    shares acquired under the First and Second CE Accumulators
                    to prevent them from being used to pay for shares
                    accumulated under the Disputed Accumulators or to protest
                    that these sale proceeds from the undisputed 60,000 CE
                    shares belonging to him have been wrongfully used to pay for
                    transactions that he never entered into. This lends credence
                    to CIC’s claim that the purpose of the sale was to
                    fund the purchase of new shares accumulated under the
                    Disputed Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Meetings between Teo and CIC’s
                senior management</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     On 20 November 2007,
                    Teo met with Ng and Kwek. CIC’s position is that
                    because Teo had been facing heat from Ng to top up the
                    margin shortfall for his account in order to pick up shares
                    to be delivered under the Disputed Accumulators, Teo met
                    Kwek to complain about the margin requirement and the size
                    of his exposure in the hope that CIC would then excuse Teo
                    from having to put in funds and top up the
                        margin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>
                    Teo’s position is that Teo met Kwek to complain about
                    the unauthorised transactions and to deny liability under
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     To support its position,
                    CIC had three of its officers give evidence on the
                    20 November 2007 meeting. First, Kwek’s testimony
                    was that he asked Teo at the outset whether Teo was denying
                    liability under the Disputed Accumulators and Teo’s
                    reply was “no”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Second, Ng’s
                    evidence was that at the meeting, Teo expressed his surprise
                    at the size of his exposure under the Disputed Accumulators
                    and made numerous other allegations that he was not well
                    versed in the accumulator, only dealt with blue chip shares,
                    was not aware of the risks involved with the accumulator and
                    that the Disputed Accumulators were not in proportion to his
                    net worth and risk appetite.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>
                    Third, the head of CIC’s credit risk department,
                    Ms Tay Lian See (“Tay”), gave evidence
                    that after the meeting she heard Ng asking Teo “How
                    could you”, and in response, Teo kept
                        silent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Tay’s
                    evidence was not challenged by Teo and CIC argued that this
                    substantiated CIC’s position that Ng was unhappy that
                    Teo had made false complaints to Kwek that he was not aware
                    of CIC’s margin requirements or his high exposure
                        levels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> On the
                    other hand, Teo’s testimony was that he told Kwek that
                    the Disputed Accumulators were unauthorised and that he was
                    not responsible for them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> He also gave
                    evidence that he informed Kwek that he had instructed Ng to
                    limit his exposure in accumulators to $1 million but Ng had
                    entered into the CE accumulators way in excess of the limit
                    and authority he had given her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     CIC’s position is
                    supported by the following contemporaneous note of the
                    meeting prepared by Kwek after the meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Mr Teo expressed surprise at
                            the size of his exposure. He made remarks like he is
                            not well versed with equity accumulator, he was only
                            into blue chips, he was not fully apprised of the
                            risks involved, the sizes of the contract are very
                            high relative to his networth and risk appetite,
                                <em>etc</em>. <b>When I pressed as to whether he is
                                denying the contracts, he said no but that the
                                bank has to take some responsibility for
                                them</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    I told him that if the
                            contracts are valid, then we have to address the
                            near term issue of funds to pick up the shares as
                            and when they get ‘striked’ in the weeks
                            ahead. The other issue is margin for the remaining
                            tenor of the contracts. Mr Teo did not want to
                            commit himself on these matters. He wants to meet up
                            with GM of the branch so that all his concerns can
                            be addressed. We told him that we will schedule a
                            meeting next week when the GM is back from
                            Paris.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    He questioned our margin
                            requirements <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                            the contracts done. Sue said that she had all along
                            been asking him to bring in additional funds but he
                            has not responded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On cross-examination, Teo agreed that the first
                    paragraph of Kwek’s note was an accurate
                    representation of what went on at the meeting, save for the
                    last line. I am more inclined to believe what Kwek had set
                    out in his note because there is no conceivable reason for
                    Kwek, after being informed that Teo was complaining about
                    Ng’s unauthorised trades, to then cover up Ng’s
                    misconduct and thereby taint himself as well. This is
                    especially so given that CIC is not allowed to hold equity
                    accumulators for itself, and to knowingly allow CIC to
                    continue to do so would be a very serious matter. Further,
                    if, as Teo alleged, he had told Kwek that the trades were
                    unauthorised, there would be no need to talk about his lack
                    of understanding of how accumulators worked and their
                    associated risks. These matters would be irrelevant if the
                    trades were indeed unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In fact, Teo’s
                    evidence in court is inconsistent with the contemporaneous
                    e-mail dated 21 November 2007 which Teo himself
                    authored and sent to Kwek. I set out the relevant portions
                    below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my meeting with your GM, I would like to
                        specifically address the issue on <b>how
                            do we resolve the last few deals on China Energy
                            that has an huge exposure that I did not expect nor
                            have agreed upon.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like I have mentioned in our conversation, I have been
                        misled several times which include the following;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1)    I was told by the bank that
                                <b>my total exposure</b>
                            was about S$9m which include China Energy and Sem
                            Marine about 2 weeks ago. When Sem Marine got
                            subsequently knocked out, I expect the exposure to
                            be reduced. Unfortunately, I was informed earlier
                            this week that just the China Energy exposure alone
                            now stands at S$10m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2)    I was never clear about how
                            exactly the accumulator deals worked. I have trusted
                            [Ng] to follow my clear instructions to only deal
                            with Blue Chips and also not to expose me by more
                            than S$1m, maximum. I was always assured by her that
                            she will monitor and not overdo it. I was shock
                            earlier this week when I learned about the <b>huge exposure</b> from the deals
                            on China Energy and Sem Marine that she has done in
                            early Oct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">FYI...what [Ng] had done had caused me great distress
                        and I looked forward to <b>a good
                            conversation</b> with you and your GM
                            <b>once again</b> next week.
                        Can we meet next Wednesday at 9.00am to see if we can
                        work out <b>an amicable
                            solution</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A plain reading of the first line of this e-mail
                    shows that Teo’s complaint relates to the size of the
                    exposure under the Disputed Accumulators. This is consistent
                    with subsequent parts of the e-mail where Teo expressed
                    concern that his exposure under the Disputed Accumulators
                    stood at S$10 million and his shock about the huge exposure
                    under the Disputed Accumulators and the Sembcorp
                    Accumulator. Pertinently, despite Teo’s allegation
                    that he had already made it clear that he would not be
                    liable under the Disputed Accumulators, Teo referred to
                    having been misled on his “total exposure”
                    under the Disputed Accumulators. Finally, CIC argued that
                    the final paragraph of the e-mail lent further support to
                    its case: Teo’s evidence – that he had aired his
                    complaint about the unauthorised trades but that Kwek did
                    not want to commit on the issue – was inconsistent
                    with Teo’s description of the 20 November 2007
                    meeting as being “a good conversation”.
                    Additionally, the fact that Teo expressed a willingness to
                    work out “an amicable solution” must have
                    meant that he was willing to compromise by accepting some
                    liability under the Disputed Accumulators. This is more
                    consistent with Teo’s actual complaint in this e-mail
                    that he did not know the exposure under his accumulators
                    would be so high, instead of Teo’s alleged complaint
                    in this action that he had not authorised the purchase of
                    the accumulators at all. Teo’s explanation of this
                    e-mail during cross-examination was that his English was not
                    good and that his idea of an amicable solution was to listen
                    to CIC’s management without the intention of paying a
                    single cent. I found that Teo had no problems expressing
                    himself on the witness stand and I have no doubt that
                    Teo’s English is good enough to clearly convey the
                    message that he did not tell Ng to buy the Disputed
                    Accumulators if he had in fact intended to do so. In fact,
                    this is what he eventually said to CIC, albeit after it
                    became very clear to Teo that the Disputed Accumulators were
                    unsalvageable loss-making investments, the prospect of a
                    recovery in the CE share price to any level near (or above)
                    the strike prices was slim and the prospect of the Disputed
                    Accumulators being knocked out was extremely remote (see [87
                    and <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> below). I also
                    cannot accept Teo’s strained meaning of “an
                    amicable solution”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     On 23 November 2007,
                    Teo sent another e-mail to Kwek. I set out the relevant
                    paragraph below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>I want to take this opportunity to
                            restate my position that I have never authorise [Ng]
                            at the level of investment for China Energy in early
                            Oct.</b> My instruction has always been
                        consistent at $1m maximum exposure and only on blue
                        chips. Incidentally, I did get a confirmation SMS from
                        [Ng] dated 27 Sep 07 that she understands. She confirms
                        in the SMS that Labroy Marine is blue chip. So is STX.
                        As for China Energy, she won’t be accumulating
                        much. <b>From my records, pls note that
                            all the unauthorised trade on China Energy were done
                            in the following week. Therefore, I will not bear
                            the responsibilities on these unauthorised
                            trades.</b> To be fair, I will not be
                        interested even if the shares get knocked out next week.
                        As I have mentioned in our earlier conversation, I am
                        not in this league to have such an appetite. Similarly,
                        I am also not prepared to pick up the next batch of
                        shares that you mentioned earlier that is due next
                        week.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While in the first line, Teo reiterated his
                    position in the e-mail of 21 November 2007 that he had
                    not authorised <b><em>the level of
                        investment</em></b> under the Disputed Accumulators,
                    he later referred to the trades as being
                    “unauthorised”. This is ambiguous, especially
                    in light of what was said in the first line, since the term
                    “unauthorised” may mean that no instructions
                    were given to establish accumulators or it may mean that
                    instructions were given to establish accumulators but not at
                    the level or quantity that they were eventually established.
                    As such, I find that this e-mail does not help Teo’s
                    case. Instead, it is another instance of Teo equivocating
                    (see <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> and <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     On 28 November 2007,
                    Teo met Kwek and CIC’s General Manager, Mr Jean Luc
                    Anglada (“Anglada”). Anglada gave evidence
                    that Kwek had asked Teo if he was reneging on the
                    transactions, and Teo’s answer was far from clear
                    – Teo replied that there was too much loss and too
                    much exposure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> Kwek also gave
                    evidence that Teo did not deny his liability for the
                    Disputed Accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> On the
                    other hand, Teo claimed that he restated his position that
                    he had not authorised the Disputed Accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>
                    Anglada in turn claimed that if Teo had indeed stated this,
                    CIC would have immediately closed-out the transactions and
                    then left the issue of whether the Disputed Accumulators
                    were authorised for later. However, since in Anglada’s
                    view, Teo had not made a clear claim that the transactions
                    were unauthorised, these transactions continued to be booked
                    under Teo’s account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> Anglada’s
                    position is reinforced by an e-mail dated 3 December
                    which he sent to Teo. I set out the relevant portions
                    below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To follow up with my discussion on
                            28<sup>th</sup> November 2007 with
                        Mr. Paul Kwek and yourself, I herein confirm that we are
                        investigating the matter thoroughly and will be in a
                        position to present conclusions to you as planned on
                            5<sup>th</sup> December 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the meantime, I need to reiterate that it is your
                        duty to give us instruction, even without prejudice, on
                        the position to adopt for the equity
                        accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The alternatives are:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">-</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">to instruct the bank to
                            immediately close out on the position and
                            crystallise the loss</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">-</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">to continue with the transaction
                            but you have to provide necessary funds to perform
                            the obligations under the
                        transactions.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please note that nothing in this letter should be
                        taken as an admission of your claim that the
                        transactions are unauthorised. The Bank’s position
                        is that the transactions are authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This letter is sent to you purely to set out the two
                        (2) options open to you which you can adopt, without
                        prejudice to both the Bank’s position and your
                        position on the validity of the transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Teo’s counsel argued that Anglada must have
                    known that Teo’s claim was that the transactions in
                    question were unauthorised since Anglada had stated in his
                    letter that “nothing in this letter should be taken
                    as an admission of your claim that the transactions are
                    unauthorised”. However, I find that this letter is
                    consistent with Anglada’s position that there had been
                    much equivocation from Teo and it was not clear what
                    Teo’s claim was. Thus, one of the conflicting claims
                    that Teo had been making was that the transactions were
                    unauthorised. I accept CIC’s position that the nature
                    of Teo’s complaint was not clear at this time because
                    had Teo been clear with his claim that the transactions were
                    unauthorised, CIC’s would have had to immediately
                    close out the transactions since CIC is not allowed to hold
                    shares. The fact that the transactions were not closed out
                    is testament to the fact that CIC had not gotten a clear
                    answer. Further, I accept Kwek’s and Anglada’s
                    evidence as I see no reason for both Kwek and Angalada to
                    lie in order to cover up for Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     On 5 December 2007,
                    Teo again met with Kwek and Anglada. Kwek gave evidence that
                    Teo again complained about the level of his
                        exposure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> At the meeting, Teo
                    asked for details of the Disputed Accumulators<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> and
                    the indicative cost of unwinding them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> If Teo had not
                    authorised the purchase of the Disputed Accumulators, he
                    would have concentrated on putting his position across to
                    CIC and this information should have been none of his
                    concern. His request suggests that he had in fact authorised
                    the transactions and was thus interested to find out the
                    details of his contracts and how much he would have to pay
                    if he walked away from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Teo’s rejection of the Disputed
                Accumulators</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Two months after the date
                    of the disputed transactions, CE shares were still
                    performing badly. In fact, the share price had been on a
                    general downward trend since 2 October
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     On 11 December 2007,
                    CIC gave Teo the details of the Disputed
                        Accumulators<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> and on 17 December
                    2007, CIC gave Teo their estimated unwinding costs.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> It was around
                    this time that Teo stopped equivocating and began to state
                    his position that the Disputed Accumulators were
                    unauthorised in very clear terms. In an e-mail dated
                    11 December 2007 to CIC, Teo stated that “[he]
                    did not authorise the last few trades for China
                    Energy”. Also, after Kwek provided Teo with the
                    estimated unwinding costs for the Seventh CE accumulator on
                    13 December 2007 (which amounted to up to $1.12 million
                    for one accumulator), Teo replied on the same day, stating
                    that “[he was] maintaining [his] stand that the
                    contracts were unauthorised.” By this time, the
                    market price of CE shares on the Singapore Exchange had
                    fallen to below S$1.20 per share, which largely explains why
                    the unwinding costs had become so large. The CE share price
                    had in fact dropped from the average price of about S$1.78
                    on 2 October 2011 to about S$1.16 by 17 December
                        2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>. This
                    represents a substantial drop of some 35% in the CE share
                    price. It must have been obvious to Teo by this time that it
                    was not likely for the CE share price, which was then
                    hovering around S$1.16, to recover to above the average
                    knock-out price of S$1.82 for the Third to Sixth CE
                    Accumulators or the knock-out price of S$1.73 for the
                    Seventh CE Accumulator. On 17 December 2011, Teo wrote
                    an e-mail to Anglada stating the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Per my several earlier e-mails and meetings, I
                        maintained that the last 5 China Energy Accumulators
                        contracts were not authorised by me. [Ng] had gone ahead
                        to acquire these contracts without my approval and
                        evaded providing the appropriate updates despite my
                        numerous earlier requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     CIC suggested that the
                    reason for Teo’s equivocation <em>at
                        the beginning</em> was that he was adopting a
                    wait-and-see attitude: if the Disputed CE Accumulators were
                    knocked out, he could accept the transactions and the
                    resulting profit, whereas if the price of CE shares
                    continued falling, he could (as he later did) assert that he
                    had all along denied authorising the trades and disclaim
                    liability for the Disputed Accumulators. To support their
                    contention, CIC submitted market analysts’
                    recommendations in November which projected a target price
                    of the CE shares which was higher than the Disputed
                    Accumulators’ knock-out price, indicating that profits
                    under the Disputed Accumulators were possible. It was only
                    after the Disputed Accumulators failed to be knocked out
                    after two months that Teo finally decided to clearly and
                    strongly deny authorising the trades. I find Teo’s
                    pattern of behaviour to be consistent with CIC’s
                    suggestion and with CIC’s case. His pattern of
                    behaviour does not sit well with Teo’s defence at the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     On 24 December 2007,
                    a document entitled “Watchlist and Provisions Report

                    Department via e-mail to CIC’s head office in Paris.
                    Tay gave evidence that the Watchlist Report had been

                    entitled “reasons for watchlist/provisions” in
                    the Watchlist Report, the following is stated:</p>

                        shares that may be picked up during the life of the
                        equity accumulator. Based on estimated unwinding cost of
                        the equity as at end Nov 07, against the market value of
                        the customer’s asset held by the bank, there is a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Teo argued that the bolded
                    words in the passage quoted above suggested that CIC was
                    aware on 30 November 2007 that Teo was alleging that
                    the Disputed Accumulators were unauthorised and that this
                    contradicted Kwek’s note of the 20 November 2007
                    meeting and the evidence of Kwek and Anglada that Teo did
                    not deny that the Disputed Accumulators were authorised at
                    the meetings of 20 November 2007 and 28 November
                    2007. This argument cannot stand in light of Tay’s
                    evidence that the Watchlist Report was prepared in
                    mid-December using materials dated up to and including
                    11 December 2007. This meant that the Watchlist Report
                    reflected what Tay was aware of in mid-December. Tay gave
                    evidence that her statement in the Watchlist Report that Teo
                    was arguing that he had not authorised the Disputed
                    Accumulators was based on the claim that he had made in his
                    e-mail. However, she further deposed that because “it
                    was not clear whether [Teo] was merely complaining about the
                    exposure being too high or whether he was disclaiming the
                    Disputed Accumulators entirely”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>, she
                    wrote in the Watchlist Report that it was necessary for Teo
                    to “clarify his trading positions” so that CIC
                    could decide whether to unwind the Disputed Accumulators. I
                    accept Tay’s explanation of what she wrote in the
                    Watchlist Report as an accurate representation of the
                    situation in mid-December because it is evident that
                    Teo’s claim in his e-mail of 11 December 2007 has
                    now become one of a complete lack of authority, but with his
                    previous equivocation it remained unclear what his true
                    position was.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Having dealt with the
                    arguments on the events of 2 October 2007 and
                    3 October 2007, and the conduct of CIC and Teo after
                    the establishment of the Disputed Accumulators, I will now
                    address CIC’s and Teo’s other arguments on why
                    it was or was not likely that Teo instructed the purchase of
                    the Disputed Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Ng’s motivation for entering into
                unauthorised transactions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     CIC argued that there is
                    no plausible motivation for Ng to enter into unauthorised
                    transactions whereas it is clear why Teo would want to
                    disclaim liability for huge loss-making
                        investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Teo
                    suggested two reasons as Ng’s motivation. First, he
                    argued that Ng wanted to cover up a mistake that she or PBA
                    had made when placing orders for accumulators. I have found
                    that this was not the case (at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>-<a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> above). Second, Teo argued that Ng did
                    unauthorised trades in order to receive a bigger bonus. To
                    refute this claim, Anglada and Kwek gave evidence on
                    Ng’s remuneration structure. Kwek gave evidence that
                    Ng’s bonus was a function of a few factors, including
                    whether Ng met her revenue and Assets Under Management
                    (“AUM”) targets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Since, at the end
                    of September 2007, Ng was very close to the revenue target
                    which she had to reach by December 2007 but far from her AUM
                        target,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>
                    it would have made sense for her to be focussing on reaching
                    her AUM target.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> Anglada and Kwek
                    gave evidence that buying unauthorised accumulators would
                    not have helped Ng to reach her AUM target.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> If shares delivered under
                    an accumulator are paid for with money from the
                    client’s account, the relationship manager’s AUM
                    would stay the same. While the relationship manager’s
                    AUM would increase if CIC grants a loan to the client to pay
                    for the accumulated shares or if the client deposits money
                    with CIC for the margin requirement, this would also
                    necessitate the client finding out that an unauthorised
                    transaction had taken place on his account as the
                    relationship manger would have to explain why a loan or
                    margin top-up was necessary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>
                    Finally, I explored the possibility that Ng was bullish on
                    CE shares and had wanted to use Teo’s account or a
                    fictitious account to trade to benefit herself, and I was
                    convinced by the answers from Kwek that this could not have
                    been done:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">Thus, from the evidence given by CIC’s
                    officers, which I accept, there was little for Ng to gain
                    and a lot for her to lose, including incurring civil and
                    criminal liability, from doing unauthorised trades using the
                    clients’ accounts and without clients’
                    instructions. This lends support to my finding that the
                    trades were, on balance, more likely to have been
                    authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Ng’s draft e-mail to Teo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Both parties made
                    submissions on the Draft E-Mail (at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above). Teo argued that the italicised
                    words in the Draft E-mail meant that Teo must have raised
                    some dispute concerning the Disputed Accumulators, and the
                    fact that Ng had not sent the Draft-Email to Teo could be
                    because Teo had not agreed to accept the Disputed
                        Accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>
                    CIC in turn argued that the italicised words are consistent
                    with Ng’s evidence that on 13 November 2007,
                    (which is the date of the conversation which Ng refers to in
                    the Draft-Email) Teo had reassured her that he would not be
                    walking away from the transactions and would remit the
                    necessary funds to top up his margin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> I am of
                    the opinion that the italicised words are ambiguous: they
                    could be a reference to a complaint that Teo had about the
                    Disputed Accumulators, though there is no indication of what
                    the nature of this complaint might be, or they could refer
                    to assurances from Teo that he would comply with his
                    obligations under the Disputed Accumulators. It is difficult
                    to draw any inference from the fact that the Draft E-mail
                    was never sent. I cannot accept Teo’s submission that
                    Ng had not sent it because what she wrote about Teo agreeing
                    to see through the accumulators was false, since it would
                    not make sense for Ng to draft an e-mail to Teo describing a
                    conversation that never occurred and then keep
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Complaints of Ng’s other
                clients</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Both parties made
                    arguments in relation to Ng’s other clients –
                    Client A, Client B and Client C – whose orders CIC
                    claimed to have been consolidated with Teo’s orders to
                    establish the Disputed Accumulators and the Sembcorp
                    Accumulator. Teo argued that both the fact that Client A and
                    Client B had complained that they had not authorised the
                    establishment of the Disputed Accumulators and the Sembcorp
                    Accumulator, and the fact that Client C had claimed that his
                    share of the Disputed Accumulators had exceeded his mandate
                    to Ng, lends support to his case that he had not authorised
                    Ng as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In response, CIC argued
                    that the complaints of Ng’s other clients were without
                    merit for several reasons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>
                    First, the other clients only complained after the price of
                    CE shares had fallen and recovery was a dim prospect.
                    Second, the other clients made payments in response to
                    CIC’s margin calls associated with the Disputed
                    Accumulators. None of them objected when CIC liquidated
                    assets in their accounts and set off the proceeds to reduce
                    the margin shortfall. Third, the other clients voluntarily
                    remitted fresh funds thereby ensuring that their
                    accumulators would not be terminated while they sought to
                    negotiate with CIC. Client A remitted US$388,000 to CIC on
                    18 October 2007, Client B remitted US$25,000 to CIC on
                    12 February 2008 and Client C paid in full and remains
                    a client of CIC. Fourth, the transcript of the recorded
                    conversation between Client A and Ng on 3 October 2007
                    (see entry number 10 in the Table of Events of
                    3 October 2007) shows that Client A had agreed to Ng
                    queuing up to buy CE and Sembcorp accumulators and that
                    Client A was indeed aware that Ng had placed an order for
                    the Seventh CE Accumulator and the Sembcorp Accumulator on
                    his behalf. I set out the relevant portion of the transcript
                        below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     It is perhaps not entirely
                    surprising that all the clients involved in the Disputed
                    Accumulators should raise some complaint or other, given the
                    large amount of losses racked up under these accumulators.
                    As such, I am unable to say, as Teo’s counsel has,
                    that it is “too much of a coincidence” that
                    they too have complained and that this leads to an inference
                    that there is validity in all the complaints, including
                    Teo’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     If I were to disregard the
                    fact that I have not heard the testimony of Client A and
                    Client B, then the evidence presented by CIC appears to
                    point instead to the direction that the trades for Clients A
                    and B were not unauthorised. From the totality of the
                    evidence adduced by CIC in relation to the trades of Client
                    A, Client B and Client C, they appear to contradict
                    Teo’s allegation that Ng had also entered into
                    unauthorised accumulator transactions for these other
                    clients of hers. Hence, I do not think that the evidence
                    adduced in relation to the complaints of Client A, Client B
                    and Client C, if I were to take them into account to decide
                    Teo’s case, would have assisted Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     However, in my opinion, it
                    is not the purpose of this action, to make findings on
                    whether or not the complaints of Ng’s other clients
                    are valid, and it is also not proper to do so given that I
                    do not have all the evidence, such as the testimony of the
                    clients themselves, before me. Teo’s use of shreds of
                    evidence showing complaints from other clients (likely also
                    to be inadmissible hearsay evidence if it is to prove the
                    truth of their complaints when these other clients are not
                    called as witnesses) to argue that Ng had established
                    accumulators without authority from her other clients,
                    making it similarly likely that she had established the
                    Disputed Accumulators without Teo’s authority because
                    she has the propensity to enter into unauthorised trades,
                    seems to me to be an attempt at using similar fact evidence
                    to bolster his defence, and I think also in circumstances
                    where their prejudicial value far exceeds their probative
                    value, which is something that I will not allow. Similarly,
                    I must hasten to add that in deciding this case, I have not
                    taken into account any evidence adduced by CIC to show that
                    the alleged complaints of Client A, Client B and Client C
                    were untrue. Accordingly, in coming to my decision for this
                    case, I have completely ignored all such evidence adduced by
                    both CIC and Teo in respect of Clients A, B and
                C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    If I am wrong to do so
                    and if I should have taken such evidence into account
                    instead, then my view is that the totality of the evidence
                    points towards the direction that Ng had not entered into
                    any unauthorised transactions in relation to her Clients A,
                    B and C, thereby showing that it is not likely for Ng to
                    have done the contrary with respect to Teo. Teo’s use
                    of the complaints of Clients A, B and C to support his case
                    backfired as CIC had strong objective evidence to prove to
                    the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Teo’s trading pattern</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Both parties claimed
                    that Teo’s trading pattern supported their respective
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Teo’s position was
                    that since he had never bought accumulators with such large
                    maximum obligations within two days, he was unlikely to have
                    done so on 2 October 2007 and 3 October
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> I find however that the
                    evidence reflects the contrary. First, Teo had accepted
                    banking facilities for up to US$15 million in total (which
                    was several times the amount of his cash deposits with CIC).
                    He had requested for and was given a loan facility of up to
                    US$5 million, an amount of up to US$5 million to facilitate
                    his entering into Treasury Contracts and an amount of up to
                    US$5 million to facilitate his entering into Margin Trading
                    Transactions. It would appear from this that from the
                    beginning of his banking relationship with CIC, Teo had
                    already made plans to enter into large trading and
                    investment transactions. As such, he must have an appetite
                    for taking on the kind of risks involved when assuming the
                    large obligations that naturally flow from making such large
                    transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Second, the previous
                    pattern of trades as can be seen from the <b><em>undisputed</em></b> transactions prior to
                    2 October 2007, shows that he in fact had exposed
                    himself to huge total maximum obligations from several
                    accumulator trade positions which were simultaneously
                    open/alive at the same time (<em>i.e.</em> before they were knocked out). Yet
                    while still having large maximum obligations, he continued
                    to buy more accumulators and further expose himself to even
                    greater total maximum obligations. I will start by giving
                    the <em>first</em> example. While the
                    second Noble Accumulator (item number 2 in the Table of
                    Accumulators) purchased on 25 July 2007 was still open
                    with a maximum obligation of S$1,069,770, he purchased
                    another accumulator, the Keppel Accumulator, on
                    1 August 2007 which had a maximum obligation of
                    $663,805 (item number 3 in the Table of Accumulators),
                    thereby exposing himself to a total obligation of
                    S$1,733,575. His maximum exposure returned to S$1,069,770
                    when this Keppel Accumulator was knocked out on
                    3 August 2007. A <em>second</em>
                    example. While the second Noble Accumulator (item number 2
                    in the Table of Accumulators) purchased on 25 July 2007
                    was still open with a maximum obligation of S$1,069,770 and
                    had not yet been knocked out, he added two Keppel
                    Accumulators (item numbers 4 and 5 in the Table of
                    Accumulators) on 13 and 15 August 2007 respectively to
                    his accumulator positions. This meant that for the period
                    between the 15 August 2007 and 23 August 2007, a
                    total of three accumulator positions were simultaneously
                    open and he was therefore exposed to a total maximum
                    obligation of S$2,431,015 for that period. On 23 August
                    2007, one of the Keppel Accumulators was knocked out and his
                    total maximum exposure was reduced to S$1,760,958. On
                    27 August 2007, the remaining Keppel Accumulator was
                    also knocked out and his total maximum exposure dropped back
                    to S$1,069,770, which was the exposure from the second Noble
                    Accumulator that was still running. A <em>third</em> example will demonstrate his risk
                    appetite for accumulators growing even further as he was
                    getting more experience from buying them. While this second
                    Noble Accumulator (item number 2 in the Table of
                    Accumulators) was still open, he further purchased two DBS
                    Accumulators on 13 September 2007 (item numbers 7 and 8
                    in the Table of Accumulators) with maximum obligations of
                    S$1,795,086 and S$1,822,561 respectively. Then he added on
                    yet another DBS Accumulator purchased on 18 September
                    2007 (item number 9 in the Table of Accumulators). This
                    meant that for the period between 13 September 2007 and
                    17 September 2007, he had altogether three accumulator
                    positions open simultaneously. His maximum total exposure on
                    these three accumulators ballooned to a hefty total of
                    S$4,687,417. When he further added the third DBS Accumulator
                    on 18 September 2007, his maximum total exposure
                    increased further to S$6,867,205. Fortunately for him, two
                    of the three DBS Accumulators were knocked out on the next
                    day, <em>i.e</em>.19 September
                    2007 (item numbers 7 and 9 in the Table of Accumulators),
                    whereupon his maximum total exposure reduced to S$2,892,331.
                    More examples can be given but it is not necessary to so.
                    These examples from his previous trading history in
                    accumulators show that taking on very large positions in
                    accumulators is nothing exceptional for him. In fact, it
                    shows his appetite for taking on huge risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Due to the highly
                    leveraged nature of the accumulator product, Teo might have
                    thought that he could undertake the large obligations since
                    he does not have to pay upfront the full amount of the
                    maximum obligation at the time of purchase. The maximum
                    obligation is computed by multiplying the strike price by
                    the total number of those shares that the investor is
                    obliged to accumulate at double the ordinary rate in the
                    worst case scenario that the market price remains below the
                    strike price throughout the whole accumulation period of one
                    year. Since the delivery and payment for the shares are
                    evenly spread out throughout the year, the investor does not
                    need to have ready cash to pay the full amount of the
                    maximum obligation in order to establish the accumulator. If
                    luck is with the investor and the price moves upwards beyond
                    the knock-out price, the accumulator is knocked out and the
                    obligation to accept further delivery ceases. The
                    “maximum obligation” thus falls away to zero.
                    Hence, the “maximum obligation” of an
                    accumulator gives an indication of the investor’s
                    maximum potential loss in the very unlikely scenario that
                    the all underlying shares delivered are worthless (<em>i.e.</em> share price has collapsed to
                    zero and remains at zero for the whole year.) I will now
                    explain how an investor may fund the purchase of an
                    accumulator with a minimum outlay. I will take the example
                    of the Seventh CE Accumulator that has a maximum obligation
                    of $4,571,400 based on an accumulation per day of 6,000 CE
                    shares. Assume that the CE share price stays above the
                    strike price. Assume delivery is on a weekly basis and a
                    week is taken as 5 working days. Teo would then have to pay
                    about $45,714 a week (<em>i.e</em>.
                    strike or discounted price of $1.5238 x 6,000 x 5) for the
                    30,000 CE shares delivered to him per week as long as the
                    market price of CE shares remains above the strike price of
                    $1.5238. The price paid of S$45,714 is at a discount because
                    the 30,000 CE shares are actually worth about $50,400
                        (<em>i.e</em>. initial price of
                    $1.68 x 6,000 x 5) at the time of establishing the Seventh
                    CE Accumulator. If the price of CE shares rises by 3 cents
                    to $1.71, Teo would still pay the same amount of $45,714 but
                    now for $51,300 (<em>i.e</em>. market
                    price of $1.71 x 6,000 x 5) worth of shares. He can then
                    sell these shares for a profit of $5,586 (<em>i.e</em>. $51,300 minus $45,714) and apply the
                    sale proceeds to pay for the CE shares that would be
                    delivered the next week. If, however, the price of CE shares
                    falls by 20 cents to $1.48, with the doubling effect, Teo
                    would pay $91,428 (<em>i.e</em>. strike
                    or discounted price of $1.5238 x 12,000 x 5) for $88,800
                        (<em>i.e</em>. market price of
                    $1.48 x 12,000 x 5) worth of shares. He can then sell these
                    shares for a loss of $2,628 ($91,428 minus $88,800) and
                    re-use the sale proceeds to help pay for the CE shares to be
                    delivered the following week.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Two observations are
                    pertinent. <em>First</em>, a 3 cents
                    rise in the market price of the CE shares brings him a large
                    profit of $5,586 yet a much larger drop of 20 cents in the
                    market price of the CE shares brings him only a fairly small
                    loss of $2,628. The structured accumulator product appears
                    to give a relatively good bargain. To the investor who is
                    not familiar with the kind of high risks involved in such
                    structured financial products and the effects of volatility
                    on the probability of a substantial loss where there is an
                    upper limit set via a knock-out price when the price rises
                    but there is no corresponding pre-set knock-out price on the
                    downside when the price falls, these accumulators would on
                    the surface appear to be an attractive leveraged play. There
                    is a good buffer from falls in the price of the CE shares in
                    the form of a discounted price at which the investor is to
                    accumulate the CE shares. I would not be surprised if this
                    superficially “attractive feature” of the
                    accumulator had influenced Teo into making such bold moves
                    to take on large accumulator positions. <em>Second</em>, if Teo continues to sell the Seventh
                    CE accumulator shares immediately each time they are
                    delivered to him, then he does not have to fork out that
                    much money to see through his obligations for that
                    accumulator even though his maximum obligation is as high as
                    S$4.571 million. He can then take on bigger accumulator
                    positions without too much worry. If one were to harbour a
                    bullish view on CE shares, in that it is highly improbable
                    for the CE share price to fall from the current spot price
                    at the time of establishing the accumulator of S$1.68 to a
                    price below the pre-set discounted price of S$1.52 (given
                    the buffer of 16 cents on the downside), then it is possible
                    to continuously roll each transaction as explained above and
                    to keep selling each consignment of CE shares delivered at
                    the market price to pay for the purchase of the next
                    consignment of CE shares. If the investor is right on his
                    outlook for CE shares that the market price will stay above
                    S$1.52, then he can readily see through the Seventh CE
                    Accumulator even when the total potential obligation may be
                    as high as S$4.571 million and he has only $500,000
                    deposited with the bank. In the process, he will also make a
                    lot of money. Of course, as with everything else, if his
                    outlook is very wrong and the share price nose dives and he
                    fails to unwind fast enough, then he will quickly suffer
                    large losses because it is a leveraged play with double
                    accumulation and there is no pre-set knock-out price on the
                    downside when the price falls. Thus, I find it difficult to
                    accept Teo’s argument that it is inconceivable for
                    him, a man of modest means with only about S$500,000 worth
                    of assets with CIC, to enter into CE accumulators with a
                    maximum obligation of S$10 million to S$11 million and a
                    Sembcorp accumulator with a maximum obligation of S$3
                    million. Whether or not to enter into the CE Accumulator
                    transaction depends more on his outlook on the likely future
                    performance of CE shares rather than on his lack of
                    financial capacity to enter those transactions, which on the
                    facts as explained above did not and would not prevent him
                    from entering those trades in question if he had wanted
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I accept the contention
                    of CIC that since Teo had profited from all his previous
                    accumulators, and because he had a strong positive outlook
                    on CE shares<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>,
                    he became greedier and ventured to take more risk by
                    entering even larger CE accumulator positions. In this case,
                    greed came before the fall. At that time on 2 and
                    3 October 2007, there was evidence of much bullishness
                    in the Singapore market on shares of China based firms
                    listed on the Singapore Exchange. The price of CE was
                    rapidly rising from 27 September 2007, when it was
                    trading at about S$1.41 (see item 12 in the Table of
                    Accumulators). It rose quickly to S$1.67 on 1 October
                    2007 (see item 14 in the Table of Accumulators). When the
                    stock market opened for trading the following day on
                    2 October 2007, the price of CE share literally shot
                    upwards to S$1.81 (see item 17 in the Table of
                    Accumulators). This is a spectacular rise of 28% in the
                    price of CE shares within a matter of days. Teo’s
                    Second CE Accumulator established on 1 October 2007 was
                    immediately knocked out the next day due to the rapidly
                    rising CE counter, with punters chasing up its stock price.
                    That in part I think explains why Teo urgently sent an SMS
                    to Ng as early as 7:47 am that morning of 2 October
                    2007, probably with a view to purchase even more CE
                    Accumulators. I find that Teo at that time was very bullish
                    on the CE counter and that was the reason why he was
                    prepared to take the risk of entering into such large CE
                    Accumulator transactions on both 2 October 2007 and
                    3 October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I further note that Teo
                    admitted in his own evidence in court that he had at 9:34 am
                    on 2 October 2007 specifically instructed Ng to sell
                    his Cosco shares but keep his CE shares. He was therefore
                    even more bullish on the CE shares than he was with Cosco
                    shares. The undisputed fact that he chose to keep the CE
                    shares delivered to him under the First and Second CE
                    Accumulators instead of immediately selling them off for a
                    profit reflects his bullishness on this stock at that time.
                    It is not surprising to me that he had gone on to
                    “bang hard on this counter”. Teo would have
                    made a lot of money but for the fact that the CE share price
                    gradually started falling not long after the Third to
                    Seventh CE Accumulators were established. What started as a
                    gradual fall became a persistent fall, from which the CE
                    share price never recovered, resulting in huge financial
                    losses eventually for Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    For Teo who had been
                    successfully punting on accumulators since 20 July 2007
                    and who was making good returns on them whilst the going was
                    good, I find it hard to believe that he would step hard on
                    the brakes and suddenly stop doing any more accumulators on
                    2 October 2007 as he appears to be claiming. It is hard
                    to stop whilst still having a successful run. Teo failed to
                    give me a reason that would reasonably convince me on why he
                    decided to stop trading in accumulators on 2 October
                    2007, especially when both Teo and Ng, who was advising him,
                    were still so bullish on CE shares. The reasons that he gave
                    for stopping – because accumulators were risky
                    investments and because of the sub-prime crisis (which did
                    not prevent him from holding on to his CE shares accumulated
                    under the First and Second CE Accumulators) – hardly
                    persuaded me at all. The timing of his alleged realisation
                    that he should stop dabbling in accumulators, which
                    coincided with the losing trade on the CE accumulators, was
                    just too remarkably coincidental and too fortuitous. If
                    indeed Teo’s explanation is not made up, then I would
                    have to believe that he was especially blessed with very
                    good foresight and good fortune to be able to stop just in
                    the neck of time, and it was simply Ng’s bad luck to
                    start trading behind his back (whether or not for her own
                    benefit) just at this point of time when the CE share price
                    was turning down and the CE Accumulators were going to
                    become instruments of financial disaster. On balance, I
                    think that Teo has denied his instructions to Ng to purchase
                    the Disputed Accumulators in an attempt to escape from his
                    obligations under the Disputed Accumulators, which turned
                    out to be loss-making.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Teo’s various mandates to
                Ng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Teo argued that he could
                    not have instructed Ng to purchase the Disputed Accumulators
                    because these accumulators were outside the confines of the
                    mandate which he had given to Ng. Teo claimed to have given
                    Ng different mandates at different times but he had
                    difficulty expressing what these mandates were and during
                    which period each mandate applied. First, Teo pleaded in his
                    Defence and Counterclaim that on 20 July 2007 <em>before</em> he established any
                    accumulator, he expressly instructed Ng that his exposure on
                    accumulators should not exceed the value of his deposits
                    with CIC, which was about S$500,000, and that he would only
                    accumulate shares which are “blue chips” (the
                    “Alleged First Mandate”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> However, in his
                    Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”), he
                    stated that he told Ng to limit his exposure to the value of
                    his deposits with CIC <em>after</em>
                    the first accumulator that he had established was knocked
                    out on 23 July 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>, which is different
                    from what he had pleaded earlier. During cross-examination,
                    he began by claiming that what he pleaded in his Defence and
                    Counterclaim was true<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> but when questioned
                    further, he said that what was in his AEIC was
                        true,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> thus implying that
                    what was stated in his Defence and Counterclaim was now
                    wrong. Second, Teo claimed during cross-examination that he
                    changed his mandate to $1 million somewhere between
                    10 September 2007 and 13 September 2007 (the
                    “Alleged Second Mandate”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Third, Teo stated that
                    before the third DBS accumulator was done on
                    18 September 2007, he asked Ng what his exposure would
                    be if he were to go into the third DBS accumulator. When she
                    replied “$2 million”, he agreed because DBS
                    was a “blue chip” (the “Alleged Third
                        Mandate”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> Fourth, Teo pleaded
                    in his Defence and Counterclaim that on 27 September
                    2007, he specifically instructed Ng to accumulate only
                    “blue chip” share counters and to limit his
                    exposure to about $1 million (the “Alleged Fourth
                        Mandate”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span>
                    When questioned under cross-examination on why, then, did he
                    authorise the First CE Accumulator on 27 September 2007
                    when to his mind CE was not a “blue
                        chip”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> he stated that it
                    was because the maximum exposure was under $1
                        million.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Even if I were to accept
                    Teo’s evidence that there were these four mandates in
                    force at different periods (which CIC disputed), it does not
                    support Teo’s case that he could not have authorised
                    the purchase of the Disputed Accumulators. I find that the
                    inconsistencies present in Teo’s evidence about his
                    mandates are significant because if he himself was not clear
                    about what his mandates were and when they applied, how
                    could Ng have been aware what exactly were the restrictions
                    placed on her? Further, it can be seen that Teo’s
                    alleged mandates were not set in stone: he may decide to
                    establish accumulators that exceed his mandate (as in the
                    case of the third DBS accumulator) or Ng may ask him for
                    permission to go beyond his mandate and he may agree (as in
                    the case of the First CE Accumulator). This meant it was
                    open for Ng to ask Teo if he wanted to purchase the Disputed
                    Accumulators which were on a non-blue chip share counter and
                    beyond the $1 million limit that he claimed was in place on
                    2 October 2007 and 3 October 2007. Indeed, she did
                    ask Teo in her SMS on 2 October 2007 whether she could
                    “do some more” and she was looking at China
                    Energy, Cosco and Ferrochina, which are all clearly non-blue
                    chip share counters (see entry number 2 in the Table of
                    Events of 2 October 2007). In this SMS, it does not
                    appear to me that she was seeking permission to vary his
                    alleged specific mandate prohibiting her from doing non-blue
                    chips. In other words, there was no hint in the SMS that Ng
                    was asking whether she could order more accumulators based
                    on these counters for him because they were non-blue chips
                    and a variation to his mandate had to be sought first. It
                    must be borne in mind that prior to this SMS on
                    2 October 2007, Ng had already purchased for him two
                    Cosco Accumulators (one on 25 September 2007 and the
                    other on 1 October 2007) and two CE Accumulators (one
                    on 27 September 2007 and the other on 1 October
                    2007), which were the same non-blue chip counters for which
                    she was asking whether more could be done. Finally, I note
                    that for every mandate Teo alleged to have given to Ng,
                    there is at least one example of an accumulator which fell
                    outside of the mandate and which Teo has never alleged to be
                    unauthorised. When the Alleged First Mandate was in force,
                    the second Noble accumulator entered into on 25 July
                    2007 and the Keppel accumulators entered into from
                    1 August 2007 to 10 September 2007 each had a
                    maximum obligation exceeding $500,000. When the Alleged
                    Second Mandate was in force, the DBS accumulators entered
                    into on 13 September 2007 each had a maximum obligation
                    exceeding $1 million. When Teo gave the Alleged Third
                    Mandate on 18 September 2007, his total maximum
                    obligation under all his accumulators exceeded $2 million.
                    When the Alleged Fourth Mandate was in force, the Second
                    Cosco accumulator and the Second CE Accumulator entered into
                    on 1 October 2007 each had a maximum obligation
                    exceeding $1 million. Teo has not disputed that the term
                    sheets of all these accumulators were sent to him and he has
                    not alleged that the accumulators were entered into in
                    excess of his authority in the sense that the dollar limits
                    of exposure set under his various changing mandates had been
                    exceeded on each of the transactions or that they were
                    non-blue chips when they should have been only blue chips.
                    As such, Teo’s arguments on his alleged mandates to Ng
                    do not help his case. In fact, I find it hard to believe
                    that there was such a series of complicated and changing
                    mandates imposed on Ng. I believe that Teo was tailoring his
                    evidence and creating these fictional mandates to suit his
                    version of the facts for what were authorised, and what were
                    allegedly unauthorised transactions carried out in breach of
                    his mandate on dollar quantum or for blue chip counters
                    only, with changes or ad hoc exceptions made to his so
                    called mandates created along the way to try to accommodate
                    those undisputed transactions that fell outside his mandate.
                    In the course of inventing these multiple mandates, he got
                    himself entangled in his own web of lies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Teo’s lack of knowledge and
                diligence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Teo claimed that Ng
                    never informed him, prior to 19 November 2007, that the
                    accumulators required him to accumulate double the quantity
                    of shares at the discounted/strike price if the market price
                    fell below the discounted price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> Further, Teo
                    claimed that Ng never informed him that he could terminate
                    an accumulator prior to its maturity or before it was
                    knocked out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>
                    However, it is set out clearly in the Risk Disclosure
                    Statement (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above)
                    that Teo is to make his own assessment before entering into
                    any transaction and that CIC is not responsible to give any
                    advice or recommendation. If Teo did not know or understand
                    the features of the accumulator, as he has alleged, the onus
                    was on him to either consult professionals or even ask Ng
                    and he cannot now blame Ng for his lack of knowledge on the
                    product. Further, the doubling effect is set out clearly in
                    the term sheets sent to him after each accumulator was
                    established. In fact, he has purchased many undisputed
                    accumulators and received many term sheets clearly stating
                    the doubling effect prior to the present disputed
                    transactions. It is his own folly if he chooses not to read
                    them and wants to remain ignorant of what the terms of the
                    accumulators were. It seems that he is prepared to indulge
                    in high risk behaviour by entering into sizeable
                    transactions without even bothering to read what the terms
                    are all about. More importantly, the fact that Teo did not
                    know about the doubling effect or that accumulators could be
                    closed-out at a certain cost (even if his absence of
                    knowledge is true) is irrelevant to the question of whether
                    Teo had instructed Ng to establish the Disputed
                    Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Teo also claimed that he
                    did not read the three contracts that he signed when he
                    opened his account and that he also did not read the letters
                    sent to him by CIC and thus never saw the term sheets,
                    confirmation notes, statements of account and loan
                    confirmation slips. However, Teo’s lack of diligence
                    cannot save him as it is trite law that, subject to certain
                    exceptions which are inapplicable and need not concern us
                    here, a person is bound by a contract that he has signed,
                    whether he has read and understood its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Finding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    For all the above
                    reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities that Teo
                    instructed Ng to purchase the Disputed Accumulators. I am
                    even prepared to go further to say that the evidence leaning
                    against him is fairly overwhelming. As such, it is not
                    necessary to examine the issue of whether Teo is estopped
                    from denying that he had authorised Ng to purchase the
                    Disputed Accumulators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What CIC is entitled to claim from Teo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I now turn to the
                    question of what CIC is entitled to claim from Teo. When
                    Teo, after receiving the letter of demand dated
                    14 March 2008 from CIC’s solicitors, failed to
                    pay the sum he owed CIC for shares delivered to him under
                    the Disputed Accumulators, it was a clear repudiation of the
                    contracts between CIC and Teo whereby CIC agreed to deliver
                    shares to Teo pursuant to the terms of the Disputed
                    Accumulators and Teo agreed to pay for them. CIC elected to
                    accept Teo’s repudiation and exercised its rights
                    under the Terms and Conditions of the Account Opening and
                    Custodian Agreement and the Terms and Conditions for
                    Treasury Services (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> and <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) to close-out and terminate the
                    Disputed Accumulators. This resulted in CIC having to pay
                    closing-out costs to its counterparties. Thus, Teo is
                    contractually obliged to pay the outstanding amounts due to
                    CIC for the CE shares delivered to him pursuant to the
                    Disputed Accumulators until the various closing-out dates
                    (at [21]). Teo is
                    also liable in contractual damages to CIC for the
                    closing-out costs (at [20]) as these are losses flowing naturally
                    from Teo’s repudiatory breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Teo did not challenge
                    CIC’s right to close-out and terminate the Disputed
                    Accumulators. However, he argued that he should not be
                    liable for the closing-out costs because the terms sheets
                    for the Disputed Accumulators do not provide that he is
                    liable to pay these costs and CIC cannot unilaterally impose
                    them on Teo. This argument cannot be accepted because the
                    term sheets need not provide what Teo must pay in the event
                    that he breaches the contracts; this falls to be determined
                    by ordinary contract principles which require him to pay the
                    reasonably foreseeable losses caused to CIC and this must
                    include the closing-out costs. Teo further argued that since
                    Anglada testified that it was CIC’s internal policy to
                    immediately close-out an accumulator which is alleged to
                    have been unauthorised and it was clear, at least by
                    23 November 2007, that Teo was making such allegations
                    about the Disputed Accumulators, CIC should have closed-out
                    the Disputed Accumulators and sold the CE shares accumulated
                    thereunder in November 2007 or December 2007 instead of
                    April 2008, something which would have cut CIC’s
                    losses. I do not accept this argument. In the first place,
                    CIC’s internal policy is not law and CIC is not
                    legally obliged to follow it. While, in law, an innocent
                    party to a contract which has been breached has a duty to
                    mitigate his losses, I do not find it so unreasonable of CIC
                    to have only closed-out the accumulator transactions in
                    April 2008 because Teo had not made his position clear until
                    about mid-December 2007 and the direction in which the
                    market would move from then on was anyone’s guess.
                    This is not a case where the earlier CIC unwound the
                    transactions, the smaller the losses will invariably be.
                    With hindsight, of course one can say CIC should have
                    unwound the positions immediately in mid-December 2007 when
                    Teo was no longer equivocating and the losses would have
                    been smaller. What happens if the CE share price recovers
                    strongly after unwinding in mid-December 2007? Share prices
                    are always volatile and CE shares are no exception. In any
                    case, it does not lie in the mouth of the wrongdoing party
                    to a contract to split hairs on what the innocent party
                    should or should not have done, and this is more so here
                    when CIC asked Teo a few times whether he wanted to
                    close-out the Disputed Accumulators and Teo refused to
                    answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Teo did not dispute that
                    CIC had the right under the overarching contractual
                    documents to realise the assets held in Teo’s account
                    and to apply the sale proceeds towards settlement of the
                    outstanding amount due from Teo to CIC under the Disputed
                    Accumulators. After the set-off, Teo still owed CIC
                    $6,408.196.77 and CIC extended to Teo various loans to cover
                    this amount. Teo challenged his liability under these loans
                    on the ground that he had never given any drawdown notices
                    to CIC under the loan facility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> CIC
                    responded that the past dealings between Teo and Ng showed
                    that there was an understanding between the parties that
                    where Teo had insufficient funds to pick up the shares under
                    an accumulator, a loan should be utilised to pick up the
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span>
                    I find this to be the case given that CIC had previously
                    provided loans to Teo for the purpose of picking up shares
                    under the undisputed accumulators and since Teo claimed
                    never to have requested any loans, Teo would not have
                    requested these loans. Yet, upon receiving the loan
                    confirmation notes which stated that “[CIC] must be
                    notified in writing of any errors or omissions within 14
                    days ... or the client is deemed to have agreed to the
                    transaction details”, Teo never disputed CIC’s
                    authority to extend these loans. The implication would be
                    that Teo had acquiesced to the extension of these loans.
                    More pertinently, Teo also did not raise any issue on the
                    loans extended to him for the Disputed Accumulators until
                    the commencement of this suit, long after the 14-day period
                    for objecting had passed. Thus, I find these loans to have
                    been validly extended, meaning that Teo was liable to CIC as
                    of 29 August 2008 for $6,459,519.83, being the sum
                    stated on the conclusive certificate of indebtedness issued
                    by CIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    For the above reasons, I
                    give judgment for CIC and dismiss Teo’s counterclaims.
                    Teo is to pay CIC the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     $2,782,803.66
                        for the shares delivered to Teo pursuant to the terms of
                        the Disputed Accumulators;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     $3,625,393.11 for the costs
                        of closing out the Disputed Accumulators;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_c"></a>(c)     Interest of S$51,323.06 as at 29 August 2008
                        for the loans extended by CIC to
                Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I will also state that
                    even without the admission of the evidence of Ng under s 33
                    of the EA, I would still have given judgment for CIC because
                    on the totality of the other evidence before me, much of it
                    being circumstantial in nature, I do find that they lead me
                    to the irresistible conclusion that Teo must have given Ng
                    the requisite instructions on 2 October 2007 and
                    3 October 2007 to enter into the Disputed Accumulator
                    transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Subject to parties
                    wishing to address me on costs, I will order costs on an
                    indemnity basis which is as provided in the Account Opening
                    and Custodian Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Finally, I observe that
                    the difficulties encountered in this case could have been
                    easily obviated through the recording of the phone calls
                    between Ng and Teo. It is worthwhile for banks and
                    relationship managers to consider adopting the practice of
                    making recordings of their clients’ investment
                    instructions in order to avoid disputes of this kind. Even
                    if there is no opportunity to record the conversations as
                    the relationship manager is outside the office and
                    transactions are frequently done over the mobile phone,
                    arrangements can easily be made by the relationship manager
                    for an officer within the bank, having a phone recording
                    facility, to call the client back immediately and repeat the
                    terms of the agreed transactions for them to be recorded.
                    Alternatively, the transactions can be confirmed via
                    SMS.</p>
