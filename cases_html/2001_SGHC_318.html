<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF

DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1

        The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, Whang Tar Choung

("WTC" ), has certain trade marks registered in his name ("the Trade

Marks"). On 15 November 2000 he assigned the Trade Marks to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendant, Forward Supreme Sdn Bhd ("Forward Supreme"). The 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiff, Lam Soon Oil and Soap Manufacturing Sdn Bhd ("LSOS") and the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiff, Lam Soon (M) Bhd ("LSMB") claim that WTC was holding those trade

marks on trust for them and seek, through this action to obtain their transfer to LSMB.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2

        On 5 September 2001, the first day of the

trial, Mr Kenneth Tan, counsel for the Defendants applied on behalf of WTC to amend his

Defence. I adjourned the hearing of his application until the following day to enable

counsel for the Plaintiffs, Mr Davinder Singh, to consider it as he had no prior notice of

it. On 7 September, after hearing submissions on both sides, I allowed Mr Tan’s

application in respect of one paragraph but dismissed it in respect of the other two

paragraphs. On 3 October 2001 WTC appealed against my decision to the extent that it

dismisses his application to amend his Defence and I now give my written grounds of

decision.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Interlocutory stage</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3

        It is necessary to set out the manner in which

this action has progressed at the interlocutory stage, at least in respect of the material

events. The Plaintiffs filed the writ along with their joint statement of claim on 17

November 2000. On the same day they applied for and obtained an interim injunction to

forbid the Defendants from transferring or otherwise disposing of the Trade Marks until

after the trial of the action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4

        On 12 December 2000, in SIC 1447/2000 WTC

applied for the action to be stayed or dismissed on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>,

alternatively that it was an abuse of the process of the court. WTC’s ground was that

Malaysia was the proper and more convenient forum for the resolution of this dispute. Also

he alleged that the Plaintiffs had commenced a similar action in Malaysia which had been

dismissed on 25 October 2000 for want of prosecution. The Plaintiffs had not appealed

against that order and the present action was therefore an abuse of the process of the

court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5

        WTC’s application was heard by Selvam J.

On 15 March the judge dismissed it with costs and ordered the Defendants to file their

Defence within 3 weeks. On 30 March 2001, WTC filed an application to stay proceedings

pending an appeal (which was yet to be filed) against that order. However the stay

application was dismissed on 20 April, and WTC withdrew his appeal against the order of

Selvam J shortly thereafter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6

        Meanwhile discovery and other applications were

proceeded with. There were 2 subsequent amendments to the statement of claim, on 21

November 2000 and 5 March 2001. In the event WTC and Forward Supreme filed their separate

defences on 5 April 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7

        On 20 August 2001 the Defendants applied to

vacate the trial dates fixed for 3-21 September 2001 on four grounds:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(i)    that the Plaintiffs had taken out

  committal proceedings against WTC in respect of an alleged breach of certain undertakings

  he had given to the court in proceedings related to the present action;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii)    that one of the directors of

  Forward Supreme, a material witness for the Defendants, was due to give birth during the

  period fixed for the trial;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii)    that the Plaintiffs had given late

  discovery of some documents and were proposing to call additional witnesses; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv)    that the Defendants wished to call

  an expert witness on the valuation of the Trade Marks.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It appears that this application was heard

by the Registrar on 22 August. He re-fixed the trial dates to 5-21 September. The

Defendants immediately lodged an urgent appeal. This was heard that very afternoon by Lai

Siu Chiu J. She dismissed it after securing an undertaking from the Plaintiffs that they

would not proceed with the committal proceedings until after the trial.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8

        The affidavits of evidence-in-chief were

exchanged on 31 August 2001.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The amendment application</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9

        The Plaintiffs’ case is that although the

Trade Marks were registered in WTC’s name, he had held them as trustee for them.

There are various grounds upon which the Plaintiffs base this assertion, but it is not

necessary for me to go into the details. WTC’s defence is that the Trade Marks

belonged to him beneficially and he had never held them on trust for either Plaintiff. He

contended that the Plaintiffs, who had been using those Trade Marks in Malaysia, did so

under a licence granted by him. I should state that this description gives only the bare

essentials of the pleadings. There had been a tussle between WTC and his brother, Whang

Tar Liang ("WTL") in relation to the Singapore holding company of the

Plaintiffs, Lam Soon Cannery Pte Ltd ("LSC"). In CWU 321/1999, WTL had

petitioned to wind up LSC which was mostly owned by WTC and WTL and their nominees. The

parties eventually settled the matter after protracted negotiations. However they disagree

as to one of the terms of that settlement which concerns the Trade Marks. Therefore a

large part of statement of claim and the defence of WTC dealt with those negotiations. But

I need not go into the details here save to say that the statement of claim ran into 18

pages with 23 paragraphs while the defence of WTC ran into 29 pages with 64 paragraphs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10

        The trial started at 10:00 am on 5 September

2001. Just before that on the same morning, WTC’s solicitors filed this application

for leave to amend the defence. The application was placed before me to be dealt with

before commencement of the trial. Naturally WTC’s solicitors had not yet managed to

serve the SIC on the Plaintiffs’ solicitors. Mr Davinder did not object to this but

asked for the trial to be stood down to take instructions from his clients. I adjourned

the hearing to 11:00 am. When it resumed, Mr Davinder requested further time to consider

the application, in particular in respect of the law. However he was prepared to proceed

with the Plaintiffs’ opening statement and work on his submissions for this

application overnight. This would enable the court hearing time to be fully utilised. In

the event the trial commenced, but at Mr Tan’s insistence, without prejudice to

WTC’s position that the application was made before the start of the trial.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11

        The hearing of this application continued on 6

September. At the end of it, I granted Mr Tan’s application to file an affidavit in

support of 2 paragraphs of the proposed amendments. This was done on 7 September with the

filing of an affidavit by WTC’s son, Whang Sun Tze ("WST").</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12

        WTC’s application was for leave to amend

his defence by adding 4 paragraphs. Mr Tan characterised them as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    Paragraph 47, to

  plead that even if there was an implied contract, the Plaintiffs are out of time by

  operation of s.6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act. As I had allowed this amendment, it is

  therefore not the subject of the appeal and I need not deal with it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Paragraph 57, to plead that even if

  WTC had held the Trade Marks on trust, by his refusal to execute a Deed of Assignment in

  1987, he was in breach of trust at the time. Therefore the cause of action ran from that

  date, and is now time barred pursuant to section 22(2) of the Limitation Act, if it were a

  constructive remedial trust.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Paragraph 58, to plead, in case

  s.21(1)(b) of the Limitation Act is applicable, the defence of laches.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Paragraph 59, to plead <i>res judicata</i>

  in that the issues of time bar and laches have been conclusively determined in the

  Malaysian proceedings. However on 7 September Mr Tan withdrew the application in respect

  of this paragraph and again, I need not deal with it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13

        I set out below the additional paragraphs 47,

57 and 58 that WTC applied to add to his Defence:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">47. Further and/or in the alternative,

  with respect to paragraph 10 read with paragraphs 12 and 14 of the Re-amended Statement of

  Claim, to the extent that the Plaintiffs allege an implied contract existed between the

  2nd Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant, which in any event is denied, any cause of action

  therefrom would have accrued by February/March 1987 when the 1st Defendant did not accede

  to the requests to execute the Deed of Assignment assigning the Trademarks to the 2nd

  Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant contends that the Plaintiffs are time barred pursuant to

  Section 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163)</font></p>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Particulars</font></p>
</u>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="justify"></p></u><font face="Times New Roman">a. In 1986, WTL executed a Deed of

    Assignment purporting to assign to the 2nd Plaintiffs Trademarks registered in the name of

    the 1st Defendant. The 2nd Plaintiffs’ application to register the said Trademarks in

    the Malaysian Trade Marks Registry was rejected on the basis that the Trademarks were

    registered in the name of the 1st Defendant.</font>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b. By way of a letter dated 23 December

    1986 from Adnan Sundra &amp; Low to the 2nd Plaintiffs, the 2nd Plaintiffs were informed

    by their then solicitors that the application to register the Trademarks in their name was

    rejected because the Trademarks were registered in the name of the 1st Defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">c. Adnan Sundra &amp; Low apparently

    prepared a fresh Deed of Assignment to be executed by the 1st Defendants. The fresh Deed

    of Assignment was apparently forwarded to the 2nd Plaintiffs together with Adnan Sundra

    &amp; Low’s letter of 23 December 1986.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">d. In a memo dated 3 March 1987 from

    Vivian Thian to Tan Kit Heng, Vivian Thian informed Tan Kit Heng that the fresh Deed of

    Assignment was forwarded to the 1st Defendant in January 1987 and the 1st Defendant was

    requested to execute the Deed of Assignment. The 1st Defendant however did not accede to

    the request to execute the Deed of Assignment.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">57 Further and/or in the alternative, with

  respect to paragraphs 11, 15, 16, and/or 17 of the Re-amended Statement of Claim, to the

  extent that the Plaintiffs alleged that the 1st Defendant is in breach of trust, which is

  in any event denied, any cause of action therefrom would have accrued by February/March

  1987 when the 1st Defendant did not accede to the request to execute the Deed of

  Assignment assigning the Trademarks to the 2nd Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant contends that

  the Plaintiffs are time barred pursuant to Section 22(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163).</font></p>

  despite the Plaintiffs being fully aware of the facts relied on in paragraphs 10 to 17 of

  1st Defendant did not accede to the Plaintiffs' requests to execute a Deed of Assignment

  commence this action and/or caused prejudice to the 1st Defendant. In the premises, the

  Plaintiffs are barred by laches from claiming the alleged or any relief/reliefs against

    events surrounding those events would have significantly deteriorated. It would thus be

    prejudicial for the 1st Defendant to now defend himself against allegations of events that

    occurred so long ago when there are no good reasons why the Plaintiffs did not assert any

    alleged rights at an earlier time.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14

        In his supporting affidavit, WST explained that

the reason for the late application was principally due to the fact that the Defendants

had changed solicitors in July 2001, and to the pandemonium caused by WTL’s parallel

committal application against WTC. In respect of the change of solicitors, WST said this

at paragraph 3 of his affidavit:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In July 2001, my father and Forward

  Supreme were considering changing lawyers in the instant suit. In particular, Chong Boon

  Leong the partner in charge of the instant suit was likely to become a witness … </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">However Mr Davinder pointed out that while

it may be true that the change of solicitors was effected sometime in late July (notice of

change of solicitors was filed on 3 September 2001), WST had studiously avoided saying

when Mr Chong had advised him of the need to change solicitors. Mr Davinder said that as

early as 1 March 2001, at the hearing before Selvam J on <i>forum non conveniens</i>, the

Plaintiffs had argued that one reason that Singapore was the more appropriate forum was

because lawyers from Messrs Rajah &amp; Tann (Mr Chong’s firm) would have to give

evidence in this suit. By that March 2001 at the latest, WTC should have been advised of

this.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15

        WST also deposed that after the parties

exchanged affidavits evidence-in-chief on 31 August 2001, they discovered that one of the

Plaintiffs’ witnesses, Thian Yew Fong ("Thian") had deposed that on several

occasions in 1987 she had requested WTC to sign an assignment in respect of the Trade

Marks but he had refused to do so. WST said that this was consistent with WTC’s

affidavit evidence-in-chief where he said that he did not recall being approached to

transfer the Trade Marks and in any event would not have agreed to it. WST said that on 3

September his counsel told him that he was considering amending WTC’s defence along

the lines of the present application. To this Mr Davinder said that in CWU 321/1999 which

was taken out as far back as 1999, WTL had deposed that WTC had consistently failed,

refused or neglected to transfer the Trade Marks despite his requests. Therefore

WTC’s solicitors ought to have taken up this point at the outset.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16

        More telling is the following fact. In October

1999 LSMB commenced an an action in the Kuala Lumpur High Court against WTC, LSC and LSOS

in respect of the Trade Marks. At the time LSC was controlled by WTC and parties aligned

with him. WTC’s defence in that suit was filed in January 2000. It contains the

following paragraphs (WTC being the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and LSC being the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendant):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">27. Further or in the alternative the 1st

  Defendant will contend that the Plaintiff’s alleged cause or causes of action herein

  did not arise within the time limited under the Limitations Act 1953 and is therefore

  barred.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">28. Further or in the alternative the 1st

  Defendant will contend that although the Plaintiff was at all material times fully aware

  of the facts relied on in the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff was nevertheless guilty of

  prolonged, inordinate and inexcusable delay in bringing this action and seeking the relief

  claimed herein and the Plaintiff thereby cause or permitted the 1st Defendant to believe

  as in fact the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant <i>[sic]</i> did believe that the Plaintiff did

  not intend to make the claim herein or any claim against the 1st Defendant and the 1st

  Defendant has thereby been prejudiced.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">28.1 By reason of the matters aforesaid

  the Plaintiff by its conduct waived its right (if any which is denied) to claim the

  alleged or any relief against the 1st Defendant and it is inequitable and unjust to grant

  the Plaintiff the alleged or any relief.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">29. Further or in the alternative the 1st

  Defendant contend that by reason of the matters aforesaid and in the circumstances the

  Plaintiff is estopped from seeking any of the alleged remedies or relief sought herein.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17

        Similar paragraphs appear in the defence filed

by LSC. Furthermore, in an affidavit filed in February 2000 to oppose LSMB’s

application for injunction in the Kuala Lumpur suit, WTC had raised issues of laches and

time bar. WTC was clearly aware of the issues of limitation and laches as far back as

January 2000. It was his deliberate choice in the present proceedings not to proceed on

those grounds until the start of trial. There is also evidence to suggest that his

previous solicitors also knew, independently of WTC, that those defences had been pleaded

in the Kuala Lumpur suit. In CWU 321/1999, Fong Kok Keong, a director of one of the

respondents, T C Whang &amp; Company Pte Ltd, deposed an affidavit on 24 January 2000 in

which he exhibited the defence of LSC in the Kuala Lumpur suit. And the solicitors acting

for that respondent are none other than Messrs Rajah &amp; Tann. Therefore WTC’s

solicitors must have been aware at a much earlier stage that such matters had been raised

in the Malaysian suit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18

        Mr Davinder opposed the application on two

grounds:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) The proposed amendments do not

  disclose good defences. In respect of the proposed paragraph 57, there was no evidence of

  refusal in 1987. In any event, in the case of breach of trust, there is a continuing duty

  to perform. The right to sue arising from the 1987 breach may be time barred, but a

  beneficiary has a continuing right to demand the trustee to act in accordance with the

  trust. Mr Davinder said that he was instructed that if WTC had pleaded this at the outset,

  the Plaintiffs would have pleaded fraud so as to avail themselves of s.21(1)(a). He

  informed the court that his instructions were that his clients had actually instructed

  their instructing solicitor to plead fraud but the latter had advised that in view of the

  strength of the other evidence and the difficulties with fraud, they should not do so.

  However his clients have since instructed that if WTC raises question of section 22, then

  they would apply to amend SOC to plead fraud.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The amendments will prejudice the

  Plaintiffs. The parties had proceeded on the assumption that, in respect of the issue of

  repudiation, what had transpired before 15 September 2000 was irrelevant. If the

  amendments were allowed, new evidence as to events in 1984 and 1987 would have to be

  adduced and instructions would have to be taken on conversations in 1990 between WTL and

  WTC. Furthermore, additional evidence would be needed as to why the defence of laches was

  not available.</font></p>

        The primary basis for my decision is the need

to ensure a fair trial of the action. The following factors are material to that decision:

</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) As a general rule, a party is allowed

  to make any amendment to his pleadings that is reasonably necessary for the due

  presentation of his case on costs provided there has been no undue delay on his part and

  no prejudice to the vested right of the other party – see White Book paragraph

  20/0/2. This is to enable consideration of the real questions in controversy between the

  parties;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) However this must be balanced against

  the need to ensure that the trial proceeds without undue delay. The present policy of the

  courts is to ensure that actions are brought to trial and disposed of speedily, subject to

  justice being done to the parties. In the present case to allow the amendments would not

  only have meant that the present trial dates, 13 hearing days, would have to be vacated,

  but also a prolonged interlocutory process as the Plaintiffs would be pleading fraud. In

  the particular the circumstances of this case, with the protagonists WTC and WTL in such

  advanced age, further delays could very well prejudice the fair trial of the matter.

  Indeed, WTC himself had said that he was 80 years of age and his memory had significantly

  deteriorated.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) <i>"There is a clear difference

  between allowing amendments to clarify the issues in dispute and those that permit a

  distinct defence to be raised for the first time"</i> – per Lord Griffiths in <i>Ketteman

  v Hansel Properties</i> [1987] AC 189 at p.220. Although in <i>Ketteman’s case</i>,

  the application to amend was made at the end of the trial, nevertheless the point remains

  that the impact of these two types of amendments are quite different and would therefore

  be treated differently.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) The issues of time bar and laches had

  been pleaded by WTC in the Kuala Lumpur suit and he had even filed an affidavit there

  alleging those matters. He chose to sit on his hands and made no such allegations in the

  present action until the first day of trial. I have no doubt that there was undue delay on

  the part of WTC. WST seems to suggest that the omission was caused by his previous

  solicitors. If this is alleged I need only to cite from the speech of Lord Griffiths in <i>Ketteman’s

  case</i>, at pp.219-220:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… if a defence of limitation is not

    pleaded because the defendant’s lawyers have overlooked the defence the defendant

    should ordinarily expect to bear the consequences of that carelessness and look to his

    lawyers for compensation if he is so minded.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Another factor that a judge must weigh in

    the balance is the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and

    the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business

    should be conducted efficiently. We can no longer afford to show the same indulgence

    towards negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age.

    There will be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing the consequences of

    the negligence of the lawyers to fall upon their own heads rather than by allowing an

    amendment at a very late stage of the proceedings.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(5) Delay in the disposition of this suit

  would cause prejudice to Plaintiffs in that there is uncertainty as to whether they should

  continue to develop the Trade Marks further.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20

        In view of the factors enumerated above, in

particular the fact that WTC had pleaded the same matters in January 2000 in the Kuala

Lumpur suit, the prolongation of the trial that would be caused if the amendments were

allowed and the prejudice that would be caused in view of the advanced ages of the

protagonists, I was of the view that the application should be refused in respect of

proposed paragraphs 57 and 58. On the question of costs, in view of the extensive

arguments made, and particularly the fact that the Plaintiff’s solicitors had to work

urgently to prepare their submissions while the trial proceeded without substantial pause,

I ordered costs to be paid by WTC to the Plaintiffs (in one set) as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Costs of application fixed at $30,000;

  and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Costs occasioned by the amendment to

  be taxed.</font></p>
