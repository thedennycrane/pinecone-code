        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against an award of damages
                    made in favour of the Respondent (the Plaintiff in the action) for the injuries
                    suffered by her as a result of a motor accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 12 July 2004, along Woodlands Avenue 3, the
                    Appellant’s motorcycle collided into the Respondent, who sustained serious
                    injuries. The Respondent was admitted to National University Hospital
                    (“NUH”) and warded for 36 days after which she was transferred to
                    Tan Tock Seng Rehabilitation Centre, where she remained for 51 days. She was
                    thereafter given hospitalisation leave from 6 October 2004 until
                    13 August 2005, a period of more than ten months. By consent,
                    interlocutory judgment was entered at 60% in favour of the
                Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent is now blind in the right eye as
                    a result of her injuries. She was diagnosed with left facial weakness and also
                    required surgery to correct hearing loss in her left ear. She also suffered
                    cognitive dysfunction due to her brain injury, which will be the subject of
                    further consideration below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent had scored 243 for her PSLE and
                    achieved seven “O” level passes (English: B3; Literature in
                    English: C5; Combined Humanities: B4; Mathematics: A2; Additional Mathematics:
                    B3; Chemistry: E8; Higher Chinese: C6). At the time of the accident, she was
                    barely two weeks into her first year as a student of Business Studies at Ngee
                    Ann Polytechnic (“the Polytechnic”). She deferred her studies as a
                    result of the accident, and resumed her education three years later in
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decisions below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Assistant Registrar (“the AR”)
                    awarded general damages of $286,000 on a 100% basis, of which: (1) $70,000 was
                    for the Respondent’s physical head injuries; (2) $25,000 was for the
                    Respondent’s cognitive disabilities; and (3) $120,000 was for the
                    Respondent’s loss of earning capacity (“LEC”). The AR
                    reasoned that as the Respondent was still in school, an award of loss of future
                    earnings (“LFE”), applying the multiplicand-multiplier formula,
                    would be too speculative. By the time of the assessment of damages before the
                    AR, the Respondent was in the fourth semester of her course for the Diploma of
                    Business Studies (“the Diploma”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent appealed against the AR’s
                    decision for an increase in the awards for her physical head injuries and her
                    cognitive disabilities, and for an award of LFE instead of only LEC, or, in the
                    alternative, for the award for LEC to be increased. The Appellant cross-appealed
                    and asked that the total award be reduced to $135,442.47.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In <em>Teo Ai Ling (by her next
                        friend Chua Wee Bee) v Koh Chai Kwang</em> [2010] SGHC 54
                    (“the Judgment”), the Judicial Commissioner (“the
                    Judge”) allowed the Respondent’s appeal in part by: (1) increasing
                    the award for cognitive disabilities to $40,000; and (2) replacing the
                    AR’s award for LEC with an award for LFE of $492,000. Costs of the appeals
                    were ordered to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In this appeal, the Appellant challenges both
                    the substantive decisions of the Judge. Accordingly, in this judgment, we will,
                    first, be examining the question of whether this is an appropriate case to award
                    LFE, and if so, whether the quantum accorded by the Judge is reasonable. The
                    second issue which we will consider is whether the sum of $40,000 awarded by the
                    Judge for the Respondent’s cognitive disabilities is
                excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The question of LFE and LEC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Recently, this court had the occasion to
                    consider the law on LFE and LEC in the case of <em>Chai Kang Wei
                        Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian</em> [2010] 3 SLR 587
                        (“<em>Samuel Chai</em>”). There, this
                    court clarified that LFE and LEC compensated different losses and, therefore,
                    were not strictly alternative to each other. Citing <em>Smith v
                        Manchester Corporation</em> [1974] 1 KIR 1
                        (“<em>Smith</em>”), it accepted the view
                    that LFE referred to the difference between post-accident and pre-accident
                    incomes or rates of income; and LEC addressed the loss arising from the
                    weakening of the plaintiff’s competitive position in the open labour
                    market, even though at the time of the assessment of damages the plaintiff was
                    still in employment and did not suffer from any immediate loss of
                income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As LFE and LEC are distinct and not alternate
                    measures, a plaintiff would bear the burden of providing sufficient evidence for
                    each of these heads of damages if claimed for. At the High Court, the Judge
                    found that the Respondent had established a claim to LFE on the following bases
                    (the Judgment at [54]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     that, but for the accident, it was
                        likely that the Respondent would pass the Polytechnic examinations and
                        graduate with the Diploma;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     that, but for the accident, the Respondent would have
                        gone on to attain a monthly gross pay of $1,610 which may reach a maximum of
                        $6,600; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     that, due to her injuries, the Respondent would probably be unable to
                        complete the Polytechnic course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is, therefore, necessary for us to examine
                    whether there was sufficient evidence for the Judge to have made those findings
                    and, consequently, whether he was justified to hold that the Respondent was
                    entitled to claim for LFE. Specifically, the issues which we would need to
                    consider are these:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there was sufficient
                        evidence for the Judge to arrive at his findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       that the Respondent would
                            have obtained the Diploma but for the injuries suffered from the
                            accident; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       that she would fail to obtain the Diploma due
                            to the said injuries; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether, considering the evidence that was before the
                        court, the multiplicand-multiplier formula used by the Judge to calculate
                        the Respondent’s loss was too speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was it likely that the Respondent, if not for the accident, would
                have passed the Polytechnic examinations and graduated with the Diploma?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the evidence, it seems to us that there was
                    no real dispute between the parties that the Respondent would likely have passed
                    the Polytechnic examinations and graduated with the Diploma if not for the
                    accident. Let us explain. We note that counsel for the Appellant had
                    cross-examined the Respondent with the intention of showing that she would have
                    passed the Polytechnic examinations <em>in spite of</em>
                    her injuries, and this was commented upon by the Judge (the Judgment at
                        [60]). For this appeal, the
                    Appellant even submitted that the Respondent’s results showed that she had
                    an equal, if not better, chance of passing the prescribed examinations after the
                    accident. Therefore, we agree with the Judge that the Respondent, if not for the
                    accident, would have graduated with the Diploma, given her academic results in
                    both her PSLE and “O” Level examinations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was it likely that the Respondent would have failed the Polytechnic
                course due to her injuries?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     For the record, the Respondent’s results
                    at the Polytechnic were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In a sense, the issue of whether or not it was
                    likely that the Respondent would have failed the Polytechnic course due to her
                    injuries had become academic by the time this appeal came up for hearing before
                    the Judge as the Respondent had already failed to pass the prescribed
                    examinations and would not be accorded the Diploma by the Polytechnic. Indeed,
                    even before the AR rendered his decision, the Respondent sought to admit the
                    fresh evidence that the Polytechnic had just announced that the Respondent had
                    failed to pass the examination and would not be granted the Diploma. The AR
                    refused to admit this fresh evidence on the ground of some other delays on the
                    part of the Respondent and/or her counsel. Before the Judge, objection was taken
                    by the Appellant to any reference to the fact that the Respondent had failed to
                    obtain the Diploma. The argument, which was run by the Appellant before the AR
                    and the Judge, was that notwithstanding the results of the Respondent’s
                    examinations for the first four semesters at the Polytechnic, where she failed
                    in a number of subjects, it was nevertheless probable that the Respondent would
                        <em>pass</em> the Polytechnic course despite her
                    cognitive disabilities for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Respondent had a remarkable
                        determination to succeed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     post-injuries, the Respondent had scored an A, a B, and
                        several Cs in her three semesters at the Polytechnic;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Respondent was able to commute
                        independently, use a handphone and a computer, and attend her classes and
                        examinations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Respondent had not sustained permanent disability;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     it was unlikely
                        that the Respondent had suffered or would suffer any deterioration of her
                        intellectual functioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It seems to us that the question of whether
                    the Respondent had suffered any impairment to her mental and intellectual
                    faculties, which would impede her completing the Diploma course, must be
                    determined in the light of the medical evidence as well as other relevant
                    objective evidence. The points made by the Appellant in the preceding paragraph,
                    other than point (b), are mere arguments and not evidence which would help the
                    court to make a finding on that question. In particular, point (c) adds little
                    as even a ten-year-old child can take public transport, use a handphone, operate
                    a computer and attend classes. The ability to do those things does not show that
                    the Respondent would be able to pass the prescribed examination for the Diploma.
                    In this regard, we ought to mention that it is not true that the Respondent had
                    no trouble in locating her classroom (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Relevant medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The medical evidence in relation to the
                    Respondent’s cognitive disabilities came from four experts: Dr Chong
                    Piang Ngok (“Dr Chong”), Dr Lim Yun Chin
                    (“Dr Lim”), and Ms Elizabeth Pang Peck Hia
                    (“Ms Pang”) for the Respondent; and Dr Calvin Fones Soon
                    Leong (“Dr Fones”) for the Appellant. We will now briefly
                    address the medical evidence of these four experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     All these experts conducted their examinations
                    of the Respondent in the year 2008, some four years after the accident.
                    Dr Chong conducted one examination on the Respondent on
                    10 April 2008. Dr Lim conducted a mental state examination on the
                    Respondent in June 2008. Ms Pang examined the Respondent twice on 11 and
                    14 June 2008. Dr Fones examined the Respondent on 4 August 2008.
                    These experts also had access to medical reports prepared by doctors who had
                    previously treated the Respondent for her injuries (“the Earlier Medical
                    Reports”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Dr Chong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Dr Chong was the first of the four
                    experts to examine the Respondent. He is a Consultant Neurologist &amp;
                    Physician with P N Chong Neurology Clinic at Mt Elizabeth Medical Centre.
                    Dr Chong’s report was rather straightforward.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He simply noted the
                    Respondent’s complaints and did an examination of her physical injuries.
                    In cross-examination, Dr Chong conceded that the examination was concluded
                    in 30 minutes. An excerpt of his opinion is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I will be very surprise [<em>sic</em>] if there are
                        no cognitive deficits following such severe injuries. I am quite sure that
                        there will be some deterioration in her mental capacity. My opinion is based
                        on the nature of the injuries, and the subsequent course of her schooling.
                        However, I strongly suggest that a formal “quantitative”
                        neuropsychological assessment be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It would seem that Dr Chong’s
                    opinion was based essentially on what was stated in the Earlier Medical Reports.
                    He did not subject the Respondent to any tests and only conducted a short
                    interview and physical examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Dr Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Dr Lim is a Consultant in Psychological
                    Medicine at Raffles Hospital. His report dated 2 July 2008 shows that
                    he conducted a mental state examination on the Respondent in June 2008. He made
                    reference to Dr Chong’s assessment that the brain injuries were very
                    severe. He also referred the Respondent to Ms Pang for neuropsychological
                    testing and, based on the results that came back, he was of the opinion that
                    there was deterioration of the Respondent’s intellectual functioning from
                    her pre-accident state.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   Ms Pang</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Ms Pang is a Consultant Clinical
                    Psychologist with Raffles Counselling Centre, Raffles Hospital. She examined the
                    Respondent twice, on 11 and 14 June 2008. She had access to the Earlier
                    Medical Reports, the Respondent’s examination results from the Polytechnic
                    and her primary and secondary school report books, which included assessments of
                    her personality by her teachers. Moreover, Ms Pang also conducted a
                    WAIS-III test (intelligence) and a WMS-III test (memory) on the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The WAIS-III test revealed that the Respondent
                    was functioning within the Low Average intellectual range, based on her Full
                    Scale Intelligence Quotient. The tests conducted on the Respondent included
                    tests such as Digit Span, Information, Arithmetic, Picture Completion, and
                    Matrix Reasoning. Using the Respondent’s pre-accident academic
                    qualifications as a yardstick, Ms Pang opined that the Respondent would
                    have previously functioned within the Average range, and had suffered
                    deterioration in her intellectual functioning as a result of the
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The WMS-III test results indicated that the
                    Respondent’s memory functioning was lower than expected, given her current
                    intellectual functioning (Low Average). Her memory indices, save for one, were
                    within the Extremely Low or Borderline range. The results also suggested that
                    she had difficulty retaining and retrieving information. The Respondent’s
                    performance was consistent with her reported difficulty in navigating the campus
                    as she would sometimes be unable to locate classrooms even with the help of a
                    map.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In her opinion, Ms Pang did not think
                    that further cognitive improvement was likely given that almost four years had
                    elapsed since the time of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the Appellant took pains to
                    cross-examine Ms Pang and Dr Lim on the WAIS-III and WMS-III tests in
                    detail. The Appellant did not raise any issue in the present appeal as to the
                    reliability of the tests or the way in which they were conducted. We share the
                    view of the Judge that Ms Pang had conducted the tests in considerable
                    detail and had ably, in cross-examination, defended the way she carried out the
                    tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   Dr Fones</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Dr Fones is a Consultant Psychiatrist
                    practising at Fones Clinic. He was previously the Head of the Department of
                    Psychological Medicine, National University of Singapore and Chief and Senior
                    Consultant Psychiatrist of the Department of Psychological Medicine,
                NUH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     He performed a mental state examination on the
                    Respondent on 4 August 2008. He opined that there was some degree of
                    cognitive deficit, including memory loss, which was expected following the type
                    of brain injury suffered by the Respondent. Having considered the Earlier
                    Medical Reports, he assessed her brain injury as a moderately severe traumatic
                    brain injury. He pointed to her prolonged period of post traumatic amnesia (of
                    more than a month) as a predictor of poorer outcome and residual cognitive
                    deficits. He also agreed that Ms Pang’s findings were consistent with
                    his.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Assessing the medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It seems to us that of the four experts, the
                    evidence of Ms Pang was the most comprehensive and reliable. We also note
                    that Dr Fones, the expert for the Appellant, essentially agreed with
                    Ms Pang’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the evidence, it is quite clear that the
                    Respondent would have difficulty sitting for and passing the examinations
                    required for the Diploma given that she suffers from memory impairment, to the
                    extent that she had difficulty navigating her own school campus. Even the AR,
                    who heard the medical evidence, thought that there was a “real
                    possibility” that the Respondent might fail the Polytechnic examinations
                    leaving her with only her “O” level certificate. Accordingly, we
                    hold that it has been proven that the Respondent would not pass the Polytechnic
                    course as a result of her cognitive impairment. Her ability to remember things
                    is significantly affected. The Appellant relied greatly on the fact that the
                    Respondent obtained an A for one of her subjects. But the fact of the matter is
                    that the Respondent is required to pass all her subjects to obtain the Diploma.
                    Doing well in one subject, which was a non-core subject, is hardly sufficient to
                    show that she could pass all the required examinations to obtain the
                    Diploma.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before moving away from this issue we would
                    like to make this observation. We think, as did the Judge, that it was wrong for
                    the AR not to have admitted the fresh evidence on the Respondent’s failure
                    to obtain the Diploma, evidence which was vital to the assessment and which was
                    not evidence that the Respondent could have produced earlier. The argument on
                    this issue, which was canvassed in disregard of this fresh evidence, was wholly
                    unreal as the Respondent’s examination results at the Polytechnic
                    confirmed the views of the medical experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Judge was wrong to have awarded LFE</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Having decided that the Respondent would
                    likely have failed to acquire the Diploma from the Polytechnic due to the
                    injuries sustained by her from the accident, and having also decided that the
                    Respondent was entitled to damages based on LFE, the Judge adopted the following
                    figures to calculate the multiplicand:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     $1,610 (based on the Ministry of
                        Manpower’s schedule of monthly gross starting pay of polytechnic
                        graduates in full-time permanent employment in the year 2006 by course:
                        Business Studies); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     $6,600 (the monthly salary of a Grade 1 officer in the
                        civil service holding a polytechnic diploma, according to a letter from the
                        Polytechnic).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge took the difference between
                    $6,600, being the highest salary a diploma holder would get in the civil
                    service, and $1,610, being the starting pay for the average Business Studies
                    diploma holder, and arrived at the mean figure of $4,105. He then took half of
                    $4,105, being $2,050, as the difference between what the Respondent would have
                    earned as a diploma holder and what she would have earned as someone with only
                    “O” level qualifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The career model</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At this juncture, we will make some brief
                    observations on the career model adopted by the Judge, before proceeding to
                    consider whether this is an appropriate case to award LFE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>Herring v Ministry of
                        Defence</em> [2004] 1 All ER 44 (“<em>Herring</em>”), the plaintiff, who was at the time of
                    the court hearing unemployed, was at the time he was injured pursuing a Higher
                    National Diploma course in law (which he completed despite the accident) with a
                    view to joining the police force. Previously the plaintiff had worked as a
                    qualified sports coach and lifeguard in a leisure centre. Because of the
                    injuries sustained, the plaintiff could no longer join the police force. The
                    court adopted the pay scale of the police force as the career model to determine
                    the plaintiff’s LFE. This statement of Potter LJ at [24] of <em>Herring</em>
                    is germane:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the situation of a young claimant who has not yet been in employment at
                        the time of injury but is still in education or has otherwise not embarked
                        on his career, or (as in this case) one who has taken time out from
                        employment in order to acquire a further qualification for a desired change
                        of direction, it may or may not be appropriate to select a specific career
                        model in his chosen field. In this connection the court will have regard to
                        the claimant’s previous performance, expressed intentions and
                        ambitions, the opportunities reasonably open to him and any steps he has
                        already taken to pursue a particular path. In many cases it will not be
                        possible to identify a specific career model and it may be necessary simply
                        to resort to national average earnings figures for persons of the
                        claimant’s ability and qualifications in his likely field(s) of
                        activity. In other cases, however, it may be possible with confidence to
                        select a career model appropriate to be used as the multiplicand for
                        calculating loss. In either case, the purpose and function of the exercise
                        is simply to select an appropriate “baseline” for calculation
                        of the claimant’s probable future earnings whatever his future
                        occupation may in fact turn out to be. Thus if the career model chosen is
                        based upon a specific occupation (such as the police force in this case),
                        the chance or possibility that the claimant will not in the event enter that
                        occupation or, having done so, may leave it, will not be significant if the
                        likelihood is that he will find alternative employment at a similar level of
                        remuneration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We share the views of Potter LJ, and recognise that in order for the
                    court to make an award for LFE, there has to be some reasonably objective
                    premise for the court to determine the multiplicand. The issue is, therefore,
                    whether such reasonably objective premise is available in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Although the Respondent was not able to
                    produce any more concrete evidence to prove her actual loss other than the
                    scales of salaries applicable in the civil service to those people with a
                    polytechnic business diploma (ranging from $1,500 per month for a Grade 6
                    officer to $6,600 for a Grade 1 officer), this was clearly understandable as she
                    had yet to commence on any career at the time of the accident. It would be
                    unfair to penalise her for being unable to come up with better evidence in the
                    form of solid figures. In fact, when the Respondent was cross-examined by
                    counsel on the basis that she would eventually obtain the Diploma, she was asked
                    what she could earn in the civil service with that qualification. Further, in
                    the Respondent’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she had stated the
                    diversity of career opportunities that would have been available to her had she
                    earned the Diploma:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I wish to say that a graduate in Diploma in Business Studies will find
                        job openings in business development, corporate ventures, corporate
                        investments, business management, human resource management, marketing
                        executive, etc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, it would appear to us that the civil service provides a
                    reasonable career model to base an award of LFE, where the claimant is a student
                    with a broad range of career opportunities ahead of him or her and it is unclear
                    which career path he or she will eventually take. We do not for a moment say
                    that in every case where the court makes an award of LFE there is no element of
                    speculation. It is obvious that any determination based on future events, as an
                    award of LFE would be, must necessarily involve some degree of speculation: see
                        <em>Paul v Rendell</em> (1981) 55 ALJR 371 at
                    372.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As we see it, the only problem in this case
                    which stands in the way of an award of LFE being based on the civil service pay
                    scale for polytechnic diploma holders is the fact that the Respondent had said
                    in court that her intention was to go into the food business. How should the
                    court view this answer? It seems to us that this indication of her preference
                    must be viewed bearing in mind two circumstances. First, she had, as a result of
                    the accident, suffered serious head injuries with significant cognitive
                    impairment. Second, the answer was an indication of her interest in the light of
                    her condition then, when she was someone with only “O” level
                    qualifications. It is of note that she was specifically cross-examined on the
                    point. She said that she still had not decided on the kind of food business she
                    would eventually like to be engaged in. When pressed further, she said that
                    between dealing with food products and selling food, she preferred the latter.
                    We cannot imagine that when the Respondent first embarked on the course at the
                    Polytechnic, she had intended only to sell food in, say, a hawker centre or a
                    food court. We think that it is only fair that her answers be viewed in the
                    context of her cognitive impairment. It stands to reason that no one in his or
                    her right mind would pursue a course in business studies in a polytechnic if all
                    that he or she wanted to do was to set up a food stall to sell food to the
                    public. It would make no sense for that person to receive all that education.
                    Such a person must have intended to do something more ambitious. Looked at
                    objectively, there are numerous possibilities. The Respondent’s affidavit
                    of evidence-in-chief, quoted at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above,
                    shows that. In any event, going into the food business could mean a wide variety
                    of things, including working in a large food manufacturing company, working in
                    the food and beverage department of a large hospitality establishment, and being
                    in the business of importing and selling food stuff. What is clear is that
                    wanting to be involved in the food business does not necessarily mean setting up
                    a food stall, either entirely on your own or in collaboration with partners.
                    Therefore, unlike a career in the police force as in <em>Herring</em>, the food business is too broad and uncertain a field,
                    and is thus unable to provide a reasonable model for calculating the
                    Respondent’s LFE. However, we would emphasise that where a claimant had
                    indicated a clear intention to enter a particular occupation, where there is a
                    strong probability that he would be able to enter that occupation, and where
                    that occupation provides a sufficiently certain career model for the estimation
                    of LFE, the court would adopt that occupation as the appropriate career model
                    instead of adopting the civil service pay scale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In this case, what the Judge in effect did was
                    to use the available evidence and arrive at what he felt was a fair career
                    model. His approach is consistent with the principle in <em>Herring</em>, quoted at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>
                    above, that the possibility that the claimant will not in the event enter the
                    specific occupation chosen in the career model will not be significant if the
                    likelihood is that he or she will find alternative employment <em>at a similar level of remuneration</em>. Therefore, the civil service
                    career model ought to be adopted should we decide to award LFE whether now in
                    the present appeal or, if a provisional damages order is considered more
                    appropriate, at a future point in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The distinction between LFE and LEC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Normally, damages on the basis of LFE are
                    awarded when the injured party is unable to go back to his pre-accident
                    employment and has to take on a lower paying job. In such a case, the loss will
                    be calculated based on a multiplier and a multiplicand, the multiplicand being
                    the monthly loss in pay and the multiplier being the appropriate period over
                    which to compute the loss. In contrast, where the injured party does not
                    suffered an immediate wage reduction (<em>eg</em>, due to
                    the compassion of the then employer: see <em>Smith</em>)
                    but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some point in the future
                    and he may, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another
                    job or getting an equally well-paid job in the open market, then the LEC would
                    be the correct basis to compensate him for the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, where the injured party is a young
                    child or a student who has yet to enter the employment market, the situation
                    poses a special challenge. In <em>Teo Sing Keng &amp; Anor v Sim
                        Ban Kiat</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 340, this court stated at
                        [40] that an award for LEC is
                        <em>generally</em> made “where there is no
                    available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to
                    properly calculate future earnings, for example, young children who have no
                    earnings on which to base an assessment for loss of future earnings”. But
                    there is nothing in principle which precludes the award of LFE to an injured
                    party who has yet to embark on a career provided that there are sufficient
                    objective facts or evidence to enable the court to reasonably make the
                    assessment. It does not necessarily follow that just because an injured party
                    was still studying at the time the injury was sustained it would not be possible
                    to award him damages based on LFE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There have been a number of cases in the past
                    where damages based on LFE have been awarded to an injured party who has yet to
                    enter the employment market. One example is the case of <em>Lai
                        Chi Kay and others v Lee Kuo Shin</em> [1981-1982] SLR(R) 71
                        (“<em>Lai Chi Kay</em>”), which
                    illustrates that not being in employment at the time of the accident is not an
                    impediment to the grant of LFE. There, a fourth year medical student from Hong
                    Kong, who was then studying at the University of Singapore and who could not
                    complete his medical course on account of the injuries sustained by him, was
                    awarded damages for LFE calculated on the basis of the mean between the maximum
                    and minimum salaries in the Hong Kong Medical Service. In this case, the basis
                    for an award of LFE is clear and objective – prior to the accident, the
                    claimant was about to complete a specialised education to enter a specific
                    occupation, <em>ie</em> the medical profession; after the
                    accident, he was unable to complete the course and therefore unable to draw the
                    level of salary associated with doctors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Tham Yew Heng and
                        another v Chong Toh Cheng</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 782
                        (“<em>Tham Yew Heng</em>”), the court
                    made an award based on LFE to a nine-year-old boy, whose school performance
                    deteriorated rather badly after the accident such that it was “extremely
                    remote” that he would be able to complete his secondary education. The
                    court took a conservative multiplicand of $200 per month in view of the
                    uncertainties and a multiplier of 20 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A third case which may be referred to is
                        <em>Peh Diana and another v Tan Miang Lee</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 22 (“<em>Diana Peh</em>”).
                    There, the High Court awarded LFE to a sixteen-year-old student who suffered
                    from permanent disabilities and was unable to continue attending a normal school
                    after the accident. We should clarify that while <em>Diana
                        Peh</em> came under review in the later case of <em>Chang Ah Lek and others v Lim Ah Koon</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 551, this was not in relation to the award of LFE but to the
                    proposition made in <em>Diana Peh</em> that the principles
                    governing an appeal from the High Court Judge to the Court of Appeal also
                    applied to an appeal from the Registrar to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Again, there was a clear basis for awarding
                    LFE in these last two cases – prior to the accident, the claimants were
                    likely to obtain at least “O” level qualifications; after the
                    accident, they had to discontinue school and thus suffered from a reduction of
                    future income. While the quantification exercises in these two cases were
                    admittedly much more uncertain than that in <em>Lai Chi
                        Kay</em> as the claimants were of young age and the assessment of LFE
                    was thus necessarily more speculative, it should be borne in mind that a
                    provisional award of LEC was not available as an alternative then as the
                    relevant legislation had not yet been enacted. Otherwise, <em>Diana Peh</em> might well have been an appropriate case to award
                    provisional damages, which could be reviewed after five years when the claimant
                    would “probably have reconciled herself with her own physical condition
                    and start to live normally” (<em>Diana Peh</em> at
                        [39]). On the other hand, <em>Tham Yew Heng</em> might not have been an appropriate case to
                    award provisional damages due to the long period of time that would have had to
                    elapse before clarity could be provided to the claimant’s employment
                    prospects, given that the claimant was only nine years old. However, we would
                    leave such a scenario to be considered in an appropriate case in the
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Appellant has in his Case referred to a
                    number of cases involving students who were injured and who were only awarded
                    LEC, <em>ie</em>, <em>Tan Yu Min Winston v
                        Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                        4 SLR(R) 825(“<em>Winston
                    Tan</em>”); <em>Muhamad Ilyas bin Mirza Abdul Hamid
                        v Kwek Khim Hui</em> [2004] SGHC 12; <em>Lim Yuen Li
                        Eugene v Singapore Shuttle Bus Service Pte Ltd</em> [2005] SGHC 189;
                    and <em>Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 209. These cases were explained and distinguished by the Judge at
                        [52] of the Judgment. We need say no
                    more on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Our determination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Here, the injured Respondent had, before the
                    accident, the intellectual capacity to pass seven “O” level
                    subjects and could have gained admission to a junior college but instead chose
                    to enrol in the Polytechnic because she wanted to undertake business studies.
                    The evidence quite clearly suggests that, barring any unforeseen events, the
                    Respondent would have completed the course and obtained the Diploma. Now because
                    of the cognitive injuries sustained by her from the accident, her hope of
                    obtaining the Diploma is forever gone. As stated in <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above, a plaintiff is typically awarded LEC where he or she
                    continues to be in employment and suffers no immediate loss of income, but would
                    suffer a disadvantage on account of the injury sustained if he or she should
                    lose that current job and have to look for a new job in the open market. As a
                    young child or a student would not have entered the employment market, there can
                    be no immediate loss of income; but to make a <em>final</em> award of only LEC on account of the fact that the young
                    child or student has not yet suffered any loss of income is to apply a principle
                    to a set of circumstances to which that principle was never intended to apply.
                    One must not lose sight of the rationale of compensation for a tort committed,
                    especially where the injuries caused to a young person are severe and the
                    consequence to his or her future employability grim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We recognise that for this purpose there is a
                    distinct difference between, say, a young child of five years old and a student
                    like the Respondent who has completed her “O” levels and has
                    embarked on tertiary education, <em>ie</em> a polytechnic
                    course. In the case of a five-year-old child, admittedly it would be difficult
                    to reasonably predict what that child would become. Will he graduate from
                    university and become a doctor, lawyer or engineer? Is medical science able to
                    provide an answer? Fortunately, we are not here concerned with such a child.
                    Here, the Respondent, if not for the accident, would have probably completed the
                    Diploma and started work, whether in the food business or the civil service or
                    any other job. All she has now is her “O” level certificate.
                    Further, there is evidence, and indeed even without such evidence common sense
                    will also tell us, that a polytechnic graduate will command a higher wage than
                    an “O” level holder within most occupations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     However, there remain two difficulties to the
                    immediate award of LFE in the present case. Firstly, while the Respondent was
                    said to be earning about $800 a month as a data entry clerk at the time of the
                    hearing of this appeal, it is unclear whether this was only a temporary or
                    transitional arrangement, and it is also unclear what her full scope of career
                    options will be until she has adjusted fully to her injuries. She may well
                    embark on a career path that does not draw a significant distinction between
                    diploma holders and “O” level holders, and thus draw a level of
                    earnings that is comparable to that which she would have obtained with the
                    Diploma. In such a situation, the Respondent may suffer a lower LFE than that
                    estimated by the Judge, or may even not suffer any actual LFE. Therefore, the
                    situation here is distinct from that in <em>Lai Chi
                        Kay</em>, where the LFE had clearly crystallised as the claimant was
                    no longer able to embark on his career as a doctor and where it was in fact
                    “highly improbable” that he would ever be gainfully
                    employed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Secondly, the present award for LFE may, on
                    the other hand, amount to under-compensation if the Respondent were to remain in
                    jobs with a pay-scale similar to her present data entry job. While damages are
                    presently assessed upon the assumption that she would be able to hold down jobs
                    with her “O” levels qualifications, her cognitive impairment may
                    be such that she is, in reality, not able to perform to the level expected of an
                    employee with those qualifications. If this were indeed the case, the
                    multiplicand may have to be significantly higher than that determined by the
                    Judge. Therefore, in the light of these uncertainties, the interests of justice
                    may be better served by allowing for a review of damages awarded after a certain
                    number of years when the Respondent’s employment situation and prospects
                    become clearer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Ultimately, in all cases involving an award of
                    LFE, the court is to an extent engaged in crystal ball gazing and peering into
                    the future. In the case of a person who is already in employment before he
                    sustained the injury, the element of speculation and uncertainty could be said
                    to be less as compared to a case involving a student like the Respondent here.
                    It was for this reason, and also to enable the court to come to a figure which
                    is even more just, that we suggested, during the course of oral arguments, to
                    the parties that they look into the question of whether this would be an
                    appropriate case for the court to grant provisional damages pursuant to the
                    powers accorded under paragraph 16 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“Paragraph
                16”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Provisional damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The previous position in Singapore, as well as
                    in England, was that damages were assessed on a once-and-for-all basis.
                    Paragraph 16, which came into operation on 1 July 1993, provides that the court
                    shall have the “[p]ower to award in any action for damages for personal
                    injuries, provisional damages assessed on the assumption that a <em>contingency</em> will not happen and further damages at a
                    future date if the contingency happens” [emphasis added]. Counsel for the
                    parties took different views as to the term “contingency”. The
                    Respondent contended that the contingency must relate to a mental or physical
                    disability of the plaintiff victim whereas the Appellant argued that the term,
                    which is not defined in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, should be given its
                    ordinary meaning so as to encompass “a multifarious variety of
                    differencing events that may or may not happen at a later point in time”.
                    The Appellant asserted that Paragraph 16 confers power on the court to make a
                    provisional damages award “on the basis that a contingency will not
                    happen and keep the door open as it were, for further damages at a future date
                    if the contingency does happen”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In this regard, we ought to mention that while
                    Paragraph 16 was modelled after the English provisions enacted in s 32A of the
                    Supreme Court Act 1981 (c 54) (UK), Paragraph 16 is drafted much more widely
                    than the English provisions. The relevant part of the English provision
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32A – (1) This section applies to an action for damages for personal
                        injuries in which there is proved or admitted to be a chance that at some
                        definite or indefinite time in the future the injured person will, as a
                        result of the act or omission which gave rise to the cause of action,
                        develop some serious disease or suffer some serious deterioration in his
                        physical or mental condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It can be seen that in England awards of
                    provisional damages are limited to the cases where there is a chance that the
                    injured plaintiff will in the future develop some serious disease or suffer some
                    serious deterioration in his or her physical or mental condition. This is unlike
                    Paragraph 16 which is worded more generally. To that extent, we are unable to
                    accept the submission of the Respondent that the contingency must be restricted
                    to a physical or mental condition. Undoubtedly, if the contingency relates to a
                    physical or mental condition (that would be a fact which could be objectively
                    determined), the injured plaintiff may ask for additional damages pursuant to
                    the provisional damages order should the contingency occur. However, there is no
                    reason why the contingency could not relate to some other future fact or
                    circumstance, so long as the occurrence of that fact or circumstance is
                    something which can be objectively determined. For example, if in the present
                    case the Respondent was still pursuing a polytechnic course and has, say, two
                    more years to go, failing to obtain the Diploma could be such a contingency.
                    Indeed this court had previously made a provisional award of LEC based on a
                    non-medical contingency, <em>ie</em>, that the
                    claimant’s “employment prospects can be shown to be more severely
                    prejudiced than assessed by [the trial judge]” in the unreported decision
                    of <em>Tan Yu Min Winston v Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd</em>,
                    Civil Appeal No 94 of 2008 (the “<em>Winston
                        Tan</em> appeal”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, the difficulty standing in the way of
                    granting provisional damages to the Respondent in this case lies in defining the
                    precise contingency upon which further damages should be awarded. In written
                    submissions, counsel for the Appellant made the suggestion that, adapting the
                    English practice, the court could make an order along the following
                    lines:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) There be judgment for the plaintiff for immediate damages in the sum
                        of ________ on the assumption that the plaintiff would not at a future date
                        suffer a loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) If the plaintiff at a future date does suffer such loss, she shall be
                        entitled to apply for further damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Such application shall be made within [specify period].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for the Appellant further suggested that the
                    “contingency” in this case would be “in relation to [the
                    Respondent’s] education and/or employment/business”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As far as the Respondent’s education is
                    concerned, she has already failed her examinations for the Diploma. It is no
                    longer a contingency. As stated before, if she were still pursuing the Diploma,
                    then her failure to obtain the Diploma could constitute a contingency which
                    would enable her to apply for additional damages. As regards her
                    employment/business, we agree that these matters could logically be formulated
                    as a contingency for this purpose, following the decision in the <em>Winston Tan</em> appeal. Provisional damages on the basis of
                    LEC could be awarded at the sum of $120,000 as assessed by the AR, based on this
                    contingency. However, we recognise that in order to avoid future disputes, the
                    contingency must be defined with greater precision than that adopted in the
                        <em>Winston Tan</em> appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Before proceeding to do so, we would clarify
                    that the provisional award of LEC in the present case is consistent with the
                    holding in <em>Samuel Chai</em> at [20] that LFE and LEC are distinct measures
                    and that “in the event that there is a lack of sufficient evidence
                    proving [LFE], this cannot, by itself, convert a claim for [LFE] into
                    a claim for LEC”. We are by no means suggesting that the uncertainty over
                    LFE here automatically leads to a provisional award for LEC; instead, we are
                    recognising that, <em>at the minimum</em>, the
                    Respondent’s competitive position in the labour market is weakened by her
                    failure to obtain the Diploma. The Respondent’s LEC has been proven
                        <em>independently</em> of the issue of whether her LFE
                    will be proven at the re-assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The window for review</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Normally, when provisional damages are
                    awarded, a claimant is given the liberty, within a specified period of time from
                    the date of the judgment, to apply for further damages upon the occurrence of a
                    contingency relating to a physical or mental disability. There is obviously a
                    need to adapt this approach where the contingency relates to business or
                    employment. The primary reason for making a provisional award for LEC in such
                    cases is that any immediate award of LFE would be highly speculative and thus it
                    would be appropriate that there be a further assessment at a future date when
                    the claimant’s employment situation and prospects become clearer. This
                    period must be of a sufficient duration so that it would achieve the objective
                    of enabling the court to come to a more accurate assessment of the LFE, if any.
                    Moreover, it has also to be of a duration which would act as a disincentive
                    against malingering by the claimant who may seek to remain unemployed or
                    underemployed in anticipation of a further assessment of damages. On the other
                    hand, the period should not be inordinately prolonged in the interest of
                    finality. Accordingly, we think there should be a prescribed minimum period of
                    time that has to elapse before an application for further assessment may be
                    made. Similarly, in order to ensure that this question of further damages is not
                    left open indefinitely, it is also necessary to fix a time period beyond which
                    no application for further damages can be made. At that point, the entire case
                    must come to an end.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Taking these considerations into account, we
                    are of the opinion that a minimum period of four years would suffice in the
                    present case to provide clarity on the Respondent’s employment situation,
                    and to act as a disincentive for malingering. We are mindful of the fact that
                    the Respondent is presently in her early 20s and starting out on her career, and
                    that the evidence in court shows that she is a determined and ambitious person.
                    In our view, it would not be to her advantage to suffer reduced earnings and put
                    her career on hold for four years in the hope of obtaining further compensation.
                    Instead, we will encourage her to continue to do her best to adjust to her
                    injuries and carry on bravely with life; should her best efforts not be
                    sufficient after four years, the court will then consider her application for
                    further damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In determining the window period beyond which
                    the Respondent should not be able to make an application for further damages, we
                    are conscious of the Appellant’s need for closure. On balance, we think it
                    fair that the outer time limit should be six years from the date of judgment. In
                    short, the Respondent will have a window period of two years to make her
                    application for re-assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The contingency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In defining the precise contingency, we adopt
                    the career model discussed at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>–<a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above in
                    order to project the likely future income stream of the Respondent but for the
                    accident. Assuming a starting monthly salary of $1,610, a maximum salary of
                    $6,600 at the end of the multiplier period of 20 years, and a constant rate of
                    salary increment, the average compounded rate of salary increment would be 7.3%
                    per annum. Taking the mid-point of the window period for application for further
                    assessment as five years, the Respondent’s projected monthly salary at the
                    time of re-assessment is estimated to be $2,290. While these involve relatively
                    uncomplicated computations that could be easily performed by a scientific
                    calculator, the relevant mathematical formulae shall be provided for the
                    avoidance of doubt:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     1610 x (1 + <em>r</em>)<sup>20</sup> = 6600, where <em>r</em> is the average compounded rate of salary increment
                        per annum (in decimals) and is equal to 0.073 when the equation is
                        solved;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     1610 x
                        (1 + 0.073)<sup>5</sup> = 2290.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Respondent will be taken to have suffered
                    LFE should her actual monthly income at the time of her application turn out to
                    be less than 80% of her projected monthly income, <em>ie</em> less than $1,832. This 20% discount is applied in order to
                    ensure that an application for re-assessment would be entertained only if the
                    Respondent is significantly prejudiced. Furthermore, the job to which the
                    submitted income applies has to be held by the Respondent for a continuous
                    period of at least six months. Should the Respondent earn more than $1,832 per
                    month at any point of time prior to her existing job at the point of
                    application, she should adduce evidence to explain why she was unable to keep
                    that job or maintain that level of earnings. These two safeguards are introduced
                    to discourage malingering – the Respondent would not be able to obtain
                    further damages by switching to a low paying job just before her
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Should the Respondent be unemployed at the
                    time of her application, she would have to show that she has been unemployed for
                    a continuous period of at least six months and should also adduce evidence,
                    medical or otherwise, to show that she is incapable of holding down a permanent
                    job.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The further assessment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     If the Respondent is found to meet the above
                    criteria, she should be awarded past loss of earnings for the period leading up
                    to the date of re-assessment and LFE for the remaining period after the
                    re-assessment, with a downward adjustment made for the amount that she would
                    have already received for LEC. Again, we would have to emphasise that this
                    downward adjustment is consistent with the holding in <em>Samuel
                        Chai</em> that LEC and LFE are distinct measures – in the
                    present case, the provisional award of LEC and the future award of LFE, if any,
                    are derived from identical compensatory factors, <em>ie</em>, the cognitive impairment and the Respondent’s failure
                    to obtain the Diploma. In an appropriate case where the provisional award of LEC
                    and the future award of LFE are derived from distinct compensatory factors, no
                    such discount would be necessary. It should also be borne in mind that all these
                    figures would continue to be assessed at 60%, as that is the extent of the
                    Appellant’s liability for the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The reference monthly salary for past loss of
                    earnings should be based, for the sake of simplicity, upon the mean of $1,610
                    and $2,290, <em>ie</em> $1,950. For example, assuming that
                    the Respondent’s re-assessment is heard five years later and that she has
                    earned a total of $48,000 in that period, the relevant quantum for past loss of
                    earnings would be ($1,950 x 12 5) – $48,000 = $69,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The reference monthly salary for the LFE
                    should, similarly for the sake of simplicity, be based upon the mean of $2,290
                    and $6,600, <em>ie</em> $4,445. The precise multiplicand
                    would be a matter to be determined at the time of re-assessment based on the
                    evidence as to the Respondent’s salary and prospects of salary increment.
                    The relevant multiplier should be the difference between the multiplier decided
                    by the Judge, <em>ie</em> 20 years, and the number of years
                    intervening between this judgment and re-assessment. Therefore, following from
                    the earlier example, if the Respondent were earning $800 per month with no
                    realistic prospect of salary increment, the relevant quantum for LFE would be
                    ($4,445 – $800) x 12 x (20 – 5) = $656,100.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Based on the example set out in the preceding
                    two paragraphs, the total further compensation due to the Respondent, after
                    adjusting for the provisional award of LEC, would thus be ($69,000 + $656,100
                    – $120,000) x 60% = $363,060. While it may appear from these figures that
                    our approach of using provisional damages would be even more generous to the
                    Respondent than the immediate award of LFE by the Judge, we would like to note
                    that this would not necessarily be the case, as the example here is based on a
                    worst-case scenario whereby the Respondent earns and is only able to earn $800
                    per month. Should she turn out to earn marginally less than the threshold amount
                    of $1,832 and enjoy some prospect of salary increment, the total compensation
                    that she would receive would naturally be less than that awarded by the Judge.
                    If she were to recover well and earn beyond the threshold amount, she would not
                    even be entitled to a re-assessment. Therefore, while we acknowledge that the
                    methodology employed here remains an imperfect estimation of the actual loss
                    suffered by the Respondent, what it does is to introduce far greater certainty
                    and accuracy to our crystal ball gazing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the award for cognitive injuries of $40,000 should be reduced
                to $25,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We now turn to the second issue of this
                    appeal. The Judge, having taken into account that in <em>Er Hung
                        Boon v Law Shyan En</em>, District Court Suit No 1567 of 1997, a
                    sum of $20,000 was awarded for memory impairment and bearing in mind that the
                    Respondent here also suffered a change of personality in addition to memory
                    impairment, thought it only fair that the amount awarded by the AR for this
                    sub-head of injury should be enhanced from $25,000 to $40,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the recent case of <em>Winston Tan</em>, an award of $90,000 was given for the following
                    disabilities arising out of a head injury:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The disabilities suffered by the Respondent,
                    according to the medical experts, were in the main similar to those enumerated
                    in <em>Winston Tan</em>. In the present case, the
                    Respondent would obtain a total of $110,000 for her head injuries –
                    $70,000 for the physical injuries and $40,000 for her cognitive disabilities, a
                    sum slightly higher than that awarded in <em>Winston
                        Tan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>Samuel Chai</em>
                    at [48], the Court of Appeal commented
                    that “sub-itemisation” of what was essentially one single head
                    injury could give rise to over-compensation. In this regard, the risk of overlap
                    should always be borne in mind: see <em>Akhinur Nashu Kazi v
                        Chong Siak Hong (trading as Hong Hwa Marine Services)</em> [2009] SGHC
                    138. What is important to note is that, here, the Respondent has suffered rather
                    significant cognitive disabilities, to the extent that she had difficulties
                    navigating the Polytechnic campus even with the aid of a map. Unlike <em>Winston Tan</em>, where the injured party, notwithstanding
                    his head injuries, <em>continued to complete the polytechnic
                        course with above average grades, the Respondent here failed to
                        graduate</em>. In this case the AR granted a global sum of $95,000 for
                    the head injuries sustained by the Respondent (including a sum of $25,000 for
                    cognitive disabilities). On account of the sum in respect of cognitive
                    disabilities being raised by the Judge from $25,000 to $40,000, the global sum
                    for the Respondent’s head injuries has become $110,000. While on the face
                    of it this sum is higher than the $90,000 granted in <em>Winston
                        Tan</em>, we are unable to say that this enhancement renders the
                    global award of $110,000 for the Respondent’s head injuries clearly
                    excessive. In the circumstances, we are not minded to disturb the enhancement of
                    the award for cognitive disabilities from $25,000 to $40,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the premises, we would substitute the sum
                    awarded by the Judge for LFE by making a provisional damage order on the basis
                    of LEC at the sum assessed by the AR of $120,000. The judgment below is
                    accordingly modified. As the Appellant has failed to have the sum awarded for
                    cognitive impairment reduced and as it was at the suggestion of the court that
                    we have now made a provisional damage order, we think it is only just that the
                    Appellant should forthwith bear part of the costs of this appeal. We would
                    accordingly grant the Respondent one-third of the costs of this appeal. We will
                    leave it to the re-assessment judge to determine how much of the remaining
                    two-third costs of this appeal (if any) should be granted to the Respondent.
                    Much would have to depend on the outcome of the re-assessment. For example, if
                    at the re-assessment the Respondent is held to be entitled to LFE at a sum no
                    less than the amount awarded by the Judge, then that would be a strong ground to
                    further grant the two-third costs of this appeal to the Respondent. The costs of
                    the re-assessment itself will be for the judge hearing the re-assessment to
                    decide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There will be the usual consequential orders
                    as well as liberty to apply.</p>
