To recapitulate, these disputes arise out of a joint venture which sought to exploit a technology developed by Australian parties for the upgrading of sub-bituminous coal from mines in Tabang, East Kalimantan, owned by Indonesian parties, into coal briquettes with a higher calorific value and lower moisture content. The terms of the joint venture were set out in the JV Deed dated 7 June 2006. However, during the course of the joint venture, the parties subsequently entered into a number of ancillary agreements, memoranda, side letters and other documents recording their various agreements on the many issues that cropped up.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The background and facts surrounding these disputes have been set out in our earlier judgment dated 12 May 2016 for the first tranche of this trial (“Tranche 1”): see <span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1; [2016] 5 LRC 186 (“the First Judgment”) at [1] – [85]. We will not repeat the same and will only refer to those facts insofar as it is necessary to do so to answer the issues raised in Tranche 2. Unless otherwise specified, we adopt the same abbreviations used in the First Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 To recapitulate, in the First Judgment, we determined issues which fell into three categories, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, funding issues, coal supply issues and counterclaim issues (see the First Judgment at [86]). We held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in respect of the funding issues, we held that BR was not obliged to fund the joint venture between November 2011 and March 2012 on two grounds (see the First Judgment at [92] – [131]). First, cl 4 of the Funding MOU did not override cll 7.1 and 8 of the JV Deed. Secondly, the good faith obligation in cl 17.3 of the JV Deed did not constrain BR to approve any and all additional expenditure assessed by BCBCS. We also held that BCBCS had not undertaken to fund the joint venture until commercial production (see the First Judgment at [137] – [146]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) with regard to the coal supply issues, we held that the arrangements under the April 2011 Side Letter read with the 2010 CSAs were neither illegal nor tainted with illegality (see the First Judgment at [172] – [228]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) on the counterclaim issues, we held that BCBCS was not under an implied obligation to use the reasonable skill and care expected of a competent designer, builder and operator of coal preparation and briquetting plants in providing technical assistance to KSC (see the First Judgment at  [263] – [271]). For completeness, we also held that there was no implied term of the JV Deed and/or the Funding MOU that BCBCS was under a contractual obligation to procure that KSC produce 1 MTPA of upgraded coal briquettes within a reasonable time (see the First Judgment at [272] – [287]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 We also held that we were not able to answer the other coal supply issue, Issue 4, which was formulated as follows (see [155] of the First Judgment):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… whether BR was under an obligation to supply and/or assist in procuring coal to be supplied to KSC on the basis set out in the JV Deed, PLFA and/or the April 2011 Side Letter, in around the period between early November 2011 to 2 March 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We left this question open for Tranche 2 because there was “insufficient evidence … before us to answer the question of what coal KSC required in early November 2011 to 2 March 2012”: see [171] of the First Judgment. We stated that “what stage the commissioning had reached by early November 2011 and whether there was sufficient coal for the commissioning process during the relevant period … cannot be answered on the inadequate evidence placed before us”, and reserved Issue 4 for Tranche 2 where the necessary facts and evidence could be fully adduced and explored.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 For Tranche 2, the parties formulated a further list of eleven issues for our determination. Again, the issues fall within three broad categories:

They agreed on the framing of Issues 2, 4, 5 to 8, 10 and 11, but were unable to agree on the wording of Issues 1, 3 and 9. In response, we informed the parties that we would hear Tranche 2 on the basis of the list of agreed and non-agreed issues set out in the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter to the Court dated 18 November 2016. On those issues upon which the parties could not reach agreement, we would decide matters based on the pleaded issues, with each party being able to argue as to what the pleaded issues were.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We have set out these agreed and non-agreed issues in our judgment below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In this tranche, the parties were, in essence, focused on:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Issue 4 from Tranche 1 (Issues 1 to 3 of Tranche 2);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the alleged breaches by BR of obligations in relation to the supply of coal to KSC (“BR’s coal supply obligations”) (Issue 4 of Tranche 2);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether, in the events that occurred at the end of 2011 and early 2012, either party was in repudiatory breach of its obligations; and if so, whether the other party had accepted the other’s repudiatory breach (if any) and put an end to the joint venture (Issues 5 to 8 of Tranche 2); and   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether, even if BR was in repudiatory breach of its coal supply obligations, such breach could have caused BCBCS loss, given our conclusion in Tranche 1 that BR was not obliged to fund KSC between November 2011 and 2 March 2012 (Issues 9 to 11 of Tranche 2). The thrust of the Defendants’ case on this point is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) BCBCS was not entitled under the JV Deed to unilaterally fund KSC without BR’s approval;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) accordingly, KSC was simply not viable, since it was devoid of funding from BR and unable to receive funding from BCBCS due to BR’s objections to such funding;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) even if coal had been supplied, KSC would not have been able to do anything with the coal (much less upgrade the same into coal briquettes) without funding;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) thus, even if BR had breached its coal supply obligations, this could not have caused loss to BCBCS.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">On these premises, it follows that, even if BR had breached its coal supply obligations, the damages for such breach would only be nominal. Thus, the Defendants argue that there is no need for a third tranche of these proceedings (“Tranche 3”) to determine the quantum of any loss or damage suffered by BCBCS due to BR’s alleged breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 During a Case Management Conference (“CMC”) before Tranche 2, we informed the parties that reference could be made to evidence from Tranche 1 (to avert the need to recall witnesses to repeat their evidence).

BR was “not sabotaging the [P]roject”, but its view was that “[the] project will not make money for KSC”. BR wanted “to get out of [the] JV”.

However, he said that “BR would need to sell coal to KSC at commercial rates” (for example, at US$40 per tonne for 4,200 CV coal, ex mine, without transport).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Chin also stated that BR wanted the issue to be finalised by the end of 2011, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, within two months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Neil’s note is a very brief one.

Mr Maras’ note indicates that, on 3 November 2011, the following discussion occurred:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) BR stated that it wished to recover its US$45m investment in the Project. It would support WEC by supplying coal on arms’ length terms. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In response, Mr Flannery proposed two options which would allow the parties to “continue as is” until June 2012 and complete the modifications to the Tabang Plant. First, KSC could buy and sell coal at the HBA price (with BCBCS funding the shortfall). Secondly, coal could just be transferred with no sales recorded. Mr Flannery stated that either option would enable BR to write off its loans before the end of the year. Further, if the Tabang Plant were abandoned in the future, BCBCS would be entitled to the production module while BR would be entitled to the power station. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At this point, the meeting was adjourned for 30 minutes. When it resumed, Mr McLeod informed the meeting that BR did not see that the Project was viable and did not want to participate further as a 49% shareholder in KSC. Mr McLeod then set out two options as follows:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) first, BCBCS could buy out BR’s 49% stake in the Project, thus enabling BR to recoup its US$45m investment, with the payment terms to be negotiated (“the US$45m buyout option”); </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) secondly, the parties could immediately close the Tabang Plant and wind down the Project.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Mr McLeod also reiterated that BR’s involvement would have to conclude by the end of 2011.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In relation to [25(b)] above, Mr Flannery deposed that, at the meeting on 3 November 2011, he had proposed the following options to BR:

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, I informed BR that while our position was that the coal should be supplied in accordance with the Side Letter, we were willing to consider agreeing to KSC purchasing coal from BR and selling briquettes back to BR at HBA price until June 2012. I recall explaining that this will allow the remaining modifications to be completed in the meantime, and it would also give BCBCS some time to find a buyer for BR’s 49% stake.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The alternative was for coal to be transferred to KSC and briquettes to BR with no sales recorded.  This would enable KSC’s operations to carry on with no cost to BR at all – the modifications and operating costs of the [Tabang Plant] would be funded entirely by BCBCS, and BR would receive upgraded coal in exchange for the low-grade coal which was supplied to KSC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I said that either option would allow BR to write off its loans to KSC before 31 December 2011.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Mr McLeod’s note of the meeting on 3 November 2011 is in line with Mr Maras’ account, and reflects the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Chin stated that BR would supply coal, haulage and barging at commercial rates to KSC. BCBCS replied that the Project was not viable if KSC had to buy coal at US$40 per tonne.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) BCBCS stated that it wished to carry on with the Project, and suggested a deadline of June 2012.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) BR’s offer to BCBCS was for the latter to buy BR’s shares in the Project, with the payment terms being flexible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Having set out the records of the November 2011 Board Meeting and Mr Neil’s testimony, we note that Mr Chin deposed on the meeting as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34.  On 2 November 2011, Mr McLeod, Mr Neil, Mr Lim, Mr Irwan, Mr Brian Flannery, Mr Mike Chapman, Mr Maras and I attended the KSC board meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia. I recall that the following was discussed at the meeting:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f)  I added that <span class="font-italic">Bara and </span><span class="font-italic">[FSP] had to supply coal to KSC (at least in the short term) in accordance with the terms of the 2010 Coal Supply Agreements</span> i.e. at the HBA Minimum Price, less transportation and port costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35.  On 3 November 2011, Mr McLeod, Mr Neil, Mr Lim and I met with Mr Flannery, Mr Chapman and Mr Maras to continue the previous day’s discussion. At that meeting:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) I repeated my view that I did not think the Tabang Plant was technically or financially viable for BR, but that BR was prepared to continue supporting the Project (for the short term) <span class="font-italic">by having Bara and/or </span><span class="font-italic">[FSP] supply coal to KSC at a price which was in accordance with the terms of the 2010 Coal Supply Agreements</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We note that Mr Chin identified Bara and FSP as the entities with obligations in relation to supplying coal to KSC, and spoke only of the 2010 CSAs. He did not state that BR had any obligations in relation to coal supply under the JV Deed or the PLFA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Having reviewed the documentary evidence and heard the witnesses, we make the following further findings regarding what transpired at the November 2011 Board Meeting:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) BR told BCBCS that the joint venture no longer made financial sense for BR; the Project was not feasible.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) BR wanted to exit the joint venture and its exit to be finalised by the end of December 2011. We note that Mr Neil testified that BR had exited the joint venture on 2 November 2011, and no longer considered itself a party to the joint venture thereafter (see [24] above). If Mr Neil’s evidence is accepted, BR would have repudiated the JV Deed because, under the JV Deed, a party could not withdraw or bring the joint venture to an end by a unilateral declaration at a KSC Board Meeting. However, we do not accept Mr Neil’s evidence. The notes of the meeting show, and we find, that BR did not communicate to BCBCS that it had exited from the joint venture during the meeting. We place less weight on Mr Neil’s evidence, given during cross-examination a few years after the event, and give more weight to the contemporaneous documents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Rather, what BR did was to inform BCBCS that it no longer wished to continue with the joint venture for the reasons set out above. BR then presented two options to BCBCS: the latter could buy out BR at US$45m on terms (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the time over which payment could be made) which were negotiable, or the parties could immediately wind down the Project and shut down the Tabang Plant. In turn, BCBCS presented two options to BR. Essentially, these were two experienced business entities negotiating with proposals and counter-proposals which were aligned to their respective, but conflicting, interests. What the parties said subsequently is consistent with this. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) However, BR stated that if BCBCS wanted to continue with the Project, then Bara and FSP would only supply coal to KSC from then on at HBA prices, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, at commercial rates and on arms’ length terms. We find that, in making this statement, BR committed a repudiatory breach of the PLFA by renunciation. This is because, under Art 7 of the PLFA, Bara and FSP were only entitled to US$8 per tonne immediately, and not HBA prices, for the coal which they supplied to KSC (see [58] of the First Judgment). By stating that Bara and FSP would only supply coal at HBA prices, BR renounced its obligation under Art 7.1 of the PLFA to ensure that coal was supplied to KSC in line with the deferred payment mechanism which the PLFA provided for. We consider that Art 7 was a condition of the PLFA. Therefore, BR’s renunciation of its obligation under Art 7.1 amounted to a repudiation of the PLFA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) It is noteworthy that BCBCS did not state at any time during the November 2011 Board Meeting that BR was in breach of its obligations. Nor did it state that it accepted any repudiatory breach by BR.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) On the contrary, BCBCS asked that the Project continue as is until June 2012 by which time the modifications would have been completed. In this regard, BCBCS proposed two options. First, KSC could buy and sell coal at HBA prices and BCBCS would fund the shortfall. Secondly, coal could be transferred with no sales recorded.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The parties did not arrive at any final, concluded positions at the November 2011 Board Meeting. Rather, the meeting ended in an impasse and both sides left to consider their options and positions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Cessation of the Coal Supply</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On 4 November 2011, Mr McLeod sent an email to Mr Maras and Mr Chapman stating that he had spoken to Mr Chin, and confirmed that as “an interim measure and for the short term Bayan would … [c]ontinue to supply coal to KSC at HBA … [and] [t]ake the upgraded coal at HBA”.

</div> According to BCBCS, BR had breached the JV Deed as its representatives had stated at the 17 November 2011 Meeting that (1) Bara would only supply coal to KSC “on the condition that [WEC] repay in full loans of approximately USD $45 million made by BR to KSC” and that (2) “Bara intended to cease supplying coal immediately unless [WEC] agreed to pay BR that amount”. BCBCS required BR to remedy the breach within seven days by directing Bara to supply coal in accordance with the 2010 CSA to which Bara was a party, and reserved all its rights arising out of BR’s breach of the JV Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We note that there was no allegation that BR had breached the PLFA, or a direct claim that Bara and FSP had breached the 2010 CSAs.

Instead, the WEC parties expressly repeated that BR had to procure Bara to supply coal under the 2010 CSA to which Bara was a party. Additionally, it introduced the new element of BR’s alleged obligation to fund its 49% share of US$20m (KSC’s anticipated expenditure to the end of June 2012).

</div> We take the fourth version to be the final copy of the minutes as it reflected input from both parties and their in-house lawyers.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The records of the meeting indicate, and we so find, that the following transpired:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Duncan stated that Bara was obliged to supply coal to KSC under the 2010 CSAs as amended by the April 2011 Side Letter. Mr Khaw replied that the Bayan parties would only comply with the former: BR was only obliged to comply with the latter if the joint venture continued; however, it proposed to withdraw from the joint venture. Mr Chin clarified that Bara was prepared to supply coal to KSC in line with the 2010 CSAs, which required coal to be sold at HBA prices.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Duncan requested that BR comply with its obligations under all the relevant agreements. Mr Chin “questioned how the agreements [could] be enforced against BR where BR [wished] to exit the JV”. Mr Duncan said that BR could not unilaterally exit the joint venture, and noted that cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed states that the parties’ unanimous consent is necessary to wind up KSC. Mr Khaw said that “this provision was not relevant as BR’s intention [was] to exit the JV”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Duncan and Mr Flannery stated that Mr Chin had conditioned the supply of coal to KSC on the US$45m buyout option at the 17 November 2011 Meeting. Mr Chin denied this. Mr Flannery noted that he had been informed that Bara had received instructions to stop supplying coal to KSC. Mr Chin stated that “coal supply will continue on the condition that KSC agrees to pay the HBA price for the coal”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Chin reiterated BR’s intention to withdraw from the joint venture, noting the costs had substantially overrun the initial projection.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Duncan offered to arbitrate the coal price issue in Singapore. Mr Chin rejected this offer. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Mr Chin reiterated BR’s offer to sell its 49% stake to BCBCS stating that, if BCBCS was not agreeable, KSC would have to be liquidated unless BCBCS had a counter-proposal. Mr Duncan replied that the WEC parties would not buy BR out unless the coal supply issue was resolved. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Mr Flannery stated that, if BR was not willing to fund KSC, KSC would need to go into care and maintenance. Mr Chin replied that KSC should “stop its operations to avoid incurring further costs”. Mr Flannery then “agreed to suspend KSC operations and maintain a limited number of people on site”, and added that BR would be provided with “proposals for BR’s approval on crew required to implement a care and maintenance program on a monthly cost basis”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We make the following findings in relation to the 6 December 2011 EGM:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) BR reiterated that it intended to withdraw from the joint venture. BCBCS made clear that it wished to continue with the Project. The parties negotiated to achieve their respective aims during the meeting, but did not reach a mutually acceptable position.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In reiterating that the Bayan parties would only supply coal to KSC at HBA prices, BR again committed a repudiatory breach of the PLFA (see [29(d)] and [46] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) BR, having previously instructed Bara and FSP to stop supplying coal to KSC from 9 November 2011, was in continuing repudiatory breach of the PLFA and the JV Deed, at the time of the 6 December 2011 EGM. We expand on this at [137] and [182] below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) BCBCS did not accept the repudiatory breaches set out at [(b)] and [(c)] above. On the contrary, it wanted to keep the Project alive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) WEC and BR agreed to put KSC into care and maintenance at this meeting. We expand on this at [176] below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Events following the 6 December 2011 EGM</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On 6 December 2011, Mr Neil sent an email to Mr Wong, copying Mr Chin, which stated as follows: “If Kaltim Supacoal ask for more raw coal please agree to supply them”.

WEC also stated that “one of the consequences of BR’s refusal to provide funding in accordance with its obligations is that KSC will need to suspend its operations and implement a care and maintenance program”.

The Tabang Plant remained in the commissioning phase until 15 December 2011, when it was put into care and maintenance when the modifications were not yet complete. We note that, at the 6 December 2011 EGM, Mr Chin, whilst complaining about the time which had been taken for commissioning, observed that “the [Tabang Plant] still remains under commissioning”.

As stated in the November 2011 Board Pack, KSC had assumed that, following completion of the modification works, the production module of the Tabang Plant could operate with 14 briquetting machines at 7.5 tonnes per hour (“TPH”) for a total production of 105 TPH.

Essentially, Mr Alderman was looking at the historical position prior to the modifications which were to be carried out in November 2011. Those modifications had the express purpose of improving the characteristics of the Tabang Plant. Mr Alderman arrived at his production rate of 13.1% by dividing the total production of 10,932.57 tonnes of briquettes in September 2011 by 30 days (to reflect a month of production).

</div> However, the Tabang Plant only operated for 13 days in September 2011. The daily production was therefore about 840 tonnes per day, which amounted to 30% of the targeted daily production rate. We note that the Tabang Plant had operated for 20 days and 22 days in March and May 2011 respectively.

KSC could not operate the Business in circumstances where, as it was entitled to, BR had refused to provide further funding to KSC, and where BCBCS itself did not fund or propose to fund KSC; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(C) At the material time, the production module of the Tabang Plant had been shut down for upgrading works and/or the power station of the Tabang Plant had been shut down for maintenance; and/or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(D) On 15 December 2011, BCBCS procured KSC to place the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance;</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It is convenient to consider each of the four allegations – allegations (A), (B), (C) and (D) – in that paragraph of the pleading in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 First, allegation (A) is that, at the material time, the Tabang Plant was not operational. We hold that the fact that the Tabang Plant was not operational from November 2011 to 2 March 2012 did not affect BR’s coal supply obligations. On 7 November 2011, KSC made a valid request for coal to be supplied for testing. That gave rise to Bara and FSP’s obligation to supply the coal under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs, in order for there to be sufficient coal for testing when the Tabang Plant became operational after the modifications. BR thus also acquired obligations to ensure that Bara and FSP fulfilled their obligations under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs (see [77] above). As matters developed in November and early December 2011, the modifications were not completed and the Tabang Plant remained non-operational so that testing was delayed. But we do not consider that this affected BR’s coal supply obligations. Those remained, and had to be fulfilled, so that coal would be available for testing when the Tabang Plant resumed operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Secondly, allegation (B) is, essentially as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) KSC was not self-funding, and any additional expenditure by KSC could be funded only by way of shareholder funding; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) KSC could not operate the Business in circumstances where:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) BR had refused to provide further funding to KSC, as it was entitled to; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) BCBCS itself did not fund or propose to fund KSC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In addressing Issue 9 below, we assess the last premise in this allegation, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that BCBCS did not fund or propose to fund KSC, and find that BCBCS had expressed a willingness to fund KSC unilaterally (see [220] – [223] below). Thus, we are not persuaded at this stage that the last premise is made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In any event, as explained at [112]–[117] above under Issue 2(iv), we do not consider that BR’s coal supply obligations were dependent on there being funding for KSC or, as developed in the Defendants’ submissions, on KSC being able to pay Bara and FSP for coal. Thus, BR’s coal supply obligations were not affected by the matters stated in allegation (B).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Allegation (C) is that, at the material time, the production module and/or the power station had been shut down for upgrading works and maintenance. This is, in essence, the same point raised in allegation (A) above. The fact that the production module and power station had been shut down did not affect Bara and FSP’s obligations to supply coal to KSC under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs which had been triggered by KSC’s request for coal on 7 November 2011. Thus, these matters also did not affect BR’s coal supply obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Finally, allegation (D) is that, on 15 December 2011, BCBCS procured KSC to place the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance. We have found at [51(e)] above, for full reasons given at [176] below, that the Tabang Plant was placed into care and maintenance by agreement. By that stage, the modifications had not been completed, but that did not affect the obligations under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs or BR’s coal supply obligations. KSC had made a proper request for coal which was needed for testing; and, although the testing might have been delayed when the Tabang Plant was put into care and maintenance, the obligation to supply the coal for testing “as and when requested” remained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 We therefore find that, individually and cumulatively, the matters raised in this issue, and under para 178A(a)(iv) of the defence and counterclaim, did not affect BR’s coal supply obligations. These matters were united by the Defendants’ allegation that, as a consequence of these matters, the Business had come to a halt. However, we note at [214] below, in addressing Issue 9, that the JV Deed defines the Business in wide terms. As submitted by Mr Davinder Singh SC (“Mr Singh”) on behalf of the Defendants, the Business refers to “the entire spectrum of the joint venture company's activities from obtaining the raw coal from source to working on that coal in the [Tabang Plant] and to then selling that upgraded coal”.

</div> We find that the Business did not cease, nor did BR’s coal supply obligations cease, just because the Tabang Plant was at a particular stage of commissioning, was non-operational, or placed into care and maintenance. Nor did any lack of funding or, as the Defendants developed, KSC’s inability to pay, affect BR’s coal supply obligations in relation to the Business. The answer to Issue 2(v) is therefore “yes”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2(vi)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Issue 2(vi) was framed in these terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether, by unilaterally placing KSC into care and maintenance, BCBCS effectively caused KSC to cease its business and/or terminate its operations without BR’s consent, thereby committing a breach of Clause 7.1(x) of the JV Deed, which breach released BR from the Disputed Coal Supply Obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As stated at [126] above, we have found that the Tabang Plant was placed into care and maintenance by agreement between the parties. In those circumstances, there was no breach of the JV Deed which could have released BR from its coal supply obligations. Issue 2(vi) therefore does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2 - Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The following conclusions arise from our rulings on Issues 2(i) to (vi):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In November 2011, given the stage of commissioning, there was insufficient coal on site for the testing of the Tabang Plant or any electricity generator of the Tabang Plant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) KSC made a valid request for such coal in accordance with the terms of the 2010 CSAs on 7 November 2011.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There was nothing arising from the funding of KSC, the ability of KSC to pay for coal, the fact that the Tabang Plant had been shut down for modifications or the placing of the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance which affected BR’s coal supply obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3(i)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Issue 3(i) states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether, as a matter of construction and at law, any limitation (in the terms relied upon by BR at sub-issues 2(ii) to 2(vi) above) was placed on BR’s continuing obligation to supply coal to KSC under Clause 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs; </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The parties could not agree on whether this issue should be included. In any event, it has been answered as a result of our answers to Issues 2(ii) to 2(vi) above.

To the extent that cll 3.1 to 3.5 applied to requests for coal under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs, the parties agreed, at the June 2010 Board Meeting, to apply a different procedure to be decided by Mr Reilly and Mr Wong. The latter in turn agreed to continue with the informal procedure that they had been using (see [104] above). The answer to this issue is therefore “yes”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 We now turn to Issue 4, which was conditioned on BR being subject to its coal supply obligations – a premise which, in light of our findings above, is made out. We now consider Issues 4(i) to (iii); each of these sub-issues pertain to breach of BR’s coal supply obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4(i)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Issue 4(i) was whether BR was in breach by virtue of the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Allegedly instructing its subsidiaries FSP and Bara to cease supply of coal to KSC on or around 9 November 2011;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 We have found that, on 9 November 2011, BR instructed Bara and FSP to cease the supply of coal to KSC (see [33] above). We now find that, by issuing this instruction, BR was in breach of its coal supply obligations: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed, BR was obliged to assist in procuring Coal for the operation of the Business. The supply of coal for testing under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs was Coal for the operation of the Business. Thus, by instructing Bara and FSP to cease the supply of coal to KSC, BR breached its obligation under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under cl 7.1 of the PLFA, BR was obliged to ensure that Bara and FSP supplied coal for testing to KSC. Thus, by instructing Bara and FSP to cease the supply of coal to KSC, BR breached its obligation under cl 7.1 of the PLFA to ensure that Bara and FSP supplied coal for testing to KSC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The answer to Issue 4(i) is therefore “yes”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4(ii) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Issue 4(ii) was whether BR had breached its coal supply obligations by:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Allegedly conveying to KSC that it would not be performing its obligation(s) to supply coal when the time for actual performance of these obligations arrived;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 When, on 9 November 2011, BR instructed Bara and FSP to cease the supply of coal to KSC, there was an existing request for coal which KSC had made on 7 November 2011. Plainly, BR’s instruction referred to that request. We also find that the terms of the instruction meant that later requests for coal under cll 3.1 to 3.8 of the 2010 CSAs would not be met. Accordingly, we find that, by the 9 November 2011 email, the contents of which were later conveyed to Mr Reilly (see [34] above), BR conveyed to KSC that it would not be performing its coal supply obligations when the time for actual performance of these obligations arrived. Thus, BR committed a breach of cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed and cl 7.1 of the PLFA by renouncing its duties thereunder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The answer to Issue 4(ii) is therefore “yes”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4(iii) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Issue 4(iii) was whether BR was in breach due to the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Allegedly conditioning its performance of its obligation(s) to supply coal on BCBCS/WEC buying out its 49% stake in KSC for US$45 million. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 We have found that, at the 17 November 2011 Meeting, BR did condition the supply of coal to KSC on the US$45m buyout option. We now find that BR thus conditioned performance of its coal supply obligations on that buyout option, and that BR was not entitled under Art 7.1 of the PLFA and cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed to do so. Thus, BR breached its duties under those provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The answer to Issue 4(iii) is therefore “yes”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The repudiation issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 We now address the second cluster of issues which pertain to repudiation of the JV Deed. We emphasise that the narrow issue before us is whether either party repudiated the JV Deed, and not any other agreement. We therefore do not further elaborate on BR’s repudiatory breaches of the PLFA, referred to at [29(d)], [46] and [51(b)] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We turn first to Issue 5, which pertained to BCBCS’ alleged repudiation of the JV Deed. In their closing submissions, the Defendants clarify that their case that BCBCS repudiated the JV Deed is founded on the Excess Expenditure Argument, the Excess Debt Argument and BCBCS’ purportedly placing the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance on 15 December 2011 without BR’s consent (“the Care and Maintenance Argument”).

The Defendants emphasise that Mr Lim’s role was merely that of ensuring that KSC followed proper procurement procedures. He had no authority to approve the Excess Expenditure; and could not prospectively approve or even consider such expenditure because, when he received a cheque, KSC had already committed to the contract with the relevant vendor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The Defendants further argue that breach of cll 7.1(s) and/or (bb) was a repudiatory breach of the JV Deed, as it was fundamental to the joint venture that the parties unanimously consent before KSC incurred expenditure.

It is not critical that Mr Lim did not (generally) know KSC’s budget. Nor is it crucial that, by the time he received a cheque, the purchase order and work order would have been issued. Nor is it significant, if true, that Mr Lim tempered his inquiries after his encounter with Mr Chapman. What is vital is that BR had the power to veto payments out of KSC’s accounts. How they chose to exercise that power is a matter that lies at their doorstep, not BCBCS’ nor WEC’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 We have found that BR knew that KSC was spending in excess of its budget by 26 April 2011, when Ms O’Bryan sent the March 2011 Cost Report, and on 15 July 2011, when she sent the June 2011 Cost Report (see [17] – [18] above). As noted above, the latter showed that, as of June 2011, the Tabang Plant’s operating costs had exceeded the budget by US$6,071,314. In April or July 2011, BR could easily have acted to stop further expenditure or instructed Mr Lim to stop signing cheques. However, BR did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 We now make the further finding that BR knew, since June 2010 at the very latest, that the WEC parties were funding KSC in excess of approved amounts and KSC were spending in excess of approved amounts. The evidence before us shows that only one Business Plan under cl 7.1 of the JV Deed was submitted and approved in the early stages of the joint venture. Thereafter, the formality of putting up and approving a Business Plan was not followed. We find that the parties kept revising the shareholder loans and KSC’s expenditure upwards, albeit with some instances where BR voiced concerns; and there was a pattern of extending sums and incurring or committing to incurring expenditure beyond approved limits before obtaining approval. For example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 16 September 2008, BCBCS transferred US$2m to KSC for KSC to meet its minimum cash needs.

BR then sought an undertaking from BCBCS to fund KSC until KSC reached commercial production. In the First Judgment, we found at [146] that BCBCS did not give such an undertaking. But that does not detract from the fact that BCBCS was funding KSC, regardless of whether it had undertaken to do this, and we so find. BR knew this, but BR did not stop KSC from incurring such expenditure, or instruct Mr Lim to stop signing any more cheques, even after it had received the March 2011 and June 2011 Cost Reports. BR does not appear to have called a halt to KSC incurring further expenditure until BR’s Default Notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 We also note that, while Mr McLeod stated that BR had grave concerns after receiving the June 2011 Cost Report (see [18] above), the November 2011 Board Meeting was not held until more than three months after BR received that document. In his reply AEIC, Mr McLeod explained that he acceded to Mr Maras’ request to defer the meeting because Mr Chapman had stated, during the March 2011 Board Meeting, that the modifications to the Tabang Plant would be completed by September 2011 and BR had previously agreed that the next Board Meeting would be after the modifications were complete.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In response to [166(a)], the Defendants argue that the agreed funding arrangements which BCBCS contended for would render the US$40m limit under the PLFA meaningless. Moreover, it would have made no commercial sense for BR to have agreed to such funding arrangements since it would take longer for BR to recover its investment in KSC the more debt KSC took on from BCBCS.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In response to [166(b)], the Defendants argue that BR could not have consented to the Excess Debt when there was no information at the material time regarding who would be providing the funding, and the terms on which funding would be provided. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In response to [166(c)], the Defendants emphasise that the Excess Debt was recorded as a debt in the November 2011 Board Pack and that BCBCS had first argued that the Excess Debt was not one of KSC’s debts in Mr Flannery’s AEIC, in this tranche of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 We do not accept the Excess Debt Argument. It assumes that BCBCS had caused KSC to incur a debt. But, in our judgment, that premise is unsound. It does not follow from the fact that BCBCS had advanced US$6m to KSC that KSC accrued a corresponding debt to BCBCS. Furthermore, that the Excess Debt was recorded as a debt in the November 2011 Board Pack does not establish that such a debt had accrued. As the Plaintiffs argue, such a debt would only have arisen if the parties had subsequently ratified the funding by a shareholder loan agreement or a further Addendum to the PLFA. Failing such ratification, BCBCS simply could not recover from KSC the US$6m which it had advanced to the latter. It is not in dispute that there was no such subsequent ratification of the US$6m funding. Therefore, KSC did not incur a debt of US$6m to BCBCS; and the premise of Issue 5(ii) falls away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The Defendants submit that this line of reasoning, which is inherent in the Plaintiffs’ submission summarised at [166(c)] above, was not pleaded. However, in our judgment, this objection has little weight. It was the Defendants who pleaded that the Plaintiffs repudiated the JV Deed by causing KSC to incur the Excess Debt. Accordingly, the Defendants bore the burden of proving that KSC incurred the Excess Debt, which burden they have not discharged. In any event, the matter is one for submissions and the parties have had adequate opportunity to deal with it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 For these reasons, the answer to Issue 5(ii) is “no”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues 5(iv) and (v)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 We will deal with Issues 5(iv) and (v) together.

As we have mentioned at [146] above, the Defendants have abandoned their argument in respect of the public announcements. We have also found that BCBCS did not breach the JV Deed in relation to the Excess Expenditure and the Excess Debt (see [162] and [170] above). It follows that the allegations of breach in BR’s Default Notice were baseless. Thus, BCBCS did not repudiate the JV Deed by failing to remedy these ostensible breaches; nor did BCBCS do so by demanding that BR withdraw BR’s Default Notice. Accordingly, the answer to both Issue 5(iv) and (v) is “no”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 5(vi) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Issue 5(vi) was whether BCBCS repudiated the JV Deed by reason of:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Procuring KSC to place the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance without BR’s consent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Parties’ Arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The Defendants’ case is that BCBCS repudiated the JV Deed by procuring KSC to place the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance, on or around 15 December 2011, without BR’s consent.

</div> As the Plaintiffs submit, putting the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance would have been consistent with this avowed aim because the value of KSC’s assets could only have been maximally realised if the Tabang Plant was put into care and maintenance and not abandoned.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This lends support to our finding that BR agreed to care and maintenance during the meeting.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) After the meeting, the WEC parties wrote to BR on 20 and 22 December 2011 to request confirmation that BR would provide 49% of the funding for the care and maintenance program (see [57]–[59] above). In its reply to the 20 December letter (see [60] above), BR asked for an “exhaustive and detailed list” of every item which the WEC parties alleged was required for care and maintenance and the cost of each item to “consider [its] position” in relation to the funding necessary for the care and maintenance program. BR added that it was requesting further information “without any admission of liability or confirmation of payment by BR”. We make the following points about this letter:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In this letter, BR was careful to state that it did not admit liability or confirm payment (in respect of the costs of care and maintenance). However, BR did not state that it had not agreed to care and maintenance, or that it would only so agree if the parties agreed on the costs of care and maintenance. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) A care and maintenance program could be implemented at various levels, with crew of varying expertise and numbers and therefore at different cost levels. BR wanted to know, before agreeing to the same, what items were being specified for care and maintenance, the number of crew for those items and the costs thereof.  </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) BR therefore asked for information to decide its position in relation to the “funding necessary for the care and maintenance program”. Reading between the lines, it is plain, and we so find, that BR had agreed that the Tabang Plant be put into care and maintenance, but reserved its position as to whether it would fund it without knowing the cost therefor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In short, the Care and Maintenance Argument is premised on the claim that BCBCS unilaterally procured KSC to put the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance. However, this was not the case. The parties agreed to put the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance at the 6 December 2011 EGM. Therefore, the Defendants’ contention on this issue fails. The answer to Issue 5(vi) is therefore also “no”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 6 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Issue 6 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If any of the above is established, whether BR accepted BCBCS’ repudiation of the JV Deed by way of BR’s letter dated 21 February 2012 to BCBCS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 We have answered Issues 5(i), (ii) and (iv) to (vi) in the negative. Therefore, BCBCS did not repudiate the JV Deed by reason of the matters contended for by BR. Hence, Issue 6 as to whether BR accepted BCBCS’ repudiation by BR’s Termination Notice does not arise.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 7</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Issue 7 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether BR had repudiated the JV Deed by: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  Breaching the Disputed Coal Supply Obligation as set out at Issue 4 above; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Its alleged words and conduct at the meetings of 2 and 3 November 2011 and 6 December 2011; and/or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii)  The allegedly wrongful issuance of BR’s letter dated 21 February 2012 to BCBCS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We address Issues 7(i) to (iii) in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 7(i) – The Coal Supply Argument</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The Plaintiffs argue that cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed was a condition of the same.

</div> We agree. Nonetheless, applying the general test in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>, it is clear that cl 3.8(b)(iii) was a condition of the JV Deed. The purpose of the joint venture was to upgrade coal from Bara and FSP in Tabang (see Recitals C and D of the JV Deed).

</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, BR’s obligation to assist in procuring coal for the Business (which, as we have found at [75] above, extended to ensuring that Bara and FSP complied with their obligations under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs) was fundamental to the joint venture. Thus, we find and hold that cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed was a condition of the same. It follows that, when BR breached cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed in respect of the matters set out in Issues 4(i) to (iii) (see [137], [140] and [143] above), BR was in repudiatory breach of the JV Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 However, the more important, and undisputed, point is that BCBCS did not purport to accept BR’s breaches of its coal supply obligations and terminate the JV Deed.

</div> The Defendants further argue that, at the November 2011 Board Meeting, BCBCS recognised that BR had such a right because it made new proposals, which departed from the existing arrangements, in view of the fact that the Business and joint venture were over. Finally, the Defendants submit that “BR’s position at the 6 December 2011 EGM was no different from its position at the 2 and 3 November 2011 meetings”; and that BR therefore did not renounce the JV Deed at the 6 December 2011 EGM.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 The law on renunciation is settled. A party renounces a contract where, by words or conduct, it “clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that it will not perform its contractual obligations at all” [emphasis omitted]: see <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> at [93]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 We find that BR did not renounce the JV Deed at the November 2011 Board Meeting for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 First, during the meeting, BR stated that it wished to exit from the joint venture and matters had to be finalised by the end of December 2011. However, it did not communicate to BCBCS that it no longer considered itself a party to the joint venture (see [29(b)] above). In our judgment, BR, in simply stating that it wished to exit the joint venture, was not intimating to BCBCS that it would not perform its obligations under the JV Deed at all. We note two further points in this regard:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) BCBCS did not state, during the November 2011 Board Meeting or in any of their contemporaneous letters thereafter, that BR had renounced the JV Deed during the meeting.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) After the November 2011 Board Meeting, Bara and FSP continued to supply coal to KSC until 9 November 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Secondly, BR did not renounce the JV Deed by merely making two proposals to BCBCS which were not in line with the joint venture. In doing so, BR was merely attempting to negotiate an exit from the joint venture (see [29(c)] above). In our judgment, the JV Deed did not preclude BR from doing so. We note that cll 11 to 13 of the JV Deed provided for termination of the joint venture by consent and for the resolution of deadlocks. We find that it was always open to BR to persuade BCBCS to agree, in a manner and on terms different from those contemplated by the JV Deed, to BR’s exit from the joint venture. We consider that this was what BR was trying to do in making its two proposals to BCBCS. And we note that BCBCS had also made counter-proposals to BR, which departed from the existing terms of the joint venture, as part of the negotiations between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Thirdly, in our judgment, BR’s obligation under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed was to assist in procuring coal for the Business in line with the terms of the 2010 CSAs (see [77(b)] above). This obligation did not extend to ensuring that coal was supplied to KSC on the terms of the PLFA, including the provision for the Coal Advance by BR. We note that, unlike the 2010 CSAs, the PLFA does not refer to the JV Deed at all. While we have found that Art 7.1 of the PLFA created a freestanding obligation on BR to ensure that coal was supplied to KSC in accordance with the 2010 CSAs (see [77(a)] above), we do not consider that the PLFA altered the content of BR’s obligation under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed. This continued to be to assist in procuring coal for KSC in accordance with the 2010 CSAs. Thus, while BR repudiated the PLFA at the November 2011 Board Meeting, we find that it did not thereby repudiate the JV Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 For similar reasons, we also find that BR did not renounce the JV Deed at the 6 December 2011 EGM:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, as explained at [188] above, BR did not renounce the JV Deed by stating that it wished to withdraw from the joint venture.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, BR did not renounce the JV Deed by restating its two proposals. In doing so, BR was simply negotiating to achieve its goal of an exit from the joint venture by the end of 2011 (see [50(f)] and [189] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, for the reasons given at [190] above, while BR again renounced the PLFA at the 6 December 2011 EGM, this did not amount to a breach of BR’s obligation under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, BR’s representatives may have made statements at the 6 December 2011 EGM which could be construed as indicating that BR no longer considered itself to be bound by the JV Deed (see [50(b)] above). But we find that, by these remarks, BR did not unambiguously convey to BCBCS that it would not perform its obligations under the JV Deed. We find that BCBCS would have understood these remarks as mere bluster or posturing. Ultimately, what is crucial is the consistent position expressed by BR during the meeting, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that BR wanted to exit the joint venture and was making two proposals to BCBCS in this regard. We have found that adopting this position did not amount to repudiatory conduct (see [(a)] and [(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The answer to Issue 7(ii) is therefore “no”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 7(iii)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 We have found that BCBCS did not repudiate the JV Deed (see [147] – [177] above) by reason of the matters relied on by BR. It follows that BR had no grounds to issue its Termination Notice which purported to terminate the JV Deed. By purporting to do so, BR clearly conveyed to BCBCS that it would not be complying with the JV Deed. We thus find that BR renounced the JV Deed by BR’s Termination Notice and thereby repudiated the JV Deed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 8 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Issue 8 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If any of the above is established, whether BCBCS accepted BR’s repudiation of the JV Deed by way of its letter dated 2 March 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 We have found that there was repudiatory conduct by BR by reason of (1) its breach of its coal supply obligations and (2) the wrongful issuance of BR’s Termination Notice.

With regard to (2), BCBCS sought to accept BR’s repudiation in its letter dated 2 March 2012. Therefore, given our finding that BR repudiated the JV Deed by BR’s Termination Notice, we find that BCBCS validly accepted BR’s repudiation of the JV Deed by its letter dated 2 March 2012 and thus terminated the JV Deed. The joint venture accordingly came to an end on 2 March 2012.

BR was thus in repudiatory breach of the JV Deed by breaching its obligation under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the same (see [182] above), albeit that BCBCS did not accept this repudiatory breach. BR also repudiated the JV Deed by BR’s Termination Notice which wrongly purported to terminate the JV Deed.

</div> The exception was Issue 9. At a CMC, the Defendants obtained leave from the Court to argue in Tranche 2 that, even if BR had breached the JV Deed, there would only be nominal damages. According to Mr Singh, even on the assumption that the Tabang Plant could have attained something like commercial production (1 MTPA) at some point in time, it could readily be demonstrated that damages from any breach of obligation or a repudiation of the JV Deed must be nominal. Issue 9 is thus analogous to a strike-out argument. Mr Singh contends that there is no need for this Court to hear what might involve (among other matters) substantial expert evidence on the Tabang Plant’s capacity to achieve commercial production. Instead, the Court would only have to draw obvious inferences from a manageable number of facts. It was on this basis that we allowed the Defendants to argue Issue 9 as part of Tranche 2. If Mr Singh is right, there would be no need for a Tranche 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203  In their opening statement for Tranche 2, the Defendants contend that, even if BR is liable for breach of its coal supply obligations or repudiation of the JV Deed, BCBCS should only be entitled to nominal damages for a limited period.

</div> This argument stemmed from para 178A(a)(iv) of their defence and counterclaim which has been dealt with in the context of Issue 2(v) at [118] – [127] above in relation to the extent of BR's coal supply obligations. (We note that Issue 9 as formulated by the Defendants refers to this paragraph of the defence and counterclaim: see [199] above). In the context of causation, the Defendants argue that, in the light of the matters pleaded in sub-para (A) to (D) of para 178A(a)(iv), BCBCS could not have suffered loss and damage from BR’s breach of its coal supply obligations or repudiatory breach of the JV Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The Defendants submit that since, as we held in Tranche 1, BR did not have an obligation to continue funding the joint venture, the failure by BR to supply (or procure the supply of) coal to KSC could have no material consequence.

</div> That is because KSC would require funds to continue to operate. In particular, KSC would need funds to modify and commission the Tabang Plant, to pay for coal, and to bring the Tabang Plant to commercial production. If no funds were forthcoming from BR, then the monies for KSC’s operation could only come from BCBCS. But the Defendants say that BR was entitled to (and did) object to BCBCS unilaterally funding KSC.

</div> The Defendants claim that, in late 2011, it had legitimate concerns about KSC taking on further liabilities to BCBCS and would not have allowed KSC to do so. The Defendants suggest that, due to its concerns, it made clear to BCBCS that BR would not countenance KSC incurring additional debt, given the large amounts already spent on the Project and the problems still being encountered with BCBCS’ coal briquetting technology. In consequence, even if theoretically the Tabang Plant was capable of achieving 1 MTPA of upgraded coal briquettes at some point, it could not (the Defendants assert) have reached that level of production without a further significant injection of cash. No such cash was forthcoming. Thus, the Tabang Plant would inevitably have had to close down without reaching commercial production or anywhere near that stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The Plaintiffs respond that, once ongoing modification works had been completed, the Tabang Plant would have soon been able to operate at a commercial level of 1 MTPA or something close to that.

</div>  The Plaintiffs argue that funding for the Project should not have been a difficulty, as WEC was prepared to fund KSC until at least June 2012. What was problematic was instead the continued supply of coal, because BR was threatening to pull out of the joint venture altogether. BR had also stopped the supply of coal since 9 November 2011.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 We are not persuaded by the Defendants’ arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The four alleged cut-off dates argued by the Defendants would not necessarily constrain the amount of damages payable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 First, in respect of 22 November 2011 (see [203(a)] above), Mr Reilly’s evidence, which we have accepted at [43] above, was that demobilisation did not mean that activity at the Tabang Plant stopped on that date. Only short-term contractors were requested to suspend work. KSC’s more than 300 regular employees continued to work on the modifications. Therefore, we do not accept the Defendants’ argument that, after 22 November 2011, it would not have been possible for KSC to reach commercial production and become profitable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Secondly, in respect of 6 December 2011 (see [203(b)] above), we have found that the 6 December 2011 instruction from BR to Bara and FSP was an internal communication that was not conveyed to KSC (see [52] above). We note that, in their closing submissions, the Defendants emphasise that, in their letter of 24 November 2011, and at the 6 December 2011 EGM, BR made clear that Bara and FSP were prepared to supply coal to KSC at HBA prices. However, at best, this would only mean that there was no continuing breach of BR’s coal supply obligations after 24 November or 6 December 2011. We have found that there was a breach of BR’s coal supply obligations under the JV Deed (see [137(a)] above); and we do not see why a claim for damages for this breach would necessarily have to be limited to the specific cut-off dates of 24 November or 6 December 2011.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Thirdly, as for 15 December 2011 (see [203(c)] above), Mr Reilly said that the Tabang Plant could be brought out of care and maintenance and “turned back on pretty quickly”.

I would think on the production module side of things and the conveyors side and the stockyard and the ROM coal, it wouldn't take long to get those going again. Depending on the amount of downtime that was there, it would obviously depend on how long it would take to re-fire the power station and get that back up to heat and get it going again so you could run under full steam.

The Defendants’ argument here is that this could only have been done if KSC had funding, and there was none. However, as we explain below, we do not consider that we can reach that conclusion at this stage. For these reasons, we do not accept the Defendants’ argument here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 That leaves the expiry of the PLFA on 31 December 2011 (see [203(d)] above). The Defendants submit that BR had no obligations under the PLFA thereafter. It is correct that the lapse of the PLFA on 31 December 2011 would have ended BR’s obligation under Art 7.1 of the same to ensure that Bara and FSP supplied coal to KSC in accordance with the terms of the 2010 CSAs. However, the JV Deed was still in force after 31 December 2011. Therefore, since Bara and FSP remained obliged under cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs to supply coal to KSC, notwithstanding the expiry of the PLFA, BR continued to bear the obligation under cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed to ensure that Bara and FSP supplied coal to KSC in accordance with cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs (see [75] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 To elaborate, under cl 3.8(b)(iii), BR was obliged to “assist in procuring Coal for the operation of the Business”.  As we have noted at [127] above, Mr Singh submitted that the JV Deed defines the “Business” in wide terms. We have also noted at [127] that the “Business” did not cease just because the Tabang Plant had gone into care and maintenance. We now find that, for similar reason, the “Business” of the joint venture would not have ceased merely because of the end of the “Availability Period” under the PLFA. BR continued to be subject to cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed notwithstanding that the PLFA expired on 31 December 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Additionally, if the joint venture had continued, and if the parties had managed to sort out their differences, it is possible that the Tabang Plant could have resumed operations, completed testing and commissioning, and gone on to commercial production. It therefore does not follow that all prospect of earnings under the joint venture came to an end when the PLFA expired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The Defendants submit that, starved of funds, the Tabang Plant could never have gone into commercial production in any event. We accept that an effect of the expiry of the PLFA on 31 December 2011 was that BR’s funding of the Coal Advance would have ceased and that cessation would be relevant to funding. Nonetheless, there are difficulties with the Defendants’ argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 To begin with, it is far from clear on the evidence that BCBCS was ever told that BR would veto BCBCS unilaterally funding KSC. Mr Singh cross-examined Mr Flannery extensively in relation to cl 7.1(f) of the JV Deed. But it was never directly put to Mr Flannery that BR had explicitly told BCBCS to stop injecting further funds into KSC from November 2011 onwards. On the contrary, Mr Flannery's evidence in cross-examination was that BR had made it clear that any further funding for KSC had to be provided by BCBCS alone at least until testing and commissioning of the Tabang Plant had been completed:

We have instead found at [17] – [18] above that, by 26 April 2011, BR knew that KSC was exceeding its budget and was reminded of this on 15 July 2011. We have also found that BR knew, since June 2010 at the very latest, that BCBCS was funding KSC on its own (see [159] above). As Mr Flannery vividly put it, money does not come from “[o]ut of the clouds”. Mr Singh suggested that BR only learnt that the PLFA had been exceeded by US$6m at the 6 December 2011 EGM. Assuming, contrary to what we have found, that this is correct, that would still not detract from the point that BR knew that BCBCS was unilaterally funding KSC and did not object to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Subject to BR supplying coal, the evidence is that BCBCS had expressed a willingness to fund KSC, at least until June 2012, even at HBA prices. We have found that, at the Board Meeting on 3 November 2011, Mr Flannery made two proposals to BR, one of which was that KSC could buy and sell coal at the HBA price, with BCBCS funding the shortfall (see [25(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Cross-examined on this, Mr Flannery stuck to his position:

I didn't ask you whether they were blowing it up. My question is a simple one. You proposed an altogether new arrangement, which was if the supplied at HBA and bought at HBA, WEC would fund; correct? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A.  <span class="font-italic">We would continue with the projec</span><span class="font-italic">t, at least until June of 2012</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 By reason of the foregoing, we do not accept that key assumptions that underpin Mr Singh’s argument have been established. In particular, we find that it has not been established that BCBCS would not have funded KSC unilaterally or that BR would have objected to BCBCS funding KSC unilaterally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Whilst on the current evidence, it seems likely that BCBCS would have been prepared to fund KSC unilaterally and BR would not have objected, we leave open the question whether as a matter of fact BCBCS was in a financial position to fund KSC unilaterally to the completion of testing and commissioning, or until June 2012, or whether BR would have objected to that funding and, if so, what the effect of that objection would have been.. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 Therefore, we do not think that what we have called Mr Singh’s strike-out argument is made out. We are not convinced that damages would only be nominal. They may or may not be. We are not persuaded that the Plaintiffs did not (and could not have) suffered significant expectation loss by reason of the Defendants’ repudiatory breach on 21 February 2012. In our judgment, a Tranche 3 specifically devoted to causation of damage and quantum cannot be avoided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 There are additional difficulties in Mr Singh’s case that we briefly comment on here, principally to flag (by no means exhaustively) issues of causation and loss that may need to be explored in Tranche 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 First, the Defendants’ argument on causation focuses on expectation loss, contending that the Project would never have gotten off the ground due to a lack of funding. But, even if the Defendants’ proposition is correct, there would remain the question whether BCBCS is entitled to claim reliance loss or wasted expenditure. In other words, given the repudiatory breach by BR on 21 February 2012, can BCBCS recover some or all of its investment sunk into KSC? We have heard no submissions on this point, and so we merely raise the question here as a potential issue for Tranche 3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Secondly, the Defendants emphasise BCBCS’ insistence that BR had an obligation under the JV Deed to fund its share of the joint venture. From 29 November 2011, BCBCS began insisting that BR provide funding pursuant to its alleged obligation under the JV Deed (see [45] above). BR refused to do so, maintaining that it had no such obligation under the JV Deed. The Tabang Plant was put into care and maintenance pending (among other matters) resolution of this dispute. The First Judgment established that BR had no obligation to provide funding under the JV Deed. In such circumstances, it is not obvious or self-evident whether (if at all) BCBCS’ wrongful insistence on BR being obliged to provide funding should (as a matter of causation) reduce or negate any damages to which BCBCS might be entitled on account of BR’s repudiation on 21 February 2012. The Defendants may have been arguing that BCBCS’ insistence on BR having an obligation to fund meant that there was contributory wrongdoing on BCBCS’ part and that would have led to any damages due to BCBCS being diminished or extinguished. That proposition may be right or wrong. Since neither party has thoroughly addressed us on this point, this question may likewise have to be explored in Tranche 3. We note in this connection that, contrary to what Mr Singh has submitted, it does not logically follow that, if BCBCS (wrongly) believed that BR was legally obliged by the JV Deed to provide its share of funding, BCBCS was not prepared to fund KSC on its own in any circumstances. In fact, as we have found, BCBCS did in fact put forward proposals to fund KSC on its own, subject to BR complying with its coal supply obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Thirdly, the Defendants submit that any lost profit being claimed by BCBCS would not be its own loss, but that of KSC. They invoke the principle against claims for reflective loss to contend that, as a mere shareholder, BCBCS cannot claim compensation for loss suffered by KSC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 On the reflective loss principle, we were only referred to a single case: <span class="font-italic">Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (in liquidation)</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span>”). There, the CA invited the parties to address it on whether the principle of reflective loss was applicable. Chan Sek Keong CJ (“Chan CJ”), delivering the judgment of the court, took the opportunity to review the case law on claims for reflective loss, noting that it had been accepted as good law in Singapore. Chan CJ also mentioned, at [75], the exception to the reflective loss principle identified by Waller LJ in <span class="font-italic">Giles v Rhind</span> [2003] Ch 618 at [34] (“the <span class="font-italic">Giles v Rhind </span>exception”). Ultimately, however, the CA declined to apply the reflective loss principle. This was on the basis that the issue had not been pleaded or canvassed at first instance; thus, Jenton had not had the opportunity to adduce evidence to establish, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the <span class="font-italic">Giles v Rhind</span> exception applied: see <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span> at [85] – [89]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 In this case, the Defendants conceded that they did not specifically plead the point on reflective loss; however, in oral closing submissions,

In any event, we consider that to apply that principle at this stage would unfairly deny BCBS the opportunity to adduce evidence in Tranche 3 that the loss for which it claims is not reflective, or that, if it is reflective, the loss falls within the <span class="font-italic">Giles v Rhind</span> exception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 On the law relating to reflective loss, we note that, after the decision in <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span>, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal delivered its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Waddington Ltd v Chan Chun Ho</span><span class="font-italic">o Thomas and others</span> [2009] 2 BCLC 82 (“<span class="font-italic">Waddington</span>”).

Neither party addressed us on whether <span class="font-italic">Waddington</span> has any bearing on the <span class="font-italic">Giles v Rhind</span> exception as a matter of Singapore law. Thus, if the reflective loss argument is seriously to be pursued, the relevant evidence and law will have to be considered in greater detail in Tranche 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 Finally, the Defendants were dismissive of BCBCS’ claim for damages predicated on what might have happened pursuant to the Expansion MOU.

</div>
</div> Mr Singh’s point was that the Expansion MOU gave BR the right, but not the obligation, to develop coal upgrading plants to an agreed capacity of 15 MTPA using BCBCS’ briquetting technology. That may or may not be valid. Again, in our view, this issue should be left to Tranche 3 to allow BCBCS an opportunity to make submissions and adduce such evidence as it deems appropriate on the relevance of the Expansion MOU to damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The net result is that there will have to be a Tranche 3. We are unable at this stage to answer Issue 9 (as formulated by the Defendants) in the Defendants’ favour by holding that damages would be nil or nominal. We do not believe that such conclusion is plain and obvious on the materials before us at present. For similar reasons, we are unable to answer Issue 9 as formulated by the Plaintiffs. Issue 9 will have to be left to Tranche 3, at which time the validity of the assumption that commercial production of 1 MTPA could be attained will itself require examination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues 10 and 11</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Issues 10 and 11 are as follows:- </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.  If the answer to Issue 9 is yes, whether BCBCS suffered loss and damage in the form of: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  loss of profits based on a projected production capacity of 1, 3 or 5 MTPA; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  wasted expenditure, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and what is the appropriate quantum of damages BCBCS is entitled to? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.  What are the costs orders that should be made in respect of the entire trial of the matter? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 It follows from our findings and discussion above that Issues 10 and 11 can also only be dealt with in Tranche 3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In summary, our answers to the issues in Tranche 2 are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Issue 1 – Under Art 7.1 of the PLFA and cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed, BR had <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> obligations to ensure that Bara and FSP supplied coal to KSC in accordance with cl 3.9 of the 2010 CSAs.

The joint venture sought to exploit a technology developed by the Australian parties to upgrade sub-bituminous coal from mines in Tabang, East Kalimantan, owned by the Indonesian parties. After a dispute arose, BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(“BCBCS”) and its affiliate Australian company, Binderless Coal Briquetting </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Company Pty Limited, sued PT Bayan Resources TBK (“BR”) and its affiliate Singaporean company, Bayan International Pte Ltd. BR counterclaimed against BCBCS and its parent company, White Energy Company Limited (“WEC”).  </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">3  The terms of the joint venture were set out in a joint venture deed which the parties entered into in 2006 (“the JV Deed”). The parties subsequently entered into a number of ancillary agreements, memoranda, side letters and other documents recording various agreements reached during the course of the joint venture. These included two coal supply agreements (“the 2010 CSAs”) between the joint venture company (“KSC”) and two subsidiaries of BR which operated coal mines in Tabang (“Bara and FSP”), and a priority loan funding agreement (“PLFA”) between BR, BCBCS and KSC.  </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4 In the first tranche of the trial (“Tranche 1”), the parties framed nine issues for the Court’s decision, centred on the parties’ obligations under the JV Deed and the agreements which they had subsequently entered into. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">5  In the second tranche (“Tranche 2”), the parties formulated a list of eleven issues for the Court to decide. The issues broadly fell into three groups: (a) coal supply issues (Issues 1 to 4); (b) repudiation issues (Issues 5 to 8); and (c) causation and loss issues (Issues 9 to 11). After a five-day trial in January 2017, the parties tendered two rounds of written submissions and made oral submissions on 20 April 2017. </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Judgment </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">6  In relation to the coal supply issues, the Court held that BR was obliged under the PLFA and the JV Deed to ensure that Bara and FSP supplied coal to </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">KSC for testing and commissioning of the Tabang Plant (albeit that BR’s obligation under the PLFA expired on 31 December 2011, while its obligation under the JV Deed expired when it was brought to an end on 2 March 2012). In November 2011, KSC had validly requested for coal to be supplied to the Tabang Plant and there was insufficient coal for testing and commissioning, which included ramp-up to production, of the Tabang Plant. BR’s obligations were not affected by matters pertaining to the funding of KSC, KSC’s ability to pay for coal, the shutdown of the Tabang Plant for modifications, and the placing of the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance on 15 December 2011.  </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">7 The Court further held that BR had breached its coal supply obligations by instructing Bara and FSP to stop supplying coal to KSC, by renouncing its coal supply obligations and by conditioning its performance of its coal supply obligations on BCBCS or WEC buying out its 49% share in KSC for US$45m. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">8 In relation to the repudiation issues, the Court held that BCBCS had not repudiated the JV Deed. In particular, BCBCS had not repudiated the JV Deed by causing KSC to incur excess expenditure of approximately US$7m and a debt of US$6m without BR’s consent. BCBCS had also not repudiated the JV Deed by unilaterally procuring KSC to place the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance. The joint venture partners had agreed to place the Tabang Plant into care and maintenance at a meeting on 6 December 2011. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">9 The Court also held that BR was in repudiatory breach of the JV Deed by breaching its coal supply obligations. However, BCBCS had not accepted BR’s repudiatory breach in this regard. Separately, BR had not been in repudiatory breach by its words and conduct at two meetings on 2–3 November and 6 December 2011. However, BR had repudiated the JV Deed by its letter dated 21 February 2012 to BCBCS by which it had wrongfully purported to terminate the JV Deed. BCBCS had accepted BR’s repudiation of the JV Deed, and thereby brought the joint venture to an end on 2 March 2012. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">10  BR’s arguments that, even if it had breached its coal supply obligations or the JV Deed, it could readily be demonstrated that there could only be nominal damages, and for limited periods of time, were not persuasive. BR’s contentions would not necessarily constrain the amount of damages payable. BR therefore failed to make out its submission that there was no need for a third tranche (“Tranche 3”) to address the issues of causation and loss. The Court accordingly ordered a Case Management Conference for Tranche 3 to be fixed within 28 days of today subject to the parties’ availability. </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
