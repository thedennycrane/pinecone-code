        Tan Lee Meng J (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Law Society of Singapore (“the Law
                    Society”) applied under s 82A(10) of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”) for an order that the
                    defendant, Mr Gopalan Nair alias Pallichadath Gopalan Nair
                    (“GN”), be “struck off the roll, prohibited from applying
                    for a practising certificate, censured and/or otherwise punished” for
                    misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme
                    Court or as a member of an honourable profession. We ordered that GN be struck
                    off the roll and now give the reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       GN, who was admitted onto the roll on
                    10 August 1980, is a non-practising advocate and solicitor of the Supreme
                    Court of Singapore. He is presently an American citizen residing in California,
                    USA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Although GN is a non-practising advocate and
                    solicitor, he is still subject to the control of the Supreme Court as
                    s 82(A)(2) of the LPA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-1">All Legal Service Officers and
                    non-practising solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court
                    and shall be liable on due cause shown to be punished in accordance with this
                    section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Pursuant to ss 82A(4) and (5) of the LPA,
                    the Law Society applied in <em>ex parte</em> Originating
                    Summons No 947 of 2009 for leave from the Chief Justice for an
                    investigation to be made into a number of complaints about GN’s
                    misconduct. On 4 September 2009, the Chief Justice appointed a Disciplinary
                    Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) comprising Mr Toh Kian Sing SC and
                    Mr Tan Jee Ming, under s 90 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The following 5 charges of misconduct were
                    preferred by the Law Society against GN:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       GN sent, by way of emails to the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal Secretariat, his Defence and his Amended Defence on 1 December
                    2009. However, although he knew that his case was being heard by the Tribunal on
                    20 and 21 September 2010, he did not appear for the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Tribunal found GN guilty of all 5 charges
                    brought against him and determined that there was cause of sufficient gravity
                    for disciplinary action to be taken against him. The Chief Justice then
                    appointed Mr Peter Low, the plaintiff’s counsel, under s 82A(10)
                    of the LPA to make the present application in Summons No 1404 of
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       GN did not attend and was not represented by
                    counsel at the hearing before this Court on 25 July 2011.The Court was
                    satisfied that he had been duly served the requisite papers and that he was
                    fully aware of the hearing scheduled for 25 July 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The issues before this Court were whether due
                    cause for disciplinary action against GN under s 82A(3)(a) of the LPA had
                    been shown and if so, the appropriate penalty to be imposed on
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Due cause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for what constitutes “due
                    cause”, the relevant part of s 82A(3) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such due cause may be shown by proof that a Legal Service Officer or a
                        non-practising solicitor, as the case may be —</p>

                            honourable profession ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Law Society rightly submitted that for the
                    purpose of considering whether there has been <em>“</em>misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an
                    officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession”
                    under s 82(3)(a) LPA, the meaning accorded to the identical phrase in
                    s 83(2)(h) LPA should be adopted. As such, both misconduct in the
                    solicitor’s professional capacity as well as misconduct in the
                    solicitor’s personal capacity are relevant to this inquiry (see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Heng Guan Hong Geoffrey</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966 at [24]). The
                    same standard applies to non-practising lawyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Law Society relied on the findings of the
                    Tribunal to support its assertion that “due cause”, as defined in
                    s 82A(3)(a) of the LPA, had been shown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> charges against GN concerned his conviction
                    with respect to two offences under s 13D(1)(a) and s 20 of the
                    Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184,
                    1997 Rev Ed) for uttering vulgarities when speaking to officers of the
                    Singapore Police Force and for behaving in a disorderly manner towards the
                    police officers who had enquired why he had knocked a number of times on a
                    police vehicle bearing the registration number QX501H. The gravity of his use of
                    abusive and obscene language was stressed by the Tribunal in its report at
                    [28]-[29]:</p>

                            the Respondent uttered vulgarities towards the two policemen after he
                            was stopped by them.All this happened in a public place in the full
                            glare of members of the public. [T]he Respondent behaved in a petulant
                            manner and apparently took grave offence when he was stopped by the
                            police. His reaction was entirely unprovoked. Even if the Respondent was
                            unhappy about being questioned by the police, he should have acted with
                            self-restraint and moderation. In the entire episode, he displayed
                            neither virtue. If he had responded to the questions in a co-operative
                            manner, his subsequent arrest could possibly have been avoided. In our
                            view, these vulgarities which the Respondent spewed were not only
                            profoundly offensive, but also had the effect of lowering the dignity
                            and professionalism of law enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    We further find the <em>racist
                                outburst</em> directed at Sergeant Daud to be wholly
                            reprehensible and deserving of condemnation in a multi-racial society
                            like Singapore. It demonstrates a callous, unpardonable disregard for
                            the sensitivities of the different races that make up our society. It is
                            not behaviour that one would expect of a member of the legal
                            profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In regard to his disorderly behaviour in the
                    presence of the police, the Tribunal noted at para [39] of its report:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    Creating a ruckus in a public place, gesticulating
                            wildly (even if a non-threatening manner), spewing vulgarities towards
                            public officers shows a very low level of restraint and self-control as
                            well as a complete lack of respect for law enforcement officers. Simply
                            put, the Respondent had made a complete nuisance of himself in public.
                            The fine of $1000 (or one week imprisonment in default thereof) may be
                            marginally less serious as compared with the Respondent’s
                            offence in MAC 3211.Nevertheless, such unruly, petulant and disorderly
                            conduct (in full view of the public) is unfitting of an advocate or
                            solicitor as an officer of the Court and as a member of a honourable
                            profession. After all, a solicitor is expected to exercise a high level
                            of self restraint and a bad tempered solicitor can only bring disrepute
                            to the legal profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As for the breach of the undertaking referred
                    to in the 4<sup>th</sup> charge, the background for the
                    undertaking given by GN is as follows. When the case regarding GN’s abuse
                    of the policemen, as outlined in the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> charges pressed by the Law Society against
                    him, was heard before District Judge James Leong (“DJ Leong”), GN
                    made several offending statements in open court. For instance, on 25 August
                    2008, he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I frankly <b><em>do not have any faith or belief that I
                            will get a fair trial in this Court</em></b>. Any attempt on my part
                        to recall these witnesses would only be a waste of my time since I believe
                        the result will be the same in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Subsequently, GN authored two blog posts dated
                    1 September 2008 and 6 September 2008 on http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com.
                    These were entitled, “<em>Another classic case of trying
                        to use the courts to silence dissent</em>” and
                        “<em>Convicted</em>” respectively and
                    were replete with statements which attacked DJ Leong. For instance, he
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for Mr. James Leong, I have this to say. I have begun to know him
                        pretty well since it took 18 days of trial. He is a good man at heart; there
                        is no doubt about it. If he had his way, there is no doubt he would have
                        acquitted me immediately. But alas he is weak. He cuts a pathetic figure. A
                        man, because of his circumstances, having to do things that he does not
                        really want to do. He knows that his employment as a judge in the Singapore
                        courts depends on the patronage of Lee Kuan Yew and his friends. He also
                        knows that Lee Kuan Yew demands his judges to punish political opponents of
                        the government. And therefore to keep his job as a judge, he has no choice
                        but to find me guilty....</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     GN’s statements prompted the
                    Attorney-General to make an application under Originating Summons No 385 of 2008
                    for an order of committal for contempt. When the hearing commenced on
                    12 November 2008 before District Judge Leslie Chew (“DJ
                    Chew”), GN admitted that he had made the offending statements, apologised
                    for his behaviour and gave an undertaking to the Court not to make similar
                    offending statements and to remove the blog posts dated 1 September 2008
                    and 6 September 2008. As such, DJ Chew only reprimanded him and ordered him
                    to pay the costs of the proceedings. As soon as GN left Singapore and returned
                    to California, he breached his undertaking to the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     What was truly unacceptable was that GN
                    subsequently declared that he never had any intention of abiding by his
                    undertaking and that he deliberately breached the undertaking at the first
                    opportunity. The Tribunal stated as follows at [62]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By flagrantly flouting his undertaking to the court in such a defiant
                        manner, the Respondent displayed absolutely no remorse or contrition for
                        what he had done prior to leaving Singapore for the United States. He was
                        simply trying to make a mockery out of the entire affair. The apology he
                        made and the undertaking he gave were both quickly withdrawn once he was
                        safely out of Singapore. Clearly the apology and undertaking was an
                        expedient way to a lighter sentence – the Respondent by his own
                        admission, never intended or believed in either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As for the offensive blog post regarding
                    Belinda Ang J on 29 May 2008, which was the subject matter of the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> charge, that blog post was in the context of
                    a defamation suit brought by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong against the
                    Singapore Democratic Party. For this charge of contempt of court, GN was
                    sentenced to three months’ imprisonment by Kan Ting Chiu J. The
                    sentence meted out gave a clear indication of the seriousness of the
                    contempt. Yet, in his blog post in relation to Judith Prakash J on
                    30 November 2008, who had, at the material time, found a number of persons
                    in contempt of court for wearing T-shirts depicting a kangaroo in judges’
                    robes, GN continued to abuse the judiciary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     After taking all the circumstances into
                    account, we found that the Law Society had shown that there was due cause for
                    disciplinary action to be taken against GN. As such, we proceeded to consider
                    the penalty that ought to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Disciplinary action is intended to punish the
                    errant solicitor for his or her misconduct, deter others from misbehaving in the
                    same manner, and protect public confidence in the administration of justice: see
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 68 (at [18]) and
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Rasif David</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 955 (at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Although GN had been convicted of a number of
                    offences, which were referred to in the charges preferred against him by the Law
                    Society, it should be borne in mind that in <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Wee Wei Fen</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 559, the Court
                    observed (at [25]) that it cannot be
                    that every violation of the criminal law implies a defect of character which
                    renders the offender unfit to be a member of the legal profession and that the
                    nature of the offence is clearly material. Similarly in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 209, the Court stated (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would, at the outset, make it quite clear that conviction of criminal
                        offence does not <em>per se</em> imply a defect of
                        character rendering an advocate and solicitor unfit for his profession.
                            <em>It is the nature of the offence, and the
                            circumstances under which it was committed, and in turn the punishment
                            imposed, which are likely to be determinative…</em>.
                            <em>The offence must be of such a nature that it is
                            expedient for the protection of the public and the preservation of the
                            good name of the profession to remove the solicitor from the roll or
                            from practice</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The offences in respect of which GN had been
                    convicted and the circumstances under which they were committed lead to the
                    conclusion that a serious penalty must be imposed. Apart from abusing the police
                    with foul language in public and behaving in a disorderly manner in the presence
                    of the police, GN was imprisoned for contempt of court in relation to his blog
                    post regarding Belinda Ang J on 29 May 2008.Furthermore, he openly
                    defied the undertaking he had given to the District Court shortly after he was
                    convicted by Kan J for contempt of court. He then posted offensive
                    statements in his blog about Prakash J on 30 November
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     When considering whether or not to strike an
                    advocate and solicitor off the rolls, it is worth noting that in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Amdad Hussein Lawrence</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 23, the Court held at [11]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The earlier decisions in <em>Law Society of
                            Singapore v Ravindra Samuel</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 266 at
                            [15]; <em>Law
                            Society of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick</em> (at [18]; <em>Law Society of
                            Singapore v Suresh Kumar Suppiah</em> [1999]
                        2 SLR(R) 1203 at [18]; and
                            <em>Law Society of Singapore v Heng Guan Hong
                            Geoffrey</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966 at [28]-[29] have consistently affirmed and applied the following
                        principles on disciplinary sentencing:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    where a solicitor has acted dishonestly, the
                                court will almost invariably order that he be struck off the roll of
                                solicitors;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    if he has not acted dishonestly, but is shown
                                to have fallen below the required standards of integrity, probity
                                and trustworthiness, <em>he will nonetheless be
                                    struck off the roll, as opposed to being suspended, if his lapse
                                    is such as to indicate that he lacks the qualities of character
                                    and trustworthiness which are the necessary attributes of a
                                    person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal
                                    practitioner</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the present case, the relevant question is
                    whether or not GN should be struck off the roll on the basis that he lacked the
                    necessary attributes of a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal
                    practitioner. After taking all the charges into account, we were of the view
                    that he lacked the said attributes. In particular, the facts in the
                        3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and
                        5<sup>th</sup> charges disclosed a contemptuous disrespect
                    on the part of GN towards the judges concerned. Such egregious misconduct is
                    totally unacceptable. As there were no mitigating circumstances to persuade us
                    that he merited a less severe penalty than striking off the roll, we
                    ordered that he be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the
                    Supreme Court of Singapore and awarded costs to the Law Society.</p>
