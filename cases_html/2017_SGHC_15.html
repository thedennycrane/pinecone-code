Under the gain-based remedies, Parakou is entitled to an account of profits and it may choose to follow or trace the misapplied assets and proceeds thereof and enforce an equitable lien or constructive trust. Parakou submits that it is entitled to elect the remedy which is most advantageous to it, and need only elect when judgment is given in its favour.

First, as Vice-President and President respectively, they were necessarily responsible for the management and day-to-day operations of the company. Second, taking charge of the process in selling the OPL Vessels could not be said to be outside the scope of their responsibilities as Vice-President and President.

</div> In any event, I would consider the actual process of selling the OPL Vessels to be implementation of the directors’ decision to sell the vessels; this was not something which directors need necessarily be involved in. Third, it would not have been surprising if Liu Por and Yang had decided to seek board approval for the PIH Repayments, the PIH Set-Off and the PSSA Repayment, given the amounts involved. However, I do not think that the mere fact that they did not do so means that they were <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> directors. These matters are conceivably within the authority of the President and Vice-President of the company and there is no evidence to the contrary.

The objective evidence did not support any intention or reason to terminate the OPL business in March 2008.

Steven Shia, the supervising manager on the audit team, testified that the audit file for FY 2007 did not contain a copy of the March 2008 Resolution. He saw a copy of the resolution in the audit file for FY 2008 when he reviewed the file in late 2009 or early 2010. Steven Shia explained that the audit team would have made a copy of the March 2008 Resolution for the audit file for FY 2007 if they had seen it in the company’s secretarial records in June/July 2008.

</div> Of course, there could have been a decision to restructure the company’s businesses even if the March 2008 Resolution was not a contemporaneous document. However, the defendants have not offered any evidence of such a decision (or the reasons for it) other than the March 2008 Resolution.

In his AEIC, Liu Por described the OPL business as “at best, marginally profitable” and the ship management business as “loss-making”.

</div> There was no reason for the urgency.

The Disposal Transactions were not carried out pursuant to the alleged restructuring plan. In my view, the restructuring plan was an afterthought in an attempt to justify the Disposal Transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In coming to my conclusions, I have been mindful of the principle that where fraud or dishonesty is alleged, more evidence is needed than in an ordinary civil case to discharge the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities: <span class="font-italic">Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another </span><span class="font-italic">appeal </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 at [184]. In my view, the evidence was more than sufficient in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Parakou was insolvent at the material time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Parakou’s solvency status is relevant to its claims for (a) breach of directors’ fiduciary duties and (b) the statutory remedy for undervalue transactions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Where directors’ duties are concerned, it is axiomatic that directors have a duty to act in the interests of the company. Generally, this refers to the interests of the company as a separate commercial entity which in many cases are very readily identified with the interests of its shareholders as a whole: Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> (Academy Publishing, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 09.045. The company’s solvency status is relevant because “when a company is insolvent, or even in a parlous financial position, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for the company”: <span class="font-italic">Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd </span>[2010] 4 SLR 1089 (“<span class="font-italic">Progen</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]. The greater the concern over the company’s financial health, the more weight the directors must accord to the interests of creditors over those of the shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal </span>[2014] 3 SLR 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty</span>”) at [34].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the case of undervalue transactions, a condition for the statutory remedy is that the company was insolvent when the transactions were carried out or became insolvent in consequence of the transactions: s 329 of the Companies Act read with ss 98 and 100 of the Bankruptcy Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The cash flow test and the balance sheet test are well established tests for determining whether a company is solvent. They are also the appropriate tests in the context of undervalue transactions. Under s 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (the cash flow test) or if the value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities (the balance sheet test).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, for the purpose of deciding whether a director has a duty to take creditors’ interests into account, the company need not be technically insolvent. It is sufficient if the company is in a parlous financial position or perilously close to being insolvent: <span class="font-italic">Progen</span> at [48] and [52]. A strict and technical application of the cash flow and balance sheet tests, which are used in the context of a winding up action, would be of limited utility and a broader assessment of the surrounding circumstances of the case is called for; as long as there are reasons to be concerned that the creditors’ interests are or will be at risk because of difficult financial circumstances, directors ignore those interests at their peril: <span class="font-italic">Dynasty </span>at [33]–[35]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Nevertheless, as Parakou is relying on both balance sheet and cash flow insolvency for purposes of its claims for breach of directors’ duties, I shall begin the analysis of Parakou’s solvency status with the balance sheet and cash flow tests.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Parakou was balance sheet insolvent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The test for balance sheet insolvency is whether “there is a deficit after balancing overall liabilities against assets”: <span class="font-italic">Chip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi Mo and others </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 434 (“<span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Thye</span>”) at [18].

</div> The Disposal Transactions took place in FY 2008 and FY 2009. The legal proceedings relating to the Galsworthy claim took place over FY 2009 to FY 2011. Parakou had negative equity positions ranging from $10.147m for FY 2008 to S$46.24m as at 31 March 2011.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Parakou’s expert witness, Mr Timothy James Reid (“Reid”) from Ferrier Hodgson Pte Ltd, testified that Parakou’s non-financial assets were unlikely to fetch anything far greater than the recorded book value. In his view, it was therefore reasonable to conclude that, based on its negative equity position, Parakou was balance sheet insolvent.

The definition of inability to pay debts in s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is for the purposes of establishing a ground for winding up. However, I see no reason why contingent and prospective liabilities should not similarly be taken into account when considering the issue of insolvency in the context of breach of directors’ duties or undervalue transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 A contingent liability is a liability or loss which arises out of an existing legal obligation or state of affairs but which is dependent on the happening of an event which may or may not occur, whereas a prospective liability is a debt which will certainly become due in the future: <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong </span>at [40].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It seems obvious that not all contingent liabilities need to be taken into account.

The Directors assert that their view that there was no binding charterparty with Galsworthy was a reasonable one because no formal contract had been signed between Parakou and Galsworthy.

In practice, however, by the time such an issue has to be decided by the court, it would invariably be the case that the letters of support have not been honoured.

It is not disputed that this presumption applies in the present case. In any event, it is clear that the defendants have not rebutted the presumption. Further, under s 100(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, the balance sheet and the cash flow tests are alternative tests; a company is deemed insolvent as long as either test is satisfied (see <span class="font-italic">Living the Link Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and others v Tan Lay Tin Tina and others </span>[2016] 3 SLR 621 (“<span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span>”) at [26], citing <span class="font-italic">Velstra Pte Ltd (in compulsory winding up) v Azero Investments SA </span>[2004] SGHC 251 at [89]).

I accept Meade’s evidence that an arm’s-length sale would likely have closed at the mid-range of the valuation. Based on the Amsbach Report, if each of the vessels were sold at the mid-range values, the aggregate price for the OPL Vessels would have been S$11,098,500. In my view, the sale of the OPL Vessels resulted in a loss to Parakou in the sum of S$1,192,900 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> S$11,098,500 less S$9,905,600). Parakou’s loss figure of S$2,263,900 is incorrect as it was computed using S$8,834,600 as the sale price. As stated at [96] above, S$8,834,600 was the net price received by Parakou after deducting the remaining construction costs for two of the OPL Vessels. The correct figure to use is the gross sale price of the OPL Vessels, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$9,905,600. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Transfer of the SMAs to PSMPL</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Parakou did not assign the SMAs to PSMPL. What actually happened was that the Pretty Entities first terminated the SMAs with Parakou with effect from 30 November 2008 and then entered into new SMAs with PSMPL from 1 December 2008. The Pretty Entities were well within their rights under the SMAs with Parakou to terminate the same. However, it is obvious that these steps were orchestrated by CC Liu, Chik and Liu Por with the objective of effecting a transfer of the SMAs to PSMPL. CC Liu and Chik were directors of Parakou, the Pretty Entities (together with Lau Hoi) and PSMPL (together with Liu Por) when these steps were taken. The defendants did not dispute that the transfer of the SMAs to PSMPL was a ‘transaction’ for purposes of s 98 of the Bankruptcy Act. In any event, under s 2(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, a ‘transaction’ includes any ’arrangement’. In my view, the steps taken to effect the transfer of the SMAs amounted to an arrangement which falls within the definition of ‘transaction’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, a transaction is at an undervalue if it is entered into on terms that provide for no consideration to be received. PSMPL did not provide any consideration for the transfer of the SMAs to it. The transfer therefore took place at an undervalue within the meaning of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Bonus Payments and Salary Increases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Parakou claims that the Bonus Payments and Salary Increases were not commensurate with the value provided by the Directors to the company, in particular, in the case of CC Liu and Chik who were not even based in Singapore. In addition, Parakou says that since the bonuses were paid in December 2008 for services rendered in 2008, the consideration for the bonuses was past consideration and therefore not good consideration. The bonuses were not paid pursuant to any contractual term. Parakou also pointed out that the Bonus Payments were unprecedented in that no bonuses had been paid to CC Liu, Chik or Liu Por in 2006 and 2007.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In my view, there is insufficient evidence to justify a finding that the Salary Increases were at an undervalue.

</div> It does not matter which is the case since either way, PIH received the benefit of the payments. Parakou paid a total amount of S$240,000 as rent for the period from January 2009 to August 2009.

Therefore, Parakou claims that the Excess Rent Payments amounted to S$213,270.

I have rejected that explanation and found that there was no restructuring plan. As matters stand, however, the defendants’ reliance on the alleged restructuring plan is misplaced. Parakou was insolvent or nearly insolvent by the time the Disposal Transactions were carried out. This meant that, regardless of any restructuring plan, the Directors had to consider whether the Disposal Transactions were in the interests of Parakou’s creditors. If they were not, the directors concerned would have acted in breach of their duties and it would have been no answer for them to say that they were merely implementing the alleged restructuring plan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Disposal Transactions were in the interests of creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Given my finding that Parakou was balance sheet and cash flow insolvent at all material times, the Directors were under a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for the company.

Parakou also relies on <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> in which the learned judge stated as follows (at [88]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But I see no reason why a company should not be able to bring concurrent claims for both undue preference and breach of fiduciary duty as the liquidators have done in this case… Although they concern the same subject matter, the two claims are clearly premised on distinct causes of action. This, however, is subject to the caveat, which I will return to below, that the courts must be slow in allowing the liquidator to employ the claim against the director as a means of circumventing the strict statutory criteria for an undue preference laid down by Parliament in the Bankruptcy Act (see <span class="font-italic">Knight v Frost</span> [1999] 1 BCLC 364 (“<span class="font-italic">Knight”) </span>at 381– 82 <span class="font-italic">and Re Continental Assurance Co of London plc (No 4); Singer v Beckett</span><span class="font-italic"> [</span>2007] 2 BCLC 287 at [420])<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span>, the court set aside certain transactions made within the relevant claw-back period as undue preferences and found the director who procured the transactions to be liable for breach of fiduciary duties (at [78]). However, certain cash transfers made outside the claw-back period were held to be legitimate and the director was therefore held not to have breached her director’s duties (at [91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In the present case, the Directors rely on the learned judge’s <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>observations (at [92]) that even if the cash transfers had been influenced by a desire to prefer the associate companies, it was likely that he would not have found the director to be in breach of her duties. The learned judge’s reason was that courts must be slow in allowing the liquidator to circumvent the strict statutory criteria for an undue preference laid down in ss 99 and 100 of the Bankruptcy Act by bringing a claim directly against the director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I note that the learned judge in <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> did not shut the door to claims against directors for breach of duties for procuring an undue preference which falls outside the claw-back period. Each case must turn on its own facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In my view, the mere fact that the PIH Repayments and PSSA Repayment took place outside the claw-back period cannot excuse the directors concerned from being held liable for breach of their duties. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Living the Link </span>(at [88]), a claim to recover an undue preference is a distinct cause of action from a claim for breach of directors’ duties even though they concern the same subject-matter. The fact that the payment was made outside of the claw-back period means that the statutory remedy is not available against the creditors who were preferred (in this case, PIH and PSSA). However, this ought not to excuse the director who procured the preferential payments for no legitimate reason. There were no legitimate reasons for the PIH Repayments and PSSA Repayment which were carried out in quick succession within two months in November and December 2008. Parakou was insolvent when they were made and they were clearly not in the interests of Parakou’s other creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In my view, the directors who procured or authorised these transactions acted against the interests of creditors of the company and must be held liable for breach of their duties as directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The PIH Repayments and the PSSA Repayment extinguished the respective debts owed by Parakou to PIH and PSSA. As succinctly explained in <span class="font-italic">Living the Link </span>(at [84]–[86]), the fact that Parakou’s liabilities to PIH and PSSA were reduced does not absolve the directors concerned from liability for breach of fiduciary duties. However, to the extent that the directors concerned are ordered to repay the value of the undue preferences, Parakou (and consequently, its creditors) would be in a better position since it no longer has to pay PIH or PSSA. To address this and ensure that unsecured creditors of Parakou will not receive a larger dividend than they would have otherwise obtained, the dividends attributable to such repayments are to be recouped to the directors who made the repayments (see <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> at [84], [85] and [90]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">PIH Set-Off</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 As this was a set-off, there was no payment by Parakou to PIH. A total amount of S$1,732,239.17 that PIH owed Parakou was set-off against amounts that Parakou owed PIH (see [16(b)] above). In my view, leaving aside the expiry of the claw-back period, the PIH Set-Off was in any event not an undue preference. One of the requirements for an undue preference is that the recipient’s position is improved in the event of the company’s winding up (see s 329 of the Companies Act read with s 99(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act). In my view, the PIH Set-Off did not satisfy this requirement. PIH would have been entitled to set-off its debt to Parakou against the debt that was owing by Parakou to it, whether or not Parakou went into liquidation. It is true that the statutory set-off in insolvency requires mutuality of dealings (see s 327(2) of the Companies Act read with s 88 of the Bankruptcy Act) but there is no question that this is satisfied in the present case. Where the statutory set-off in insolvency is available, any prior agreement for set-off cannot be construed as a void preference: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 13 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 150.443, footnote 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In my opinion, the fact that PIH was entitled to a set-off in any event also means that the PIH Set-Off cannot be said to have been contrary to the interests of Parakou’s creditors. The PIH Set-Off was therefore not in breach of directors’ duties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Bonus Payments, Salary Increases and Employees’ Salary Payments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Bonus Payments and Salary Increases must be viewed in their proper context. Parakou was insolvent by then. The Bonus Payments were unprecedented and there was no contractual obligation to pay any bonus or give any salary increases. I agree with Parakou that given its financial status then, the Bonus Payments and the Salary Increases were not in the interests of its creditors and were in breach of the directors’ duties. As for the Employees’ Salary Payments, I have rejected the defendants’ explanation that the six employees’ names were erroneously included in the list of Affected Employees who had tendered their resignations from Parakou (see [105] and [106] above). There was no legitimate reason for Parakou to make the Employees’ Salary Payments. The Employees’ Salary Payments were therefore also in breach of directors’ duties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Transfer of SMAs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The ship management business was set up as a cost centre to provide ship management services to the Pretty Vessels which were owned by related parties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> the Pretty Entities).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The Directors therefore submit that they were not trying to delay Galsworthy from winding up Parakou until after the claw-back period expired. Instead, they submit that defending the London Arbitration and pursuing the HK Proceedings were part of a strategy to achieve a settlement with Galsworthy. As a result of the HK Proceedings, Parakou managed to compel Galsworthy’s related parties to put up security of US$44m for a period of more than a year. The Directors argue that this was part of the strategy to increase commercial pressure on Galsworthy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Further, the Directors point to the fact that Liu Por and Yang had themselves placed Parakou into voluntary liquidation in March 2011 when the five-year claw-back period for undervalue transactions had not yet expired. The Directors argue that this shows there was no intention to delay the liquidation of Parakou until after the claw-back periods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 It must first be noted that Chik was no longer a director at the relevant time and Parakou therefore has no claim against her in respect of the London Arbitration and HK Proceedings. Looking at all the evidence in its totality, I am not satisfied that the liquidator has proved its claim. It seems to me that although CC Liu, Liu Por and Yang were conscious of the two-year claw-back period, their objective in defending the London Arbitration and pursuing the HK Proceedings was indeed to put pressure on Galsworthy to negotiate a settlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In particular, there was no reason for Liu Por and Yang to make the admission that led to the First Award in August 2010, if their objective was indeed to prevent any winding up application being made before the two-year claw-back period expired in December 2010. Parakou has no answer to this. In addition, CC Liu, Liu Por and Yang in fact proceeded with the appeal in the HK Proceedings even after the two-year claw-back period had expired. There was no need for them to do continue with the HK Proceedings if the reason for pursuing the HK Proceedings was simply to let the two-year claw-back period expire. Parakou’s solicitors described the appeal as “part of an overall strategy to keep the US$44m in the HK Courts for the purpose of incentivitising [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] a negotiated settlement”.

</div> There is further evidence of this strategy. In an email dated 6 September 2010, Parakou’s Singapore solicitors made the point to its HK solicitors that Parakou had “absolutely no assets” and referred to a strategy to “say to opponents that it is either they take US$1 million or they get nothing in liquidation”.

The only question is whether the assistance rendered by PIH was dishonest and whether PIH’s receipt was with knowledge of the breaches by CC Liu and Chik. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 As CC Liu and Chik were also directors of PIH at the material time, PIH is attributed with their knowledge. PIH therefore must be taken to have known that the sale of the OPL Vessels and the PIH Repayments were in breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties. It follows that PIH’s assistance was dishonest and that it would be unconscionable for PIH to retain the benefit of what it had received.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 I therefore find that PIH is liable for dishonest assistance and knowing receipt in respect of the sale of the OPL Vessels and the PIH Repayments. For the same reasons discussed at [124] above, to the extent that PIH is ordered to pay the value of the PIH Repayments, the dividends attributable to such payments are to be recouped to PIH.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Claims against PSMPL</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Parakou claims against PSMPL for dishonest assistance and/or knowing receipt in relation to the transfer of the SMAs and for dishonest assistance in relation to the Employees’ Salary Payments.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The PIH Set-Off and the transfers of the SMAs were not in breach of directors’ duties and are not unlawful means. The transfer of the Affected Employees was in consequence of the transfer of the SMAs and therefore also not in breach of directors’ duties. As the transfer of the SMAs and the Affected Employees were the only alleged unlawful means that involved PSMPL, it follows that the conspiracy claim against PSMPL fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164  The surviving conspiracy claim concerns only the sale of the OPL Vessels, the PIH Repayments and the Bonus Payments. The parties involved in the conspiracy were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) CC Liu and Chik who were the directors of Parakou at the material time.

It is also clear that the intent was to cause loss to Parakou. Further, Parakou suffered pecuniary damage. The OPL Vessels had been sold at an undervalue. The PIH Repayments, PIH Set-Off and Bonus Payments resulted in monies being paid to PIH and the Directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In my view, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Directors and PIH are liable for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means in connection with the sale of the OPL Vessels and the PIH Repayments; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Directors are liable for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means in connection with the Bonus Payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 CC Liu and Chik resigned from Parakou’s board with effect from 31 December 2008.

The claimant has an alternative remedy against the fiduciary for an account of profits which have been made in breach of fiduciary duty. Relief given by way of an account of profits is measured by the gain made by the wrongdoer irrespective of whether the claimant has suffered a corresponding loss: <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee, ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 20-039.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Where a fiduciary has made a gain through a breach of fiduciary duty, the claimant has an <span class="font-italic">in personam</span> claim for payment of the amount brought out by the account of profits. Alternatively, the claimant may pursue a proprietary remedy – a constructive trust may be imposed on the profit or its traceable proceeds provided these survive in identifiable form in the fiduciary’s hands; otherwise there is no property to which the constructive trust can attach. See, David Hayton, Paul Matthews &amp; Charles Mitchell, <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton: Law</span><span class="font-italic"> of Trusts and Trustees</span> (LexisNexis, 19th Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton</span>”) at para 27.25.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Where the trustee has misapplied the claimant’s original asset and transferred it to a third person, the claimant can either follow the original asset and enforce his equitable title to it, or trace into the substituted asset in the hands of the trustee and enforce a proprietary remedy against it. Against a substituted asset in the hands of the trustee, the claimant has two alternative proprietary remedies. He may enforce an equitable lien against it for the value of the original asset which was applied to acquire it. Alternatively, he may claim the entire beneficial ownership of the substituted asset under a constructive trust. See, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 30-055.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 A claimant in a breach of trust may have claims against third parties involved in the breach, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, dishonest assistants or knowing recipients. Claims brought against such third parties have the effect of reducing the amount of the claimant’s loss resulting from the primary breach of trust. Any sum which the beneficiary recovers would be counted towards reducing the amount of the trustee’s primary liability for losses resulting from the breach. See, <span class="font-italic">Snells’ Equity</span> at para 30-067.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Election between alternative remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 A plaintiff may have alternative remedies against a defendant. Where alternative and inconsistent remedies (as opposed to cumulative remedies) are available to the plaintiff, he must elect between them. The classic example of inconsistent and alternative remedies is (a) an account of the profits made by a defendant in breach of his fiduciary obligations and (b) damages for the loss suffered by reason of the same breach. A plaintiff must elect one or the other. The election need not be made when proceedings are first brought but must be made when judgment is given in his favour. He is also entitled to readily available information before an election is made. See, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>at para 7-052.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 As discussed earlier, both personal and proprietary remedies are potentially available where the fiduciary has made a profit. The court can award both personal and proprietary remedies on an alternative but not on a cumulative basis. It cannot order a fiduciary both to deliver up property to the principal and to pay over its value, but it can allow the principal to choose between the two. See, <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton</span> at para 27.26.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Against a substituted asset in the hands of the trustee, the claimant has to elect between (a) enforcing an equitable lien against it for the value of the original asset which was applied to acquire it, and (b) claiming the entire beneficial ownership of the substituted asset under a constructive trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Where alternative remedies are cumulative, the claimant does not have to make an election but he cannot recover in the aggregate an amount in excess of his loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of directors’ fiduciary duties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Each of the Directors is liable to Parakou for the losses caused to Parakou by his or her breaches of fiduciary duties (see [173] and [174] above). Alternatively, each of them is liable for an account of profits made by each of them in breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the Bonus Payments and Salary Increases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dishonest assistance and knowing receipt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 A breach of fiduciary duty by a director is generally treated as a breach of trust. Where dishonest assistance or knowing receipt is established in connection with a breach of fiduciary duty by a director, the third party concerned is liable as constructive trustee. See, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>at para 09.110. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 A dishonest assistant is secondarily liable to pay equitable compensation for the losses caused by the breach of duty in which he assisted, or possibly to account for profits which accrue to him as a result of his assistance: <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at paras 20-033, 20-043 and 30-080. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 A knowing recipient is liable to give restitution of the value of the property received by him. His liability is fixed at the value of the property when he first received it. A knowing recipient may also be required to account for profits gained as a result of his knowing receipt. See <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>at paras 20-043 and 30-071. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191  PIH is liable to Parakou for the losses caused to Parakou as a result of its dishonest assistance in respect of the sale of the OPL Vessels and the PIH Repayments. PIH’s liability for knowing receipt would appear to be the same amount as the loss caused to Parakou. Alternatively, PIH is liable, as a constructive trustee, for an account of profits made as a result of its dishonest assistance and knowing receipt in connection with the sale of the OPL Vessels and the PIH Repayments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 PSMPL is liable to Parakou for the losses caused to Parakou as a result of its dishonest assistance in connection with the Employees’ Salary Payments (see [177] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Undervalue transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The discretion given to the court under s 98(2) of the Bankruptcy Act is a wide one. The court may, in appropriate cases, allow the defendant to retain the asset in return for a payment of the difference between the full value of the asset and the value which was in fact received by the company: <span class="font-italic">Living the Link</span> at [75], citing <span class="font-italic">Goode</span> at para 13-46 and <span class="font-italic">Pena v Coyne (No 2)</span> [2004] 2 BCLC 730. On the other hand, the court will not make an order where the company would have found itself in an even worse position if the transaction had not been carried out: <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 13-45. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 With respect to the sale of the OPL Vessels, restoring the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> would be problematic given the lapse in time. In my view, the appropriate order is for PIH to retain the vessels but pay Parakou the sum of S$1,192,900 being the difference between the price that the vessels could have been sold for and the price that Parakou in fact received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 With respect to the Bonus Payments, each of the Directors will have to return the bonus received by him or her.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 As for the Employees’ Salary Payments, PSMPL, having received the benefit of the payments amounting to S$309,376.85, will have to pay this amount to Parakou. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 However, I do not think that any order should be made under s 98(2) in respect of the transfer of the SMAs. As stated at [128] above, the SMAs were loss making. Further, it is not disputed that the SMAs could have been terminated on 30 days’ notice or would have been terminated automatically upon Parakou’s liquidation in any event. It seems to me to be pointless and of no benefit to Parakou to restore the position to what it would have been if the transfer of the SMAs had not taken place.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Damages arising from conspiracy claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The Directors and PIH are liable to Parakou for damages arising from the conspiracy claim in connection with the sale of the OPL Vessels and the PIH Repayments.
