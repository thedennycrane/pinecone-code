They lie in relation to causes of action that the enjoiner has now or may have against the person enjoined if the injunction is not granted and the enjoined act occurs. The interlocutory injunction may have a <span class="font-italic">direct</span> relationship to an <span class="font-italic">existing</span> cause of action: for example, where the interlocutory injunction enjoins an act in respect of which a permanent injunction is to be sought at trial or where the injunction is to preserve an asset that is the subject-matter of the dispute. The interlocutory injunction may have a <span class="font-italic">direct</span> relationship to a <span class="font-italic">potential</span> cause of action; thus, <span class="font-italic">q</span><span class="font-italic">uia timet</span>, or precautionary, injunctions are granted to enjoin an act that if committed would be a legal wrong against the enjoiner and give rise to a cause of action, for example, in tort or for breach of contract. The relationship between interlocutory injunction and cause of action may in other instances be <span class="font-italic">indirect</span> where the court grants an injunction to protect the due administration of justice, such as a freezing order that ensures that a judgment if eventually given would not merely issue on paper. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Before me, it was suggested that there is now a new category of “freestanding injunctions” granted to prevent injustice, regardless of whether there is a cause of action present or future. I do not agree. The word “freestanding” is not a legal term. Prior to recent dicta which I consider at [67] to [71] below, it has been used in reference to two situations: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the historical debate over whether and to what extent interlocutory injunctions may be granted in relation to proceedings on a cause of action being pursued elsewhere whether in foreign courts or foreign-seated arbitrations where the forum court has no jurisdiction over that cause of action; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the grant of injunctions that are interlocutory in nature because they do not finally resolve substantive rights of the parties , <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, they are pending resolution of the underlying dispute in another forum or in support of the enforcement of a judgment or award, but are granted on final applications, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, originating applications or previously originating summonses) precisely because the main proceedings are not taking place before the court hearing the application for an interlocutory injunction. Such injunctions have been described as freestanding because the proceeding in which they are granted concludes with the grant of such injunction. Interlocutory injunctions granted on <span class="font-italic">final applications</span> are treated differently from those granted on <span class="font-italic">interlocutory applications</span> in terms of appeal rights: see s 29A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) read with para 3(1) of its Fifth Schedule. However, this difference does not change the juridical nature of the injunction: an injunction pending resolution of a dispute in an arbitration is as interlocutory (or as interim, if this word is preferred) as an injunction pending resolution of the dispute in court. The difference in appeal rights depending on the nature of the application was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports Co Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v GMR Malé International Airport Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 449 at [16]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Whether a particular decision is one that has been made upon an interlocutory application depends in the first place on the nature of the <span class="font-italic">application</span> which is the subject matter of the decision. Where, as in the present case, the nature of the application takes the form of an originating summons and the substantive merits are being determined in another forum, it would be wrong to characterise the <span class="font-italic">application</span> as interlocutory in nature: see further <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [16]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The use of the word “freestanding” in such situations is only a description of a procedural aspect. The jurisdiction of the court to grant interlocutory injunctions is broad (whenever “just and convenient”) but the <span class="font-italic">exercise</span> of that jurisdiction remains incidental to and dependent upon the enforcement of a substantive right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 HC/OA 781/2023 (“OA 781”) is an application by Gazelle Ventures Pte Ltd (“Gazelle”) for an injunction restraining the first defendant, Mr Lim Yong Sim (“Mr Lim”), the second defendant, GuGong Pte Ltd (“GuGong”), and the third defendant, No Signboard Holdings Ltd (“No Signboard”) from taking steps to pass certain shareholder resolutions at a general meeting of No Signboard’s shareholders. Mr Lim and GuGong are the actors while No Signboard is the stage on which they are playing, joined only as a nominal defendant and not represented before me. Gazelle seeks a <span class="font-italic">quia timet</span> injunction or, alternatively, a “freestanding” one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I have already indicated that I do not accept that an injunction may properly be granted independent of an enforceable right: there is no such thing as an injunction freestanding in that sense. Hence, the proper lens for considering Gazelle’s application is that of <span class="font-italic">quia </span><span class="font-italic">timet</span>, or precautionary, injunctions. In the remainder of this judgment, I generally adopt the English word “precautionary” and not the Latin label. To grant such an injunction, I must first find that the act enjoined would if committed give rise to a cause of action, either in itself or upon causing damage (which I would have to assess as being likely to follow).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Gazelle has sought the precautionary injunction not on the basis that steps likely to be taken by Mr Lim and GuGong will be a breach of contract on the part of any of the defendants but that they would amount to overt acts causing loss by unlawful means, or of a conspiracy whether by lawful means or unlawful means. It will be immediately obvious that it is challenging to establish the conditions for grant of a precautionary injunction in the context of complex torts (as compared to the contexts of contract or simple torts), because there will have to be close consideration of possible interrelated future acts along with the intention with which they may be carried out. Moreover, it is inherently difficult to enjoin an act that is otherwise lawful on the basis that is may be part of a conspiracy. Having considered the parties’ arguments and evidence, I am not persuaded to grant the precautionary injunction Gazelle seeks. I therefore dismiss OA 781 for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 No Signboard is a public company, incorporated in Singapore, listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange.

He owns 0.12% of No Signboard’s issued shares. No Signboard’s majority shareholder is GuGong, who owns 54.91% of No Signboard’s issued shares. Mr Lim owns 93.6% of GuGong’s shareholding and is one of its two directors.

However, it was not argued that there was such an implied term, and any such argument would have its own difficulties including the presence of the exclusion of implied terms by the prefatory phrase “except as expressly provided otherwise herein”.

Gazelle is not a shareholder of No Signboard but a creditor. It is only upon completion of the Implementation Agreement that Gazelle would become a shareholder. Any breach of </span>duty to vote “<span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for the benefit of No Signboard as a whole” would be a wrong committed either against No Signboard or against No Signboard’s minority shareholders, and not against Gazelle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The fact that the wrong, if any, would be against No Signboard or No Signboard’s minority shareholders is important because it brings into consideration the question of which unlawful acts against third parties count as relevant unlawful means. In <span class="font-italic">Raffles </span><span class="font-italic">Education</span>, Audrey Lim J summarised (at [240]) the two different formulations of the limits proposed in <span class="font-italic">OBG Ltd v Allan</span> [2008] AC 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">OBG</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Lord Hoffmann (for the majority) held that in a three-party setting – namely, where a third party is the victim of the defendant’s unlawful act – acts against the third party count as unlawful means only if they are actionable by that third party, or if the only reason why they are not actionable is because the third party has suffered no loss. <span class="font-italic">Unlawful means, however, do not include acts which may be unlawful against a third party but do not</span><span class="font-italic"> affect his freedom to deal with the claimant</span>, or criminal acts not actionable in private law… Lord Nicholls preferred a wider approach in that ‘unlawful means’ embraced ‘all acts a defendant is not permitted to do, whether by the civil law or the criminal law’, <span class="font-italic">subject to the qualification that liability should be found only where the claimant is harmed through the </span><span class="font-italic">‘instrumentality’ of a third party</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The court must then consider whether the passing of the resolutions would affect the freedom of No Signboard or of No Signboard’s minority shareholders to deal with Gazelle, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Lord Hoffman’s formulation, or whether they would be the “instrument” whereby Gazelle is harmed, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Lord Nicholls’ formulation.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>In my view, any argument that GuGong’s breach of duty would curtail the freedom of No Signboard’s minority shareholders to deal with Gazelle or that Gazelle would be harmed through the “instrumentality” of Gazelle’s minority shareholders is not seriously arguable, and was not seriously run by Gazelle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>Moreover, in relation to the position of both No Signboard and its minority shareholders, Gazelle’s argument takes aim only at certain of the resolutions, namely those that concern No Signboard’s constitution, when its real concern is that Mr Lim and GuGong seek to change the composition of the board of No Signboard, and that the new board would thereafter make decisions that would affect Gazelle’s position in relation to No Signboard. It is possible that Gazelle might have recourse thereafter in contract against No Signboard, but whether this is the case or not, the composition of a company’s board is for its shareholders to decide. This brings the discussion back to Mr Lim’s and GuGong’s points concerning statutory rights in relation to the governance of No Signboard, not as an automatic disqualifier of injunctive relief generally but as an answer on the facts of this case to any claim by Gazelle that it has enforceable rights in relation to the requisitioning of or voting at shareholders’ meetings of No Signboard, in respect of which a precautionary injunction may lie. This is sufficient to dispose of this argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>Nonetheless, it is worth adding a further point, namely that whether the duty to act in good faith in the interests of the body of No Signboard’s shareholders as a whole would be breached requires close and detailed inquiry into the commercial considerations at play. Part of any such inquiry involves considering the position of the minority shareholders and their reasons, if any, for disagreeing with the majority. The majority’s reasons would also have to be scrutinised. At the precautionary injunction stage, the court must find a strong probability that the act to be injuncted would constitute a wrong.

The paying party calls upon a bond in support of its own cause of action against the performing party for damages for non-performance. Indeed, wrongfully calling on a performance bond may constitute an abuse of a contractual power which equity will restrain, albeit in limited circumstances: in England only on the ground of fraud but in Singapore also on the broader ground of unconscionability.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I would, for the same reasons, respectfully disagree with recent dicta in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Tanoto Sau Ian v USP Group Ltd and another matter</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [2023]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> SGHC 106 at [73] and [74], following </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sulzer Pumps</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Having held that there is no such thing as a freestanding injunction to prevent injustice independent of substantive rights, I do not accept Gazelle’s alternative contention. </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I dismiss this originating application entirely and award costs to the defendants against Gazelle.

Secondly, Gazelle is concerned that the sums it has already disbursed to No Signboard are practically irrecoverable given No Signboard’s financial state. Again, this is not a matter before me, and I make no comment on Gazelle’s potential legal options hereafter. Thirdly, nothing in this judgment should be taken as foreclosing potential causes of action that Gazelle may have for remedies in damages, including the potential causes of action raised by Gazelle before me. In this judgment, I have been called upon only to consider the arguments in terms of prior restraint and not in analysis of events which have happened. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam <br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Lai Hock Nichol, Qua Bi Qi and Zhang Jun (Nine Yards Chambers LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kevin Kwek Yiu Wing, Tan Yiting Gina and Charanpreet Kaur (Legal Solutions LLC) for the first and second defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The third respondent unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
