<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In its statement of claim, the plaintiff,
                    Comfort Management Pte Ltd, formulates its claim against the defendants as being
                    “for conversion and/or for wrongful or illegal distress of the
                    Plaintiffs’ properties”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       There are three defendants. The first defendant
                    is Afco East Pte Ltd (“Afco”), a Singapore incorporated company.
                    Mr Lee Bee Eng and Ms Ang Lay Hong, the second and third defendants
                    respectively, are the directors and shareholders of Afco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The proceedings herein are an offshoot of OS 71
                    of 2008 (“OS 71”) filed in the Subordinate Courts by Afco in
                    February 2008. In OS 71, Afco applied under the provisions of the Distress Act
                    (Cap 84, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to procure the issue of a
                    Writ of Distress against a firm called Alaskan Ice Distribution (“Alaskan
                    Ice”). Pursuant to this writ certain equipment lying in Afco’s
                    premises at 9 Jalan Tepong Singapore (“the premises”) was seized
                    by the Bailiff of the Subordinate Courts and subsequently sold by auction in
                    July 2008. The plaintiff’s position is that the equipment was wrongly
                    seized and sold because it did not belong to Alaskan Ice but belonged to the
                    plaintiff as the defendants well knew at the time of the seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The trial of the action took place over two days
                    in December 2011. At the end of the plaintiff’s case, the defendants
                    elected not to call any evidence and submitted that there was no case to answer.
                    The parties subsequently filed written submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">No case to answer – the law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The test of whether a defendant has a case to
                    answer is whether the plaintiff's evidence, taken at face value, establishes a
                    case in law or, alternatively, whether the evidence led by the plaintiff was so
                    unsatisfactory or unreliable that the plaintiff was unable to discharge its
                    burden of proof. See <em>Relfo Ltd (in liquidation) v Bhimji
                        </em><em>Velji </em><em>Jadva
                        </em><em>Varsani</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 657 at [20]
                    following <em>Bansal </em><em>Hemant
                        </em><em>Govindprasad v Central Bank of
                        India</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 33 at [11].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In this case, while the defendants say that they
                    have no case to answer based on both of the above grounds, the reasons given in
                    their written closing submissions seem to suggest that they are mainly pursuing
                    the first ground of no case to answer, namely, that the plaintiff’s
                    evidence at face value does not establish a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       From 2005, Afco was the landlord of the
                    premises. At the time that Afco became the landlord, the premises housed certain
                    equipment (“the equipment”) which was used to produce ice. The
                    plaintiff’s position is that it was at all material times the beneficial
                    owner of the equipment and was the producer of the ice which was then
                    distributed by Alaskan Ice. According to the plaintiff, Alaskan Ice was an
                    associate business of the plaintiff but the plaintiff did not clarify the exact
                    relationship between it and Alaskan Ice. The evidence before me establishes that
                    the plaintiff was at all material times the absolute owner of the ice production
                    machine, two refrigeration systems and the switchboard which formed part of the
                    equipment. As for another part of the equipment, the automatic freezing tank,
                    the plaintiff was purchasing this on hire purchase and completed all its hire
                    purchase payments in July 2008 when it became the owner of the tank. Before that
                    it was the bailee of the tank under the hire purchase agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff’s position was that at all
                    material times, it was the tenant of the premises. It produced evidence of a
                    tenancy agreement dated 31 December 2002 between itself and the prior
                    landlord of the premises, one Fong Fo Eng (“Mr Fong”), under which
                    the premises were let to the plaintiff for two years. The plaintiff said that
                    this tenancy agreement was succeeded by another one made in 2004 for the period
                    from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2006. The plaintiff, however,
                    admitted through its counsel that the 2004 tenancy agreement was never signed by
                    Afco. It also appears from the copy of the document that was produced in court
                    that it was not signed by Mr Fong either and was also not stamped. The
                    plaintiff subsequently learnt that Mr Fong had transferred the premises to
                    Afco and that Afco was the landlord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendants’ position was that the
                    plaintiff was not the tenant of the premises from 2005 onwards. They said that
                    Alaskan Ice was the tenant under a month-to-month tenancy because Alaskan Ice
                    was the party who paid the rent of the premises. This rental payment was
                    evidenced by statements of account which Alaskan Ice issued to Afco from
                    30 April 2005 to 31 January 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff’s response was that
                    Alaskan Ice was not the tenant because it had never signed any tenancy
                    agreement. The plaintiff admitted, however, that Alaskan Ice had paid the rental
                    for the premises under the 2002 and 2004 tenancy agreements but asserted that
                    such payments were made on the plaintiff’s behalf because the plaintiff
                    and Alaskan Ice had a contra agreement in respect of the dealings between them
                    relating to the sale and purchase of ice. There was, however, no documentary
                    proof (as the plaintiff admitted) of the purchase of ice by Alaskan Ice and no
                    documentary proof that Alaskan Ice and the plaintiff had agreed that Alaskan Ice
                    should pay the rental and that such payments should be set off against the cost
                    of ice supplied to Alaskan Ice by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff also asserted that there was
                    another contra agreement between it and Afco. Afco bought ice from Alaskan Ice
                    and agreed that the amount due from it should be set off against the rent
                    payable for the premises. The statements of account between Alaskan Ice and Afco
                    were prepared by the plaintiff and although they show a contra agreement between
                    these two parties, there is no indication at all that Alaskan Ice was paying the
                    rent that was being set off on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not,
                    it seems, seek to protect its position by documenting it. There is thus no proof
                    of such an arrangement between the plaintiff and Afco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff ceased ice production activities
                    on the premises on 28 January 2006. It admitted that from February 2006
                    onwards, no rent was paid for the premises. Its position was that it had the
                    intention to remove the equipment from the premises and to sell it but that it
                    did not do so because Afco wanted to use the equipment and this resulted in a
                    verbal agreement under which Afco would set off the rent for the equipment
                    against the rental that the plaintiff had to pay for the premises. This verbal
                    agreement was denied by Afco which said it never used the equipment. Further,
                    the evidence given in court that an agreement was arrived at was contrary to the
                    position that the plaintiff took in a letter to Afco’s solicitors written
                    on 19 February 2008. In that letter, the plaintiff said that despite
                    numerous discussions held, the plaintiff and Afco could not arrive at an
                    agreement. The plaintiff’s position is that Afco continued to operate the
                    equipment until it broke down completely in July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 3 January 2008, Afco’s
                    solicitors sent the plaintiff a letter of demand claiming rental of $212,688 for
                    the period from January 2006 to December 2007. On 19 February 2008, the
                    plaintiff responded. It denied Afco’s allegations and asserted that Afco
                    owed it money for the use of the equipment and for damage caused to the
                    equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 26 February 2008, Afco commenced OS 71
                    against Alaskan Ice seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, leave to
                    levy a distress for rent due in respect of the premises from January 2006 to
                    December 2007. The ground of the application was that Afco had issued invoices
                    to Alaskan Ice for rent since January 2005 and Alaskan Ice had in turn issued
                    statements of account admitting its indebtedness to Afco for such rent. These
                    documents were accepted by the District Court as evidencing the tenancy between
                    Afco and Alaskan Ice and Afco was granted leave to levy a distress for rent
                    amounting to $100,800, which represented the rental amount for the period of
                    January 2007 to December 2007. The writ of distress was issued on 2 April
                    2008 and executed on 15 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     More than a month after the writ was executed
                    (26 May 2008), the plaintiff filed a Notice of Claimant of Property taken
                    in Execution. It claimed that it was the owner of, or, had right title and
                    interest in, the equipment. The plaintiff’s Notice was, however, rejected
                    by the Registry of the Subordinate Courts apparently because it did not fulfil
                    procedural requirements. On 14 July 2008, the plaintiff filed Summons 9768
                    of 2008 in OS 71 seeking an injunction to restrain Afco from selling or
                    otherwise disposing of the equipment and further, an order discharging the writ
                    of distress or any sale made thereunder. This application was heard on
                    18 July 2008 and was totally unsuccessful. The plaintiff did not appeal and
                    the equipment was sold on 21 July 2008. The plaintiff then took no further
                    steps until the writ of summons herein was filed on 29 April 2011, almost
                    three years later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In its statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    stated that its claim was against all the defendants for conversion and/or for
                    wrongful distress of the equipment. It asserted that the second and third
                    defendants were at the material time, the directors and shareholders of Afco. It
                    went on to make the following allegations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 3 January 2008, Afco had
                        demanded payment of the rental arrears in respect of the
                    premises;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     On
                        19 February 2008, the plaintiff had denied the allegation and claimed
                        that instead it was Afco that owed the plaintiff money for the use of the
                        equipment and demanded payment from Afco;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Afco did not pay the claim but instead
                        “quietly commenced” OS 71 against Alaskan Ice for possession
                        and arrears of rent “when Alaskan Ice Distribution was not the tenant
                        [of the premises]”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     Afco obtained default judgment against Alaskan Ice and
                        then seized the equipment. The plaintiff alleged that it was “at all
                        material times the beneficial owners of the equipment and all the defendants
                        were aware of it”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff applied to stop Afco from selling and
                        auctioning the equipment and to discharge the writ of distress “but
                        had too short a time to gather their documents, and the equipment seized was
                        sold off or otherwise disposed of in or about July
                    2008”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff claimed that because of the
                    seizure and sale:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     “the Defendants have
                        converted the equipment to their own use and have wrongfully denied the
                        Plaintiffs thereof”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     “the Defendants have committed distress on the
                        equipment that was wrongful, unjustifiable or illegal, and have wrongfully
                        deprived the Plaintiffs thereof”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The statement of claim stated that the claim
                    by the plaintiff extended to the second and third defendants in their capacity
                    as “directors and shareholders of [Afco]” because they
                    “were aware of and party to [Afco’s] said actions”. The
                    plaintiff did not elaborate on why the corporate veil should be lifted and the
                    second and third defendants made personally responsible for Afco’s
                    actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defence was basically a denial that the
                    plaintiff had the right to make a claim against the defendants jointly or
                    severally for conversion, wrongful/illegal distress or on any other basis. This
                    was because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     OS 71 was commenced against Alaskan
                        Ice because of its statements of account and these documents were accepted
                        by the court as evidence that Alaskan Ice was the tenant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was no evidence that the
                        equipment belonged to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff was aware of OS 71 and the subsequent issue
                        of the writ of distress;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     No default judgment was obtained against Alaskan Ice.
                        Only a writ of distress was issued against Alaskan Ice who did not come
                        forward to dispute the distress proceedings even though it was allegedly the
                        plaintiff’s associate company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff had filed a claim for the equipment and
                        applied for its release. It had had ample time to do this because there was
                        five months between the plaintiff’s letter of 19 February 2008
                        and the date on which it filed the application to stop the sale. There was
                        also a period of one and half months between the filing of the Notice of
                        Claim on 26 May 2008 by the plaintiff and the filing of the summons on
                        14 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendants also said that as there was no
                    appeal against the order dismissing the application by the plaintiff to stop the
                    sale, the matters raised in these proceedings were <em>res
                        </em><em>judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff then filed a reply claiming that
                    Alaskan Ice had purchased ice from the plaintiff and sold it to Afco. Alaskan
                    Ice owed the plaintiff money for the purchases and the plaintiff requested that
                    Alaskan Ice paid the rent for the premises. Alaskan Ice was not the tenant of
                    the premises at the material time but the plaintiff was the tenant. It also
                    alleged that the issues in the present proceedings were not <em>res </em><em>judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendants submitted that they have no
                    case to answer for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the defendants said that the
                        plaintiff cannot pursue a claim in wrongful distress of the equipment
                        because there is no common law action for wrongful or illegal distress in
                        Singapore. Even if such a common law action exists, there was no wrongful
                        distress of the equipment on the facts of the case;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the defendants said that the
                        plaintiff could not pursue a claim in conversion because this claim was
                        tacked on the claim in wrongful distress, which, the defendants submitted,
                        failed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the defendants said that the plaintiff was precluded from raising the issue
                        of whether Afco was entitled to issue distress proceedings on the equipment
                        seized by the bailiff because that issue was <em>res
                            </em><em>judicata</em> following the
                        dismissal of the plaintiff’s application in OS 71;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally, the defendants said that the
                        plaintiff was not entitled to lift the corporate veil and make the second
                        and third defendants personally liable for the default of
                    Afco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There are therefore potentially four areas to
                    be considered. However, the last area, that of the personal liability of the
                    second and third defendants, need only be considered if the plaintiff succeeds
                    on either its claim for conversion or its claim for wrongful distress. The issue
                    of <em>res </em><em>judicata</em> is
                    not an independent issue and may only need to be considered in the context of
                    the conversion claim. I propose to deal with conversion first and thereafter
                    with the claim for wrongful distress.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The difficulty that I have with the
                    plaintiff’s conversion claim is that the plaintiff itself did not discuss
                    either in its opening statement or in its closing submissions why it thought
                    that the elements of conversion had been established in fact and in
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff’s opening statement set
                    out the brief facts of the matter and then identified the issues before the
                    court as being:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the plaintiff was
                        Afco’s tenant at the premises at the time when OS 71 was
                        commenced;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the plaintiff had legal or beneficial rights and interest in the
                        equipment and whether the defendants had committed wrongful or illegal
                        distress on the same; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether Afco ought to have proceeded with the sale under
                        the writ of distress because it had been given due notice of the
                        plaintiff’s rights and interests by way of the Notice of Claim and the
                        affidavits which the plaintiff had filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The opening
                    statement then went on to make certain arguments as to why the doctrine of
                        <em>res </em><em>judicata</em> did
                    not apply. The opening statement concluded with no mention whatsoever of
                    conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As the defendants had submitted that there was
                    no case to answer, their closing submissions were delivered first. In this
                    document, they asserted that the conversion claim was linked to the distress
                    proceedings. They submitted that on the basis of the pleadings, this claim was
                    tacked on to the wrongful distress claim since the seizure had been carried out
                    by the Bailiff pursuant to the writ of distress and in accordance with the
                    provisions of the Act. Accordingly, if the claim for wrongful distress failed,
                    the conversion claim would also fail. As an alternative, the defendants
                    submitted that the doctrine of <em>res </em><em>judicata</em> applied to prevent the plaintiff from
                    re-arguing the issue of whether Afco had been entitled to issue distress
                    proceedings and execute the writ of distress against the
                equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Thereafter, the plaintiff filed its closing
                    submissions and reply. In the same, it did not deal at all with the
                    defendants’ submission that the conversion claim had to fail if the
                    wrongful distress claim failed. Nor did the plaintiff say why and how the claim
                    for conversion had been established. Instead, it dealt only with <em>res </em><em>judicata</em>. Even if the
                    plaintiff were to be successful in establishing that <em>res
                        </em><em>judicata</em> does not apply to the
                    facts here, that in itself does not mean that conversion has been
                    established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In these circumstances, it appears to me that
                    the plaintiff did not make out any case of conversion which the defendants had
                    to answer. For completeness, however, I will deal briefly with this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The basic elements of a claim in conversion
                    are that a third party has, without authority, dealt with the claimant’s
                    chattel so as to question or deny his title to it. See <em>Tat
                        Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd</em> [2009] 4
                    SLR(R) 1101 (“<em>Orix Leasing</em>”). The
                    plaintiff would therefore have to show that it had legal standing to sue in
                    relation to the equipment and that Afco had converted the same. As for the legal
                    standing to sue, I have already stated in <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above that the evidence indicated that the plaintiff was the legal owner or
                    bailee of most of the equipment at the time that OS 71 was commenced.
                    Therefore, the plaintiff had the right to possession of most of the equipment.
                    In any event, it was probable that the plaintiff had possession of the equipment
                    prior to January 2008 being (according to the evidence it adduced which the
                    defendants did not rebut) the party who had used the equipment prior to the
                    dispute without adverse claims from any other party, especially Alaskan Ice.
                    Alaskan Ice did not claim the equipment nor was there any evidence that the
                    plaintiff had agreed to lease the equipment to Alaskan Ice or otherwise transfer
                    possession to it. Accordingly, the requirement of legal standing to sue would be
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The next question was whether Afco had
                    committed any act of conversion of the equipment. In this connection, the only
                    relevant act to be considered is its application through OS 71 for the writ of
                    distress as Afco committed no other act in relation to the distraint and sale of
                    the equipment. There is no case directly on point but it appears to me that such
                    act on the part of the plaintiff cannot amount to conversion. While an act of
                    conversion includes an unauthorised course of dealing not involving physical
                    possession or physical handling of the goods in question, such an act must
                    deprive the plaintiff of his right to possession or amount to a substantial
                    interference with that right (<em>UCO Bank (formerly known as
                        United Commercial Bank) v Ringler Pte Ltd</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 399 at
                    [19]), question or deny his title to the goods in question, or be committed with
                    the intention of exercising a permanent or temporary dominion over it (<em>Orix Leasing</em> at [45]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the instant case, the application for the
                    writ of distress was not an act which purported to exercise control or dominion
                    over the equipment. It did not amount to a transfer of title of the equipment to
                    the bailiff or to any other party. Whilst the granting of the order and the
                    execution of the writ led to the plaintiff eventually losing its right of
                    possession to the equipment and its title to the same, this resulted from lawful
                    court action. All that Afco did was what it was legally entitled to do in
                    protecting its legitimate interest in collecting rent from Alaskan
                Ice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Thorogood v
                        Robinson</em> (1845) 6 QBR 769 (“<em>Thorogood”</em>), the plaintiff was a limeburner who was in
                    possession of some land and of the lime which was lying on the land. The
                    defendant had recovered judgment in ejectment for the land and entered the land
                    under the writ of possession issued pursuant to the judgment. Two of plaintiff's
                    servants were, at the material time, loading a barge at the premises with part
                    of the plaintiff’s lime, and the defendant had turned the
                    plaintiff’s servants away from the premises and refused to let them deal
                    with the remaining lime on the land. The plaintiff sued the defendant for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the tort of conversion, and the
                    Court held that the defendant’s acts did not amount to conversion of the
                    plaintiff’s lime because the defendant had the right to enter the land to
                    evict the plaintiff's servants (<em>Thorogood</em> at 772).
                    The Court noted that while the plaintiff certainly had a right to the lime on
                    the land, he should have sent someone with a proper authority to demand and
                    receive them – if the defendant had then refused to deliver them or to
                    permit the plaintiff or his servants to remove them, there would have been a
                    clear conversion (<em>ibid.)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, Afco, like the defendant
                    in <em>Thorogood</em>, had simply done whatever it was
                    legally entitled to in order to protect its rights. It is pertinent to note that
                    under the Act, the tenant against whom a lessor is entitled to levy a writ of
                    distress is “any person from whom a landlord claims rent to be due under
                    any such lease or agreement” (see s 5 read with s 2 of the Act). Even if
                    Afco had committed an act seemingly depriving the plaintiff of its right to
                    possession of the equipment or amounting to a substantial interference with that
                    right, Afco cannot be liable in the tort of conversion because it was found to
                    be entitled to the issue of a writ of distress on the evidence produced before
                    the court that Alaskan Ice had not paid rental which it was liable to pay to
                    Afco and Alaskan Ice as tenant was apparently in possession of the equipment.
                    Action taken in a court of law to protect one’s legal rights cannot be
                    considered to be unauthorised even if, as a result thereof, a third
                    party’s right to possession of goods is interfered with. It appears to me
                    that, conceptually, action taken by a claimant to obtain a legal remedy against
                    a third party’s property cannot amount to an unauthorised dealing in such
                    property. The owner of the property is not in any position to authorise, let
                    alone withhold authority for, the commencement of legal action by such claimant
                    notwithstanding that the claimant may not have a good legal basis to do so. If
                    the third party is aggrieved by the taking of the legal action it has remedies
                    open to it, but, in my judgment, these do not include a claim for conversion. I
                    tend to agree with the defendants’ submission that in a situation like the
                    present, a claim for conversion could only succeed if the distress action was
                    common law distress rather than the judicial process established by the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wrongful or illegal distress of the equipment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff concentrated its submissions on
                    establishing that Afco had acted wrongfully in applying for the writ of distress
                    because the defendants knew that the plaintiff was the owner of the equipment at
                    all material times. The plaintiff says that the defendants therefore had no
                    honest intention and no probable cause when they applied for the writ of
                    distress and executed it. In this connection, the plaintiff relied on the
                    observation of Shaw CJ in <em>Chop Chye </em><em>Hin </em><em>Chong v Ng Yeok Seng</em>
                    [1934] 1 MLJ 265 (“<em>Chop Chye </em><em>Hin </em><em>Chong</em>”) at p
                    266 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the right of everyone to put the law in motion if he does so with
                        the honest intention of protecting his interests but it is an abuse of that
                        right if he proceeds maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause
                        for anticipating success.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted, however, that that statement was made in the
                    context of explaining that the right to make a claim for wrongful or illegal
                    distress no longer existed in Singapore and instead there had to be an action
                    for malicious prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I discussed <em>Chop Chye
                        </em><em>Hin </em><em>Chong</em> in <em>Ginsin Holdings v Tan Mui
                        </em><em>Khoon t/a Chan Eng Soon Service</em>

                    Holdings</em>”). In <em>Ginsin Holdings</em>,
                    I held that there is no common law action for wrongful or illegal distress of
                    goods in Singapore because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">there is a judicial determination interposed between filing of the
                        affidavit on which the writ is issued and the issue of the writ, and the
                        issue of the writ is in consequence of that interposition and therefore
                        persons acting without malice are protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(See <em>Ginsin Holdings</em> at [13] citing
                        <em>Chop Chye </em><em>Hin
                        </em><em>Chong</em>). This decision was based on
                    the fact that since 1876, in Singapore, the law of distress had been embodied in
                    legislation establishing a judicial process and the common law remedy relating
                    to distress had been abrogated. In coming to this determination, I followed
                        <em>Chop Chye </em><em>Hin
                        </em><em>Chong</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Also relevant is my observation in <em>Ginsin Holdings</em> at [14] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There has been no change in the legal position since <em>Chop Chye </em><em>Hin
                            </em><em>Chong v Ng Yeok Seng</em> was
                        decided. Under the Act which in its original form as Ordinance 28 of 1934
                        was the successor to the Civil Procedure Code 1907 and is not substantively
                        different from that Code, distress is a remedy which is obtained only after
                        judicial intervention. It is not a self-help remedy as in England.
                        Accordingly, although the Act follows the Code in not providing compensation
                        for wrongful or illegal distress, an aggrieved tenant cannot fall back on
                        the common law remedy of an action for damages per se. Instead he has
                        to bring an action for malicious prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">My decision in <em>Ginsin Holdings</em> was
                    followed by the High Court in <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee v Far East Square Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 651.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It has therefore been established law in
                    Singapore since 1934 that a person aggrieved by a writ of distress obtained
                    through a proper court process cannot sue the applicant for the writ on the
                    basis of the common law cause of action for wrongful or illegal distress. The
                    remedy for such an aggrieved person lies in an action for malicious
                    prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the present case, the statement of claim
                    says explicitly at para 1 that the plaintiff’s claim is “for
                    wrongful or illegal distress of the [plaintiff’s] properties”.
                    After reciting all the facts on which the action is based, the plaintiff ended
                    in para 9 of the statement of claim by repeating its assertion that the
                    defendants had committed distress on the equipment that was wrongful,
                    unjustifiable or illegal. To me, the plaintiff’s pleading indicates an
                    action for wrongful or illegal distress rather than an action for malicious
                    prosecution. On that basis, the plaintiff has no cause of action for the reasons
                    given above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the course of the trial, the plaintiff
                    attempted to amend its statement of claim by amending para 1 thereof and
                    inserting a new para 10. If the amendments had been allowed, paras 1 and 10
                    would have read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The Plaintiffs’ claim against all the
                            Defendants for conversion and/or for wrongful or illegal distress of the
                            Plaintiffs’ properties <u>as well as malicious
                                prosecution against the Plaintiffs (distraining and selling
                                Plaintiffs’ equipment in total disregard of the
                                Plaintiffs’ rights and interest therein, which the Defendants
                                were aware of at the material time).</u></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    
              <u>Further or in the alternative,
                                the Defendants have committed malicious prosecution against the
                                Plaintiffs (distraining and selling Plaintiffs’ equipment in
                                total disregard of the Plaintiffs’ rights and interest
                                therein, which the Defendants were aware at the material
                                time.</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Proposed amendments indicated by the underlined wording)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I disallowed the plaintiff’s
                    application. I considered that the proposed amended pleading was inadequate to
                    sustain a cause of action in malicious prosecution. The plaintiff gave no
                    particulars of the alleged malice and was relying only on the facts already
                    pleaded in support of the action for wrongful distress to support its new cause
                    of action. The plaintiff did not appeal against my dismissal of its application
                    and the trial proceeded on the basis of the original pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It appears from the closing submissions,
                    however, that the plaintiff considers that it can still make out an action for
                    malicious prosecution although that cause of action was not expressly mentioned
                    in the statement of claim. It submitted that the evidence showed that the
                    defendants knew that the plaintiff was the owner of the equipment and as Afco
                    applied under the Act on the basis that Alaskan Ice, and not the plaintiff, was
                    the tenant, the defendants could not be said to have any honest intention or
                    probable cause. In using the words “honest intention or probable
                    cause”, the plaintiff was referring to <em>Chop Chye
                        </em><em>Hin </em><em>Chong</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Reverting to <em>Chop Chye
                        </em><em>Hin </em><em>Chong</em>, it is worth repeating the extract from that judgment
                    relied on by the plaintiff (and quoted in <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above) but putting it in the context in which it was
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a well established principle both with regard to civil and criminal
                        matters that a person is not liable in damages for putting the law in motion
                        unless he is actuated by malice. <em>It is the right of
                            everyone to put the law in motion if he does so with the honest
                            intention of protecting his interests but it is an abuse of that right
                            if he proceeds maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause for
                            anticipating success.</em> An example of this will be found in the
                            <u>difference that exists between an action for
                            wrongful arrest and one for malicious prosecution. In the case of the
                            first</u>, where a man acts on his own initiative, <u>proof of malice is not necessary to give a right to recompense
                            by damages</u>. <u>In the case of the
                            second</u>, where the interposition of the Court is obtained,
                            <u>malice must be established</u>. An example
                        may again be found in the form of an action for abuse of ordinary civil
                        process. Malice and absence of reasonable and probable cause must again be
                        proved in the same manner as in an action for malicious prosecution
                            (<em>Mitchell v. Jenkins</em>, 5 B. &amp; Ad.
                        588)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the above extract, I have italicised the language relied on by the
                    plaintiff and underlined the portion which I think is equally relevant to put
                    the plaintiff’s claim in context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is clear from the underlined portion of the
                    extract from <em>Chop Chye </em><em>Hin
                        </em><em>Chong</em> that whilst in an action for
                    wrongful distress no proof of malice is required, in a case for malicious
                    prosecution arising from a distress executed by the court, malice must be
                    established. This means that an allegation of malice must be specifically
                    asserted and particulars of such malice must be pleaded and proved. The
                    plaintiff failed completely to meet this requirement and it is too late at this
                    stage for the plaintiff to recast its case and assert that the facts set out in
                    the statement of claim would establish malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The particulars if provided would have given
                    the defendants an opportunity to meet the plaintiff’s case for malicious
                    prosecution. As the plaintiff cast its claim as one for wrongful distress, the
                    defendants had to deal with it on that basis and did so. It is likely that if
                    the claim had been properly pleaded, the defendants would have made a different
                    election in relation to the production of evidence. The plaintiff cannot take
                    advantage of the defendants’ decision not to adduce evidence, a decision
                    made on the basis that the case was a claim for conversion and wrongful
                    distress, to now say that it has established malicious prosecution since the
                    defendants have not produced any rebuttal evidence in relation to their
                    contention that the evidence showed that Afco knew the plaintiff owned the
                    equipment. As held by Lai Siu Chiu J in <em>Challenger
                        Technologies Pte Ltd v Dennison Transoceanic Corp</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R)
                    618 at [60], the absence of reasonable and probable cause would not in itself
                    lead inexorably to a finding that there was malice, and the nub of the matter
                    was whether Afco had a genuine belief that there was a <em>bona
                        fide</em> case against Alaskan Ice under the Act and was primarily
                    motivated by a desire to vindicate its rights <em>qua</em>
                    landlord of the premises. No doubt the defendants would have had to produce
                    evidence to establish what Afco’s genuine belief was at the material time.
                    One of the reasons that they did not do so was that on the basis of the
                    pleadings, it did not appear that Afco was facing a claim for malicious
                    prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I am satisfied that the only causes of action
                    that the writ herein disclosed were conversion and wrongful or illegal distress.
                    There was no action for malicious prosecution and the plaintiff cannot now seek
                    a verdict in its favour on the basis of such a cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim against the second and third defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As the plaintiff’s claim against Afco
                    has failed, its claim against the second and third defendants must fail too. In
                    any event, I would have held that the second and third defendants could not be
                    made personally liable for the actions of Afco. It is a basic principle of our
                    law that a company has a separate legal personality from its directors and that
                    its directors cannot be made personally liable for the actions of the company
                    simply on the basis that they were the ones who procured such actions. One or
                    more of certain grounds has to be established. There is no need for me to go
                    into the law of lifting the corporate veil in this judgment. Suffice it to say
                    that none of the grounds that would support a finding of personal liability on
                    the part of the directors was either pleaded or proved by the plaintiff in
                    relation to the second and third defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiff’s claim against all the
                    defendants is dismissed with costs.</p>
