Put another way, unrecovered legal costs is something which is part and parcel of resolving disputes by seeking recourse to <span class="font-italic">our </span>legal system and all parties who come before our courts must accept this to be a <span class="font-italic">necessary incidence </span>of using the litigation process.

The Court of Appeal at [51] and [52] distinguished the policy considerations underpinning the separate costs regime for the Singapore International Commercial Court from those underpinning the costs regime in the High Court. In relation to the latter, the Court of Appeal cautioned at [46] that awarding the full extent of costs incurred by the successful party may diminish access to justice by deterring the pursuit of legitimate claims by litigants for fear of unaffordable or otherwise prohibitive adverse costs. Moreover, a policy based on full indemnification may mean that the costs awarded to a successful party would depend on the ability of that party to expend resources on the litigation, which will advantage the better-resourced litigant and promote inequality of arms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Considerations of access to justice therefore require that costs awarded under O 59 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”) are assessed at a level that would enable a litigant with reasonable merits to pursue justice. This involves “the application of an <span class="font-italic">objective</span> standard to determine the level of recoverable costs in each case, shaped by the normative question of what <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to be the amount of costs a successful party can recover for the particular work done in the context of the dispute in question, irrespective of the level of costs the successful party may have actually incurred in the legal proceedings” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Senda</span> at [47]). Specifically, the court relies on costs precedents, as well as the guidelines to be found in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2013.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Supreme Court Practice Directions 2013, Appendix G: Guidelines for Party-and-Party costs awards in the Supreme Court of Singapore.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In other words, costs must be tailored to the attributes of each case and what is generally accepted to be recoverable in similar cases, as opposed to subjective factors such as how much individual litigants might have been willing to spend (<span class="font-italic">Senda</span> at [48]–[50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I pause to consider a possible point of principle that might be thought to arise from the change in the English Rules of the Supreme Court in 1986 (the “RSC”), which was adopted in Singapore. Previously, costs assessed on a party-and-party basis were of costs “necessarily incurred”. However, the former O 62 of the RSC was recast to enable the successful party in litigation to recover costs either on: (a) the standard basis, which allows costs reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount; or (b) the indemnity basis, which allows costs except where unreasonable in amount or unreasonably incurred, with costs on a standard basis being the norm in civil litigation (see James Edelman, <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span><span class="font-italic">on Damages</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2021) at para 21-004). Order 59 rr 27(2) and 27(3) of the ROC 2014 were taken virtually verbatim from the recast O 62 rr 12(1) and 12(2) of the RSC (see <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon </span>at [215]). A key difference between costs on the standard basis and costs on the indemnity basis is that in the former, any doubts are resolved in favour of the receiving party whereas in the latter, any doubts are resolved in favour of the paying party (see O 59 rr 27(2) and 27(3) of the ROC 2014). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Thus, if an amount of costs is fixed on the basis that that is the amount reasonably incurred, it could be argued that any difference between that amount and the full amount incurred is not reasonable, and so on ordinary principles of assessment of damages should not be recoverable as damages either. This is superficially attractive, until one recalls that the yardstick for reasonableness for the assessment of costs by the court is not the market alone, but takes into account proportionality as well as considerations of access to justice that I have earlier outlined at [13]–[17]. The balance struck is reflected in Appendix G. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> at [49] in relation to the assessment of costs by reference to Appendix G: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [Appendix G] infers a reasonable amount of fees that may be charged for various types of work, which are then expressed in ranges to account for the reality that there will be variances from one case to the next in terms of complexity (see Appendix G at para 2). The effect of Appendix G means that, even catering for the specificities of individual cases, the level of recoverable costs will generally remain within the ranges set out therein, which represent the level of fees which members of the public and the legal profession would generally accept as reasonable. It is consistent with access to justice considerations that costs are assessed by reference to these generally accepted levels and, again, are not dependent on subjective factors such as how much the individual litigant might have been willing to spend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The assessment of damages in relation to costs incurred by a party, if available in principle as a substantive right, would, by contrast, consider reasonableness principally in terms of whether the costs actually incurred were reasonable in terms of the market for advocates of the appropriate expertise and experience in relation to the matter concerned, including the matter’s value, complexity and importance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 This does not mean that full legal costs are not potentially recoverable as damages in claims against third parties. For example, A may claim against B for damages arising from a wrong committed by B that caused A to incur legal costs in commencing proceedings against or defending against proceedings brought by C, or that caused the waste of legal costs incurred in such a proceeding. Such loss may occur, for instance, where a legal professional has been negligent and the client has had to commence a legal proceeding that he would not have had to pursue but for such negligence, perhaps in an effort to mitigate his loss. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Possible exception where there has been an undertaking as to damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I turn then to the question of whether there is an exception to the general rule – that the shortfall between costs assessed and costs incurred is not recoverable as damages against the same party – when an undertaking as to damages has been given by a party as a condition for the grant of an injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I would first dispose of the point made by counsel for the fifth and sixth defendants during the hearing before me on 7 November 2022 that the case of <span class="font-italic">Maryani Sadeli</span> may be distinguished on the basis that the general rule identified in that case applies to claims for damages in subsequent proceedings whereas the undertaking as to damages in the present case was given and sought to be enforced in the same proceedings.

</div> It is true that the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Maryani Sadeli</span> (see [11] above) relate to claims for damages made in subsequent proceedings. However, that is simply a consequence of how such a claim might ordinarily be mounted. When a party to a proceeding seeks costs against another party to the same proceeding, he does so pursuant to the court’s jurisdiction to order costs and not pursuant to a substantive right to damages. Most successful parties, whether plaintiff or defendant, are likely to find that their outlay in costs exceeds the quantum they are awarded pursuant to the court’s powers to award costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The fifth and sixth defendants contend that the undertaking makes all the difference. But it is hard to see why this should be so as a matter of principle. The undertaking operates as if it were a contract between the applicant for an injunction and the respondent to it that the applicant would not prevent the respondent from doing that which the respondent was restrained from doing by the terms of the injunction, a principle most recently restated in the Privy Council decision on appeal from the Cayman Islands Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ennismore Fund Management Ltd v Fenris Consulting Ltd</span> [2022] UKPC 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Ennismore</span>”) at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On 9 December 2022, I invited

</div>
</div>
</div> I disagree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my view, an undertaking as to damages concerns <span class="font-italic">loss caused by the issu</span><span class="font-italic">ing of the injunction</span>. The question is what loss the respondent has suffered as a result of not being able to do what he would otherwise have been free to do. A typical example in the context of a freezing order would be not being able to sell an asset while the injunction is in force. This may result in loss where the market is falling. There could also be disruptions to the respondent’s business or an increase in his borrowing costs. The question is whether these losses flow from the existence of the injunction which stopped the respondent from doing what the applicant, by way of the undertaking, contracted not to prevent the respondent from doing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 By contrast, an application to set aside the injunction is the choice of the respondent. In a sense, it can be described as a legal proceeding brought in respect of the alleged breach of the notional contract, not dissimilar from legal proceedings brought in respect of contractual and other claims.  As with any other legal proceeding, the respondent is entitled to seek the costs of doing so pursuant to the court’s jurisdiction to order costs. The expenses incurred by the respondent from applying to set aside the injunction are not damages flowing from the existence of the injunction. It is one part of the respondent’s overall costs of his legal battle in the matter as whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Seen in this light, the recovery of the respondent’s costs of applying to set aside an injunction must be subject to the same policy considerations that govern the recovery of that respondent’s costs of successfully defending the action, namely, the need to enhance access to justice, achieve finality in litigation and suppress parasitic litigation (see [13]–[17] above). As the Court of Appeal stated in the passage cited at [15] above: “unrecovered legal costs is something which is part and parcel of resolving disputes by seeking recourse to <span class="font-italic">our </span>legal system and all parties who come before our courts must accept this to be a <span class="font-italic">necessary incidence </span>of using the litigation process” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Given that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> post-dated the hearing I also invited the plaintiffs and the fifth and sixth defendants to make further submissions on the policy considerations underlying the making of an award of costs in the High Court identified in that case (see [16]–[17] above).

</div> The fifth and sixth defendants submit that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> did not state as a foregone conclusion that a successful litigant could never recover its full legal costs. They argue that there are exceptions to the general position that the court should not award the full extent of costs incurred by the successful party (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where there is a contractual agreement that a litigant may recover costs on an indemnity basis), and that the enforcement of an undertaking as to damages should be recognised as one such exception.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 However, as explained above at [26], the fifth and sixth defendants’ costs of applying to set aside the Freezing Order are part of their overall costs in the matter as a whole, the recovery of which was first sought pursuant to the court’s jurisdiction to order costs. In this regard, the fifth and sixth defendants have not explained why the recovery of such costs should not be subject to the policy considerations identified in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> nor how allowing a parallel avenue of recovery by recourse to the undertaking as to damages would not undermine those policy considerations. Moreover, the example provided by the fifth and sixth defendants of awarding the full extent of costs incurred by a party pursuant to a term in the contract between parties is completely different from the case at hand. Agreeing to pay full costs in the event of an action brought upon a contract is different from simply agreeing to pay damages for breach of a notional contract that the applicant would not prevent the respondent from doing that which the respondent was restrained from doing by the terms of the injunction; giving an undertaking in respect of the latter does not entail any agreement to the former. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, the absence of authority on this point itself reflects the practice that costs incurred in applying to discharge an injunction are sought by recourse to the court’s jurisdiction to order costs and not as damages pursuant to an undertaking by the applicant. It is not uncommon for a respondent to seek from a foreign applicant both a fortification of the undertaking as to damages and security for costs. While costs would not be a factor in the application for a fortification of the undertaking, regard would be had to the likely costs that might eventually be ordered by the court pursuant to its costs jurisdiction in the application for security for costs. This demonstrates that the distinction between damages and costs is workable, accepted and effective in the context of interlocutory injunctions. That distinction should not be eroded by allowing the recovery of the fifth and sixth defendants’ costs as damages pursuant to the plaintiffs’ undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I therefore decline to order an inquiry as to damages, and make no order as to costs of the fifth and sixth defendants’ application for such an inquiry.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Plaintiffs absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">First defendant absent;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Yoong Joon Wei, Aaron (Yang Junwei)</span> (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the second, third and seventh defendants (watching brief);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Fourth defendant absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lum Kwong Hoe Melvin and Joel Raj Moosa (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the fifth and sixth defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
