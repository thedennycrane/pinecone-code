It suffices to note that the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (“EMA”) had established the Enhanced Forward Sales Contract Scheme (“the Scheme”) to facilitate participation in Singapore’s electric futures market.

Two of the legal issues were (a) whether Menrva had breached the consultancy agreement and (b) whether SEPL was contractually liable to pay Menrva certain fees under the same agreement (liability judgment at [27]). Coomaraswamy J held largely in favour of the defendants to the claim, who are also the applicants in the present case. He held for Menrva in the counterclaim, leaving damages to be assessed (at [153] and [154]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 SEPL and SEPPL appealed against the liability judgment. This is reported in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric Pte Ltd and another v Menrva Solutions Pte Ltd and another </span>[2019] SGCA 51.

</div> Mr Peloso applied for SEPPL to be placed under judicial management on two grounds. First, that SEPPL was unable to pay its debts. Second, that the interests of SEPPL’s shareholders would be better served through the winding down of its operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Based on Mr Peloso’s affidavit, SEPPL’s issued share capital was S$45,605,994. As of the date of Mr Peloso’s affidavit, SEPPL’s cash on hand amounted to a meagre $93,599.64. In his affidavit, Mr Peloso claimed that SEPPL’s major creditors were SESPL and SEPL, various customers of SEPPL, Wong Partnership LLP, and an entity known as Kashish.

However, for reasons which will be made clear, both the Mareva injunction and the Disclosure Orders were not granted that day but only at the subsequent hearings held on 24 September 2019 and 22 October 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 To obtain Mareva relief against a party to the suit, a plaintiff must establish a good arguable case on the merits and a real risk that the defendant will dissipate its assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the court (<span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and another v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 558 (“<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>”) at [36]). The issue of there being a “good arguable case” did not arise because the plaintiff in the counterclaim, Menrva, had successfully established its counterclaim against SEPL, with judgment having been entered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In an application for a Mareva injunction against a third party to the suit, the applicant must show a “good arguable” case that a third party is holding assets that belong to the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 410 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19]). The Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> affirmed the court’s jurisdiction to include in a Mareva court order assets belonging to a third party on the basis that the assets are “in truth the assets of the defendant” (at [124]). I was mindful that the respondents, save for SEPL and SEPPL, were third parties in Suit No 200 of 2016. I was equally cognisant that each respondent was a separate legal personality. In arriving at my decision to grant Mareva relief against the respondents, I did not rely on the single economic entity doctrine, which has been rejected by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 592 at [70]–[75]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Applying the test in <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>, I was of the view that the assets of the third parties were, on a good arguable standard, the assets of the defendant in the counterclaim, SEPL. It is not necessary for me to elaborate further as the respondents did not seek leave to appeal against this point (see [9] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The parties’ main point of contention at the four hearings was the existence of a “real risk” of asset dissipation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The evidence cited by the applicants included the following matters, which I accepted as showing a “real risk” of dissipation. First, there appeared to have been a breach of an existing Order of Court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an interim injunction obtained by RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (“RCMA”) against SEPPL (“the RCMA Injunction”, explained further at [21] below), through SEPPL’s withdrawal or transfer of large sums of money out of a bank account it held. Second, SEPL had sold several of its patents for a sum of S$80,000. SEPL was then made the exclusive licensee of those patents. The terms of the licenses were not shown to court. Third, there was a large depletion of assets from SEPPL, the company that is now the subject of JM proceedings, to the tune of $16.8 million. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The RCMA Injunction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As part of the same Scheme established by the EMA, SEPPL had entered into an agreement with RCMA.

I fully understand the significance of an order of court, and as SEPPL’s director, I had always intended to procure SEPPL to comply with the injunction ordered by the Court. However, as explained in MP’s JM Affidavit at [48(k)], SEEAPL urgently required monies to pay a contractor, Sunpower Systems Sarl for solar modules to be installed on its rooftop projects (a copy of Sunpower System Sarl’s invoice dated 25 September 2018 for the sum of US$1,253,184.90 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, approximately S$1.5m) is exhibited hereto as <span class="font-weight-bold">Tab 103 </span>of <span class="font-weight-bold">Exhibit MP-4</span>). Although SEEAPL had managed to secure the agreement of a third party funder to fund part of the costs in September 2018, it so happened that there was a delay in the remission of funds. In the event, the funds in SEPPL’s OCBC Account were the only option available at the time and were used to pay for the solar modules in September 2018. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">While I understand now after having sought advice from my solicitors that I should have applied to court to seek a partial variation of the injunction, the withdrawal on 24 September 2018 was done purely out of desperation and immediately made up for once funds from the third party funder came through.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics and bold; emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In other words, Mr Peloso was <span class="font-italic">aware </span>that the money should not have been withdrawn from the OCBC Account. He was conscious that removing the sum constituted a breach of the terms of the RCMA injunction. Still, he proceeded to withdraw the sum of money from the OCBC Account. Mr Peloso’s justification for defying a clear court order (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the RCMA Injunction) was that SEEAPL “urgently required monies to pay a contractor” and that “the funds in SEPPL’s OCBC Account were the only option available at the time”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Thereafter, sometime between 27 November 2018 to 17 December 2018, <span class="font-italic">money was again </span><span class="font-italic">taken out of the OCBC Account, in apparent contravention of the RCMA Injunction</span>. This time, the entire sum of money in the OCBC Account was transferred to a DBS Account held by SEPPL (“the DBS account”). The sum amounted to approximately S$6 million.

In relation to the other alleged debts, no documents were produced to evidence the losses allegedly made on the CFDs involving Mr Chan, or indeed any of the other expenses incurred by SEPPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, it was clear that a large amount of the expenses listed by Mr Peloso in his affidavit for SEPPL was incurred by <span class="font-italic">other entities </span>in the SE Group. However, there was a noticeable omission by Mr Peloso to mention any reason why the sums that were received by <span class="font-italic">SEPPL</span> in the OCBC Account ended up being used by <span class="font-italic">other</span> <span class="font-italic">entities</span> in the SE Group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Third, while SEPPL claimed to have incurred almost S$1.5 million in legal costs, at least some of these costs were incurred for entities other than SEPPL. For instance, Suit 1229 of 2016 did not involve SEPPL. Further, although $1.2 million was allegedly incurred for the registration of patents, none of these registered patents were owned by SEPPL. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the FSC Payments were credited into SEPPL’s OCBC Account and this was the <span class="font-italic">same account </span>jointly maintained with RCMA and the <span class="font-italic">same account </span>from which approximately S$6 million had been garnished by Kashish in highly suspicious circumstances.

Ms Koh, however, informed me that the deal would not go through if a Mareva injunction was in force. To overcome this, I granted the Mareva injunction with a <span class="font-italic">proviso </span>so that the sale could go ahead pending the payment of a sum of approximately $1.86 million (a revised figure from Ms Koh’s proposal) into court (“the Enjoined Sum”)). This sum represented the alleged quantum of damages arising from Menrva’s counterclaim against SEPL, interest accruing from the date of the liability judgment and various legal costs. The Mareva injunction would be discharged with immediate effect upon the payment of the Enjoined Sum into court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The parties were to work out the precise terms of the draft order for the Mareva injunction.

I first take note of the wide terms of section 37(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 [equivalent to s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) (see below at [81])] which empowers the court to grant an injunction in all cases where it appears to the court to be just and convenient to do so. Secondly, the whole basis of the Mareva injunction is that, where a plaintiff has shown a good arguable case, the court, in order to protect the plaintiff’s interests, has jurisdiction in a proper case to grant an interlocutory injunction restraining a defendant from disposing of or dissipating his assets, where the refusal of such an injunction would involve a real risk that a judgment obtained by the plaintiff would be stultified and remain unsatisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thirdly, the jurisdiction of the court should be exercised with caution and great care should be taken not to be oppressive to the persons restrained, either in the carrying on of a business or in the conduct of everyday life. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Fourthly, the practice of the court on the grant of Mareva injunctions is an evolving one which has to remain flexible and adaptable to meet new situations as and when they arise. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my view, in granting Mareva relief (including ancillary disclosure orders) regard must be had to how wily a defendant has been in devising schemes to dissipate, dispose or put its assets out of reach to evade judgment. To meet the objectives of Mareva relief and confront the challenges posed by devious schemes, the Mareva relief must remain flexible and be capable of being tailored accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Petromar Energy Resources Pte Ltd v Glencore International AG </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1152 (“<span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>”) set out the purpose of disclosure orders. In brief, disclosure orders are merely ancillary to a Mareva injunction for the plaintiff to determine the location of a defendant’s assets and take appropriate steps to preserve them pending the trial (at [21]). The CA elaborated on disclosure orders in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [101]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The ancillary disclosure order] aims to give the plaintiff a snapshot of the defendant’s assets at the time of disclosure. This is to enable the plaintiff to police the injunction and ensure that the defendant’s assets are kept at the steady state which the Mareva injunction seeks to preserve. After all, if the court is satisfied that there is a real risk of dissipation, then it generally follows, as a matter of logic, that there should be a capability to police the Mareva injunction granted. The ancillary asset disclosure order is thus an integral part of the court’s Mareva injunction and an ordinary adjunct to a Mareva injunction: <span class="font-italic">Grupo Torras SA v Shiek Fahad Mohammed Al Sabah </span>(16 February 1994); <span class="font-italic">Motorola Credit Corporation v Cem Cegiz Uzan </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 989 at [28]–[29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 A recent decision by Andrew Ang SJ in <span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks Offshore Ltd and others v Roomans, Jacobus Johannes and others</span> [2019] 3 SLR 836 (“<span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks</span>”) was instructive. The plaintiffs had obtained a Mareva injunction against two defendants. The injunction prohibited the two defendants from dealing with their assets up to a certain value. The two defendants filed affidavits but only partially disclosed their assets. Thereafter, the defendants applied to vary their disclosure obligations on the basis that the disclosed sums were sufficient for the purpose of the Mareva injunction. In dismissing the application to vary the disclosure obligations, Ang SJ set out several important principles in relation to ancillary disclosure obligations: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A plaintiff is given no interest, security or priority in assets that are the subject of a Mareva injunction. Thus, the only way to allow the plaintiff to effectively police the Mareva injunction is by giving the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">sufficient </span>information about the location and details of the defendant’s assets (at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As a general rule, a defendant will be required to make disclosure of <span class="font-italic">all </span>its assets even though the assets restrained are limited to those of a certain value (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even where the defendant has disclosed assets sufficient to meet the sums restrained by the Mareva injunction, there remains utility in requiring the defendant to disclose information relating to the defendant’s other assets. As the information contained in the disclosure affidavits is often a “rough and ready” figure, it would be unrealistic to expect that the value of such assets would be so close to the true value of the defendant’s assets such that no other assets are required to be disclosed in order to preserve the efficacy of the Mareva injunction (at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It is often the case that a Mareva injunction contains exceptions that allow the defendant to apply some of the restrained sums of money towards ordinary expenses and legal fees. Thus, where the defendant only discloses assets that are equal in value or slightly above that restrained by the Mareva injunction, this could reduce the injunction’s  efficacy (at [49]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) As a wide disclosure obligation is typically required to give a Mareva injunction teeth, such widely-phrased disclosure obligations are the norm rather than the exception, and have been described as being the “standard terms” on which a disclosure obligation is made (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Ang SJ stated that it is only where disclosure orders go further than requiring the defendant to disclose all its assets that the court has found such obligations to be overly onerous (at [53]), such as in <span class="font-italic">Wallace Kevin James v Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd </span>[1998] 1 SLR (R) 61 (“<span class="font-italic">Wallace</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>, Glencore had obtained an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>interim Mareva injunction against Petromar, together with ancillary disclosure orders. The CA determined that there was an <span class="font-italic">abuse</span> of the ancillary orders for disclosure, as it appeared that Glencore was not merely seeking to ascertain the amount of money in Petromar’s bank account, but also to determine the movement of money to and from the bank account to assist it in its claims against Petromar and another entity, Metro (at [21]). Two further observations may be made about <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>. The first is that the disclosure orders had been granted by the Judge below at an <span class="font-italic">early</span> stage in the proceedings, indeed on the date the action was commenced. The second is that the disclosure orders were granted on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> basis. In this regard, the court declared that there was no reason why such extensive orders could not have been granted at an <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>hearing instead (at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Wallace</span>, a bank had obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction and an accompanying disclosure order against an employee. The disclosure order at issue was in the following terms (at [34]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the defendants shall give their consent in writing within seven (7) days of the service of the order to be made hereon to all of their bankers providing to the plaintiffs or their solicitors <span class="font-italic">any information</span> relating to their bank account or accounts and/or copies of their bank statements. [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Similarly, as in <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Wallace </span>noted that the disclosure order granted was too wide. In effect, it directed the appellant and his wife to consent to the respondents obtaining any information relating to the accounts they had with his banks. The CA also observed that the only purpose of the disclosure order was to “aid” the Mareva injunction by policing any subsequent disposal of funds. In the circumstances, the court was of the view that opportunity ought to be given to the appellant and his wife to disclose the assets they had at the time, which would include the credit balances in their bank accounts. Requiring the appellant and his wife to provide letters of consent to allow the respondents to obtain information was “going too far” (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Apart from the width of the order, it is important to flag the CA’s concern regarding the <span class="font-italic">stage of the proceedings </span>at which the disclosure order was made. In this respect, the CA expressly remarked that the order was “unjustified” at the time it was made. Like <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>, the disclosure order was made on the date of the commencement of the action (at [3] and [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The above cases concerned disclosure orders that were granted <span class="font-italic">pre</span>-judgment. I now turn to examine decisions involving post-judgment Mareva injunctions and disclosure orders, given that the present case involved the grant of a post-judgment Mareva injunction and ancillary disclosure orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held in <span class="font-italic">Hitachi Leasing (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Vincent Ambrose and another </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 762 (“<span class="font-italic">Hitachi Leasing</span>”) that the two conditions for the issue of a post-judgment Mareva injunction are as follows. First, a real risk of the debtor dissipating or disposing of assets with the intention of depriving the creditor of any satisfaction of its debt. Second, that the injunction must act as an aid to execution (at [19]). <span class="font-italic">Hitachi Leasing</span> did not, however, concern disclosure orders. <span class="font-italic">Hitachi Leasing </span>was cited with approval by the CA in <span class="font-italic">The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport-SDPR) v Westacre Investments Inc and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 372 at [120]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Citing <span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme Shipping Co Ltd v Tantomar-Transportes Marittimos L</span><span class="font-italic">da </span>[1995] 1 WLR 299 (“<span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme Shipping</span>”), Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara International BV and others v PT Ayunda Prima Mitra and others and another matter </span>[2016] 2 SLR 737 noted at [89] that a post-arbitral award Mareva injunction could be made as an aid to execution on the basis that there was a real risk that the party against whom the award had been made may dispose of its assets to avoid execution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme Shipping</span>, the owners of a chartered ship had obtained a Mareva injunction against the charterers to enable enforcement of arbitration awards that had already been made. The assets that were ordered to be disclosed covered assets that were not subject to the Mareva injunction, given that the injunction was confined to <span class="font-italic">assets within England</span> while the ancillary disclosure orders required the charterers to <span class="font-italic">disclose their assets worldwide</span>. Colman J made the following observations regarding the different considerations applicable to pre-judgment and post-judgment disclosure orders (at 310): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… However, in <span class="font-italic">Derby &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Weldon </span>Neill L.J., at pp. 94–95, reaffirmed, albeit obiter, his conviction expressed in <span class="font-italic">Ashtiani v. Kashi [1987] Q.B. 888 </span>that disclosure orders should be coextensive with the scope of the <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunction to which they were ancillary. It is to be observed, however, that both in <span class="font-italic">Ashtiani v. Kashi </span>and in <span class="font-italic">Derby &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Weldon (Nos. 3 and 4) </span>the courts were concerned with <span class="font-italic">pre-judgment</span> orders which included <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunctions. The orders for disclosure were therefore orders ancillary to those injunctions. There was no question of there being any other order in support of which a disclosure order could be justified. Where, by contrast, one has the position that a judgment has been already obtained or an award made and where a <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunction in aid of execution is justified, <span class="font-weight-bold">the jurisdiction to make a disclosure order arises both as a power ancillary to and in support of the injunction and independently of the injunction as a power in support of the execution of the judgment or award</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> It follows that, whereas it may on the facts of the case in question be inappropriate to extend the <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunction to assets outside the jurisdiction — and it is clear from the two authorities cited that such extensions are likely to be rarely justified — <span class="font-italic">very different considerations may apply to disclosure orders in aid of execution.</span><span class="font-italic"> … </span>[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Colman J took into account considerations such as the charterers claiming not to have any assets in England and the existence of outstanding and unsatisfied arbitral awards against them (at 311–312): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case <span class="font-italic">the charterers who have failed to honour the first award, and who have subsequently failed to honour the second award, appear to carry on business in Lisbon and are incorporated in Portugal</span>. <span class="font-italic">They claim to have no assets within the jurisdiction except funds held on account of costs by their solicitors and claims in a London arbitration against an English </span><span class="font-italic">company in relation to which an award is apparently imminent</span>. … <span class="font-italic">The charterers have no bank accounts here</span>. <span class="font-italic">Nothing is known of what assets they have abroad beyond those arbitration claims or the whereabouts of those assets</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">In view of the outstanding and unsatisfied awards against the defendants amounting in aggregate to U.S.$357,349.47 plus interest and costs, the first award having been converted into a judgment for U.S.$284,392.47</span>, <span class="font-italic">it is, in my judgment, entirely just and convenient in aid of execution</span> of those awards that the charterers should be required to tell the owners where their assets are, whether inside or outside the jurisdiction of the English courts. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Although the Mareva injunction was confined to assets within England, the disclosure orders granted extended to assets outside<span class="font-italic"> </span>England. These broader disclosure orders were justified on the basis that they were <span class="font-italic">in aid of execution</span>. In this regard, the court observed that the charterers had no bank accounts in England, nor was anything known about their assets abroad. These factors made it necessary for the court to make the wider disclosure orders. Thus, <span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme Shipping</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>makes it clear that while a disclosure order in support of a pre-judgment Mareva is usually coextensive with the scope of a Mareva injunction, this is not <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> the case for a post-judgment Mareva. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Vitol SA v Capri Marine Limited and others </span>[2010] EWHC 458 (Comm), Justice Tomlinson elaborated on the purpose of post-judgment disclosure orders at [37]: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the post-judgment stage, a disclosure order has a dual purpose. It serves both to assist in the identification or ascertainment of assets that were subject or potentially subject to the freezing order <span class="font-italic">and </span>to assist the judgment creditor in locating assets against which enforcement may be sought. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Pursuant to s 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (c 54) (UK) (“the Senior Courts Act 1981”), the court has a freestanding power to order disclosure after judgment in order to render the judgment effective, in the sense of being capable of enforcement. In this regard, “it is the policy of the law to assist persons in the position of the plaintiffs to obtain the fruits of their judgments” (<span class="font-italic">Maclaine Watson &amp; Co Ltd v International Tin Council (No.2) </span>[1989] 1 Ch 286 at 301). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Different considerations apply between pre and post-judgment situations. In a post-judgment context, it is just and convenient that the judgment creditor should normally have all the information needed to levy execution of the judgment anywhere in the world (per Colman J in <span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme Shipping </span>at p 312EF). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG </span>[2014] 3 SLR 166 that “[t]he language of s 4(10) of the [CLA] is very similar to that of s 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981” (at [44]). It has been recognised that s 4(10) of the CLA is the source of the statutory power to grant interlocutory relief, including Mareva injunctions (see [45]). Thus, the power to grant disclosure orders ancillary to a Mareva injunction, like the power to grant a Mareva injunction, originates from s 4(10) of the CLA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I set out the various orders of the Mareva injunction granted on 24 September 2019:

I elaborate below at [91]–[108] on how the Disclosure Orders were necessary to police the Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The next point is that the present case was unlike both<span class="font-italic"> Wallace </span>and <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>. The present case involved disclosure orders granted at a late stage in the proceedings, after liability had been established but before damages had been assessed. Both the disclosure orders in <span class="font-italic">Wallace </span>and <span class="font-italic">Petromar </span>had been granted at an early stage of proceedings. Further, there was no indication, as in <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>, that the disclosure orders were sought for an extraneous purpose. In my judgment, the primary reason the respondents sought the accompanying disclosure orders was to police the Mareva injunction. Further, unlike <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>, the disclosure orders here were granted only after four <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>hearings. Parties here had every opportunity to be heard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The respondents had claimed that the quantum of the total assets ordered to be disclosed far exceeded the contingent liability that was due as a result of the liability judgment. As a general rule, a defendant will be required to make disclosure of <span class="font-italic">all </span>its assets even though the assets restrained are limited to those of a certain value (<span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks </span>at [52]). There was no reason to depart from this general rule. It was also observed in <span class="font-italic">Motorola Credit Corporation v Cem Cegiz Uzan</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2003] EWCA Civ 752 (“<span class="font-italic">Motorola Credit Corporation</span>”) that a defendant is ordinarily required to disclose all its assets above a certain value. Otherwise, a defendant may selectively pick which assets to disclose. In doing so, the defendant may choose to disclose assets that are the least available or accessible to the claimant for the purpose of execution (<span class="font-italic">Motorola Credit Corporation</span> at [146]). This was something that I bore in mind when granting the Disclosure Orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 SEPPL’s assets were listed in Mr Peloso’s affidavit in support of its JM application (see above at [11]), but these consisted only of two patents and a sum of money. Moreover, there was no valuation attached to these two patents. Further, the respondents failed to point to the existence of any other liquid assets in Mr Peloso’s fourth affidavit. This case was unlike <span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks</span>, where the defendants had at least provided partial disclosure indicating the availability of a certain amount of assets. Here, it was <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> at all known</span> whether there would be sufficient assets to satisfy the contingent liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the alternative, I was of the view that, as in <span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme </span><span class="font-italic">Shipping</span>, all of the Disclosure Orders were justified as <span class="font-italic">aid</span><span class="font-italic">s to execution</span>. First, very little information was provided on the quantum and location of the respondents’ assets, either in Singapore or worldwide. Second, the respondents’ conduct in the Kashish matter, as well as Mr Peloso’s flippant attitude towards an order of court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the RCMA Injunction, suggested a substantial risk that the respondents would take evasive steps to avoid execution. I have also highlighted above at [19]–[51] other matters (evidencing a real risk of dissipation) which indicated that there would be difficulties in execution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Worldwide Disclosure Order </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The scope of the Worldwide Disclosure Order was necessary to police the Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I noted above at [68] the general observation in <span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks </span>that a plaintiff is given no interest, security or priority in the assets that are the subject of a Mareva injunction. It follows from this that the only way for a disclosure order to assist in the effective enforcement of a Mareva injunction is for the plaintiff to be given sufficient information about the location and details of the assets. Therefore, where the court grants disclosure orders covering the same assets that are restrained under the Mareva injunction, such disclosure orders are regarded as normal. Two decisions illustrated this point. The first is <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>, where the court had directed that disclosure be made in respect of the defendants’ worldwide assets after a worldwide Mareva injunction was imposed (at [6]). The second is <span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan </span><span class="font-italic">@ Lu Yan v Lim Tien Chiang and others </span>[2019] SGHC 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan</span>”), in which Choo Han Teck J granted a worldwide disclosure order to accompany the worldwide Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Upon examining Orders 1(a)(i) and 1(a)(ii) of the Mareva injunction and the Worldwide Disclosure Order, it can be seen that both sets of orders refer to assets “in or outside Singapore, whether in [the respondents’] own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned, and whether the [respondents] are interested in them legally, beneficially or otherwise” and assets which the respondents “have the power, directly or indirectly, to dispose of or deal with as if it were its own”. The only difference between the assets restrained under Orders 1(a)(i) and (ii) and those subject of the disclosure obligations in the Worldwide Disclosure Order was that Orders 1(a)(i) and (ii) restrained movement of assets up to the sum of S$1,853,795.95 (see also Order 1(d)) while the Worldwide Disclosure Order required the respondents to disclose all their assets (unlimited by any sum). As I have pointed out above, there is a general rule that a defendant will be required to make disclosure of <span class="font-italic">all </span>its assets even though the assets restrained are limited to a certain value (<span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks </span>at [52]). Cogent reasons were provided by Ang SJ to justify this general position (see <span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks </span>at [45]–[52]). It remained necessary for the Worldwide Disclosure Order to be unrestricted by a fixed sum in order to police the accompanying Mareva injunction. It must also be highlighted that the orders granted in both <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har </span>and <span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan </span>were not  restricted to a fixed sum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Given the width of the Mareva injunction, I found that the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders did not go beyond the assets restrained, and were therefore necessary for its policing. The width of the Mareva injunction becomes apparent upon examination of its precise terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Order 1(a)(ii) restrained the respondents from disposing of assets “whether in their own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned up to the [value of S$1,853,795.95] and <span class="font-italic">whether the [respondents] are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">interested</span><span class="font-italic"> in them </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legally, beneficially or otherwise</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>… For the purpose of this Order, <span class="font-italic">the [respondents</span><span class="font-italic">’] assets include any asset in which [the respondents] have the power, directly or indirectly, to dispose of or deal with as if it were their own.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[respondents] are to be regarded as having such a power if a third party holds or controls the asset in accordance with its direct or indirect instructions</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I have noted above at [9] that Order 1(a)(ii) was not being challenged in the application for leave to appeal. I highlight two cases that illustrate the wide-ranging nature of this type of order. <span class="font-italic">JSC BTA Bank v Solodchenko</span> and others [2010] EWCA Civ 1436 (“<span class="font-italic">Solodchenko</span>”) held that the formulation “legally, beneficially or otherwise” covered assets which are held by the defendant as a trustee or nominee for a third party (see also Prakash J in<span class="font-italic"> STX Corp v Jason Surjana Tanuwidjaja and others </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1261 at [20]). In <span class="font-italic">JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov (No 10) </span>[2015] UKSC 64, the defendant had entered into a number of unsecured loan agreements providing for large sums of money to be made available to him. Although these borrowings would not have been covered under the standard form of a freezing order, the inclusion of the phrase “[f]or the purpose of this Order the [defendant’s] assets include any asset which they have power, indirectly or indirectly, to dispose of, or deal with as if it were their own” in the terms of the freezing order granted meant that they were now covered. <span class="font-italic">The upshot of this is that </span><span class="font-italic">the respondents are restrained from disposing of a wide range of assets under Order 1(a)(ii)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In brief, the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders required the respondents to disclose the reasons SEPPL transferred a sum of about S$6 million from the joint OCBC Account to the DBS Account, as well as full details of SEPPL’s trading losses with Kashish, and how Kashish came to find out about the details of the sum of money in SEPPL’s DBS Account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 On the basis of the available evidence, which consisted of an Order of Court dated 4 February 2019

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mr Peloso’s 4th Affidavit, p 382. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> and correspondence between SEPPL and Kashish’s solicitors on the alleged claims under the CFDs, I was not convinced that SEPPL <span class="font-italic">genuinely</span> owed a sum of money to Kashish. In the circumstances, it may be inferred that the respondents were “interested in [the approximately S$6 million] … <span class="font-italic">beneficially or otherwise</span>”. There was admittedly a degree of evidential difficulty involved in ascertaining the precise nature of this interest. The S$6 million could have been “transferred” to Kashish through the garnishment process with the intention on SEPPL’s part to retain a beneficial interest in the sums under the trust. On the basis of the affidavit evidence, I was satisfied that there was at least a “good arguable” case that the money belonged beneficially to SEPPL. Thus, the Kashish and RCMA Disclosure Orders were co-extensive with the assets restrained under Order 1(a)(ii). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Order 1(a)(ii) also restrained the movement of assets that a third party controlled on the direct or indirect instructions of the respondents. Based on the suspicious circumstances that I have described above (at [20]–[37]), I was of the view that, in the alternative, there was a “good arguable” case that the $6 million was directly or indirectly controlled by the respondents. In requiring the respondents to disclose the “full details” of what happened to the approximately S$6 million, as well as the reasons for the transfer of the $6m, the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders did not go further than the Mareva injunction. <span class="font-italic">Put differently, t</span><span class="font-italic">he two Disclosure Orders did not require the respondents to provide information regarding assets that were not already the subject of the Mareva injunction</span>. It was therefore necessary to make the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders for the applicants to police the Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In addition, I reiterate the principle in <span class="font-italic">Gidrxslme Shipping</span> that while a disclosure order in support of a pre-judgment Mareva is usually coextensive with the scope of a Mareva injunction, this is not necessarily the case for post-judgment disclosure orders. I have explained that the Disclosure Orders were granted as aids to execution (see above at [90]). It follows that <span class="font-italic">e</span><span class="font-italic">ven if</span> the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders were <span class="font-italic">broader </span>than the Mareva injunction, they were justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 There were other reasons why I believed the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders to be justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Apart from the standard disclosure orders, the court has the power to make additional orders against a party that is the subject of a Mareva injunction to give discovery and answer interrogatories. The disclosure orders assist in, among other things, (a) determining the existence, nature and location of the respondents’ assets or of proceeds of fraud; and (b) clarifying questions of title concerning assets (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span> vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2020)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 29/1/69; see also <span class="font-italic">Civil Procedure: Volume II </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) at para 15-74). Although the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders were labelled as “disclosure” orders, they were also in effect interrogatories. In my judgment, both orders were necessary to achieve the above two objectives, given the evidential difficulty in determining the nature of the interest in the S$6 million that was garnished by Kashish.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan</span>, the plaintiff had opened a private wealth account with BNP Paribas and sought to transfer US$3m in RMB from her personal RMB account in China to one of her personal bank accounts in Singapore through the assistance of the defendants. As it turned out, the bulk of the plaintiff’s money disappeared (at [11]) and the plaintiff accordingly sought various orders pending trial. The plaintiff was granted a Worldwide Mareva injunction (at [14]). Crucially, the defendants were made to state on affidavit what had happened to the money initially transferred to their bank accounts (at [14(c)]). This question was presumably to assist in determining the location of the plaintiff’s assets to aid the policing of the Mareva injunction. In my judgment, the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders served a similar function. They were directed at determining the location of assets that potentially fell within the scope of the Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 <span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan </span>illustrates another important point. Choo J had found a “real risk” of dissipation of assets. He inferred this from the fact that the entire sum of S$3m had been dissipated through the bank accounts of all the defendants and someone known as “Allan”. He also found the explanations given by the defendants to be “inadequate and unconvincing” (at [12]). In making the disclosure order directed at finding out information about the missing S$3m, the court was in effect granting an ancillary disclosure order that sought to determine the true state of affairs as regards the circumstances which led to its finding of a “real risk” of dissipation. In this case, I have set out above at [19]–[51] the matters leading to my determination that there was a “real risk” of dissipation. This included the RCMA Injunction and involvement of Kashish. As in the disclosure order in <span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>both the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders were directed at finding out further information that formed the basis of my finding of a “real risk” of dissipation. Hence, I was of the view that the making of the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders was justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Finally, it must be noted that both Orders were not onerous obligations. The Orders required only information readily available and entirely within Mr Peloso’s personal knowledge. After all, Mr Peloso had acknowledged that he had provided Kashish with the DBS Account number from which the sum of money was garnished. No prejudice would be occasioned if the respondents were required to comply with the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders. Both orders must be seen in the light of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the transfer of money from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account, as well as the insufficient evidence concerning Kashish. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">FSC Disclosure Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The facts concerning the FSC Payments have been set above at [20]–[21]. The FSC Disclosure Order required the respondents to provide full details of what had happened to SEPPL’s share of the FSC Payments received in the OCBC Account and, where the payments had been transferred out of the account, various details surrounding those transfers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The FSC Disclosure Order was necessary to police the Mareva injunction. As I have pointed out above at [96], Orders 1(a)(i) and 1(a)(ii) encompassed a very broad range of assets. Like the assets ordered to be disclosed pursuant to the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders, the assets under the FSC Disclosure Order fell within the scope of Order 1(a)(ii). Further, like all of the above Disclosure Orders, this order was also justified as an aid to execution. Given my finding that some of the FSC Payments had been transferred in anticipation of execution, it was necessary for me to make this order.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Acquisition Disclosure Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Acquisition Disclosure Order required the respondents to inform the applicants two weeks in advance of executing any definitive agreements in respect of the foreign investor’s proposed acquisition of the majority stake in SEEAPL. The Mareva injunction granted contained an exception, such that the respondents were not prohibited from proceeding with and completing the proposed acquisition involving SEEAPL’s shares. This <span class="font-italic">proviso </span>was granted to permit the sale of SEEAPL’s majority stake and allow the Enjoined Sum to be paid into court (see above at [53]). Under the Mareva injunction, the respondents were required to furnish notice to the applicants within two business days once a definitive agreement has been signed and after completion has taken place. The Acquisition Disclosure Order required notice before the execution of any definitive agreements. It was only right that notice also be provided before any agreements were signed. If something was amiss (for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, if it appeared that the impending sale was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>), the applicants could take the necessary steps to protect their interests. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-compliance with the Practice Directions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The respondents submitted that the Disclosure Orders were wider than the orders set out in Form 7 of Appendix A of the PD. According to para 42(3) of the PD, Form 7 must be used unless the Court considers that there is “good reason” for adopting a different form. Based on the reasons set out above at [85]–[108], I was of the view that there were good reasons for the departure from the usual form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Paragraph 42(3) of the PD also provides that any departure from the terms of the prescribed form (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Form 7) should be justified by the applicant in its supporting affidavit. While the applicants did not specify precisely why each and every departure from Form 7 was justified, it was in my judgment clear from Mr Chan’s affidavit why the applicants had thought that the additional disclosure orders, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the FSC, RCMA, Kashish and Acquisition Disclosure Orders, were justified. I also noted that such disclosure orders requiring the disclosure of parties’ beneficial assets (similar to Order 1(a)(ii)) have been granted before (see <span class="font-italic">Lyu Yan </span>at [14(b)]; <span class="font-italic">Solodchenko </span>at [46]; see also <span class="font-italic">STX Corp </span>at [20] per Prakash J).

A hearing was fixed for 5 December 2019. On this date, counsel for the applicants, Ms Sia, informed me that the applicants had discovered that assets had been dissipated in breach of the Mareva injunction. Ms Sia sought to tender an affidavit detailing the same. I allowed the admission of the affidavit. I also permitted the respondents to file a reply affidavit and adjourned the hearing to 17 December 2019. Both parties filed written submissions on the question of leave to appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 On 17 December 2019, I refused the respondents’ application for leave to appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The principles for granting leave to appeal are well established (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew</span>”) at [16]).

</div>
</div> This was for the following reasons. The respondents argued that the Disclosure Orders substantially departed from the standard form set out in Form 7 of the PD. As I have explained, each of the Disclosure Orders was co-extensive with the assets restrained under the Mareva injunction. In particular, Orders 1(a)(i) and 1(a)(ii) restrained the respondents from removing their assets on a <span class="font-italic">worldwide</span> basis. As an additional ground, disclosure orders granted ancillary to a <span class="font-italic">post</span>-judgment Mareva injunction served a secondary purpose of acting as <span class="font-italic">aid</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> to execution. Thus, the Disclosure Orders were also justified on this basis. As for the point on the departure from Form 7 of the PD, there was nothing which prevented me from departing from Form 7, so long as I was of the view that there were good reasons to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 During the hearing, counsel for the respondents, Ms Eden Li (“Ms Li”), submitted that there had been an erroneous exercise of discretion in granting the Worldwide Disclosure Order as one of the entities in the SE Group, SEEAPL, had assets that substantially exceeded the Enjoined Sum.

</div>
</div> In my view, the “Independent Practitioner’s Review”, which Ms Li relied on, was cynically redacted to avoid scrutiny of the true financial health of SEEAPL. In any case, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Sea Trucks </span>required a party subject to a Mareva injunction to make disclosure of <span class="font-italic">all </span>its assets even though the assets restrained are limited to those of a certain value (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Second, the respondents submitted that there was a question of general principle to be decided for the first time and a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, both limbs (b) and (c) of the test in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew</span>). The question posed was this: in circumstances where non-parties to the underlying suit have been joined solely for the purposes of injunctive relief, what is the precise scope of ancillary disclosure orders that can and should be granted against such non-parties?

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In my view, this submission was unmeritorious. I noted that the respondents did not challenge the court’s power or jurisdiction<span class="font-italic"> </span>to make disclosure orders against third parties. Although the respondents’ question was couched as one of general principle, it appeared, on closer inspection, to be a fact-specific one. The question was formulated as “what is the <span class="font-italic">precise scope</span>” of the ancillary disclosure order (where third parties have been joined to the suit for injunctive relief). Naturally, the determination of the scope of the disclosure orders was fundamentally a fact-sensitive exercise, depending on the overall circumstances of each case. The guiding principle in determining the width of an ancillary disclosure order is whether it is necessary to police the accompanying Mareva injunction. This was well established by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>and <span class="font-italic">Petromar</span>. I also observed that wide-ranging disclosure orders have been directed against third parties before. In <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>, the third party wife had been required to file an affidavit setting out her assets, whether located in Singapore or elsewhere, under the terms of the worldwide Mareva injunction (at [6]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span> made clear that the court may direct a third party to provide information on all of its assets both in Singapore and worldwide if there is a Mareva injunction in place (at [6]).

This was an alternative reason to the reason stated at [119] for dismissing the application for leave to appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The orders were, on a literal reading, directed at all of the respondents (Order 1(b) of the Disclosure Orders). However, they were in substance and in effect directed at <span class="font-italic">SEPPL</span>. This was because it was <span class="font-italic">SEPPL </span>that possessed the information relating to the FSC, RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders. The FSC Disclosure Order directed information to be provided on affidavit regarding what had happened to <span class="font-italic">SEPPL’s </span>share of the FSC Payments. Likewise, the RCMA and Kashish Disclosure Orders required SEPPL to provide information about why the approximately S$6m was taken out of <span class="font-italic">SEPPL’s </span>account and how and why <span class="font-italic">SEPPL </span>had incurred losses with Kashish. There was only <span class="font-italic">one </span>situation in which an order was directed at the third party entities. If and when the FSC Payments that had been received in the OCBC Account were transferred by SEPPL into another bank account, the respondents (including SEPPL) would be obliged to disclose, to the best of their knowledge and belief, whether those sums remained in the bank accounts to which the FSC Payments had been transferred to and whether those sums had been further transferred into another bank account; if so, the date of the transfer and details of the account to which the transfer had been made, or whether those sums had been used in any other manner and if so, the purpose of usage. Thus, save for this limited scenario, the question of the precise scope of the disclosure orders directed against third parties did not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Given the above, there was no question of general principle to be decided for the first time or question of general importance upon which further argument would be to the public advantage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I also add that the evidence indicated that the respondents were dragging their feet in an attempt to avoid complying with the Disclosure Orders.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Two cases are instructive on the question of whether a stay should be granted in cases involving disclosure orders that are ancillary to a Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The first is the decision by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Buhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 74 (“<span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>”). The defendants had affirmed two sets of affidavits in compliance with disclosure orders that were granted ancillary to a Mareva injunction. The plaintiffs applied to cross-examine the defendants on their affidavits. This order was granted. The defendants appealed against Ang J’s order for cross-examination and sought a stay of the said order. She refused to stay the hearing of the application to cross-examine the defendants pending the determination of the appeal. Recognising that a Mareva injunction would not be effective without disclosure, she held that the prejudice to the defendants would be “of a lesser order than the prejudice that the plaintiffs may suffer if they are unable to police the Mareva order for some time”. At [46]–[47], Ang J stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 I accept that an order for cross-examination before the appeal is determined is potentially prejudicial to the defendants. If the defendants are successful in their appeal, they would have been subjected to cross-examination on affidavits of assets which would have been wrongly ordered. Above all, it would not be possible to undo and put right the invasion of their privacy. Damage would have been done if the order for cross-examination had been complied with before the appeal to set aside the order was heard.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 Whilst the defendants may have some prospect of success on appeal the plaintiffs have, on the other hand, put up a good arguable case on fraud and dissipation of assets. Unfairness lies only in the possibility that the claim may be ill-founded, and I have taken this into account in my assessment of the merits of the plaintiffs’ application to cross-examine. If their claim and hence the order for a worldwide injunction turns out to be ill-founded, the defendants will be able to recover their costs and damages suffered, if any, from the undertaking as to damages which the plaintiffs have been ordered to fortify. Weighing all the factors, there are grounds for saying that whilst the prejudice alluded to by Mr Sreenivasan is not illusory, the prejudice to the defendants is of a lesser order than the prejudice that the plaintiffs may suffer if they are unable to police the Mareva order for some time. It is an imposition to subject a defendant to cross-examination, but a Mareva injunction in normal circumstances simply cannot be effective without that disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It has been remarked that cross-examination is a powerful and valuable weapon for testing the veracity of a witness (<span class="font-italic">Mechanical and General Inventions Company, Limited and Lehwess v Austin and the Austin Motor Company, Limited </span>[1935] 1 AC 346 at 359). Multiple and sometimes probing questions are directed at the deponent of the affidavit. It may be said that an order for cross-examination is more invasive than an order requiring disclosure to be made on affidavit. Thus, the degree of prejudice that may potentially be faced by the respondents here, who are only required to satisfy disclosure obligations, was of a lesser degree than what the defendants in <span class="font-italic">OCM </span><span class="font-italic">Opportunities</span> experienced. Moreover, unlike <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>, the claim here has already been established and the Mareva injunction was not the subject of a challenge. Given the absence of a challenge to the Mareva injunction, there was no risk that the Mareva injunction might be lifted such that there would no longer be a need for ancillary disclosure obligations. The main thrust of the respondents’ submissions for leave to appeal was that the disclosure obligations were too wide, and <span class="font-italic">not </span>that the orders were entirely defective. As a result, even if an appeal was allowed against the disclosure orders, there would only be a change in their scope. This was a factor that I took into account in determining the degree of prejudice the respondents were likely to suffer if a stay of execution was refused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Another weighty factor that I took into account was the importance of the Disclosure Orders in ensuring that the applicants could police the Mareva injunction. In this regard, the second decision to consider was <span class="font-italic">Motorola Credit Corporation v Cem Cegiz Uzan </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 989. The defendant applied to set aside the worldwide freezing order and a stay of the disclosure orders. Justice Waller refused the stay of the ancillary disclosure orders. His reasoning centred on the importance of disclosure orders in policing the accompanying freezing order. He explained at [27]–[29]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[27] … But the fact that <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">making of a disclosure order is a very important part of the Mareva jurisdiction is made clear in a number of authorities</span><span class="font-weight-bold">,</span> the most helpful of which so far as this case is concerned is <span class="font-italic">Grupo Torras SA v Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al-Sabah</span> (CA, 16.2.94) … That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. There are helpful dicta of Steyn LJ when he identified the submissions of Mr Andrew Smith QC (as he then was) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[28] Steyn LJ also recognised that undoubtedly there would be prejudice to the Sheikh in that case if he was forced to disclose his assets and ultimately managed to set aside the proceedings for want of jurisdiction, but Steyn LJ emphasised that that was not anywhere near as much prejudice as would be suffered if the claimant was unable to police the Mareva injunction for some time. The emphasis in that case, as has been the emphasise [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in this case by Mr Cran, is that whereas at first sight it looks as though the court in dealing with suspending the supply of this information for only a short period of time, that is until the hearing of the summons to set aside the freezing order on 17 July, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the reality is that that decision is likely to be appealed to the Court of Appeal, and indeed it may well go to the House of Lords. The reality is that if it were suspended now, it would be suspended for a very great period of time</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[29] … The factors that weigh with me are these. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First, although it is an invasion of privacy to force any party to disclose assets, a freezing order in normal circumstances simply cannot be effective without that disclosure.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Once one has the situation which did exist in this case, which was that on 13 June it was accepted that the freezing order should continue, then prima facie David Steel J is right in saying that a disclosure provision would be the normal provision so that that freezing order can be properly policed and be effective.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 While I accepted that any stay, if granted in this case, would not operate for as long as it might in England (assuming that an appeal was allowed sometime in the future), the fact remained that the Disclosure Orders were necessary for the applicants here to police the Mareva injunction. As stated by Waller J, a Mareva injunction “simply <span class="font-italic">cannot be effective</span> without [the accompanying] disclosure” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Further, the need to <span class="font-italic">police </span>the Mareva injunction assumed heightened importance in this case because of the troubling matters disclosed in Mr Chan’s affidavit tendered on 5 December 2019. In summary, the evidence showed that Mr Peloso had diluted his shareholdings in SEPL. It was thus necessary for the stay to be refused to prevent possible future breaches of the Mareva injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Given that the respondents had thus far failed to comply with the Disclosure Orders, the applicants resorted to a more rudimentary method of “policing” the Mareva injunction. According to the applicants, they did this by carrying out business profile searches of the applicants from time to time.
