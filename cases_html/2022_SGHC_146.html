Indeed, reliance by the courts on sentencing precedents to arrive at consistent and fair outcomes is a core feature of sentencing practice in Singapore. Yet, the value of each sentencing precedent depends on a whole host of factors and it is important for the courts to bear this in mind when deciding on whether to rely on a particular precedent and if so, to what extent. The present appeal examines some of the principles engaged when assessing the value of sentencing precedents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellant pleaded guilty to four charges in the court below, three of which were in respect of offences under s 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and one in respect of an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code. She also consented to the remaining six charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Of these, five were in respect of offences under s 468 and the remaining one under s 420. The District Judge (“DJ”) imposed a global sentence of 35 months’ imprisonment. The DJ’s grounds of decision may be found in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Jennifer </span><span class="font-italic">Toh Suat Leng </span>[2022] SGDC 16 (“GD”).

At the material time, the appellant was working as an insurance agent for AIA Singapore (“AIA”). In that capacity, the appellant became acquainted with Wong, who was a client of AIA. Sometime in 2015, the appellant sold Wong an AIA policy. As the appellant was indebted to various unlicensed moneylenders at the time, she decided to hatch a plan to forge an AIA insurance policy to obtain more money from Wong.

Thus, where an offender is labouring under a psychiatric condition at the time of the commission of an offence, this may in some circumstances be of mitigating value, reducing the force of general deterrence. In <span class="font-italic">Ng So </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 178, Yong Pung How CJ (“Yong CJ”) made the following observations at [58]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the element of general deterrence can and should be given considerably less weight if the offender was suffering from a mental disorder <span class="font-italic">at the time of the commission of the offence</span>. This is particularly so if there is a causal link between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence. In addition to the need for a causal link, other factors such as the seriousness of the mental condition, the likelihood of the appellant repeating the offence and the severity of the crime, are factors which have to be taken into account by the sentencing judge. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To my mind, the DJ was plainly correct to find that there was no evidence before the court that the appellant was suffering from a MDD at the time the present offences were committed. Neither was there any evidence that the appellant’s MDD was causally linked to the commission of the offences.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, this conclusion was based on the medical reports from IMH and SGH, both of which diagnosed the appellant with a MDD <span class="font-italic">after</span> the commission of the offences. Dr Tan did not indicate anywhere in the Report that the appellant was suffering from a MDD <span class="font-italic">at the time of the commission</span> of the present offences. I am thus unable to draw a conclusion from the Report that the appellant was suffering from a MDD at the relevant time. In <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> at [119], the Court of Appeal stated that “if the psychiatric report appears ‘contrived and flimsy’, or the psychiatric report does not show that the offender is ‘suffering from a clearly diagnosed and recognised psychiatric disorder’, the court will be justified in rejecting the evidence of the offender’s purported mental condition”. In my view, the Report is wholly lacking. Without a proper diagnosis that the appellant was labouring under a MDD at the time of the commission of the offences, the DJ was fully entitled to find that there was insufficient evidence to form such a conclusion and therefore no mitigating weight ought to be accorded to the appellant’s MDD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In any event, even if I accept that the Report did properly diagnose the appellant with a MDD at the time of the commission of the offences (which for the reasons above, I do not), I am of the view that the Report does not establish a relevant causal link between the appellant’s MDD and the commission of the offences. Under the section in the Report titled “Opinions”, Dr Tan opined that it was “<span class="font-italic">unlikely</span> that [the appellant] might have committed the stated offences wilfully” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div> Dr Tan’s opinion in the Report is tentative and unspecific. His suggestion that the appellant was “unlikely” to have committed the offences wilfully is ambiguous; it does not establish a clear causal link between the appellant’s MDD and her commission of the offences. Further, his observations regarding how a typical person who suffers from a MDD would behave is unhelpful in ascertaining how the appellant <span class="font-italic">herself</span> was affected by the MDD. Even where reference was made specifically to the appellant, Dr Tan’s comments were tentative and merely suggested that as a result of the MDD, the appellant’s decision making could have been <span class="font-italic">potentially</span> coloured by negative perceptions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The appellant’s bare assertion that she had a MDD at the time of the commission of the offences is insufficient for any mitigating weight to be accorded to her MDD. Therefore, in my view, the DJ was right not to have regard to the appellant’s MDD in her consideration of the appropriate sentence to impose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appellant’s personal circumstances and background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The appellant also submits that the DJ erred in failing to consider her personal circumstances and background which led to the commission of the offences. She urges the court to take into account her challenging childhood which was marred by abuse and a constant fear of harassment by unlicensed moneylenders whom her father had borrowed moneys from. This childhood fear manifested once again at the time of the offences as her husband had accumulated a massive amount of debt owing to his gambling habits. In order to help pay off her husband’s mounting debt, the appellant began obtaining loans from unlicensed moneylenders. However, when she defaulted on her payments, these unlicensed moneylenders began to harass her and her family, including her two sons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is trite that financial difficulties are not to be regarded as mitigating factors, save for exceptional circumstances: see <span class="font-italic">Lai</span><span class="font-italic"> Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10]. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Bee Ngan Karen v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1120 at [73], Chao Hick Tin JA (“Chao JA”) noted that the “court should examine the motivation behind the offence, and if the offence was prompted by personal hardship caused by factors beyond the offender’s control, such mitigating circumstances <span class="font-italic">may</span>, in appropriate cases, be looked upon more favourably and given due consideration” [emphasis in original]. While I am sympathetic to the appellant’s personal circumstances, I am not satisfied that the appellant’s present offences were prompted by personal hardship caused by factors beyond her control. The appellant had made the voluntary decision to borrow from unlicensed moneylenders despite being acutely aware of the dangers of doing so. She could have availed herself of other legal means of settling her husband’s gambling debts. I accept that the appellant had not borrowed from the unlicensed moneylenders because of her own faults, but had done so in order to pay off the debts incurred by her husband’s gambling habits. Nevertheless, the main motivation behind the commission of the offences was the appellant’s desire to repay the unlicensed moneylenders who were harassing her and her family, which was ultimately borne out of her own conscious decision to borrow from them while cognisant of the likely consequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I am therefore of the view that no mitigating weight should be accorded to her personal circumstances in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General principles concerning the use of sentencing precedents </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Before I consider the appropriateness of the individual sentences imposed for the proceeded charges, I first set out some of the established general principles concerning the use of sentencing precedents by the courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Sentencing precedents function as an aid so that consistency in sentencing may be maintained: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 at [45]. However, it has been cautioned that they serve as mere guidelines only. In <span class="font-italic">Soong Hee Sin v Public Prosecutor </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 475 at [12], this court stressed that “every case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances, and counsel be kept constantly and keenly apprised of the fact that it is just not possible to categorise cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points”. The truth of this should not be understated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 No two cases are ever alike. The value of a particular sentencing precedent in determining the sentence to be imposed in a subsequent case is ultimately dependent on the degree of factual similarity between the two cases, including the offence-specific and offender-specific factors identified. Making bare references to outcomes in precedent cases without consideration of the detailed reasoning leading to those outcomes is ultimately an unproductive exercise.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentence for the s 468 of the Penal Code charges </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I now address the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the individual s 468 charges. In this regard, it is apposite to first consider the significance of the increase in the maximum penalties for the offence introduced in the 2008 Revised Edition of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The punishment provision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, the appellant was charged with offences under the 2008 Revised Edition of the Penal Code. Prior to the amendments introduced by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51 of 2007) (“PCAA”), the maximum imprisonment term provided for an offence under s 468 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“1985 Penal Code”) was seven years’ imprisonment. The current iteration of s 468 of the Penal Code provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever commits forgery, intending that the document or electronic record forged shall be used for the purpose of cheating, shall be punished with <span class="font-italic">imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years</span>, and shall also be liable to fine. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The increase in the maximum sentence of an offence is an indication that Parliament intended that the offence should thereafter attract heavier sentences, and the courts should reflect that intention in their sentencing decisions: see <span class="font-italic">Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 627 at [28]. However, as Chao JA went on to add, such a change does not automatically or inexorably have a conclusive effect in raising the punishments for such offences especially when Parliament states otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Proposals to enhance the maximum imprisonment terms for a number of offences including s 468 were discussed during the Second Reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 38/2007). Parliament cited the prevalence and seriousness of the offences, and the proportionality of the punishments to the offences, as reasons for enhancing the prescribed punishments for those offences (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(23 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2436 (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee (“Assoc Prof Ho”))). However, Assoc Prof Ho went on to explain that these increased maximum sentences would not automatically result in an increase in the punishments meted out by the courts (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(23 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2439): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… when Mr Lim Biow Chuan asks whether what we have done will lead automatically to fines or punishments going up[,] I do not think so. He has mentioned, for example, the benchmarks, the sentencing guidelines, that the courts have. <span class="font-italic">I think the guidelines will continue</span>. It does not mean that automatically when the maximum punishment is raised, the punishment will go up. Because every punishment must depend on the facts of the case. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To my mind, some weight should still be accorded to the increase in the maximum sentence for s 468 offences in order to give effect to the legislative intent of deterring potential offenders on account of the seriousness and prevalence of the offence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assessment of the sentencing precedents cited by the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 With the general principles concerning the use of sentencing precedents set out at [32]–[34] above in mind, I now turn to assess the sentencing precedents cited by the parties in the court below and in this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the court below, the DJ had made reference to a number of sentencing precedents cited by the parties. The Prosecution in this appeal also highlight additional precedents to support its submission that the sentence imposed by the DJ is not manifestly excessive. I now analyse these precedents in greater detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The DJ first considered the benchmark sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment set out in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ek Kian</span> as a useful starting point for the present offences. In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ek Kian</span>, the offender was convicted after trial on a single charge under s 468 of the 1985 Penal Code. The offender was the managing director of a car distributor. He had forged signatures on transfer forms and presented them to an officer of the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”), to deceive the LTA into transferring rebates from one customer to another. The amount involved was $9,237. The High Court noted the aggravating factors identified by the court below, namely that the fraud was a serious one that had adversely affected confidence in the integrity of the system of vehicle registration in Singapore and was practised on a statutory body no less (at [33]). The offender had also abused the position of trust he was in vis-à-vis the car buyers. In dismissing the offender’s appeal against the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed by the lower court, Yong CJ observed at [35] that the courts have always treated offences under s 468 seriously, and past cases had adopted a “12 month sentence of imprisonment as a benchmark”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 However, as the Prosecution duly notes, this benchmark sentence was observed in the context of s 468 of the 1985 Penal Code, which carried a maximum term of seven years’ imprisonment.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, the precedential value of sentencing precedents relating to an earlier version of the same offence with a different prescribed punishment is somewhat attenuated, although they may still serve as a point of reference. Moreover, as I stated above at [37], some weight should be accorded to the increase in the maximum sentence for s 468 offences to reflect Parliament’s views on the gravity of such offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Furthermore, with respect, I am of the view that the benchmark sentence set out in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ek Kian</span> is nonetheless of limited utility. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 at [28], the Court of Appeal remarked that the single starting point approach would be most suitable where the offence in question almost invariably manifests itself in a particular way and the range of sentencing considerations is circumscribed. In my assessment, the single starting point approach is inappropriate for offences of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code. There is simply no paradigmatic manifestation of the offence for which a notional starting-point sentence may be purposefully calibrated. It is clear even on the face of the Penal Code provisions alone that an offence under s 468 may be perpetrated in a diverse range of circumstances. Indeed, “cheating” itself manifests in several different ways as listed in s 415 of the Penal Code. Nonetheless, I agree with the observation by the court in <span class="font-italic">Lim</span><span class="font-italic"> Ek Kian </span>(at [35]) that offences under s 468 of the Penal Code are serious offences that should be visited with a strong response by the courts. I should also make clear that nothing I have said about the utility of the benchmark sentence in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ek Kian</span> detracts from its relevance as a sentencing precedent in its own right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Next, the DJ also had regard to the two District Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Choy </span><span class="font-italic">Yut Hong</span> and <span class="font-italic">Tang Wai Kit</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Choy </span><span class="font-italic">Yut Hong</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to seven charges, four of which were under s 468 of the Penal Code and the remaining three were under s 420 of the Penal Code. An additional 42 similar charges were taken into consideration. The offences, which were committed between 13 June 2008 and 1 April 2012, related to a rental scam orchestrated by the offender who was a property agent at the material time. The total amount involved was $546,012. In relation to the proceeded s 468 charges, the offender created and forged signatures on various separate tenancy agreements with the tenants and landlords, deceiving tenants of four condominiums into believing that if they paid the total rent upfront, they would be able to stay rent-free for six months out of a 24-month lease period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The offender was sentenced to a total of 60 months’ imprisonment. The individual sentence for one of the proceeded charges involving $50,400 was 15 months’ imprisonment. The appeal against the decision was dismissed by the High Court. In arriving at the individual sentences to be imposed, the District Judge took into consideration the following factors: (a) the amount involved; (b) the offender’s abuse of his position as a property agent; (c) the premeditated nature of the offence; (d) the large number of victims involved; (e) the offender’s post-arrest offending; (f) the offender’s plea of guilt (which was accorded lesser weight in view of the fact that he had absconded after his first arrest and had committed subsequent offences); and (g) the offender’s minimal restitution of $900 (see <span class="font-italic">Choy </span><span class="font-italic">Yut Hong</span> at [43]–[49]). As the s 468 charges related to separate properties and were therefore separate and distinct offences, the District Judge ordered three of the sentences for the seven proceeded charges to run consecutively, which she considered to be proportionate to the overall offending (see <span class="font-italic">Choy </span><span class="font-italic">Yut Hong</span> at [55]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Tang Wai Kit</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to six charges – four charges under s 468 and two charges under s 420 of the Penal Code. Eleven other similar charges were taken into consideration. At the material time, the offender was employed as an assistant sales manager of a company trading in industrial chemicals and plastic products. In respect of the s 468 charges, the offender had forged a purchase order and multiple delivery orders in order to cheat other employees of the company, thereby inducing them to make various payments, a large proportion of which were ultimately diverted to the offender. The total amount involved was $1.59m. The offender was sentenced to a total of 84 months’ imprisonment. In particular, the Prosecution highlights the sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment imposed for the s 468 charge involving an amount of $26,910.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  PS at [28]. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Curiously, the District Judge in <span class="font-italic">Tang Wai </span><span class="font-italic">Kit</span> found (at [44]) that the correct approach to sentencing in that case was to emphasise the aggregate sentence over a “granular approach relating to the sentence for (the) individual charges”, citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Seah Wee </span>[2012] 1 SLR 292. In essence, the District Judge accepted that it was proper to first determine the appropriate aggregate sentence before working backwards to determine the corresponding individual sentences. With respect, I find this approach to be incorrect and contrary to the established principles concerning the analytical framework for sentencing of multiple offences. In <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne</span> <span class="font-italic">v Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor </span>[2019] 4 SLR 838 (“<span class="font-italic">Anne </span><span class="font-italic">Gan</span>”) at [19], Sundaresh Menon CJ (“Menon CJ”) stressed that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… sentencing for multiple offences comprises two analytically distinct steps which are to be taken in sequence. First, the court must determine the appropriate individual sentence in respect of each charge. Second, the court must determine the overall sentence which should be imposed. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At the first step, the sentencing judge must consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon the sentence for each charge. Subsequently, at the second step, the sentencing judge must consider which of the sentences should run consecutively, having due regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (see <span class="font-italic">Anne Gan </span>at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my view, the sentencing methodology adopted by the District Judge in <span class="font-italic">Tang Wai Kit</span> is wrong in principle. It effectively reverses the proper order of the two steps cited above. The defect of such an approach is its inability to account for the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors which play an important role in the calibration of the sentences for the individual offences. For this reason, I am cautious of relying on the individual sentences imposed in <span class="font-italic">Tang Wai Kit</span>. In this connection, I should add that it is imperative for sentencing courts to examine closely the articulated reasoning behind the sentences imposed in precedent cases which are sought to be relied upon. Where the reasoning is in doubt, the weight to be accorded to the outcomes in those cases is consequently diminished.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I now turn to the sole precedent cited by the appellant, which was the unreported decision of <span class="font-italic">Candace Ang</span>. The appellant extracted the case of <span class="font-italic">Candace Ang</span> from <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice </span><span class="font-italic">in the Subordinate Courts </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“Sentencing Practice”) at pp 1012–1013<span class="font-italic">. </span>Based on the passage from the textbook, the offender had forged her husband’s signature on various bank and insurance documents to make unauthorised withdrawals and surrender requests respectively. The misappropriated moneys amounted to $152,453.22 and were used by the offender to settle personal debts and other expenses. The offender was a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 468, with four similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender did not make any restitution, but instead agreed with her husband and mother-in-law to forgo her right to claim maintenance for their one-year-old child. On appeal, the court reduced the offender’s sentence from 12 months’ imprisonment per charge to two months’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It is well-established that unreported decisions are of limited precedential value. Much judicial ink has been spilt cautioning against reliance on unreported decisions. In <span class="font-italic">Luong </span><span class="font-italic">Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 1 SLR 707 at [21], Chan Sek Keong CJ cautioned against relying on unreported decisions indiscriminately in determining the appropriate sentence for any particular case before the court. Unreported decisions are often bereft of crucial details concerning the facts and circumstances of the case. The lack of detailed reasoning behind the sentences imposed also undermines the utility of such cases as relevant comparators. This was recently echoed in <span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2021] 4 SLR 1220 at [99], where this court observed that “absent a reasoned judgment explaining a particular sentencing decision, bare reference to the outcomes in other cases will seldom be useful”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Notwithstanding the already limited utility of <span class="font-italic">Candace Ang</span> as an unreported decision, the extract taken from Sentencing Practice clearly stated that the High Court judge in that case cautioned against the use of the reduced sentence as a general precedent. Moreover, as the DJ observed, <span class="font-italic">Candace Ang</span> appeared to be a case involving the misappropriation of moneys within the family, which can be distinguished from the present case involving a scheme of insurance fraud perpetrated against the general public.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Therefore, I am of the view that the DJ rightly placed little weight on this precedent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I turn now to consider the two additional sentencing precedents the Prosecution cites in this appeal. The Prosecution submits that the individual sentences meted out in the present case are consistent with these precedents and consequently are not manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The first precedent that the Prosecution refers to is <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 803 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to 12 charges under s 468 of the 1985 Penal Code, with the remaining 470 other similar charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender, who had sole charge of her employer’s bank accounts, forged bank cheques issued by her employer by making unauthorised changes to the amounts payable and altering the name of the payee on the cheques in order to reflect herself as the recipient. Her offending conduct spanned a substantial duration of seven years and she dishonestly obtained a total sum of $3,117,000. On appeal, the offender’s sentence was increased from six years’ imprisonment to nine years’ imprisonment. She was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment per charge with the sentences in three of the charges ordered to run consecutively. The amount involved in each charge ranged from $16,117.66 to $30,011.42. The offender offered to make restitution of about $250,000. She was not a first-time offender and had several property-related antecedents for criminal breach of trust under s 408 of the 1985 Penal Code and cheating under s 420 of the 1985 Penal Code. On appeal, the High Court noted that there was an abuse of trust on the part of the offender which was aggravating (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> at [15]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I find the case of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> to be of limited precedential value in in the present case for a number of reasons. First, similar to <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ek Kian</span>, the offender was prosecuted under s 468 of the 1985 Penal Code, where the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed was lower. Second, several offender-specific aggravating factors present in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> are absent in the present case. The offender in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> faced 470 other similar charges which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, dwarfing the six charges taken into consideration in the instant case. Additionally, the offender in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> was traced for relevant property-related antecedents. By virtue of the principle of escalation, which calls for the cumulative increase in punishments where an offender’s antecedents have displayed an escalating pattern of offending (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing </span>[2019] 5 SLR 769 at [57]–[60]), the sentences imposed on the offender would have been calibrated to reflect his property-related antecedents in order to deter him from committing further offences. In contrast, the appellant in the present case is untraced. Third, the total amount involved in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> was significantly higher at $3,117,000, compared to $330,878 in the present case. After consideration of all these differences, I do not find <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> to be a helpful precedent to determine the appropriate sentence in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The second precedent the Prosecution relies on is <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Hwee Ling Rina </span>[2005] SGDC 237 (“<span class="font-italic">Rina Lim</span>”). The offender in <span class="font-italic">Rina Lim</span> pleaded guilty to 13 charges, of which seven charges were under s 468, another five charges were under s 420 and the remaining charge was under s 406. All the charges were brought under the 1985 Penal Code. A total of 96 similar charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. There were three distinct manners in which the s 468 offences were perpetrated by the offender. On some occasions the offender would obtain cheques which her grandfather had signed in advance but fraudulently insert larger figures than what her grandfather had intended. On other occasions, she would fraudulently withdraw funds from her grandfather’s bank account by issuing forged cheques addressed to herself, causing the bank to deliver moneys to her. Lastly, she had also forged bank account statements to convince her grandfather that his accounts were in order. The total loss across all the charges amounted to $2,677,000. She was sentenced to a global term of six and a half years’ imprisonment. For the charges which involved sums of between $100,000 and $200,000 and the forging of bank account statements, individual sentences of two years’ imprisonment were imposed for each charge. For the charges which involved sums of $300,000 and above, sentences of two and a half years’ imprisonment were imposed per charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As with <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo </span>above, I am of the view that <span class="font-italic">Rina Lim</span> is likewise an unhelpful precedent. Apart from the same issues identified with <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Choo</span> concerning: (a) the fact that the charges were brought under the 1985 Penal Code which prescribed a lower maximum sentence; (b) the significantly higher number of charges taken into consideration; and (c) the fact that the total amount involved ($2,677,000) was much higher (see [57] above), the factual circumstances of the offending in <span class="font-italic">Rina Lim</span> differ from the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Rina Lim</span>, the victim of the majority of the offences underlying the charges was the offender’s grandfather. While there certainly was an abuse of trust, the consequences of the offender’s acts did not have significant public interest ramifications unlike in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 After considering the precedents above, I am of the view that the most closely relevant precedent in the present case is <span class="font-italic">Choy </span><span class="font-italic">Yut Hong</span>. I will elaborate more on this later. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevant sentencing factors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 While relevant sentencing precedents serve as good reference points to determine the appropriate sentence to impose, due regard must be had to the specific facts and circumstances of each case, especially the relevant offence-specific and offender-specific factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the present case, the DJ accepted that the following factors were relevant: (a) the amount involved;

There is much sense in this proposition. Yet, that is not to say that the amount involved should be the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> factor in determining the appropriate individual sentence to be imposed. This is especially pertinent when comparisons are made between precedent cases where similar amounts are involved. As noted by the District Judge in <span class="font-italic">Choy </span><span class="font-italic">Yut Hong </span>at [54], it is trite that sentences do not always bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sum involved. Care must be taken not to directly translate sentences imposed in a precedent case unquestioningly to a case at hand based simply on mathematical extrapolation.

</div> Here, the appellant committed the s 468 offences in her capacity as an insurance agent in the employ of either AIA or HSBC, which were prominent institutions. These offences have the potential to adversely affect public confidence in the insurance industry. I also accept that such incidents of offending may result in increased efforts and costs on the part of the insurance industry as it seeks to enhance security measures to prevent the recurrence of similar scams. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Abuse of trust</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Third, it is clear that the appellant had abused the trust reposed in her by the victims who were her clients by forging the insurance policies and deceiving them into delivering moneys to her. Insurance agents like the appellant are expected to uphold high standards of professional integrity in dealings with their clients. Instead, the appellant had taken advantage of the trust her clients had in her by misusing the authority of the insurance companies she worked for on multiple occasions, cheating her clients of large sums of moneys. This is a significant aggravating factor which the DJ rightly took into account.
