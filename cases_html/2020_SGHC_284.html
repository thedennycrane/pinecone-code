Clause 33 of the Contract, which the first defendant understood to be an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Belizean courts, in fact nominated more than one forum and was thus void for uncertainty. The plaintiff also argued that he had satisfied the requirements of Order 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) for service out of Singapore; that there was a serious issue to be tried; and that he had validly served the writ on the first, fifth and sixth defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The first defendant’s chief contention was that clause 33 of the Contract contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause, in favour of the Belizean courts, which the plaintiff had not shown strong cause for breaching. Consequently, the proper forum for the plaintiff’s claims against the first defendant was not Singapore but Belize – or in the alternative, Belize <span class="font-italic">or</span> the UK. As for the sixth defendant, the baseline of his case was that there was nothing to link him to the alleged conspiracy at all, such that there was no serious issue to be tried. The sixth defendant also submitted that the material non-disclosures in the plaintiff’s application for leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction warranted the setting aside of the writ and service thereof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 All three defendants argued that the plaintiff had established neither a good arguable case that his claims fell within O 11 r 1 of the ROC nor that there was a serious issue to be tried, and that Singapore was not the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>.

</div> With respect, Mr Courtenay did not appear to have considered the possibility that a “forum selection clause” had been transposed to clause 33, as Prof Briggs postulated.

</div>
</div> The careless editing of this standard form contract was evident from clause 33 itself, which contained several other obvious typographical errors. For example, clause 33 stated that “[t]he courts of Belize <span class="font-italic">ware</span> [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] agreed to have exclusive jurisdiction …” and that the Contract “<span class="font-italic">waivers</span> [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] any objections” [emphasis added] to the use of the UK legal system. Despite these errors, the meaning of clause 33 would be apparent to any reasonable person – that parties agreed to litigate any Contract-related disputes in Belize and in Belize only. The errors in clause 33 did not render the exclusive jurisdiction clause contained therein so incoherent as to be void for uncertainty.  Rectification would be the more appropriate and less draconian response to these errors as compared to voiding the clause altogether. As Prof Briggs noted, not only had something gone wrong with the language in clause 33, it was “easy to say what that something [was] and what [was] needed to correct it”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In this connection, the approach adopted by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Chartbrook</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd</span> [2009] 1 AC 1101 (“<span class="font-italic">Chartbrook</span>”) was instructive. In <span class="font-italic">Chartbrook</span>, the House of Lords had to interpret a term in a contract between land owners and developers which provided for the latter to pay the former something called an “additional residential payment”. The developers calculated the sum payable pursuant to this term as £897,051; the land owners claimed that the sum should be £4,484,862. The land owners sued for the unpaid balance of the “additional residential payment” which they claimed was due; the developers counterclaimed for rectification of the contract to accord with what they claimed to be the parties’ common agreement. At first instance, the judge found in favour of the land owners’ construction of the said term; and this finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal. However, the developers appealed successfully to the House of Lords. In allowing the appeal, the House of Lords held (at 1112) that although a court would not easily accept that linguistic mistakes had been made in formal documents, if the context and the background drove a court to conclude that something had gone wrong with the language of the contract, the law did not require it to attribute to the parties an intention which a reasonable person would not have understood them to have had. Where it was clear that there was a mistake on the face of the document and what correction ought to be made in order to cure it, in that it was clear what a reasonable person, having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties, would have understood the parties to have meant in their use of the language in the contract, the court was entitled to correct the mistake as a matter of construction (at 1114). The House of Lords held (at 1132, 1133 and 1135) that the contractual definition of “additional residential payment” was ambiguous and obviously defective as a piece of drafting; that there was always a commercial context to a contract negotiated between businessmen; and that to construe the definition in accordance with the ordinary rules of syntax made no commercial sense. Accordingly, taking into consideration the background and context but not the pre-contractual negotiations, and applying the established principles of construction, the land owners’ construction could not be upheld; and the developers’ construction was more appropriate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In following the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Chartbrook</span>, I was conscious that the parties’ differing interpretations of clause 33 meant I was essentially faced with an interpretation which would result in clause 33 being found void and unenforceable, versus an interpretation which would give effect to the said clause as an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of Belize (or alternatively – according to the first defendant – Belize or the UK). In such a situation, the latter interpretation should surely be preferred: <span class="font-italic">ut</span><span class="font-italic"> res magis valeat quam pereat</span>; or, as the learned editors of <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (Professor Hugh Beale Gen Ed) (Thomson Reuters, 33rd Ed, 2020) put it (at para 13-078):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the words used in an agreement are susceptible of two meanings, one of which would validate the instrument or the particular clause in the instrument, and the other render it void, ineffective or meaningless, the former sense is to be adopted. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Indeed, it should be pointed out that even Mr Courtenay acknowledged that the Belizean courts would be most reluctant to void a contractual provision for uncertainty.

</div> to the plaintiff’s non-contractual claims against the first defendant (in deceit, misrepresentation, conspiracy, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), the plaintiff did not pursue this line of argument in either written or oral submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, regardless of how the plaintiff’s non-contractual causes of action were repackaged, they were undeniably connected to the Contract. In this connection, counsel for the first/fifth defendant referred me to the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals</span> [2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”). In that case, the plaintiff brought a suit for minority oppression against the defendants who included the company in which it was a minority shareholder (“AMRG”) as well as other shareholders of AMRG. The Court of Appeal had to consider whether the plaintiff’s claims fell within the arbitration clause in the share sale agreement between the parties, which provided that “any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination” was to be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore according to the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. In considering this issue, the Court of Appeal made it clear (at [133]) that its task was to “examine the substance of the controversy without paying undue attention to the details of how it ha[d] been pleaded”. It held (at [136]) that in so far as the plaintiff’s claim of minority oppression was based on an alleged understanding that it would be allowed to participate in the management of AMRG (what the court termed “the Management Participation Allegation”), the construction of certain clauses in the share sale agreement would “form an inescapable and substantial (if not the entire) step in establishing the existence of any understanding or legitimate expectation of management participation by [the plaintiff]”. As such, the Management Participation Allegation fell squarely within the ambit of the arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 While <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> concerned an application for a stay under s 6(1) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) based on the arbitration clause in the parties’ share sale agreement, I derived useful guidance from the Court of Appeal’s approach. In emphasising the importance of identifying the substance of the controversy rather than the formal nature of the proceedings, the court cited (at [124]) Lord Hoffmann’s statement at [13] of <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corporation</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Privalov and others</span> [2007] All ER 951, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, his observation that the “construction of an arbitration clause should start from the assumption that the parties, as rational businessmen, are likely to have intended any dispute arising out of the relationship into which they have entered or purported to enter to be decided by the same tribunal”. That observation should, in my view, apply with equal force in a case such as the present, where parties had entered into a contract containing an exclusive jurisdiction clause. As rational businessmen, the parties were likely to have intended that any dispute arising out of their contractual relationship ought to be decided in the same forum “unless the language ma[de] it clear that certain questions were intended to be excluded” from the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction clause.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the present case, the plaintiff’s various causes of action (in deceit, misrepresentation, conspiracy, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) were premised on his allegation that Opteck was a bogus trading platform which used pre-determined data to give the impression of real-time trading.

</div> According to the plaintiff, the fact that moneys were credited to his account and that he was permitted to trade on Opteck despite the freezing of his funds by the Romanian authorities provided the strongest evidence of the defendants’ fraudulent scheme. In the circumstances, the construction of various clauses in the Contract clearly formed an inescapable and substantial step in establishing the credibility of the plaintiff’s claims about the nature of the Opteck platform, the information provided by it, and the transactions conducted on it. As counsel for the first and fifth defendants pointed out, for example, in evaluating the plaintiff’s allegations about the fraudulent nature of the Opteck trading platform, it would be critical to examine those contractual clauses providing for Opteck to operate under the B Book (Market Maker) model (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, clauses 5 and 6 of the Contract), whereby the first defendant was to be the counterparty to trades conducted on Opteck and Opteck maintained an internal “B Book”.

As noted in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 75.121:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the party seeking trial in the forum shows that the lapse (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the failure to take out a protective writ in the chosen forum) was a reasonable one in the circumstances, then he can rely on the time-bar to show exceptional circumstances why the trial should proceed in the forum where his action is not barred. However, if the party had acted unreasonably in allowing the time limitation to lapse in the chosen jurisdiction, the time-bar is merely a neutral factor. … The party seeking to rely on the time bar in the contractual forum needs to show very compelling reasons why it did not file a protective writ in the contractual forum. It should be born in mind that the parties must be taken to have agreed to the time bar that will be applied by the agreed forum … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Even assuming that the plaintiff’s claims in Belize would be time-barred, such a result would be entirely of his own doing. The plaintiff filed his “protective writ” in Belize only in December 2019. This was some 20 months after he had applied for leave to join the sixth defendant as a defendant to these proceedings, and nearly two years after his commencement of Suit 34 against the first to fifth defendants. No coherent explanation was been provided as to why he could not have filed a protective writ in Belize – or even in England or in Romania – prior to December 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The plaintiff sought to impugn the defendants’ conduct as the cause of the delay in these proceedings, claiming that the defendants were to blame for his being (allegedly) at risk of having no recourse in the Belizean courts. I rejected these submissions as being self-serving and entirely baseless. From the undisputed history of Suit 34, it was plain that these proceedings had been unduly protracted due to the plaintiff’s own stalling tactics. For example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) After the plaintiff commenced the suit in January 2017, there was a long period of inactivity on his part as he engaged in settlement talks with the first and fifth defendants and apparently even toyed with the idea of discontinuing the suit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff applied for leave to include the sixth defendant as a party to these proceedings only in April 2018, more than a year after commencing Suit 34. He then took about nine months to effect service (which is disputed) on the sixth defendant in January 2019.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A regular feature of Suit 34 was the plaintiff’s multiple requests for additional time. He sought repeated and lengthy extensions of time for various steps required in the proceedings, from the filing of his List of Documents to the filing of various reply affidavits, as well as affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”). The numerous delays on the plaintiff’s part led the court to remark sternly on one occasion in December 2018 that “[t]his has dragged on for a very long time”.

</div> Even then, the court’s admonition did nothing to improve the plaintiff’s sense of urgency. On more than one occasion, he asked for hearing or trial dates to be adjourned, vacated, or pushed back. For example, at a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on 26 March 2019 (more than two years after the filing of Suit 34), the court had proposed that the trial be held in May 2019, with the AEICs to be filed by April 2019.

</div> In April 2020, the plaintiff applied for leave to file additional affidavits at the eleventh hour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The above is by no means an exhaustive list of the various ways in which the plaintiff has been dilatory in the conduct of these proceedings.

The plaintiff’s argument was even more unmeritorious when one considered that the present case involved a <span class="font-italic">contractually agreed</span> forum under the exclusive jurisdiction clause – it was even more incumbent on the plaintiff to make an effort to protect his legal position in the forum that parties had expressly chosen. Instead of doing so, he had chosen to hedge his bets by forum-shopping, filing criminal complaints in multiple jurisdictions (Romania and Singapore) and civil writs in others (Singapore, then belatedly Belize), while making claims about his intention to pursue various other courses of action such as requesting “remedies … from the English courts”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 With respect, therefore, it did not lie in the plaintiff’s mouth to lament that irremediable prejudice would result from the prospect of his claims being time-barred in Belize. He wilfully chose not to litigate in the contractually agreed forum, failed even to issue a protective writ in Belize timeously, and instead gambled on the chance that the Singapore courts would overlook his forum-shopping and allow him to litigate here. That gamble has not paid off, and the plaintiff has only himself to blame if he ultimately winds up unable to pursue his claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s residence in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff’s only other recourse in trying to show strong cause for non-compliance with clause 33 was to harp on the fact that he was resident in Singapore. I did not view his residence here as an exceptional circumstance that justified his reneging on clause 33. While his place of residence might be a general connecting factor under the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> ([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) test, as mentioned at [63] above, a <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> connecting factor would generally not amount to strong cause. In any event, it was not disputed that the key transactions in this case took place online: as counsel for the first and fifth defendants put it, the plaintiff could have been anywhere in the world when he entered into the Contract, transferred funds to the first defendant, and carried out trades on the Opteck platform.  In a modern commercial dispute such as this, a party’s current domicile “will provide little guidance to the natural forum”, particularly for an individual like the plaintiff who is a “well-heeled” individual with likely a “high degree of mobility”: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 75.091; <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span>”) at [71]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In summary, I found that the first defendant had at least a good arguable case that clause 33 contained an applicable exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Belizean courts. I also found that the plaintiff was unable to show strong cause for being relieved of his contractual obligation under clause 33. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In light of my findings, it was unnecessary for me to consider the first defendant’s alternative interpretation of clause 33 as providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of either Belize <span class="font-italic">or</span> the UK.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was Singapore the proper forum for the plaintiff’s claims against the fifth and sixth defendants?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In respect of the fifth and the sixth defendants, the parties were agreed that the applicable test for determining the natural forum of the dispute was the two-stage test set out in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> ([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> ([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [30].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The first issue to be determined under the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> ([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) test is whether there is<span class="font-italic"> prima facie </span>some other available forum where it is more appropriate that the case be tried (“Stage One”): <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span>”) at [14]. The legal burden of proving that Singapore is the proper forum lies on the defendant at this stage: <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [26]. At Stage One, the court considers the connecting factors that link the dispute with the competing jurisdictions, which include (<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> ([72] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [71]; <span class="font-italic">Grains</span> ([61] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses, including the compellability of witnesses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the connections to relevant events and transactions;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the applicable law of the dispute;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the existence of proceedings elsewhere, which could result in inconsistent judgments and duplication of resources; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the “shape of the litigation”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the manner in which the claim and the defence have been pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The above connecting factors do not carry equal weight. Instead, the court should accord greater weight to those factors that are likely to be material to the fair determination of the dispute, having regard to the circumstances of the case: <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span> ([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [83]. The search is for the connecting factors which have the “most relevant and substantial associations” with the dispute at hand: <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> ([72] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [70].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 At the second stage of the inquiry, the court is concerned with whether justice requires that it exercise its jurisdiction even if it is not the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> natural forum (“Stage Two”): <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 75.096. In particular, the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish cogently that he will be denied “substantial justice” if the case is not heard in that forum: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [38] and [43]. In the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro SAPI de CV and others and another appeal (Jesus Angel Guerra Mendez, non-party) </span>[2020] 1 SLR 226 (“<span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span>”), however, the Court of Appeal remarked (at [80(d)]) that it was an “open question” whether Stage Two is applicable in the context of leave applications for service outside jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stage One: analysis of the connecting factors </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Connections to relevant events and the applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I analysed these two connecting factors in conjunction as I found them to be closely related. I concluded that these connecting factors strongly tied the dispute to Belize instead of Singapore, and I accorded them significant weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The thrust of the plaintiff’s claims against the fifth and sixth defendants was for unlawful means conspiracy to defraud him. The starting presumption in relation to tortious claims is that the place where the tort occurred is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for determining that tortious claim: <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span> at [90]. The place of the tort was not immediately apparent in the present case, as the constituent acts of the alleged unlawful means conspiracy spanned multiple jurisdictions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Romania and the UK). However, I did not need to ascertain the place of the conspiracy: I found that the plaintiff’s tortious claim was so intimately connected to his contractual claim that Belizean law, which governed the Contract, also applied to the plaintiff’s tortious claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The two authorities which the defendants cited – <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro </span>and<span class="font-italic"> Trafigura </span><span class="font-italic">Beheer BV v Kookmin Bank Co</span> [2006] EWHC 1450 (“<span class="font-italic">Trafigura</span>”) – were instructive. In <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span>, the appellants (a group of Singapore-incorporated companies) commenced proceedings against the respondents who comprised the appellants’ former directors and parent company. The appellants’ tortious claims against the respondents included unlawful means conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract. The Court of Appeal found (at [90]) that as the alleged torts had occurred in Mexico, Mexico was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for the appellants’ tortious claims. However, the Court of Appeal held (at [91]) that this starting point was displaced as “the underlying acts that allegedly attracted tortious liability arose from the breaches of the appellants’ constitutions”: as the tortious claims were “parasitic” on the non-tortious claims, the two “inextricably linked issues” ought to be determined in a single forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 <span class="font-italic">Trafigura</span>, on the other hand, concerned a dispute over a letter of credit issued by the defendant, a Korean bank, to the claimant company. The defendant contended that the claimant, as the beneficiary under the letter of credit, had breached the terms of the letter of credit as well as its tortious duty not to jeopardise the security interest in certain cargo. The court held that although most of the significant elements of the tort had occurred in Singapore, the applicable law governing the tortious claim was English law. In so concluding, the court reasoned that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the most significant factor that relates to the two parties is the pre-existing relationship of the [letter of credit]. <span class="font-italic">Without that </span><span class="font-italic">pre-existing contractual relationship, [the defendant] cannot create the necessary connection between itself, as issuing bank, and [the claimant], as beneficiary under the [letter of credit], so as to give rise to the duties that [the defendant] says are owed to it by [the claimant] </span>under Korean law. That factor connects the alleged tort to England because English law is the governing law of the pre-existing contractual relationship between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In the instant case, the plaintiff’s tortious claim was parasitic on the Contract in several ways. The Contract formed the basis for the plaintiff’s use of the Opteck platform, which platform was the primary conduit by which the defendants were alleged to have perpetrated their conspiracy. In this regard, I was guided by the approach that Aikens J adopted in <span class="font-italic">Trafigura</span> in considering the events that set the tortious claim into motion. In <span class="font-italic">Trafigura</span>, the letter of credit (out of which the tortious claim arose) “only came into existence” by virtue of a sale contract, which was governed by English law and contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the English courts. Similarly, had the present plaintiff not e-signed the Contract, he would not have been able to use the Opteck platform, and there would have been no conspiracy against him to speak of. Per the SOC (Amendment No. 2), the acts that constituted and/or were carried out in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy all arose from and occurred <span class="font-italic">after</span> the plaintiff’s signing of the Contract.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Contract also created the “necessary connection” between the plaintiff on the one hand and the fifth and sixth defendants on the other. The fifth and sixth defendants’ involvement in Suit 34 was primarily based on their ownership (actual and alleged, respectively) of the first defendant, whom the plaintiff claimed had received the moneys he deposited. The Contract created the pre-existing contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the first defendant, and that contractual relationship in turn formed the basis for the fifth and sixth defendants’ roles in the alleged conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Furthermore, the present dispute inevitably concerned the <span class="font-italic">terms</span> of the Contract. As stated at [8] above, the Contract expressly warned that trading on the Opteck platform was a high-risk financial activity and disclaimed liability on the first defendant’s part for any losses incurred by trading on the Opteck platform. Key to the plaintiff’s tortious claim were his assertions to the contrary – that the second defendant had sweettalked him into believing that binary options trading carried minimal risks, and that the defendants ought to be liable for the losses he had sustained. Weighing these considerations in totality, I considered that the contractual matrix underlying the plaintiff’s conspiracy claim pointed towards Belizean law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the governing law of the Contract) as the applicable law for the conspiracy claim. It would be preferable for the Belizean courts rather than the Singaporean courts to apply Belizean law; the Belizean courts would undoubtedly be more adept at applying their own law, and such an arrangement would also be more expedient (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> ([76] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [42]); also <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Holdrich Investments Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1007 at [16].  I therefore held that at Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> ([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) analysis, the proper forum for the plaintiff’s conspiracy claim was Belize.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In respect of the plaintiff’s equitable claim, this arose out of the same factual matrix as his tortious and contractual claims. His equitable claim was founded on the defendants’ alleged advice to him to invest US$18m in binary options, on breach of the “no profit” rule, and on “knowing receipt” of the US$11.55m that he had remitted to the Volksbank Account.

</div>
</div>
</div> These allegations stemmed from the very same facts as those which grounded the plaintiff’s tortious claim, and which I concluded (at [85] above) was governed by Belizean law. More pertinently, the defendants’ alleged equitable duties to the plaintiff also “[arose] from a factual matrix where the legal foundation [was] premised on … contract” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Contract): see [83]–[85] above and <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> ([76] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [81]. Consequently, the applicable law for the plaintiff’s equitable claim should be Belizean law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the governing law of the Contract), and this significantly militated in favour of Belize as the natural forum to determine the equitable claim (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> at [42] and [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It would not be desirable for the plaintiff’s contractual and/or tortious claims to be heard in Belize while his equitable claim was heard in Singapore. Where claims “arise from the same factual matrix” and “involve a determination of the same central issues”, they ought to be heard in the same jurisdiction to minimise the risk of inconsistent findings and to avoid duplication of resources: <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> ([72] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [106]. For these reasons, although the fifth and sixth defendants were not party to the Contract, the exclusive jurisdiction clause therein was still a persuasive reason why the plaintiff’s equitable claim should be heard by the Belizean courts in accordance with Belizean law. The plaintiff’s equitable claim was closely connected to the Contract, and it would not be conducive to the interests of justice for the litigation to be fragmented across multiple jurisdictions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Finally, the plaintiff’s own conduct suggested that he himself did not believe Singapore to be the natural forum. As mentioned, he filed a “protective writ” in Belize to preserve his causes of action there. On the other hand, the criminal complaint he filed with the Romanian authorities on 22 July 2014 stated, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that an “act of instigation” or an “act of complicity” had been “committed in the Romanian territory”.

I therefore regarded the availability of witnesses and documents as neutral factors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stage Two: whether the plaintiff would be denied substantial justice in Belize</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As I noted at [78], it remains an open question whether Stage Two is applicable in cases involving leave for service out of jurisdiction. Nevertheless, in the present case I considered Stage Two for the sake of completeness. The plaintiff relied chiefly on the possibility of his claims being time-barred in Belize to argue that he would not be able to obtain substantial justice there. For the reasons stated at [65]–[71] above, I decided that if Stage Two of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test did apply, the plaintiff had also failed to establish that he would be denied substantial justice in Belize. I make three points in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 First, the fact that the Belize courts would be more suited than the Singapore courts for the task of applying Belize law constituted, in my view, a factor that increased the likelihood of the plaintiff obtaining substantial justice. Although the governing law of the Contract has already been considered at Stage One of the analysis, Stage Two requires all circumstances to be taken into consideration, “including factors already taken into consideration in Stage One” (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 75.096). I was thus not precluded from having regard to this material circumstance again in Stage Two. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, the plaintiff failed to produce “cogent evidence” (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> ([78] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [43]) that he would not be able to obtain substantial justice in Belize. As his counsel admitted before me, he was “not fully shut out on all [his] causes of action in Belize” owing to the “protective writ” that he had filed in Belize in December 2019. In other words, there was a real chance that the plaintiff would be able to pursue at least <span class="font-italic">some</span> of his claims in Belize.  I did not treat “substantial justice” as being synonymous with the plaintiff’s entitlement to pursue <span class="font-italic">all</span> his claims in Belize; and certainly he did not put forward any authorities to persuade me that this should be the position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Third, even if some or all of the plaintiff’s claims in Belize turned out to be time-barred, I considered that to be the very justice of the case. As the editors of <span class="font-italic">Dicey and Morris</span> have noted (at para 12-155), it “may be a rare case in which the claimant is able to say that allowing time to run in an expressly-chosen court was not unreasonable”. In this case, given the plaintiff’s forum-shopping and the brazen delays in his conduct of these proceedings (see [68]–[71] above), he could not claim to have acted reasonably in allowing time to run in Belize.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Finally, in so far as the plaintiff sought to suggest that the Singapore courts afforded certain juridical advantages which the Belize courts did not (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in terms of the scope of discovery and the use of technology), such suggestions did not assist his case. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> ([72] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [109], any such “differences in procedure and remedies will generally be irrelevant, and not having the benefit of the procedures or remedies of the forum will not by itself amount to denial of substantial justice”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To sum up: an examination of the connecting factors at Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> ([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) test pointed to Belize, not Singapore, as the proper forum for the plaintiff’s claims against the fifth and sixth defendants. I also found that the plaintiff had failed to establish that he would be denied substantial justice in Belize. Whatever grievances the plaintiff might have against the fifth and sixth defendants, they ought properly to be aired in Belize, not Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the plaintiff establish a good arguable case that his claims fell within O 11 r 1 of the ROC?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On behalf of the first, fifth and sixth defendants, it was further submitted that the plaintiff should not have been given leave for service out of jurisdiction under O 11 r 1 of the ROC.  It is trite that a plaintiff who seeks leave for service out of jurisdiction needs to meet the standard of a “good arguable case” that one or more limbs under O 11 r 1 has been satisfied – in other words, that he has “the better of the argument”: <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> ([62] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [49]; <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> ([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45]. Having considered the affidavit evidence and parties’ submissions, I concluded that the plaintiff was unable to establish a good arguable case under any of the limbs of O 11 r 1 that he purported to rely on.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Order 11 r 1(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">d</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">i) of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) of the ROC concerns claims brought in relation to a contract or breach thereof, where the contract was made in Singapore or was made as a result of an essential step being taken in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The plaintiff posited that the present case involved two types of contracts: (a) the Contract; and (b) individual “Financial Contracts” made when each binary order trade was performed.

These “Financial Contracts” were mentioned for the first time in the plaintiff’s written submissions (filed on 11 June 2020) in relation to SUM 5512 and SUM 5513: they were not pleaded nor even mentioned in the affidavit filed by the plaintiff (on 4 February 2020) in relation to the two summonses. Nevertheless, even taking the “Financial Contracts” into consideration for the sake of argument, I found that O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) of the ROC was not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) of the ROC was plainly inapplicable as against the fifth and sixth defendants, who were not party to the Contract and the purported “Financial Contracts”. As against the first defendant, I was not persuaded that the plaintiff had the better of the argument that the Contract and/or the “Financial Contracts” were “made in Singapore”. Where an offer is made and accepted over the telephone, a contract is formed at the place where the offeror “receives the notification of acceptance by the offeree”: <span class="font-italic">Transniko</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Communication Technology Sdn Bhd</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 941 at [17]. Applying the same logic to the present case, it would suggest that the Contract and “Financial Contracts” were made in Belize, where the plaintiff’s acceptances were received by the first defendant. In any event, and as the fifth defendant pointed out, the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence to show that he was actually in Singapore when he e-signed the Contract and when he made each trade on the Opteck platform.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The plaintiff also tried to rely on his pre-trading Skype conversations with the second defendant as an “essential step” taken in Singapore for the purposes of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) of the ROC.

</div> However, this argument was an obvious non-starter in relation to the Contract, which predated the plaintiff’s introduction to the second defendant; the Contract could not possibly have been made “as a result” of the plaintiff’s Skype conversations with the second defendant. In addition, O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) makes it clear that the “essential step” must have been taken in Singapore – but the second defendant was based in the UK at all material times. It was perhaps for this reason that the plaintiff contended that the “essential step” taken in Singapore was his <span class="font-italic">“receiving”</span> the second defendant’s misrepresentations via Skype,

Six years after the plaintiff made a criminal complaint to the Romanian authorities, Mr Alireza’s report remains as tentative as ever. The plaintiff subsequently engaged a forensic accountant, Mr Wan Yew Fai (“Mr Wan”), to assess “whether the strike price, outcome and payout/loss for trades” made on the plaintiff’s Opteck account were “consistent with comparative data obtained from the Bloomberg Terminal”.

</div> However, the sixth defendant was not copied in those e-mails, and there was no evidence that he was privy to the Skype and telephone conversations. Third, and more tellingly, in the plaintiff’s seventh affidavit which was filed on 4 February 2020 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, nearly two years after the plaintiff had applied to join the sixth defendant as a defendant) and which spanned some 600 pages, the plaintiff traversed the facts of these proceedings in painstaking detail – yet there was conspicuously no mention of the substance of the two meetings and the letter that formed the very basis for the sixth defendant’s entanglement in these proceedings. Indeed, in his seventh affidavit, the plaintiff entirely abandoned his claim that the sixth defendant substantially owned the first defendant. This was perhaps inevitable, because the documentary evidence before me – namely, the first defendant’s Certificate of Incumbency – upended the plaintiff’s allegations about the sixth defendant’s substantial ownership of the first defendant: it showed that the fifth defendant had been the <span class="font-italic">sole shareholder</span> of the first defendant since 7 September 2011.

</div> Again, however, there was simply no basis for these belated allegations. The plaintiff sought to rely on the fact that the employment of the sole local director of BNet Online (one Robert Benjamin Gersohn) was terminated in June 2014 and that the gazette notice for the compulsory strike-off of BNet Online was filed on 9 September 2014. Once again, these allegations really amounted to grasping at straws: the plaintiff was unable to explain how these events were connected to the timing of the Asset Purchase, or even how BNet Online was connected to the purported conspiracy against him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In fact, the plaintiff himself acknowledged receipt of an e-mail from Opteck dated <span class="font-italic">29 April 2015</span> informing him that there was a change in the ownership of the Opteck platform.

Even at this preliminary stage, the plaintiff’s claim rang hollow: there was simply no evidence of the sixth defendant’s participation in the making of the said misrepresentations. Indeed, the sixth defendant asserted that he did not even know the second defendant;

The acts purportedly carried out in relation to or in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy occurred in late 2013, way before the sixth defendant came into the picture during the Asset Purchase in 2015. Relying on the “without prejudice” meetings and the sixth defendant’s letter of November 2015 (see [119] above), the plaintiff claimed that:

In this connection, I had already indicated in the course of the hearing of SUM 1273 and SUM 1298 that I agreed with the defendants’ counsel that the High Court’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Bunge SA and another v Indian Bank </span>[2015] SGHC 330 provided a complete answer to this “preliminary” objection.  In that case, it was held that given the PTC Registrar’s directions on the timeline for the filing of the stay application, there was no need for the defendant to apply for an extension of time. In any event, and with respect, this “preliminary” objection appeared to me to be yet another cynical attempt by the plaintiff to distract from the substantive issues raised in the jurisdictional challenges – especially considering his own failure to raise such objection until February 2020, months after the filing of the jurisdictional challenges.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Raeza Khaled Salem Ibrahim, Kulvinder Kaur and Charlene Wee Swee Ting (Salem Ibrahim LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Calvin Liang (Essex Court Chambers Duxton (Singapore Group Practice)), Yu Kexin (Yu Law) (instructed) and Eugene Jedidiah Low (Ark Law Corporation) for the first and fifth defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gregory Vijayendran SC, Tan Eu Shan Kevin and Andrew Tan Jian Ming (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the sixth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
