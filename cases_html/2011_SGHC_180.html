        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       “Adverse possession” is the law
                    that recognises one’s claim to ownership of soil and plaster he knows do
                    not belong to him. That law will become obsolete in time. This case is a relic
                    from a past not affected by the change in law, and concerns the ownership of a
                    property located at 89 Amoy Street, Singapore 069908 described as lot
                    number TS3-99095P in the lot base system operated by the Singapore Land
                    Authority (“the Property”). Chua June Ching Michelle (“the
                    Plaintiff”) and Chai Hoi Tong (“the Defendant”) are rival
                    claimants to the Property, both claiming by the doctrine of adverse possession.
                    The 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> defendants did not enter an appearance in the
                    action, and were not involved in the proceedings at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The history of this case so far as it can be
                    proved or was undisputed showed that on 13 June 1936, a Statutory
                    Declaration declared Tan Seang Guat Neo the owner of the Property by way of
                    adverse possession. Tan Seang Guat Neo bears no relation to either the Plaintiff
                    or the Defendant. The Plaintiff and Defendant could not agree on what happened
                    thereafter. The Plaintiff’s version of the story was as follows. Tan Seang
                    Guat Neo leased the Property to the Defendant’s predecessors for $840 a
                    year. On 23 October 1936, and after the lease was granted, Tan Seang
                    Guat Neo mortgaged the Property to the Plaintiff’s grandmother, one Goh
                    Tim Hneo (“the Plaintiff’s grandmother”). Subsequent to the
                    grant of the mortgage, the Defendant’s predecessors paid the rent to Goh
                    Tim Hneo. It was not known why the “rent” of $840 was collected by
                    Goh Tim Hneo (the mortgagee) rather than Tan Seang Guat Neo (the registered
                    owner), but in any event this showed that if Goh Tim Hneo was to have any claim
                    to ownership of the Property, she would have to establish her claim by way of
                    adverse possession, and significantly, the Plaintiff cannot have a better claim
                    through her predecessors than her present claim (also based on adverse
                    possession). Tan Seang Guat Neo and/or her successors, if any, did not made any
                    claim over the Property and in light of this, it is not necessary to determine
                    the effect of the mortgage on the claims of either party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff’s grandmother granted a
                    power of attorney to the Plaintiff’s father, one Chua Eng Cheong
                    (“the Plaintiff’s father”) on 24 January 1951. From
                    that time on, the Plaintiff’s father collected the “rent”
                    from the Defendant’s predecessors. The Plaintiff’s grandmother died
                    in 1955 and the Plaintiff’s father died in 1971. The Plaintiff’s
                    case was that from 1971, until December 2008, she had been collecting payments
                    by way of rent from the Defendant amounting to $840 a year, and her adverse
                    possession claim rests on her assertion that she was the landlord of the
                    Property. I will hereafter refer to the $840 payments as “the
                    Payments” as a neutral term rather than
                “rent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Defendant’s version of the facts
                    differed from the Plaintiff’s in several important respects. He disputed
                    that the Payments were made, and also the nature of the Payments. He claimed
                    that if the Payments were made, they were not rental payments but financial
                    assistance. He testified that the Plaintiff’s father was in financial
                    difficulty from as early as 1956, and frequently sought financial assistance
                    from the Defendant’s own father, who generously offered $840 a year for
                    that purpose. The Defendant’s father was one of two partners in a
                    partnership known as Kwong Thye Hin, which had its business premises at the
                    Property and had as its other partner one Chai Xing. Upon the Defendant’s
                    father’s death, the Defendant took over his share of the partnership. Chai
                    Xing has since passed away and the partnership has since been
                dissolved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 11 September 2008, the Defendant filed
                    Originating Summons No 1183 of 2008 (“the application”), ex
                    parte, for a court order to grant him title to the Property as adverse possessor
                    as against the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup>
                    defendants (“the defendants”) named in the counterclaim in the
                    present proceedings. The Plaintiff was not named as a defendant to that
                    application. The Defendant claimed that he was unable to locate the defendants,
                    and he was allowed to serve the application by substituted service. He placed
                    advertisements in two local newspapers (the Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao) on
                    26 September 2008 giving notice of the application. However, the Plaintiff
                    claimed that she received no notice of the application and thus did not attend
                    the hearing. The Defendant was granted a declaration by an <em>ex
                        parte</em> Order of Court dated 16 October 2008 (“the
                    Order of Court”) that he was the owner of the Property and the building
                    erected thereon by reason of his adverse possession of the Property for a
                    continuous period of 12 years prior to 1 March 1994. He subsequently
                    procured the registration of title to the Property in his name on
                    18 December 2008. On 6 April 2009, the Plaintiff lodged Caveat
                    No IB/325458M against the Property, and when the Defendant sought to remove
                    the caveat, she initiated the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiff claimed that the Order of Court
                    was irregularly or fraudulently obtained. Before this court, she sought a
                    declaration that the Order of Court be set aside on the grounds that it was
                    obtained <em>ex parte</em>. The Plaintiff also sought an
                    order that the Defendant’s title to the Property be extinguished and the
                    land-register be rectified by cancelling the registration on the grounds of
                    fraud. The Plaintiff further sought a declaration that she was the owner of and
                    was entitled to all the rights and title to and possession of the Property, and
                    an order that the Registrar of Titles registered her as the proprietor of the
                    Property. In his counterclaim, the Defendant prayed for an order that the Caveat
                    against the Property be removed, that the Registrar of Land Titles be directed
                    to remove and/or expunge the Caveat from the land register, and for damages to
                    be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       To succeed, a party has to show both that he or
                    she had adversely possessed the Property as against the paper owner Tan Seang
                    Guat Neo (who did not enter appearance), and that he or she had adversely
                    possessed the Property against the other. Order 32 rule 6 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) provides that an <em>ex parte</em> order may be set aside in the interests of justice, if
                    the party who was not heard wishes to object. One of the grounds for the setting
                    aside of <em>ex parte</em> orders is that the applicant did
                    not make full and frank disclosure of material facts in his application (see
                        <em>Nikkomann Co Pte Ltd v Yulean Trading Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1992] 2 SLR(R) 328). Here, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant
                    deliberately did not disclose the material fact that he paid rent to her in
                    respect of the Property in his <em>ex parte</em>
                    application. The nature of that payment was an important issue before me. I
                    shall revert to this issue shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Indefeasibility of the registered title is an
                    important feature of the system of land registration. An exception to this
                    indefeasibility is the court’s power to order rectification of the
                    land-register if it is satisfied that a registration was procured through fraud,
                    omission or mistake, as stated in s 160(1)(b) of the Land Titles Act
                    (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed). In this case, the Plaintiff claimed that the
                    Defendant had been dishonest in procuring the registration of the Property in
                    his name, because he had deliberately not disclosed that he had paid rent to her
                    in respect of the Property. As stated in <em>United Overseas Bank
                        Ltd v Bebe bte Mohammad</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 884 at [34]
                    —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The hallmark of fraud is dishonesty or moral turpitude, which usually
                        stems from greed, and greed simply means taking something of value which
                        does not belong to you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Under s 50 of the Land Titles Act 1993 (Act No
                    27 of 1993) (“LTA 1993”) which came into effect in Singapore on
                    1 March 1994, acquisition of title by adverse possession was effectively
                    abolished. However, the LTA 1993 contained transitional provisions (see
                    s 174(8)) to preserve the rights which had already crystallised prior to 1
                    March 1994. While s 174(8) is not found in the edition of the Land Titles
                    Act in force today, <em>ie</em> the Land Titles Act 2004
                    (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA 2004”), it survives and operates
                    by virtue of s 5 of the Revised Edition of the Laws Act (Cap 275, 1995
                    Rev Ed). To this date, the Property is unregistered land, and thus s 50 of
                    the LTA 2004 does not operate to preclude claims of adverse possession that
                    crystallised before 1 March 1994. Therefore, if 12 continuous years of
                    adverse possession had been completed prior to 1 March 1994, the right of
                    ownership over the Property would be preserved by s 174(8) of the LTA 1993
                    read with s 9 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev
                Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At common law, two elements have to be proved
                    in order to substantiate a claim of adverse possession. The first is factual
                    possession, which must be “open, adverse and exclusive” (<em>Elements of Land Law</em> (Kevin Gray and Susan Francis Gray)
                    (OUPS, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed) at p 1180 – 1185), and the
                    second is the <em>animus possidendi</em> – the
                    intention to possess. One issue that has to be dealt with at the outset is
                    whether “factual possession” must be proved by physical occupation
                    of the Property. The Plaintiff did not rely on physical possession of the
                    Property but on the claim that she had received the Payments which were in the
                    nature of rent from December 1971 till December 2008, a period of 37 years. In
                    other words, the Plaintiff claimed that she was the landlord of the Property,
                    and that the Defendant was merely her tenant. The Defendant in contrast, based
                    his claim to the Property on the fact that he had been in continuous physical
                    occupation of the land since 1965.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is generally accepted that factual
                    possession requires “a sufficient degree of <em>physical</em> custody and control” (<em>Tan
                        Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</em> (Tan Sook Yee,
                    Tang Hang Wu and Kelvin K F Low) (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) at page 824).
                    However, “physical” custody and control may require
                    elaboration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Physical occupation of land is neither a
                    necessary nor a sufficient condition for possession in law because a person may
                    in law be in “possession” of land without asserting his physical
                    presence on it. “Possession” and “occupation” are
                    distinct concepts. The common law is replete with examples. (See, <em>eg</em>, <em>Western Australia v
                        Ward</em> (2002) 213 CLR 1 at [518]; and <em>Nicholson v Samuel Property Management Ltd</em> (2002) 217 DLR
                        (4<sup>th</sup>) 292 at [14])). In Singapore, the Court of Appeal held in <em>Soon Peng Yam &amp; Anor (trustees of the Chinese Swimming Club) v
                        Maimon bte Ahmad</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 279
                        (“<em>Soon Peng Yam”</em>), that
                    “a possessor need not personally be in occupation of the land to be in
                    factual possession or to have the requisite <em>animus
                        possidendi</em>” (at [14]). While factual possession implies an “appropriate
                    degree of physical control” (at [11]), it could be assumed, for example, by the collection of
                    rent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    ...factual possession is constituted by a possessor
                            “dealing with the land in question as an occupying owner might
                            have been expected to deal with it”. <em>This
                                clearly contemplates physical possession but it certainly
                                encompasses much more. It is the exercise of acts of ownership which
                                is crucial. Receipt of rent</em> or grant of licence in
                            respect of the property by the respondent <em>would be an
                                act of ownership</em> which is adverse to the title of the
                            club...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If acts of ownership are of paramount importance, it would be unduly
                    restrictive to insist that physical occupation be the sole criterion of factual
                    possession. It is acts of ownership that reflect the nature of adverse
                    possession – the doctrine under which ownership of land passes from the
                    paper owner to an adverse possessor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Plaintiff claimed that she exercised an
                    act of ownership by collecting rent from the Defendant. She claimed that the
                    Payments had been collected by her as rent, from the Defendant since 1971. The
                    Plaintiff testified that the Payments had been made by way of cheque from 1971
                    to 1990, but she only tendered two cheques in evidence made out by Kwong Thye
                    Hin (for the years 1984 and 1989). Since the Payments were allegedly collected
                    at the end of the year, it would be sufficient for the Plaintiff to show that
                    Payments had been tendered for a total of 12 years from the end of 1981 to the
                    end of 1993 (“the relevant period”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In relation to the relevant period, the
                    Plaintiff adduced:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">bank passbook records from 1984 to 1988, and
                            1990;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">two cheques for the years 1984 and 1989;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">receipts handwritten by one Chua Kah Lock
                            (“the Plaintiff’s brother”) from 1981 to
                            1994.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">With regard to (a), there were two sets of bank passbook records, the
                    first of which was an account held jointly by the Plaintiff and her mother,
                    which was operated by the Plaintiff. Sums of $840 were deposited by cheque in
                    1984 and by cash in 1985. The second set of records was an account held jointly
                    by the Plaintiff and her brother, which showed that payments of $840 were
                    deposited by cheque in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1990. For the years where there was
                    no bank record of a sum of $840 being deposited, the Plaintiff claimed that she
                    used the money to pay for her household expenses. I accept this as a reasonable
                    explanation. With regard to (c), on the face of each of the documents was stated
                    that it was a receipt for rent received from Kwong Thye Hin for a specified
                    period. The Defendant had two objections to the purported receipts. First, he
                    claimed that they were of doubtful probative value because they were made out to
                    Kwong Thye Hin and not him personally. However, he had admitted under
                    cross-examination that owing to his stake in the partnership, receipts issued to
                    Kwong Thye Hin were as good receipts issued to him. The Defendant’s second
                    objection was that the receipts for the period 1981 to 1984 were made out to one
                    “Koh Tee Tee”, the Plaintiff’s late mother who died in 1985.
                    The Plaintiff explained that she and her mother collected the Payments together
                    for that period of time, and that she had written her mother’s name on the
                    receipts out of respect for her mother. I accept this explanation. Further, even
                    if the rent had been collected by Koh Tee Tee, the Plaintiff could take over and
                    continue the period of adverse possession that her mother had started on her own
                    behalf, as was held in <em>Jubilee Electronics Pte Ltd and others
                        v Tai Wah Garments and Knitting Factory Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1996] 1 SLR(R) 352 at [42], “[s]o long as the adverse
                    possession continues unbroken, it makes no difference who continues
                    it”. Therefore, the Plaintiff could have continued the adverse possession
                    started by her mother, as evidenced by her collection of rent from 1985 onwards.
                    In sum, I find that the receipts, corroborated by passbook entries and cheques
                    in certain years, prove that the Payments were received by the Plaintiff from
                    the Defendant for the relevant period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I now turn to whether the Payments were in the
                    nature of rent. Mr Samuel Chacko, counsel for the Defendant, submitted that if
                    the Payments were indeed rent, the Plaintiff would have sought to raise the
                    amount paid over the years, given that an annual rent of $840 was incongruous
                    with the favourable location of the Property. He submitted that the Payments
                    were really a form of financial assistance from the Defendant’s family to
                    the Plaintiff’s family. However, I was not convinced. The odd and
                    unexplained figure of $840 was an unusual sum for financial assistance. That
                    might have been more likely had it been a one-off charity, not as an annual
                    payout, for so many years. The Defendant’s claim that the
                    Plaintiff’s family was in dire financial straits from 1956 all the way to
                    2008 was unsubstantiated, and in any event does not necessarily lead to the
                    conclusion that they would have received handouts from the Defendant’s
                    family in the form of the Payments. I find the Plaintiff’s explanation,
                        <em>viz</em> that her father had instructed her not to
                    raise the amount demanded because of his belief that the Property was subject to
                    the Control of Rent Act (Cap 58), to be the more plausible version of
                    events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Defendant was living at the Property
                    during the relevant period, and under cross-examination he testified that he
                    would have to pay rent for staying at the Property, even if it belonged to him.
                    That made no sense and he must have realised this later, and upon
                    re-examination, he changed his testimony, claiming that it was Kwong Thye Hin
                    which had paid rent, not for the Property, but in respect of a warehouse on the
                    corner of Amoy Street. Kwong Thye Hin’s tax records from the years 1965,
                    1967, and 1969 show that the partnership had made some payments for the single
                    itemised amount of “Rent, Water, Light” every year. The Defendant
                    had not made the tax records for the relevant period available, but it was clear
                    that Kwong Thye Hin had to pay some form of rent in the past. The Defendant
                    claimed that the word “Rent” referred to the rent for the
                    warehouse and the words “Water, Light” referred to the utilities
                    for the Property. I do not find his explanation at all convincing. The warehouse
                    did not feature in the Defendant’s case or evidence until the
                    re-examination stage of the proceedings, and appeared to be an afterthought.
                    Moreover, it is absurd that in the single itemised amount of “Rent,
                    Water, Light”, “Rent” was attributed to one property and
                    “Water and Light” to another, without the document making this
                    explicit on its face. Given the context in which the Payments were given and
                    received, I find that they were in the nature of rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having established that the Plaintiff had
                    exercised ownership by collecting rent from the Defendant, I now return to the
                    other requirements for factual possession, namely, that it be open, adverse and
                    exclusive. Only the latter two requirements are controversial in the instant
                    case. The requirement that possession be adverse means that the possession must
                    be without the consent of the paper owner. The Plaintiff’s collection of
                    rent was clearly without the consent of the paper owner. The Defendant’s
                    physical occupation was also against the consent of the paper owner, but since
                    he had been paying rent to the Plaintiff, he was in physical occupation of the
                    Property only with her consent and he thus cannot show that he had adversely
                    possessed the Property as against the Plaintiff. His claim fails on this point
                    alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The requirement that possession be exclusive
                    means that the claimant must have excluded the whole world including the paper
                    owner. However, this requirement being also a necessary component of a tenancy,
                    which is defined as exclusive possession at a term (<em>Street v
                        Mountford</em> [1985] UKHL 4) with rent optional (<em>Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold</em> [1988] EWCA Civ 14) presents an
                    ostensible obstacle to the Plaintiff’s case. If she had granted exclusive
                    possession to the Defendant in the lease, could she have have satisfied the
                    requirement of exclusive possession herself? Mr Edwin Lee, counsel for the
                    Plaintiff, relied on the case of <em>Soon Peng Yam</em> in
                    which the appellant claimant sought to vindicate her title to the land by way of
                    adverse possession against the respondent paper owner. The claimant was
                    initially in physical occupation of the land and then later moved off the land
                    and tenanted it out to a third party. The Court of Appeal (at [17]) held that the claimant was in exclusive
                    possession of the land during the time she was in physical occupation of the
                    land, and further, after the claimant had granted the lease, she continued to be
                    in adverse possession of the land <em>through her
                        tenants</em>” (at [13]) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Court of Appeal’s dicta that a
                    landlord can satisfy the requirements of adverse possession through her tenants
                    is not consistent with the fact that the landlord has granted exclusive
                    possession to the tenant in the lease. The nature of exclusive possession is
                    that it is exclusive. The landlord and tenant cannot both concurrently enjoy
                    this exclusivity. As stated above (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>)
                    the doctrine of adverse possession is one under which the ownership of land can
                    change from the paper owner to the adverse possessor. If the exercise of acts of
                    ownership has been proved on the part of the would-be adverse possessor, the
                    requirement of exclusive possession should not prove a stumbling block to him or
                    her. The two concepts are discrete, and while the law does not hold that one
                    implies the other, they bear an important relation to each other. Exclusive
                    possession is an incident, not an exclusive definition, of ownership. While it
                    is true that a tenant has exclusive possession even though he is not the owner,
                    he only has exclusive possession by way of grant from the landlord, and
                    acknowledges that another is the owner. In the context of adverse possession,
                    exclusive possession is treated as a mere incident of the larger consideration,
                    which is to show that the would-be adverse possessor was dealing with the land
                    as an owner would. As the Plaintiff’s collection of rent is an act of
                    ownership, I am of the view that even though she was not in exclusive possession
                    during the relevant period, she had, nonetheless, fulfilled the requirement of
                    factual possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Plaintiff still needed to prove that she
                    had demonstrated the <em>animus possidendi. Tan Sook
                        Yee</em> at page 824, described <em>animus
                        possidendi</em> (“the <em>animus</em>”) as “an intention to exercise such custody and
                    control on one’s own behalf and for one’s own benefit”, and
                    the “requisite intention is one to possess, not to own”. In our
                    case, the Plaintiff’s intention was one to own and not to possess, and the
                    question remained as to whether that would that preclude her claim to adverse
                    possession. The intention to own is a more precise and exacting intention than
                    the intention to possess. Adverse possession is a doctrine under which the
                    ownership of land may change from the paper owner to the adverse possessor, and
                    if the would-be adverse possessor himself has the more specific and relevant
                    intention of ownership, then this should adequately demonstrate his <em>animus</em>. The standard definition of <em>animus</em> in <em>Tan Sook Yee</em> required
                    merely the intent to possess only because it was a more general intention and a
                    more easily satisfied requirement than the intention to own.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In previous cases where the claimant was not
                    in physical occupation of the property, acts such as paying property tax,
                    utilities and carrying out maintenance and repair work for the property were
                    held to be evidence of the <em>animus</em> (see <em>Soon Peng Yam</em> and <em>Tan Ah Suan v Ng
                        Aik Kern and Others</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 1135). In the present
                    case, the Plaintiff has done none of the above. On the contrary, it was the
                    Defendant who paid the taxes and the utility bills in respect of the Property.
                    Although the Plaintiff was aware that the Defendant intended to undertake
                    extensive renovation to the Property in 1994, she did not ask the Defendant for
                    either the plans or the bank loans obtained for the purposes of the same. I do
                    not think that she would have lost the requisite <em>animus</em> on that account. It was clear that the Plaintiff’s
                    continued to receive the Payments in the resolute belief that they were rent.
                    She explained that she did not pay property tax and the utility charges because
                    she was already collecting such a low sum of rent and it would not be
                    commercially viable for her to make these additional payments in respect of the
                    Property. I accepted her explanation which seemed plausible in the
                    circumstances. I find that the Plaintiff’s collection of rent from the
                    Defendant constituted an act of ownership, and that she had been dealing with
                    the Property as if a landlord-owner would for 37 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In conclusion, I find that the Plaintiff has
                    demonstrated both factual possession and the requisite <em>animus</em> and is thus able to claim ownership over the Property on
                    the basis of adverse possession. I declare that the Plaintiff is the owner of
                    and is entitled to all the rights and title to and possession of the Property,
                    and grant an order that the Registrar of Titles registers her as the proprietor
                    of the Property. The land-register must be rectified, by cancelling the
                    registration the Defendant obtained on the basis of the Order of Court, on the
                    grounds of fraud.</p>
