<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the plaintiff, Sanae Achar
                    (“Achar”), against the decision of the learned assistant registrar
                    (“AR”) who allowed the application of the defendant, Sci-Gen Ltd
                    (“Sci-Gen”), in Summons No 4406 of 2010 (“Summons
                    4406/2010”) for specific discovery of documents pursuant to O 24
                    r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Rules of Court”). After hearing both parties, I dismissed
                    Achar’s appeal. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Achar was a former employee of Sci-Gen. She
                    commenced Suit No 222 of 2010 (“the Suit”) against Sci-Gen
                    for salary and benefits allegedly owed to her by Sci-Gen under the terms of her
                    employment with Sci-Gen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Achar’s claim against Sci-Gen is based on
                    her employment contract with Sci-Gen (“the Employment Contract”),
                    which commenced in April 2008 and was due to expire three years later in
                    April 2011. According to Achar, the Employment Contract provided that in
                    the event Sci-Gen terminated her employment by notice prior to the end of her
                    employment period with Sci-Gen (<em>ie</em>
                    April 2011), Sci-Gen was to pay to Achar the balance of her salaries until
                    the end of that employment period. Achar alleged that she was terminated by
                    Sci-Gen with notice on 1 December 2008, less than eight months through
                    her employment contract. Notice for Achar’s termination was allegedly
                    given for and on behalf of Sci-Gen by Saul Mashaal (“Saul”),
                    Sci-Gen’s chairman and chief executive officer at the relevant time.
                    Accordingly, Achar maintained that she was entitled to be compensated for the
                    remaining months up till the end of the Employment Contract in
                    April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sci-Gen’s position, however, was that it
                    had not terminated Achar’s employment on 1 December 2008.
                    Rather, the alleged notice of termination and related documents therein had only
                    been given by Saul to Achar after the former’s termination as
                    Sci-Gen’s chairman and chief executive officer on 20 April 2009,
                    and backdated to 1 December 2008. Backdating was done so as to allow
                    Achar to procure the remainder of her employment benefits under the Employment
                    Contract without performance of her duties thereunder. As Sci-Gen believed that
                    Achar had falsely alleged that she had been given the notice of termination,
                    Sci-Gen terminated Achar’s employment pursuant to the Employment Contract
                    on 29 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the course of the Suit, Sci-Gen took out an
                    application for discovery of particular documents. The AR heard Sci-Gen’s
                    discovery application on 27 October 2010 and allowed discovery of the
                    following documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     An electronic mail
                        (“email”) from Saul to Achar allegedly dated
                        1 December 2008 (“the Alleged 1 December
                        Email”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     An email from Saul to Achar allegedly dated 15 December 2008
                        (“the Alleged 15 December Email”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     All emails from Saul to Achar received
                        between 1 December 2008 and 29 May 2009, stored on
                        Achar’s computer(s), notebook(s), external hard drive(s), external
                        hard disk(s) or any other external storage device or medium, and/or
                        Achar’s online email account on the domain
                    yahoo.com.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     All
                        emails from Achar to Saul sent between 1 December 2008 and
                        29 May 2009, stored on Achar’s computer(s), notebook(s),
                        external hard drive(s), external hard disk(s) or any other external storage
                        device or medium, and/or Achar’s online email account on the domain
                        yahoo.com.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     All
                        emails which include any of the following search words or phrases or any
                        combination thereof, <em>viz</em>,
                        “Saul”, “Saul Mashaal”,
                        “termination”, “terminate”,
                        “leave”, or “vacation”, stored on Achar’s
                        computer(s), notebook(s), external hard drive(s), external hard disk(s) or
                        any other external storage device or medium, and/or Achar’s online
                        email account on the domain yahoo.com, the duration of discovery being
                        limited to the period between 1 December 2008 and
                        31 July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The documents in respect of which
                    the AR ordered discovery can be broadly grouped into three categories. The first
                    category, corresponding to items (a) and (b) at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, consisted of emails allegedly terminating
                    Achar’s employment with Sci-Gen (henceforth referred to as “the
                    Category 1 Documents”). The second category, corresponding to items (c)
                    and (d) at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, consisted of email
                    exchanges between Achar and Saul between 1 December 2008 and
                    29 May 2009 (henceforth referred to as “the Category 2
                    Documents”). The third and final category, corresponding to item (e) at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, consists of emails sent and
                    received between 1 December 2008 and 31 July 2009, which
                    contain various search words and phrases (henceforth referred to as “the
                    Category 3 Documents”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The AR further ordered that the documents to be
                    disclosed were to be provided in an electronic, text searchable and structured
                    format. They were to also include the names of the electronic files constituting
                    or containing the relevant electronic documents, as well as the file formats
                    (and their versions) of the said documents. The AR also allowed Sci-Gen to
                    inspect the disclosed documents in their native format. Dissatisfied with the
                    discovery order made by the AR, Achar appealed against the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A party to a litigation has an obligation to
                    disclose to the opposing party all documents which are, or have been, in his
                    possession, custody or power that are relevant to the issues in dispute. This is
                    the process of discovery and the court may make an order to do so under
                    O 24 r 1 of the Rules of Court. Where the court is of the view that
                    any party has not disclosed any such document, the court may order that party to
                    give discovery thereof. This is known as specific discovery which the court may
                    order under O 24 r 5. To be susceptible to an order for specific
                    discovery, a document must fulfil certain requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       First, the document must be relevant (see
                        <em>Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 465 (“<em>Tan
                        Chin Seng</em>”) at [18]). In respect of discovery of specific documents, O 24
                    r 5(3) of the Rules of Court describes a relevant document to be:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>(a)</em> a document on which the party relies or
                        will rely;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>(b)</em> a document which could
                        -</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) adversely affect his own case;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) adversely affect another party's case; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iii) support another party's case; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>(c)</em> a document which may lead
                        the party seeking discovery of it to a train of inquiry resulting in his
                        obtaining information which may –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) adversely affect his own case;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) adversely affect another party's case; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iii) support another party's case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Whether a document is one on which the party seeking
                    discovery relies or will rely upon, or one which could adversely affect that
                    party’s case, or adversely affect or support another party’s case,
                    would depend on the issues pleaded by the parties in the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Second, even if the document is established to
                    be relevant, O 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court further prescribes an
                    overriding principle that discovery is to be ordered only if “necessary
                    either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving
                    costs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the context of an application for discovery
                    and inspection (including the supply of copies) of electronically stored
                    documents, the Supreme Court Practice Direction No 3 of 2009 (“the
                    e-Discovery PD”) establishes an opt-in framework which parties may adopt
                    (see <em>Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen and others</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 125, which considered the application of the opt-in
                    framework). The e-Discovery PD supplements the traditional tests of relevancy
                    and necessity by articulating a non-exhaustive list of matters which the court
                    will consider while applying these existing legal principles of discovery. These
                    matters are listed at para 43D of the e-Discovery PD and include:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the number of
                            electronic documents
                            involved;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the nature of the
                            case and complexity of the
                            issues;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the value of the
                            claim and the financial position of each
                            party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the ease and expense
                            of retrieval of any particular electronically stored document or class
                            of electronically stored documents, including –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    the accessibility, location and likelihood of
                                locating any relevant documents,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   the costs of recovering and giving discovery
                                and inspection of any relevant documents,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   the likelihood that any relevant documents
                                will be materially altered in the course of recovery, or the giving
                                of discovery or inspection; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    the significance of any particular electronically
                            stored document or class of electronically stored documents which are
                            likely to be located to the issues in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The phrase “electronically stored documents” is not
                    defined in the e-Discovery PD. In my view, it is not necessary to define this
                    term as it should be given its natural meaning as used in our modern day
                    context. On this approach, this term will include a wide range of electronic
                    documents, <em>eg</em>, word processor documents,
                    spreadsheets, presentation slides, and image files. Case law has also included
                    within the scope of “documents” electronically stored documents
                    like:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The e-Discovery PD was introduced in 2009 with
                    the aim of providing guidance on how existing legal principles pertaining to the
                    discovery process could be applied in respect of electronically stored
                    documents. One of its objectives is to promote the exchange of electronically
                    stored documents in a text searchable electronic form (in lieu of printed
                    copies) so that parties may capitalise on the twin benefits of digitisation,
                        <em>viz</em>, the ability to run keyword searches on
                    the documents in question as well as easy management of the same. This also has
                    the added benefit of avoiding unnecessary photocopying or printing of
                    electronically stored documents. The e-Discovery PD also prefers the inspection
                    and supply of copies of electronic documents in their native formats without any
                    interference with the documents’ “metadata information”.
                    Metadata literally means “data about data”. Paragraph 43A(3)
                    of the e-Discovery PD describes “metadata information” as
                    “the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or
                    associated with electronically stored documents”. Metadata information
                    may sometimes be relevant at trial, for instance, when data relating to the
                    authorship history, date of creation and modification of a particular file or
                    document is in issue. Paragraph 43G of the e-Discovery PD prohibits the
                    deletion, removal or alteration of metadata information internally stored in the
                    native format of discoverable electronically stored documents without consent by
                    the relevant parties or leave of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The introduction of the e-Discovery PD was a
                    response to the increasing tendency for documents to be generated and held
                    electronically. In my view, its introduction was timely, given the unprecedented
                    volume of documents which are created and stored electronically today
                    (attributed, in part, to the ease at which multiple copies of the same document,
                    especially emails, are stored at multiple locations, <em>eg</em>, personal computers, servers, network drives, and other
                    assorted backup media, for indefinite periods of time, and at relatively low
                    costs), the relative ease of duplicating such documents (by way of illustration,
                    the same email may be sent to multiple recipients, who may reply to one or more
                    recipients on the email thread, copying in other recipients, or forwarding the
                    message on to others), the often haphazard manner in which electronic documents
                    are stored, the different document retention policies of parties (some may
                    routinely delete electronic documents to maximise the use of storage capacity
                    whereas others may retain records of all electronic documents), the existence of
                    metadata information, and the fact that it is more difficult to completely
                    dispose of electronically stored documents than printed ones (it is common for
                    residual traces of an electronic document to remain on a computer’s
                    storage system, despite deletion of the same from the user’s active
                    data).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With technology fuelling an unprecedented
                    explosion of the volume of discoverable documents and the ease of their
                    duplication, it is not surprising that the traditional manner in which discovery
                    has been carried out is proving increasingly inefficient in achieving the
                    purposes for which the discovery process was developed. Discovery was originally
                    an equitable remedy premised on the idea that it was unconscionable for a party
                    to conceal evidence material to a fair conclusion. Its aim was that of enabling
                    parties to acquire information which is material to their case but in the
                    possession, power or custody of their opponents. Discovery was directed towards
                    the just and fair adjudication of an action as it ensured that all material and
                    relevant facts were placed before the court for its consideration. These
                    purposes remain relevant as ever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     One way to cope with the burgeoning volume of
                    discoverable documents is to rely on technology itself. Technology has thrown up
                    countless tools which make editing, copying, reviewing and searching through the
                    textual content of documents considerably less cumbersome than before. For
                    example, parties need not manually trawl through heaps of printed documents in
                    order to identify relevant documents and weed out irrelevant ones. Running
                    simple keyword searches using easy-to-use desktop search engines would suffice.
                    It is also easier to manage and organise electronically stored documents,
                    especially where printed copies of such documents run into tomes and cartons.
                    The e-Discovery PD recognises the tremendous potential of technology in
                    modernising the discovery process. Thus, it encourages the exchange and supply
                    of copies of discoverable electronic documents in soft copy by creating a
                    framework for the inspection and discovery of electronically stored documents
                    within boundaries established by existing legal principles. In supplementing the
                    traditional tests for whether applications for discovery of documents should be
                    granted (the applicable tests remain that of relevancy and necessity either for
                    the fair disposal of the matter or for saving costs) <em>vis-a-vis</em> electronically stored documents, the e-Discovery PD
                    identifies specific factors which are to be considered (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). These factors were principally
                    adapted from the UK Practice Direction Part 31B on “Disclosure of
                    Electronic Documents”. At the same time, the e-Discovery PD also
                    acknowledges that the costs of e-discovery could potentially be disproportionate
                    to the value of the claims and the significance of the issues in dispute.
                    Accordingly, the e-Discovery PD also introduced mechanisms in anticipation of
                    this problem. For instance, the e-Discovery PD contemplates the conduct of
                    general discovery in stages – see para 43B of the e-Discovery PD and
                    also <em>Goodale &amp; Ors v The Ministry of Justice &amp;
                        Ors</em> [2010] EWHC B40 (QB), at [22]–[23]. It also sets out rules which require limits to be imposed
                    on the scope of requests for discovery by keyword searches. The factors listed
                    at para 43D of the e-Discovery PD were also introduced to keep costs within
                    reasonable limits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It was with the e-Discovery PD’s
                    guidance on the adaptation of the traditional tests of relevance and necessity
                    in mind, including the matters listed at para 43D therein, that I turned to
                    consider the present application. I was of the view that all three categories of
                    electronically-stored documents which Sci-Gen sought discovery of were either
                    directly or indirectly relevant to the issue of whether Saul had given Achar the
                    notice of termination while he was still in Sci-Gen’s employment. I did
                    not think that discovery of the same would lead to costs disproportionate to the
                    nature of the case, the value of the claims and the complexity of the issues in
                    dispute, so long as certain limits were imposed on the scope of disclosure. I
                    also did not consider that the volume of electronic documents to be searched
                    justified not ordering the disclosure of the documents sought by Sci-Gen. I
                    hence ordered discovery of those documents, but within specific defined
                    boundaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Category 1 Documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In respect of the Category 1 Documents, the
                    emails therein are relevant to and necessary for the determination of whether
                    Saul had given Achar the notice of termination whilst in Sci-Gen’s
                    employment as both the Alleged 1 December Email and the Alleged
                    15 December Email referred to the alleged termination on
                    1 December 2008 and their existence would either support Achar’s
                    claim and/or adversely affect Sci-Gen’s defence that the Category 1
                    Documents were backdated. The Alleged 1 December Email was stated in
                    Summons 4406/2010 (the Annex section) to read, <em>inter
                        alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>“Further to my communication dated December 1st,
                            2008 I hereby give you thirty (30) days notice of termination of
                            employment effective December 1st, 2008. As per my letter addressed to
                            you of the same date we shall honour the employment
                            agreement.”</em> [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, the Annex section of Summons 4406/2010 quoted the Alleged
                    15 December Email as stating, <em>inter
                    alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>“you need not apply for leave as you have been
                            terminated from your employment on December 1st, 2008 ... You [sic]
                            request for a leave of absence starting April 20th thru [sic] May 15th,
                            2009 is hereby approved.”</em> [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Achar argued that the Category 1 Documents are
                    not directly relevant to the parties’ pleaded cases as both the statement
                    of claim and defence had been amended such that all references to the Category 1
                    Documents had been removed, and that Sci-Gen had not pleaded that the Category 1
                    Documents were backdated. However, the removal of all references to the Category
                    1 Documents in the amended statement of claim and defence did not and could not
                    render those documents any less relevant than they previously were when they
                    were so pleaded, for express reference (or otherwise) of particular documents in
                    the parties’ pleadings is independent of the relevancy of those documents
                    to the parties’ cases. The relevancy of documents sought in discovery is
                    determined <em>vis-a-vis</em> the substance of the
                    parties’ pleaded cases or allegations. This test of relevancy goes beyond
                    the perusal of pleadings for express references to the documents sought for. If
                    documents in respect of which discovery could be ordered were restricted to
                    those referred to in the pleadings and no more, the amount of documents which
                    would be excluded from discovery would be significant. It is thus my view that
                    explicit references in the pleadings to documents in respect of which discovery
                    is sought is helpful, but is not a pre-requisite, for establishing
                    relevancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Category 2 Documents </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Turning to the Category 2 Documents, these are
                    also relevant to the parties’ pleaded cases, as Achar’s claim is
                    premised on her assertion that Sci-Gen, through Saul, had terminated her
                    employment on 1 December 2008, and Sci-Gen’s defence in response
                    to Achar’s claim is that of backdating, <em>ie</em>,
                    Saul had only begun signing and/or sending the various documents purporting to
                    terminate Achar’s employment with Sci-Gen on or after he himself had been
                    terminated by Sci-Gen on 20 April 2009. The email correspondences
                    between Achar and Saul from 1 December 2008 (the date Achar claimed
                    she had been terminated) and 29 May 2009 (the date Sci-Gen alleged it
                    had terminated Achar without notice) could shed some light on the status of
                    Achar’s employment during this period, thereby supporting or adversely
                    affecting the parties’ respective cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Achar argued that Sci-Gen’s request for
                    discovery of all email exchanges between herself and Saul from
                    1 December 2008 to 29 May 2009 was in effect a request to
                    “fish” through all of her emails in the hope that some beneficial
                    or advantageous evidence might, on the off-chance, surface. However, I was of
                    the view that Sci-Gen’s request for the Category 2 Documents was not
                    overly wide, as Sci-Gen had limited the scope of the emails sought to a time
                    period, which boundaries were determined with respect to the disputed dates of
                    termination. To my mind, the proposed time frame was a reasonable
                one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Category 3 Documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As for the Category 3 Documents, Sci-Gen
                    requested for emails containing the following search words or phrases or any
                    combination thereof, <em>viz</em>, “Saul”,
                    “Saul Mashaal”, “termination”,
                    “terminate”, “leave”, and/or
                    “vacation”. Its request was drafted pursuant to para 43C(2)
                    of the e-Discovery PD, which concerns electronic searches of electronic
                    documents using specified words or strings of words. Paragraph 43C(2) of the
                    e-Discovery PD provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    electronically stored documents which form the subject of a discovery request
                    “may be described by specifying or describing a search term or phrase to
                    be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents”. This
                    paragraph could be said to have arisen from the invention of computer search
                    engines, which allow parties to conduct textual searches of electronically
                    stored documents. The availability of textual searches thus created a new way to
                    describe a class of documents for which discovery is sought. Compared to the
                    traditional manner of describing classes of documents, this new way of
                    describing a class of documents by reference to a search phrase in fact lessens
                    the burden of the party from whom discovery is sought, as it digitises what was
                    once a manual and often tedious process of search and review through huge
                    volumes of documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     To my mind, there is a sufficient likelihood
                    that emails significant and relevant to the action would be retrieved following
                    a search conducted using the requested words or phrases. Sci-Gen explained that
                    the search terms “Saul” and “Saul Mashaal” were
                    intended to capture email exchanges between Achar and Saul which involved
                    Achar’s Sci-Gen work email account and which Achar subsequently forwarded
                    to her personal email account and/or third parties. Sci-Gen presented evidence
                    of such forwarding to me and argued that such emails would fall outside the
                    ambit of the Category 2 Documents. I thus allowed its request in this respect.
                    As for emails which contain the words “termination” or
                    “terminate”, Sci-Gen explained that conducting a search using
                    these terms would throw up emails in which Achar’s termination was
                    discussed. These emails would thus be relevant to the cases of both parties.
                    Accordingly, I also allowed its request <em>vis-a-vis</em>
                    these two words. Finally, Sci-Gen argued that its request for discovery of
                    emails containing the words “vacation” or “leave”
                    arose out of Achar’s pleaded case that she had informed Saul in
                    mid-December 2008 of her intention to utilise her annual leave for the
                    period of 20 April 2009 to 15 May 2009, but was informed by
                    Saul in writing that she need not apply for leave as she had been terminated
                    from Sci-Gen’s employment on 1 December 2008. As these emails
                    pertain to Achar’s position in her pleaded case, I also allowed
                    Sci-Gen’s request. However, I restricted the scope of Sci-Gen’s
                    request to emails created, received or modified between
                    1 December 2008 and 29 June 2009. The end date of
                    29 June 2009 was imposed because Achar claimed that she stopped having
                    access to her Sci-Gen work email account on or about 28 June 2009. I
                    believed that such restrictions by time kept Sci-Gen’s searches within
                    reasonable limits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Possession, custody or power</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Achar resisted Sci-Gen’s discovery
                    application <em>vis-a-vis</em> all three categories of
                    documents on the ground that she had since returned the laptop in which all of
                    the emails were situated to Sci-Gen and thus no longer had “possession,
                    custody or power” over the electronic copies of those emails which
                    Sci-Gen sought. She also argued that she did not store any of the said emails on
                    any external storage device or medium. I was of the view that if Achar no longer
                    had possession, custody or power over the electronic copies of the documents
                    which form the subject of the discovery application, the onus would be on Achar,
                    pursuant to O 24 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court, to state this fact on
                    affidavit, together with an explanation of why she no longer had possession,
                    custody or power over them, when she parted with them, and what has become of
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Scope of the parties’ obligations with regard to the discovery
                of the ordered documents </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Having explained the basis for ordering
                    discovery of the Category 1, 2, and 3 Documents, I briefly turn to the extent of
                    Achar’s and Sci-Gen’s obligations. Pursuant to my discovery order,
                    Achar must, <em>inter alia</em>, disclose the documents
                    specified in the order, carry out a search to the extent stated in the order,
                    and disclose any documents located as a result of that search. So long as Achar
                    has complied with the terms of that order, as well as all the necessary
                    requirements stated in the Rules of Court, Sci-Gen would have to accept that
                    Achar had fulfilled her discovery obligations, notwithstanding the fact that
                    there could well be emails not caught by the search engine employed. As
                    Morgan J (echoing a point made by Jacob LJ in <em>Nichia Corporation v Argos Limited</em>
                    [2007] EWCA Civ 741 at [50] to [52]) articulated in <em>Digicel (St Lucia) Ltd v Cable &amp; Wireless Plc</em>
                    [2008] EWHC 2522 (Ch) at [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he [discovery] rules do not require that no stone should be
                        left unturned. This may mean that a relevant document, even “a
                        smoking gun” is not found. This attitude is justified by
                        considerations of proportionality. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, it would be best if the parties can, prior to any
                    search, agree on which search engine or software is to be used, the preparation
                    of the search engine prior to conducting the searches (<em>eg</em>, updating the search index or causing a fresh search index to
                    be made) and how searches are to be conducted. This would minimise potential
                    disputes as to whether the parties have discharged their discovery
                    obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the result, I dismissed Achar’s
                    appeal and upheld, with slight modifications, the AR’s order. I ordered
                    Achar to disclose the Category 1, 2 and 3 Documents, with disclosure of the
                    Category 3 Documents to be limited to the period between
                    1 December 2008 and 29 June 2009. I also ordered costs to be
                    fixed at $1,500.</p>
