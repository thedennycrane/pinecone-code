<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The issue in this matter is whether the parties
                    in these divorce proceedings had agreed between themselves to vary the orders on
                    the division of two properties which were their matrimonial
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff Ng Irene was the wife (“the
                    wife”), and the defendant Tan Meng Heng Robin was the husband
                    (“the husband”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the course of the divorce proceedings, an
                    order was made by Justice Woo Bih Li on 9 February 2010 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[5](e)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Plaintiff is to transfer her interest in 14
                            Stratton Walk, Singapore 806765 [“the Stratton Walk
                            property”] to the Defendant provided that the Defendant is to
                            refund the Plaintiff’s CPF contribution with accrued interest
                            towards the purchase of the said property.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[5](f)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Defendant is to transfer his interest in
                            511 Yio Chu Kang Road, #01-04, The Calrose, Singapore 787066
                            [“the Calrose property”] to the Plaintiff and the
                            Defendant is to pay off the entire outstanding housing loan thereon as
                            well as to refund the Plaintiff and his own CPF contributions with
                            accrued interest towards the purchase of the said
                        property.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[5](h)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The transfers of the two properties are to be
                            done simultaneously and within five (5) months from the date of this
                            Order or such other extended date as the parties may agree
                        to.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The effect of the order was that the husband was to have the
                    Stratton Walk property and the wife was to have the Calrose property, and that
                    the transfers were to take place within five months (by 9 July
                    2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties did not transfer the properties
                    after the order was made. Instead, they engaged in an exchange of correspondence
                    referred to in the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 14 April 2010 the husband’s
                    solicitors wrote and informed the wife’s solicitors that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have our client’s latest instructions:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">to propose to vary the Order of Court dated

                            and/or a transfer of No.14 Stratton Walk to your client’s name
                            wholly, whilst our client takes sole ownership of #01-04, The
                            Calrose.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please therefore revert to us within the next three (3) days from the date
                        hereof <em>so that we can do the needful on the conveyance of
                            the two matrimonial properties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 19 April 2010 the husband’s
                    solicitors sent a reminder to the wife’s solicitors requesting them to
                    “revert as soon as possible on the ‘swapping’ of properties
                    under the Order of Court”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 20 April 2010 the wife’s
                    solicitors responded to the letter of 14 April 2010, stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We regret to inform you that after much
                            consideration, our client is not agreeable to your client’s
                            proposal. We are instructed that she will abide by the Order as it
                            stands.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The husband did not give up on his proposal. On
                    21 April 2010 his solicitors wrote to the wife’s solicitors,
                    stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]e would urge your client to re-consider seriously to ‘swap’
                        the 2 properties; failing which we will still proceed with our separate
                        application to Court to vary the Order of Court dated
                            9<sup>th</sup> February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We shall seek an extension of time from the Courts to attend to the
                        conveyancing matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no request for a reply in three days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 3 June 2010 the wife’s
                    solicitors replied that she agreed to and accepted the proposed swap. Quite
                    inexplicably and regrettably, both counsel did not see it fit to exhibit this
                    letter in the parties’ affidavits. However, this letter was referred to in
                    the wife’s solicitors’ letter of 25 August 2010 and also in the
                    husband’s written submissions, and its existence was not
                disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 25 August 2010 the wife’s
                    solicitors wrote to the husband’s solicitors, stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You will recall that your client had requested for
                            a swap of properties vide your letters to us dated 21 April 2010
                            and 14 April 2010 i.e. that our client was to take the Stratton
                            Walk property in place of the Calrose property and your client would
                            take the Calrose property in place of the Stratton Walk property. By our
                            letter of 3 June 2010, we had on our client’s instructions
                            agreed to and accepted the requested swap.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As you know, the Order provided that the transfers
                            of the properties were to be effected within 5 months from the date of
                            the said order. It is now more than 5 months and we have as yet to
                            receive the transfer documents from your client to enable our client to
                            transfer all her share interest and estate in the Calrose apartment to
                            your client and for your client to transfer all his share interest and
                            estate in the Stratton Walk property to our client.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The letter of 25 August 2010 did not
                    bring any satisfaction to the wife, and on 16 September 2010, she filed the
                    present application to vary the Order of Court of 9 February 2010 to give
                    effect to the swap.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In her affidavit filed in support of the
                    application the wife exhibited the letters referred to in <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> to <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> <em>supra</em>. She stated that after she had accepted the
                    husband’s swap offer by the letter of 3 June 2010 the husband
                    ‘did nothing’, and her solicitors had to follow up with the letter
                    of 25 August 2010. (The husband’s inaction will be considered
                    later.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The husband opposed the application. In his
                    affidavit filed on 28 September 2010, he gave the reasons for his
                    objection. He deposed at [4] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason is that I am in the course of compliance with the said Order in
                        respect of the transfer of the property known as No.14 Stratton Walk,
                        Singapore 806765 (hereinafter referred to as ‘The Stratton’) to
                        my sole name and transfer of the property known as 511 Yio Chu Kang Road,
                        #01-04, The Calrose, Singapore 787066 (hereinafter referred to as ‘The
                        Calrose’) to the Plaintiff solely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and added at [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, by my solicitor’s said letter dated
                            14<sup>th</sup> [April] 2010, it was clearly stated that
                        I wanted a response from the Plaintiff in 3 day’s time whether my
                        proposal was agreeable to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s
                        solicitor’s replied on 20<sup>th</sup> April 2010
                        telling us that the Plaintiff is not in agreement to my proposal to swap
                        properties. However, the Plaintiff changed her mind and chose to revert to
                        us only on 3<sup>rd</sup> June 2010 that she would accept
                        the ‘swap’ of the properties; that is to say that she would take
                        over The Stratton whilst I would take over The Calrose. I say now that I am
                        not obliged to let the Plaintiff have The Stratton.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the written submissions dated 8 November 2010, the
                    husband’s solicitors argued that when the wife accepted the offer on
                    3 June 2010 it was 50 days after the offer of 14 April 2010 which was
                    open for only three days. The principal, if not sole basis, of the
                    defendant’s case was that the offer to swap had lapsed by the time the
                    wife accepted it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The husband’s solicitors should not rely
                    on the letter of 14 April 2010 in isolation. That letter was followed by
                    the letters of 19 April 2010 and 21 April 2010 where the husband
                    persuaded the wife to agree to the swap proposal. It was wrong in law and in
                    fact to argue that the offer had lapsed when it was not accepted within three
                    days from 14 April 2010. Clearly the husband had extended his offer in the
                    subsequent letters and abandoned the 17 April 2010 deadline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I would add that the reference to the three
                    days in the letter of 14 April 2010 is open to a different construction,
                    which is more consistent with the contents of the letter, that the writers asked
                    for a reply in three days to allow time to arrange the transfers, and not that
                    the offer was to lapse after three days. It should be noted that the letter was
                    written by lawyers. If they had wanted to inform the wife that the offer was
                    open for three days, one would expect them to state that in clear
                terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The husband’s conduct showed that he did
                    not consider the offer to have lapsed by 17 April 2010. He did not dispute
                    that when the wife’s evidence that she accepted the offer on 3 June
                    2010, he did nothing. If he thought that that offer had lapsed, and was no
                    longer open for acceptance, the most natural thing for him to do would be to
                    tell her that the offer had lapsed, and that he no longer wished to swap the
                    properties, and to ask her to proceed with the transfers in accordance with the
                    Order of Court. Instead, he did nothing, and the wife’s solicitors had to
                    send the reminder of 25 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The husband only responded after the wife
                    filed on 16 September 2010 the present application to amend the Order of
                    Court. In his affidavit filed on 28 September 2010 he said in [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I say <b><em>now</em></b> that I am not obliged to let the
                        Plaintiff have The Stratton. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is significant that he did not say that the offer had lapsed, when
                    it lapsed, or that he had informed the wife that that offer had
                lapsed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The husband deposed a second affidavit on
                    4 November 2010 in which he exhibited a letter dated 27 October 2010
                    to the wife’s solicitors. In this letter the husband’s solicitors
                    wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In compliance with the Order of Court dated 9<sup>th</sup>
                        February 2010, we now forward herewith the necessary conveyancing documents

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please sign and return the documents to us within seven (7) days from the

                        sign. Thereafter, the loan can be disbursed within (7) seven days of the
                        Bank’s execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your client shall have The Calrose free of encumbrances and your client
                        shall have a full refund of her CPF’s monies with accrued interest

                        documents on the 2 said matrimonial properties are duly executed and
                        registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly advise your client to render her full co-operation on the
                        conveyancing matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This was a curious letter. The writers were
                    aware that there was a pending application to vary the Order of Court of
                    2 February 2010, nevertheless they sought the wife’s “full
                    co-operation on the conveyancing matter”. It is inexplicable that even at
                    this stage, the solicitors did not inform the wife’s solicitors that the
                    swap offer had lapsed before it was accepted if that was the husband’s
                    position at that time. (That position was only stated on 9 November 2010 in
                    the written submissions.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I find that the husband had not withdrawn his
                    offer on or before 3 June 2010. The question is whether the husband’s
                    offer to swap the properties was open when the wife accepted it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The rights of the parties can be ascertained
                    from the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     under the Order of Court of
                        9 February 2010 the husband was to have the Stratton Walk property and
                        the wife was to have the Carlose property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     the husband made the initial offer to swap on
                        14 April 2010, which according to him was expressed to be open for
                        three days;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        offer was extended on 19 April 2010 and 21 April 2010 without the
                        three-day limitation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     the offer was accepted on 3 June 2010; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     the husband stated his rejection of
                        the acceptance in his affidavit of 28 September
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When the swap offer was extended without the
                    three-day response period, there is no legal basis to read that condition into
                    the subsequent offers. In the circumstances, the offer was open for acceptance
                    until it is withdrawn by the husband, or is deemed to have lapsed after a
                    reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     What is a ‘reasonable time’ on the
                    facts? Three factors are relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 9 July 2010 deadline in the
                        Order of Court for the transfer of the properties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     the importance of the property swap to
                        the wife; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     the husband’s response to the wife’s acceptance of the
                        offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It would be reasonable to deem the offer to
                    have lapsed if it was not accepted by 9 July 2010 as the husband was
                    entitled to proceed with the implementation of the terms of the Order of Court.
                    It would also be reasonable to allow adequate time to the wife to consider the
                    offer carefully as the two properties were the entirety of the matrimonial
                    assets to be divided following the divorce (see the letter of 21 April 2010
                    and the advice to the wife to consider the swap seriously). Against this
                    background, the response on 3 June 2010 cannot be said to be unreasonably
                    delayed. The husband’s delayed response to the acceptance indicated that
                    he had not considered the offer to have lapsed when he received the acceptance
                    of 3 June 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the reasons stated, I found that the
                    husband’s offer was open for acceptance when it was accepted by the wife,
                    and I granted her application to vary the Order of Court of 9 February 2010
                    to give effect to the proposed swap that she accepted.</p>
