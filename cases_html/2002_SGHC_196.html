<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF

DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.

        This was an appeal against the decision of the

Asst. Registrar May Loh, refusing a stay of the Respondents’ action against the

Appellant. I heard the appeal on 21 May 2002 and affirmed the Asst. Registrar’s

decision. The Appellant, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed Notice of Appeal on 12

June 2002. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.

        The Appellant, Won Siok Wan ("Won")

and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent, Choo Lee Chin ("Choo") are named account

holders of three joint accounts with United Overseas Bank, Main Branch, 80 UOB Plaza,

Singapore. Either account holder could operate the accounts in that the bank could act on

the sole signature of either account holder. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.

        It was common ground that after Won left the

home where she and Yeoh lived, Won travelled to Singapore on 11 June 2001 and during that

visit withdrew various sums of money from the three joint accounts. All in all she

withdrew a total of S$2.5m or thereabouts. A breakdown of withdrawals from the three joint

accounts is as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Current account no. 101-311-077-3

                   

S $1,036,000.00</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Fixed Deposit account no. 101-462-177-1

          S $ 810,596.41</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Foreign Currency Account no. 101-074-120-9

    US$ 372,122.49</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(denominated in US Dollars)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.

        Won then deposited the withdrawals into

separate bank accounts in her sole name with United Overseas Bank in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.

        Yeoh Poh San ("Yeoh"), the 1<sup>st</sup>

Respondent and Choo objected to the withdrawals when they learned about what Won had done.

Yeoh alleged that Won had misappropriated trust money. Yeoh’s evidence, which is

corroborated by Choo, is that the monies in the joint accounts were his savings for his

old age. He was the sole contributor of the funds deposited in the three joint accounts.

Won and Choo, both held the monies on trust for him. Won and Choo were to share equally

the balance of the monies in the joint accounts upon Yeoh’s death. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.

        Prior to the withdrawals on 11 June 2002, Won

and Choo were Yeoh’s companions. Won, however, claimed that she was more than a

companion. She was all along Yeoh’s common law wife, having lived together as man and

wife for 20 years from July 1981 to June 2001. I should mention that Yeoh married Choo on

21 August 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.

        On 4 January 2002, the Respondents issued

proceedings against Won and on 29 January 2002 successfully obtained a mareva injunction

freezing Won’s assets in Singapore. Won failed in her application filed on 18

February 2002 to set aside or vary the injunction. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.

        On 18 February 2002, Won applied for a stay of

the action on the ground of forum non conveniens. It was argued that the action should be

stayed for the following reasons:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) the Appellant and Respondents are

  Malaysians and ordinarily resident in Malaysia; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) the main witnesses are resident in

  Malaysia;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent has assets

  in Malaysia;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) the Appellant has assets in Malaysia;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) there are issues of Malaysian law

  before the Singapore court. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.

        The principles governing a stay of proceedings

on the ground of forum non conveniens are well established. The House of Lords’

decision in <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Consulex</i> [1987] AC 460 was affirmed and

applied in <i>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp &amp; Anor v PT Airfast Services

Indonesia &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 776</nobr>; <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 97</nobr> and <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr>. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.

        The Court of Appeal in <i>PT Hutan Domas Raya v

Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Limited &amp; Anor.</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 49</nobr> at 54 re-affirmed

the <i>Spiliada</i> approach:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"….The correct approach which a

  court should take in such a case is as follows. The first stage is for the court to

  determine whether prima facie, there is some other available forum, having competent

  jurisdiction, which is more appropriate for the trial of the action. The legal burden of

  showing that rests on the defendant. In determining that issue the court will look to see

  what factors there are which point in the direction of another forum as being the forum

  with which the action has the most real and substantial connection, e.g. availability of

  witnesses, the convenience or expenses of having a trial in a particular forum, the law

  governing the transaction and the places where the parties reside or carry on business.

  Unless there is clearly another more appropriate available forum, a stay will ordinarily

  be refused. If the court concludes that there is such a more appropriate forum, it will

  ordinarily grant a stay unless, in the words of Lord Goff, ‘there are circumstances

  by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted. In

  this inquiry the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including

  circumstances which go beyond those taken into account which considering connecting

  factors with other jurisdictions’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘the unless

  question’ or ‘unless proviso’ as may be appropriate in the context). One

  such factor which would warrant a refusal of stay would be if it can be established by

  objective cogent evidence that the plaintiff will not obtain justice in the foreign

  jurisdiction. But the mere fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate personal or juridical

  advantage in proceedings in Singapore is not decisive; regard must be had to the interests

  of all the parties and the ends of justice. We would emphasis[e] that in determining the

  ‘unless question’ all circumstances must be taken into account, including those

  taken into account in determining the question of the more appropriate forum. However, in

  this stage of the inquiry the burden shifts to the plaintiff."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.

        Chao JA delivering the decision of the Court of

Appeal in <i>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Limited</i> said that

ultimately the question is "where should the case be suitably tried having regard to

the interest of the parties and the ends of justice." </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.

        The Respondents’ claim in this action

against Won is, inter alia, for money had and received, breach of fiduciary duties owed to

Yeoh and for an account. The issue in this case is: Were the monies in the joint accounts

impressed with a trust for the benefit of Yeoh.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.

        Counsel for Won, Mr. Andre Arul argued that the

monies in the joint accounts were gifts from Yeoh. She had every right to withdraw the

monies from the accounts. The alleged trust, if any, was probably created in Malaysia and

the dispute is best left to the Malaysian courts to decide. Counsel for the Respondents,

Mr. L. Kuppanchetti took the opposite view.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.

        A claim for money had and received arises in

the place of receipt, which in this case, is Singapore. The joint accounts were opened in

Singapore and the alleged misappropriation was committed in Singapore where she withdrew

the monies and immediately transferred the funds into her own bank accounts in Singapore

with United Overseas Bank Ltd. Singapore was the place where the alleged misappropriation

and enrichment took place. On this analysis, there is no conflict of laws issue. But if

there were a conflict of laws issue, namely, what law governs the Respondents’ claim

to the monies, I would regard Singapore law as the proper law of the country where the

enrichment occurred: <i>Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd

</i><nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 495</nobr>; <i>Kartika Ratna Thahir v PT Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara

(Pertamina)</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 257</nobr>. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.

        In a stay application, it is appropriate for

the court to form, at this interlocutory stage before all the evidence has been heard, a

prima facie view on the governing law. See <i>Banco Altantico v The British Bank of The

Middle East</i> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 504. Even if a different view is taken and the

lex causae is Malaysian law, the Appellant did not adduce any evidence of Malaysian law.

On any view, the applicable law is the law of Singapore</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.

        On this approach, Singapore is the natural

forum or most appropriate forum for the determination of the dispute. The place where the

breach was committed is prima facie the natural forum: <i>Cordoba Shipping Co. Ltd v

National State Bank</i> [1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91. Additionally, the governing law is

Singapore. Thus, there must be weighty grounds for displacing Singapore as the more

appropriate forum and in my judgment no weighty grounds for doing so were shown.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.

        It was said by Mr. Arul that Malaysia is

clearly the more appropriate forum, as the Respondents and Appellant are Malaysian

citizens. The parties all reside and have property in Malaysia. Moreover, Yeoh is a

partner of a law firm in Kuala Lumpur and Choo is an employee of the firm. The parties are

therefore amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts in Malaysia for the adjudication of

the dispute. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.

        I was not satisfied that the parties’ own

connecting factors with Malaysia were of sufficient weight to enable me to disregard the

factors that so clearly point to Singapore as the appropriate forum. There is undoubtedly

a tenable Malaysian flavour as far as the parties’ own connection with Malaysia is

concerned. But more importantly, the subject matter of the dispute itself has no

connection with Malaysia. It must be remembered that the court is required to consider

what forum the issues have the closest connection with and will not simply weigh factors

without reference to the likely issues. See <i>The Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v Seltron Pte Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 773</nobr>. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.

        Mr. Arul referred me to two recent decisions of

the Court of Appeal in <i>Datuk Hamzah bin Mohd Noor v Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan

Iskandar Al-Haj</i> (Civil Appeal no. 600086 of 2001) and <i>Andre Ravindran S. Arul v

Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj</i> (Civil Appeal no. 600012 of 2001)

where the actions were stayed for Malaysia. He urged me to follow these recent decisions

where many of the same connecting factors relied on here were present in the two cases. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.

        How each factor is to be weighed so as to tilt

the balance of convenience in favour of or against a stay varies from case to case. The

outcome of each case applying the well-established principles governing a stay of an

action on ground of forum non conveniens is very much dependent on the facts. As Lord

Templeman in <i>Spiliada</i> at p 465 observed: "The authorities do not, perhaps

cannot give any clear guidance as to how these factors are to be weighed in any particular

case…".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.

        The allegation of trust is a matter more

important for Yeoh than Won to adduce evidence on. The witnesses of fact are the

Respondents and Appellant as the parties most involved in the setting up of the joint

accounts in Singapore and the deposits made over the years. Won has assets in Singapore

and Malaysia. There was no suggestion that a Singapore Judgment cannot be enforced in

Malaysia.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.

        Factors affecting convenience and expense

arising from the need for the parties to travel and stay in Singapore for the trial is a

neutral factor. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.

        Mr. Kuppanchetti submitted that the Respondents

genuinely desire to have the action adjudicated in Singapore. They have obtained a mareva

injunction against the Appellant and have fortified their undertaking as to damages by

depositing S$200,000 with their lawyers as stakeholders. In my view, the order to fortify

the undertaking as to damages is a juridical advantage Won had gained thus far in the

Singapore proceedings. It is a factor to be taken into account in answering the question

whether the issue in dispute will be tried more suitably for the interests of the parties

and the ends of justice in Singapore. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.

        Mr. Arul referred to proceedings in Malaysia

and Thailand. The proceedings in Malaysia were brought by Won for a declaration that she

was at all material times Yeoh’s common law wife. She also sought an injunction to

restrain Yeoh from disposing of and/or charging the property know as 18, Pesiaran Bukit

Tunku, 50480 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.

        The Malaysia proceedings were filed on 14

September 2001 eight months after the action herein and shortly after Yeoh married Choo in

August. Yeoh succeeded in his procedural objections to strike out the Malaysian

proceedings. Won’s appeal was pending at the time this matter was heard by me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.

        As for the Thai proceedings, they arose from

the following events. Yeoh and Won are joint account holders of two bank accounts in

Thailand. After she left Yeoh on 11 June 2001, she withdrew monies from the two joint

accounts and thereafter deposited the monies in two other accounts she held with her

brother, On A Wan. Yeoh on hearing what she had done lodged a complaint with the Thai

police. Won had apparently made a false declaration that she had lost the passbook of one

of the Thai bank accounts. Arising from Yeoh’s complaint, criminal proceedings are

apparently afoot in Thailand. Yeoh had filed a civil action in Thailand against Won and On

A Wan on the basis that he was the sole owner of the funds. At date of hearing of the

Registrar’s Appeal, the Thai proceedings had yet to be served. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.

        Yeoh in his affidavit filed on 2 April 2002

deposed that the Malaysian and Thai proceedings have no bearing whatsoever on the issue

before the Singapore court, namely whether the monies in the joint accounts were held on

trust by Won and Choo. A relevant issue is the rights and obligations between Won and Choo

as joint account holders.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.

        The proceedings in Malaysia and Thailand are in

my view totally irrelevant. The issues in those proceedings are different and separate

from the cause in Singapore. So are the parties. Choo is not involved in the proceedings

in Thailand or Malaysia. In Malaysia, Won is the plaintiff and Yeoh the defendant. In the

proceedings in Thailand, Yeoh had sued Won and her brother for the proceeds of the joint

accounts in Thailand.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.

        In the circumstances, as Won had not

established that Malaysia is a more appropriate forum for the action, I dismissed her

appeal with costs fixed at $3000. </font></p>
