<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4       Mobil relied on its MOBIL and MOBIL derivative trade marks in Singapore in support of its opposition to the Opposed Mark. These are set out in the appendix to the Notice of Opposition.

Such use by the Applicant is also likely to lead to the belief that there is some connection in the course of trade between the Applicant and the Opponent when in fact no such connection exists.

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12.    The Applicants’ evidence was declared by Myung-Ki, the manager in charge of intellectual property rights of the Applicants. He has been employed by the Applicants or their affiliates for 13 years. The Applicants say their company was established in 1977 in Korea as Hyundai Precision &amp; Ind. Co and that they changed their name to Hyundai Mobis in November 2000. The Applicants are in the business of designing and supplying automotive parts for Hyundai, Kia and other automobile companies in Korea and around the world. They say that they are the largest auto parts manufacturer in Korea. The Applicants state that the mark Mobis is derived from the combination of the words mobile and system. Mobile refers to automobiles and system refers to the harmonization of the complicated mechanical apparatus, therefore Mobis refers to an enterprise specializing in the manufacture of automobile components and system.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13.    The Applicant has registrations and pending applications for the Mobis mark in 58 countries around the world.

They say that in Algeria, Chile, Djibouti and USA their marks co-exist in the same class namely, class 12.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14.    The Applicants state that they first commenced use of the mark in Korea in November 2000.

They say that their mark has been advertised and promoted worldwide and that it is well known.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15.    The Applicants say that the Opponents do not have any registrations in Singapore in class 12 which is the class that their application is in and that most of the Opponents’ marks are in class 4 for fuels and lubricants. The Applicants state that fuels and lubricants are typically sold in fuel stations and that the Applicants’ goods are sold to distributors of car parts.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16.    The Opponents’ and the Applicants’ evidence show that the Opponents have opposed the Applicants’ trademark applications in 9 countries, the Czech Republic, Bahrain, OAPI, Saudi Arabia, Korea, Chile, Ecuador, Finland and Spain. The Applicants were successful in obtaining registration in 7 countries. The Opponents were successful in opposing the registration in 2 countries, Spain and Ecuador. In Romania and Slovak Republic the Applicants’ applications were allowed to proceed to registration with the exclusion of one item from their classification of goods, “oil filters”. In the United Kingdom the application for Mobis was made in 4 classes, namely 7, 9, 11 and 12. The applications were allowed in classes 11 and 12. The applications were allowed in class 7 after the exclusion of oil filters. The application in class 9 did not proceed to registration as the Opponent had an earlier registration in class 9.</font></span></p>

In addition, she held that there was no likelihood of confusion on the part of the public because of such use.

<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Issues in this Appeal</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17     Hyundai Mobis did not appeal against the decision of the PAR. Therefore the issues before me in this appeal pertain to the following findings of the tribunal below:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    In respect of s 8(2)(b) of the Act, that</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)     the goods of Mobil and Hyundai Mobis were not similar; and</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)     the use of the Opposed Mark in relation to the goods for which it was sought to be registered would not indicate a connection between those goods and Mobil;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)   there was no likelihood of confusion on the part of the public because of such use; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)  it was not shown that the interests of Mobil were likely to be damaged by such use.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    In respect of s 8(4)(a) of the Act, that the use of the Opposed Mark by Hyundai Mobis on its goods would not lead to the type of misrepresentation required by the law of the tort of passing off.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18     Before I consider these issues, I will deal with two points. The first is that: the PAR had held that the Opposed Mark was similar to that of Mobil’s on the ground that they were aurally and visually similar, but not conceptually similar. This was because both are invented words and conveyed no meaning. Before me, Mobil submitted that they were conceptually similar as well as they were both linked to the word “mobile”; in Mobil’s case, it was a truncation of the word, whereas in Hyundai Mobis’ case, the word was meant to amalgamate “mobile systems”. However even if the word “mobil” is sufficiently close to “mobile” as to be related to that concept, in my view, the word “mobis” does not convey the same notion. I therefore agree with the PAR that conceptually, they are not similar.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19     The second is that it is important to bear in mind the physical nature of the respective marks. For convenience, I reproduce them below:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21     In <i>British Sugar plc v James Robertson &amp; Sons Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] RPC 281</nobr> (“<i>British Sugar”</i>), Jacob J laid down the following factors which may be used to assess the similarity of goods (or services)(at 296):</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the uses of the goods;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    the users of the goods;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    the physical nature of the goods;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    the trade channels through which the goods reach the market;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    for self-serve consumer items, whether in practice they are found or likely to be found, in particular on the same or different shelves; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f)     the extent to which the respective goods are competitive.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     Applying the above test, the PAR considered that the physical nature of the goods in question were different as Mobil’s goods were oils and Hyundai Mobis’ goods were vehicle parts. She noted, however, that the users were the same ­­– they were all vehicle owners. As for the channels of trade, the PAR found that they were different although there may be instances of overlap. Some of Hyundai Mobis’ goods, for example, anti-theft devices, could be sold in a petrol station store where Mobil’s lubricants for engines would be sold. Likewise, Mobil’s engine oils could be sold at a mechanic workshop where Hyundai Mobis’ parts were also sold. Taking into account all the factors set out in <i>British Sugar</i>, the PAR formed the view that vehicle parts and fuels and lubricants were not similar goods under s 8(2) of the Act.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     Mobil submitted that the PAR had placed too much emphasis on the physical nature of the goods and had given insufficient weight to the fact that the nature of the goods is ultimately for the maintenance and servicing of vehicles. In support of this point, Mobil relied on <i>Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v McDonald’s Corp</i> <nobr>[2006] 4 SLR 629</nobr> (<i>“Future Enterprises”</i>) where Tay Yong Kwang J held at [16]–[17] that instant coffee mix and coffee (as in the drink) were similar goods despite the differences in their physical states. However, in my view, the situation in that case is very different from the present case. As stated by the learned judge in <i>Future Enterprises</i> (at [17]), “the basic product in both cases is coffee”. I should add that coffee mix is not consumed in the crystalline state that it is sold in, but dissolved in water, by which time the two products are the same physically, differentiated perhaps only by flavour.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     Mobil also submitted that there was a further factor to be considered. It was held by Jacob J in <i>Imperial Tobacco v Berry Bros &amp; Rudd Ltd</i> CH 2001/APP/641 (“<i>Imperial Tobacco</i>”) that distinctiveness and reputation of the cited mark would also be a relevant factor. Mobil also pointed out that the evidence from Li Chi Fai’s affidavit showed that the channels of trade and points of sale were the same.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25     Mobil relied on Tan Lee Meng J’s statement in <i>Johnson &amp; Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 1082</nobr> (at [18]) that the factors set out by Jacob J in <i>British Sugar</i> should not be regarded as requirements that must all be satisfied before the goods in question can be treated as similar. I respectfully agree with this statement. The factors that Jacob J had set out in <i>British Sugar</i> and <i>Imperial Tobacco</i> are merely guidelines to assist in consideration of the matter at hand. The court must decide whether the goods are similar for the purposes of s 8(2)(b) of the Act bearing in mind the objective of the legislation. Mobil’s primary submission was that, notwithstanding the difference in physical nature of the goods, fuels and lubricants on the one hand and auto-parts on the other hand, all of these products relate to the proper maintenance and servicing of automobiles and are perceived as such by the relevant consumers. This submission appears attractive in that it identifies a label under which both goods may be categorised. However, in my view, this category is too wide because it involves products ranging from gases such as refrigerants for air-conditioners, to liquids such as paint, additives, lubricants, brake and transmission fluids, to soft solids such as tyres, wiper blades, fan belts and gaskets, to hard solids such as spark plugs, oil filters and to every part of a vehicle that may be replaced for the purposes of maintenance and servicing. In my view, what is important is whether such goods will be considered by consumers to be similar goods. Posed in that manner, I do not think that they would as they are quite different in terms of physical state and type of application. I therefore agree with the PAR that the goods are not similar for the purposes of s 8(2)(b) of the Act.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26     Mobil submitted that there was a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. The PAR considered: (a) the degree of distinctiveness of the MOBIL mark; (b) the degree of similarity between the MOBIL mark and the Opposed Mark; (c) the degree of similarity between the goods of Mobil and Hyundai Mobis; (d) the perception of the average consumer of the goods in question bearing in mind the possibility of imperfect recollection; (e) the risk that the public might believe that the goods come from the same source or economically linked sources; and (f) the absence of steps taken by Hyundai Mobis to differentiate its goods from that of Mobil’s. She also considered the circumstances under which the goods at issue were sold and found as a relevant factor the fact that Hyundai Mobis’ goods mostly would involve a considered purchasing decision whereas Mobil’s goods would involve off-the-cuff purchasing decisions. Taking into account these considerations, the PAR found that there would be no likelihood of confusion if the Opposed Mark were to be registered in Singapore for the classes in question.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">27     Hyundai Mobis submitted that there was no need to consider the issue of likelihood of confusion once there is a finding that the goods are not similar, citing the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>The Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop-In Department Store Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2006] 2 SLR 690</nobr>. Although that case involved an action for infringement under s 27(2)(b) of the Act, the provision there is similar to s 8(2)(b) of the Act. The Court of Appeal held (at [8]) that “if either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not be any need to go into the third question of determining whether there exists a likelihood of confusion”. I agree with the submission of Hyundai Mobis on this point as it is clear from s 8(2)(b) that the likelihood of confusion must be caused by one of the factors set out in sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Section 8(3): Connection, confusion and damage to interests</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28     Section 8(3) of the Act provides as follows:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A trade mark which —</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[emphasis added]</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29     The PAR found that the MOBIL mark was well known in Singapore for the purpose of subparagraph (i) of s 8(3) of the Act. This finding has not been challenged by Hyundai Mobis.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30     In relation to subparagraph (ii), the PAR was of the view that the use in relation to the goods of the Opposed Mark, with its physical form having the letter O in red and remaining letters in black, was not likely to result in a substantial number of average Singaporeans making a connection between the vehicle parts sold by Hyundai Mobis and Mobil. She explained that this would mainly be because a consumer, when choosing a vehicle part, must choose a part according to its compatibility with the vehicle, a process which required consideration. And because it required such consideration, the average Singaporean consumer would not make such a connection even though he might be reminded of the MOBIL mark. The PAR therefore considered that this requirement was not satisfied. In respect of subparagraph (iii), the PAR reasoned that there being no likelihood that the use of the Opposed Mark on vehicle parts would indicate a connection with Mobil, it would be even more unlikely that the use of that mark on vehicle parts would cause confusion.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31     Mobil submitted that the term “connection” had to be construed widely, to include any form of commercial or trade connection between its goods and those of Hyundai Mobis. This would include any form of commercial connection, including being associated with the owner of the MOBIL mark. Mobil pointed out that, historically, certain types of automobile parts and accessories have been concurrently sold at service stations. In addition, automobile parts and automobile lubricants were complementary goods and often sold together in connection with automobile servicing and maintenance (whether performed at a service station or other automobile service centre). Mobil pointed out that retail automobile parts stores and other mass merchandisers frequently offer automobile parts and accessories as well as vehicle lubricants and other automotive fluids at the same venue. Mobil relied on the additional evidence in the further affidavit of Li Chi Fai to show that Mobil branded fuel and lubricant products and other branded automobile fuel and lubricant products are commonly sold in the same locations, distributed through the same trade channels, and displayed in close proximity to goods covered by the specification of goods for the Opposed Mark in Singapore. Mobil noted that some customers may not be highly educated or conversant in English and therefore may not notice the difference in the sound made by the last consonant in each of the two marks and may even remember the two marks by the dominant sounds/features, “MO-BI”. The average consumer in these circumstances is likely to overlook the insignificant differences between the Opposed Mark and the MOBIL and MOBIL derivative trade marks, resulting in a likelihood of confusion. Mobil submitted that the PAR had erred in law in finding that subparagraph (iii) was not satisfied because a substantial number of average Singaporeans would not make a connection.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32     I am unable to agree with these submissions of Mobil. Although the term “connection” has to be construed widely, it has to be done in the context of the MOBIL mark and the Opposed Mark, taking into account their visual and aural similarities. I should add that it is also necessary to take into account their dissimilarities or, expressed in another manner, the extent to which they are similar. Thus, if the two marks are visually very close, then the likelihood of a connection and confusion would be higher. In the present case, although there is similarity, the degree of resemblance is limited to some extent by the differences in font, capitalisation and colours (see [19] above). In the context of the nature of the goods of Mobil and Hyundai Mobis, I do not find that the use of the Opposed Mark by Hyundai Mobis would indicate a connection with Mobil.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33     To succeed under s 8(3) of the Act, Mobil must show that the requirements of all four subparagraphs are met. In respect of subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), they are related in the sense that the greater the similarity between the two marks in question, the greater would be the connection indicated and the greater the likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. While I agree with Mobil’s submission that there is no test prescribed in the law that requires a consideration of whether a substantial number of average Singaporeans would make a connection, I am not persuaded that the PAR had made such a finding. From the construction of s 8(3), consideration of the four subparagraphs must necessarily proceed serially. Therefore, if the requirement in subparagraph (i) is not met, <i>ie</i>, that the earlier mark must be well known in Singapore, then it is not necessary to consider the remaining requirements. Similarly, proceeding to subparagraph (ii), if no connection between the two sets of goods is indicated, it becomes unnecessary to consider the next requirement. This is because there cannot be any confusion unless a connection is indicated. But even if a connection is indicated, Mobil must then show that, arising from the connection, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. This is where the PAR’s consideration, as to whether the average Singaporean would be confused, becomes relevant. It cannot be within the contemplation of the Act that subparagraph (iii) would be satisfied if only a single member of the public would be confused by the use of both marks. In my opinion, in view of the words “likelihood” and “public”, the test ought to be whether there is a substantial number of the relevant public (<i>ie</i>, people who are in the market for such goods) would be confused. By “substantial number” I do not mean a majority, but a not insubstantial number. Applying that test, I find that even if there were a connection indicated, there does not exist a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in view of the different nature of the goods and the nature of the two trade marks.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34     As for subparagraph (iv), the PAR held that it would not be possible for Mobil to show that its interests are likely to be damaged by such use as the Opposed Mark has not yet been used in Singapore. I agree with Mobil that this holding is wrong as this would mean that only upon its use can an opposition to a new mark succeed under this provision, no matter how closely it resembles an existing well known mark. Indeed, this provision enables the owner of an existing mark to oppose the registration of a new mark and it therefore necessarily involves a mark that is not yet used. I am of the view that, if the requirements in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) are made out, there is enough evidence in the affidavits filed to support a finding that the interests of Mobil are likely to be damaged by use of the Opposed Mark.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Section 8(4)(a): Passing off</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     Section 8(4)(a) of the Act provides as follows:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in Singapore is liable to be prevented —</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36     Mobil submitted that the use of the Opposed Mark by Hyundai Mobis on its goods is the most basic type of misrepresentation required by the tort of passing off insofar as the PAR had held that the Opposed Mark was similar to Mobil’s marks.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37     On the issue of goodwill, the PAR found that Mobil had a presence in Singapore since the 1930s and had been using the MOBIL mark since the 1960s for lubricants and oils. Sales were in the hundreds of millions of dollars every year, with advertising promotion expenditure in excess of a million dollars a year. The PAR found that Mobil had a reputation in the business of selling fuels and lubricants under the Mobil mark.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">38     The PAR went on to consider whether the use by Hyundai Mobis of the Opposed Mark (with its physical form having a red letter O) on vehicle parts would lead to the type of misrepresentation required in the law of passing off. She held that there was no misrepresentation in the present case for the same reason she found that there would be no confusion under s 8(2) of the Act and that there would be no connection and confusion under s 8(3) of the Act.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">39     Mobil’s case on this point is based substantially on the submission that there is a close resemblance between the two marks. For the reasons given earlier (at [32] above), I do not agree that there is such a degree of resemblance, seen in the context of the goods the marks are used for, as would constitute a misrepresentation for the purposes of the law of the tort of passing off.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Section 7(6): Bad faith</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40     Section 7(6) of the Act provides as follows:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the application is made in bad faith. </font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41     Whether the application was made in bad faith is a question of fact and the onus lies on Mobil to prove it. Mobil submitted that, firstly, there was no doubt that Mobil has established tremendous goodwill in its MOBIL mark. Secondly, the Opposed Mark closely resembled the MOBIL mark as it reproduces four out of the five letters of the MOBIL mark with the letter O in red and distinct from the remaining letters and they are visually, aurally and conceptually similar. Mobil contended that that there was more than sufficient evidence to make an inference of bad faith on the part of Hyundai Mobis in filing its application for the Opposed Mark.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42     Hyundai Mobis had explained on affidavit that the Opposed Mark “was derived from the combination of the words ‘mobile’ and ‘system’” and that it “referred to an enterprise specializing in the manufacture of automobile components and systems”. Mobil submitted that these assertions were not supported by any credible evidence, but even if true, their significance was far outweighed by the high degree of similarity between the MOBIL mark and Opposed Mark. Before the PAR (but not before me) Mobil submitted that “mobis” was not a logical combination of the words “mobile” and “system” whereas “mosys” would be a logical combination. I do not quite agree that “mosys” would be any more logical than “mobis”, especially if the connotation of “mobile” is required. In the circumstances, I do not find that the explanation on the derivation of the Opposed Mark to be incredible at all.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">43     In my view the resemblance between the two marks is not so close in the context of the different goods they are used for that I would be prepared, in the absence of further evidence, to make a finding of bad faith.</font></span></p>
