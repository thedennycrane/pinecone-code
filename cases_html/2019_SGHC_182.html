Five months later, he commenced Suit 1159 of 2017 (“Suit 1159/2017”) against Mr Mulacek which claimed relief for a loan of shares. Both these suits were commenced in Singapore. He followed on three days later with a claim against Mr Mulacek in Texas, for breach of contract, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and conspiracy. He then served the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim relating to the Singapore proceedings by way of substituted service on Mr Mulacek in Texas, and followed on, subsequently, to serve the papers relating to the Texas proceedings, again by substituted service in Texas.

These principles were summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [26]. At the first stage, the defendant must establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. This, in turn, would depend upon which forum has the most real and substantial connection with the dispute. Considerations of convenience or expense, the governing law, and the places where the parties reside or carry on business come into play. The queries to be posed at the first stage were most recently summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra </span>[2019] SGCA 42 (“<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the personal connections of the parties; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the connections to relevant events and transactions; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the governing law of the dispute, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the existence of other proceedings elsewhere (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">lis alibi pendens</span>); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the overall shape of the litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 If there is another available forum that is more appropriate than Singapore, the second stage of the inquiry is then to ask whether any reasons of justice militate against a stay of the proceedings in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In a case such as the present, where there are connecting factors in Singapore and in Texas, the Court of Appeal’s caution given in <span class="font-italic">Rappo, Tania</span><span class="font-italic"> v Accent Delight International Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo, Tania</span>”) not to apply the five-fold framework in a mechanistic manner is apt (see [70] and [71]).

The question of natural forum serves as the primary issue of both the ASI and FNC applications. The issue of any juridical advantage offered by the foreign venue, found in the second stage of the FNC analysis, is also featured within the ASI analysis. The issue of oppression in any ASI analysis follows after the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> analysis is answered. The starting point of analysis must be, therefore, the issue of natural forum. While Mr Mulacek bears the burden of proof in his ASI application, Mr Civelli bears the burden of proof on his FNC application. And because the issue of merits is key to any application for an extension of time, the last application follows closely upon the heels of the second. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I hold that Texas is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> for the various disputes between parties.

The conclusion I draw from the exercise is that the initial claim for the return of cash pursuant to a demand in Singapore has evolved, after Mr Mulacek served his counterclaim to that initial claim, into a complex series of claims involving many jurisdictions and parties. Mr Civelli’s present claim in the Texas proceedings is one that encompasses and is wider than his claims in Suit 676/2017 and 1159/2017, including claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, negligence, fraudulent transfers of shares, conversion, conspiracy, promissory estoppel, and common law fraud. Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim in the local proceedings, on the other hand, is substantially similar to his counterclaim in the Texas suit. It is premised on the recovery of approximately US$114m following the Complex Arrangements arising out of the breach of fiduciary duties. The claims and counterclaims share a common factual matrix. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Governing law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I start with the issue of the governing law of the various disputes between parties.

</div> The starting point would be to look for a jurisdiction clause in the contract. In its absence, I must consider the intention of the parties. If that is not clear, I must look to the system of law with which the contract has its closest and most real connection. This is “an objective analysis undertaken from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the parties at the time of the contract” (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Share Loan Agreement was an oral agreement. There is no express governing law clause. Parties did not discuss a governing law, and their intention is not readily discernible from their conduct. The issue, then is which system of law has its closest connection. While the contract was concluded in Singapore and the demand for the return of the shares was made in Singapore, there are other elements in the surrounding context that point outwards. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [43]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, the place of contracting is generally not important in determining the governing law of a contract, except, perhaps, where the contract is to be performed in that country: <span class="font-italic">Chatenay </span><span class="font-italic">v The Brazilian Submarine Telegraph Company, Limited</span> [1891] 1 QB 79. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The background to Mr Mulacek’s request, Mr Civelli maintains, was a Texas lawsuit. Its place of performance, on Mr Civelli’s claim, was to be Texas. After parties’ agreement, the shares were initially transferred to the trust account of Dale A Dossey &amp; Associates, which were based in Texas.

</div> Mr Mulacek’s defence has elements of Swiss and other international elements, but do not weigh the case more closely to Singapore rather than Texas. The governing law for the Share Loan Agreement is therefore likely to be Texas rather than Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Claim for breach of trust and fiduciary duties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Turning then to Mr Civelli’s claim against Mr Mulacek, Chase Securities and Chase Bank for breach of trust and fiduciary duties, the determination of the governing law would be dependent on the Share Loan Agreement. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [83], where an alleged breach of fiduciary duty has its root source in a contractual agreement between the parties, the governing choice of law rules ought to be based on those governing that particular contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mr Civelli’s claim concerns Mr Mulacek’s repeated transfer of his shares, culminating in the transfer to the Bank of New York Mellon account, and his subsequent refusal to return his InterOil shares. These shares were initially transferred pursuant to the Share Loan Agreement. Because the governing law for the Share Loan Agreement is likely Texas law, as seen above at [57], Mr Civelli’s claim for breach of trust and fiduciary duties should likely be governed by Texas law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Tortious claims for negligence, conversion and conspiracy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The governing law for a tortious claim is usually dependent on the place the tort occurred. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> noted at [39] and [40], where the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, this would be a weighty factor pointing in favour of that jurisdiction being the natural forum. In order to determine the place where a tort occurred, the court is to apply the “substance of the tort” test by examining the series of events constituting the elements of the tort to determine where, in substance, the cause of action arose (see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”) at [53]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 According to Mr Civelli, his negligence claim against Chase Bank and Chase Securities is premised on their acting contrary to industry practice and their own internal policies by transferring shares from the second Chase Securities Account to Aster Brunei’s Bank of New York Mellon account despite Aster Brunei having no right to the Shares.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span>, Mr Rybolovlev, through two offshore vehicles, commenced proceedings in Monaco and Singapore against the applicants, Mr Bouvier and Mrs Rappo. While Mr Rybolovlev alleged that Mr Bouvier breached fiduciary duties owed to him by dishonestly inflating the sale prices of artworks, Mr Bouvier claimed that he was an independent seller of artworks. The Court of Appeal held that the governing law of the parties’ relationship was Swiss law. This was because parties’ relationship originated in Geneva sometime in 2002 or 2003, when they had entered into an oral agreement for Mr Bouvier to assist Mr Rybolovlev in procuring a collection of valuable artworks (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> at [77]); both men were based in Switzerland at the time of the oral agreement (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> at [78]); the four written agreements that governed the purchase of specific artworks, which followed shortly after the oral agreement, contained an express choice of Swiss law and also provided for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Swiss courts (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> at [78]). While the parties subsequently transacted only on the basis of invoices after the initial four written agreements, the court found that the later “course of dealing was on the same basis as that reflected in the four written agreements”, and that there was nothing to suggest otherwise (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> at [79]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Court of Appeal considered a similar argument to that raised by Mr Mulacek, whether the governing law of the parties’ relationship changed.

In our judgment, the course of dealing that underlay all the transactions in question remained rooted in what had transpired in the years between sometime in 2002 or 2003 (when Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev entered into their oral agreement) and late 2008.

</div> As for the performance of Mr Civelli’s fiduciary duties, the Complex Arrangements, which are key to Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim, do not evince connecting factors that point towards Singapore. The governing law and arbitration agreement clauses in the Complex Arrangements are of limited usefulness. It is common ground that these clauses would not bind Mr Civelli and Mr Mulacek; the companies that entered into the complex arrangements are not parties to Suit 676/2017 or Suit 1159/2017.

</div> PIE Holdings was also involved in the US$40m PN under which PWE loaned a further USD40m to PIE Holdings (see above at [18(c)]).

In my view, there is insufficient evidence of any intention to ground their relationship and transactions in Singapore law. Mr Civelli’s incorporation of Clarion SG, even with the voluntary liquidation thereafter of Clarion Finanz in 2011, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate a shift in the “centre of gravity” to Singapore. Nor would the use of Singapore as a base, for a time, to facilitate business interests in Papua New Guinea. Those business needs have further evolved with time, and include connections to multiple other jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, the court must look to the context of parties’ relationship as a whole, its origins and evolution. The period of time, post 2009, where both parties dealt with each other in Singapore must be viewed in the context of that entirety. It is not uncommon for individuals who have an international portfolio of assets to work from Singapore, for reasons of time-zone, geographical location, infrastructure and ease of transport. It is closer to Papua New Guinea than Europe, and a competitive venue for global finance and fund management services. Looking at the genesis of the alleged trust, its settlor and beneficiaries, its assets, and its performance through the Complex Arrangements, there is greater connection to Texas than to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Personal connections of parties and witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Both parties, in this case, made great effort to pin down each other’s residence in a country strategic to their case.

As made clear by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> at [17] and [19], where there are multiple disputes on issues of fact – and the present case is one such case – the location and the compellability of the witnesses assumes greater importance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Four Beneficiaries play a central role in both Mr Mulacek and Mr Civelli’s claims; Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim hinges on Mr Civelli having breached his duties to them while Mr Civelli’s claim in the Texas proceedings concerns the Four Beneficiaries as parties.

In most cases it will appear from the decision of the foreign court whether it acted on principle similar to those that obtain here, but, if not, then the domestic court must consider whether the result is consistent with those principles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 <span class="font-italic">Amchem</span> was cited by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">The “Reecon Wolf”</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2012] 2 SLR 289 (at [51]) where Belinda Ang Saw Ean J also spoke of the “manifest concern for international comity in <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>principles” (at [21]). In that case, proceedings were pending both in Singapore and Malaysia. In the course of an appeal from an assistant registrar, the Malaysian courts dismissed a stay application pending before them. Taking this into account, the learned judge allowed the appeal, explaining at [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Multiplicity of proceedings here and abroad in respect of the same controversy and parties is a concern.

This brings me to <span class="font-italic">The Abidin Daver </span>[[1984] AC 398 at [18]]. In that case, there were concurrent proceedings in England and Turkey and the court had to decide whether to stay the English proceedings. Lord Diplock was concerned that if concurrent proceedings were allowed to continue in England and Turkey, there might well be “an unseemly race to be the first to obtain judgment”, and opined that “comity demands that such a situation should not be permitted to occur as between court of two civilised and friendly states” (at 344). In short, the risk of inconsistent judgments can be avoided if one court gives way to the other in the interest of international comity. A similar risk of inconsistent findings and conflicting decisions also arises where there are two related or parallel actions, one here and abroad and the court is asked to stay one of the actions. To illustrate, in <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span> [[2010] 1 SLR 1192] at [16]], there were parallel proceedings in Singapore and Malaysia and the Singapore proceedings were stayed in the interest of international comity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Mr Mulacek emphasises that a determination by a foreign court to exercise its jurisdiction does not bind the Singapore court’s ability to issue an ASI.

</div> Mr Mulacek contends that the Texas decision should be accorded less weight because the court made a crucial error in concluding that Chase Securities were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, in that Chase Securities could still be joined and served out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I do not agree that the Texas court acted in error. In the present case, the Texas court, in considering the issue of <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>, had regard to principles similar to that of Singapore law. Judge Atlas, in stating her principal reason that Chase Securities was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court, could have been speaking broadly. Before her, both Chase Bank and Chase Securities opposed Mr Mulacek’s stay application in Texas. Chase Bank has a branch in Singapore that may be served process; Chase Securities does not.

</div> Whilst Chase Securities may be served out of jurisdiction, it would likely remain resistant to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. If joined by Mr Civelli in the lawsuit in Singapore as Mr Mulacek suggests, both Chase Bank and Chase Securities may apply for a stay on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 On the wider issue of the ability of the court to come to a different conclusion from a foreign court, I would agree with Mr Mulacek. Recently in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> at [129], the Court of Appeal held that it would not be invariably a breach of comity for a domestic court to grant an ASI if it finds that, first, it is clearly the more appropriate forum for the dispute <span class="font-italic">and</span> secondly, the defendant in the application has acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in commencing the foreign proceedings. In the present case, however, it is <span class="font-italic">Texas</span> that would be the more appropriate forum for the dispute. The first requirement identified in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> is therefore not met on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I am of the view that a single jurisdiction should deal with the myriad of issues concerning the dispute between Mr Civelli and Mr Mulacek, in order to avoid the risk of conflicting decisions and findings of fact. The Singapore dispute is a subset of the Texas one. The present case is therefore the converse of the situation referred to at [122] of <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span>, where the foreign proceedings pertain to one specific issue in a broader claim. Fragmentation would likely result if the ASI is granted or if a stay is not ordered. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Vinmar Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1271 was concerned with the issue of fragmentation even in the context of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, stating at [139]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our restatement of the law, we have not discussed a case where the grant of a stay would lead to the fragmentation of a dispute across multiple jurisdictions because the dispute involves multiple parties, some of whom are not parties to the jurisdiction clause. In such cases, the <span class="font-italic">risk of duplicative proceedings, inconsistent findings and incentivising a rush to judgment may well establish strong cause to refuse a stay</span>…[i]t is sufficient for our immediate purposes to observe that the concern arising from such fragmentation of legal proceedings is legitimate… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Considering that the connecting factors have a closer connection with Texas, the claims ought to be tried in a single set of proceedings in Texas. As such, there is no reason in the present case for me to grant an ASI. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Oppression</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is in this context that I deal with Mr Mulacek’s contentions of oppression.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It is clear that sustaining action in two jurisdictions in the same subject matter is inappropriate conduct on the part of a plaintiff. The gravamen of Mr Mulacek’s complaint is that Mr Civelli has instituted actions in both Singapore and Texas. In <span class="font-italic">Kirkham</span> at [47], the Court of Appeal listed examples of oppression or vexation. These included bad faith in the institution of the foreign proceedings; commencing the foreign proceedings for no good reason; commencing proceedings that are bound to fail; and extreme inconvenience caused by the foreign proceedings. In the present case, as events unfolded, it is the <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> proceedings that have been commenced without sufficient reason, and which have generated unnecessary costs. The issue of <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> is central to the remedy to be applied. The Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> at [67] on the sensible approach to take in deciding cumulative jurisdictional objections based on forum election and <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> is apt:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, we think it would be prudent, as a matter of general practice, for a court in such a situation to first decide whether Singapore is <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. If it considers that Singapore is not the appropriate forum, it should order a stay and that would be the end of the matter; there would be no need in such circumstances to embark on a further inquiry as to whether the foreign proceedings are <span class="font-italic">lis alibi pendens</span>. It is only if the court finds that the alternative forum is not clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore for the determination of the dispute that it would then have to put the plaintiff to an election between forums. This approach would not only be resource-saving, but also more consonant with logic and principle in that there is simply no need to put the plaintiff to an election if Singapore turns out not to be an appropriate forum for the hearing of the matter in the first place. Accordingly, this is the approach which we adopt in the present appeals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Mr Civelli’s conduct therefore is not a reason to deny his request for a stay in Singapore if Texas is the natural forum for the disputes. As I have found that Texas is the natural forum, the issue is, rather, how any oppressive conduct should be dealt with in the context of the application for a stay of Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim. I deal with this below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reasons of justice against a stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The second stage of the test in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test requires the court to consider whether there are circumstances by reason of justice why it should exercise its jurisdiction even if it is not the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> natural forum. Mr Mulacek did not raise any particular juridical advantages he would lose if denied trial of the matter in Singapore. Mr Mulacek argued that the juridical advantages that Mr Civelli raised in his favour in the Texas action were tactical pressures used unfairly. It follows from my finding that Texas is the natural forum that these are legitimate juridical advantages. Mr Mulacek’s wider point is that the Texas proceedings are oppressive in the light of the Singapore proceedings. Fundamental to his case, therefore, is his argument that Mr Civelli’s FNC application must fail because of three fatal flaws. I turn then to discuss each of these flaws.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether ‘three fatal flaws’ prevent a stay </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Civelli’s maintenance of his claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The first argument is that Mr Civelli cannot seek to stay Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim while maintaining his claims in the Singapore proceedings. Further, Mr Mulacek contends that it is not open to Mr Civelli, as a plaintiff, to attempt to stay Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim. Order 15, r 2 ROC allows any defendant to bring a counterclaim, and therefore, any plaintiff who brings suit must expect that a defendant may bring a counterclaim in response (see <span class="font-italic">Balkan Bank v </span><span class="font-italic">Taher and others (no 2)</span> [1995] 1 WLR 1067 at 1072). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 A defendant has the right to bring a counterclaim notwithstanding that Singapore may not be the clearly more appropriate forum (see <span class="font-italic">Metal Scrap Trading Corporation Ltd v Kate Shipping Co Ltd</span> [1990] 1 WLR 115). This does not, however, affect the court’s ability to stay a counterclaim on the basis of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Mr Mulacek makes a wider point, and a valid one. This is that a plaintiff who has commenced multiple proceedings should in general be made to face up to the situation he has chosen to create. As Mustill LJ puts the point in <span class="font-italic">HM </span><span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Arthur Andersen</span> <span class="font-italic">&amp; Co (United Kingdom) and others </span>[1989] ECC 224 at [13]: “Having put his hand to the plough he should continue to the end of the furrow.” The same judgment nevertheless also recognises that fairness and common sense could on occasion require a stay. Mr Civelli’s answer lies in his undertaking to discontinue both suits if the court were to dismiss the ASI. In that way, once the ASI is dismissed, Suits 676/2017 and 1159/2017 would be discontinued and the only remaining issue would be to stay Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim. In view of my finding on the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> for the parties’ disputes, save for the question of costs, this is the most practicable resolution to the multiple lawsuits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Civelli’s application being out of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The second fatal flaw contended is that Mr Civelli had filed his application out of time without an application for an extension of time. Mr Civelli subsequently took out an application for an extension of time and I deal with that below. I deal, at this juncture, with the reliance placed on a number of English decisions, including <span class="font-italic">Ledra Fisheries Ltd &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">others v Turner &amp; others </span>[2003] EWHC 1049 (Ch) at [19], <span class="font-italic">The Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania v Equitas Insurance Limited </span>[2013] EWHC 3713 (Comm) at [31] and <span class="font-italic">Excalibur </span><span class="font-italic">Ventures LLC v Texas Keystone</span> <span class="font-italic">Inc &amp; ors</span> [2012] All ER (Comm) 933 at [77] for the proposition that where a plaintiff seeking a stay must be refused but for the limited exception where proceedings were started purely to protect the claimant’s limitation period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 On a consideration of the cases, I agree with counsel for Mr Civelli that the particular application of the three authorities to the case at hand is not apposite. These cases concerned Rule 11.5 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK), under which a defendant, having filed an acknowledgement of service and failing to make an application for a stay within 14 days, was treated as having submitted to jurisdiction. The local equivalent of the jurisdictional stay provision is O 12, rr 7(1) and (6) ROC. Order 12, r 7(6) stipulates that unless the defendant makes an application within the time limited for serving a defence in accordance with O 12, r 7(1), an appearance, if not withdrawn by leave of court under O 21, r 1, is treated as a submission by the defendant to jurisdiction. <span class="font-italic">Forum non conveniens</span>, however, is the subject of O 12, r 7(2) and not O 12, r 7(1). While r 7(2) specifies that such an application should be filed within the time limited for serving a defence, r 7(6) does not apply to r 7(2). The flaw, so to speak, is not fatal because an application for an extension of time may be sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 This is made clear by <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung and others </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1192, where the Court of Appeal held, at [15], that the timeline in O 12, r 7(2) is not absolute and could be extended using O 3, r 4. At [22], Chao Hick Tin JA made clear the distinction and its rationale:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The appellant relies on several cases to argue that an extension of time under O 3 r 4, even if permissible, cannot “cure” the fact that the respondents had already taken steps in the proceedings and submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. With respect, this argument is off the mark because whether a litigant has <span class="font-italic">submitted</span> to the jurisdiction of the court if relevant only to an application for a stay under O 12 r 7(1), where the litigant is taking the position that the court has <span class="font-italic">no jurisdiction</span> to hear the case. In contrast, where the litigant applies for a stay under O12 r 7(2) on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, he in fact <span class="font-italic">accepts the court’s jurisdiction</span> and is not to be treated as disputing it (see <span class="font-italic">The Jian He</span> [[1999] 3 SLR(R) 432] at [44], and GP Selvam, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007) at para 12/7/4). The respondents have undoubtedly participated in the Singapore proceedings by filing their Defence. Although this would be a step in the proceeding that might disentitle them from contesting jurisdiction under O 12 r 7(1), this does not mean that they are barred from applying for a stay on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 This principle was reiterated in <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo</span> [2011] 2 SLR 196 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering</span>”). In that case, a month and three weeks after the time for filing of the defence, the appellant applied for – and obtained - a stay of proceedings on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. The respondent’s argument that the appellant had taken steps in the proceedings was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which highlighted again at [16] and [17] the distinction between O, 12 r 7(1) and O, 12 r 7(2). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Waiver </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 It is in this context that I consider Mr Civelli’s argument that Mr Mulacek has waived his right to apply for a stay of the counterclaim, which is premised upon <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Ltd v Liu Ming</span> [2019] 1 SLR 779 (“<span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span>”). In that case, the Court of Appeal held that the defendant’s participation in the suit was not merely defensive, but amounted to an invocation of the court’s jurisdiction and an implied acceptance that the court had jurisdiction (at [33] and [42]). The defendant in <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> did not confine himself to applying to set aside service of jurisdiction and discharging the various injunctions against him. Instead, he went further to participate in the non-parties’ application for an interim injunction to restrain the plaintiff company from, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, diluting the shareholding of any shareholding. The defendant’s participation included presenting submissions and offering to give an undertaking as to damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span>, the Court of Appeal left the possibility open at [46] that a “lengthy delay” in making a stay application “may be treated as a waiver of any objections which might have been raised”. Mr Civelli filed his Reply and Defence to Counterclaim on 5 April 2018, before commencing Summons 2384/2018 on 22 May 2018. Mr Civelli points out that his delay was less than that seen in <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin</span>, which had been approximately 7 weeks. Order 12, r 7(2) requires that a defendant contending for the Singapore court to refrain from assuming jurisdiction apply to Court for a stay within the time limited for serving a defence (in this case, 5 April 2018). Mr Mulacek was hence out of time by approximately six and a half weeks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In my judgment, the length of delay cannot be determinative. Even a cursory glance of the facts of the case in <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering</span> and those of the present one will reveal that substantially more has happened in these proceedings. Mr Civelli has taken significantly more steps in Singapore. But both <span class="font-italic">Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Cheung</span> and <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering</span> make clear that the taking of steps is not sufficient. The question must be answered by the looking at the competing interests of parties and the justice of the case as a whole. Viewing the nature, quality and context of the steps taken in perspective, I do not think it can be said that Mr Civelli waived his rights to a stay. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application for extension of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It is clear from my foregoing views that the merits of the stay application weigh in Mr Civelli’s favour. The key question is therefore summarised by the Court of Appeal’s query in <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span>, at [44]: “is the [party]’s procedural default so egregious that the imposition of a sanction by way of an appropriate costs order would not suffice to register the court’s disapproval?” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The guidance of <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering</span>, at [30], in cases where the court is asked to extend an interlocutory timeline, is that the factual matrix of the case is paramount. Further, in balancing the parties’ competing interests, the court must consider the issue of prejudice. The key prejudice that Mr Mulacek says he suffered due to Mr Civelli’s late application for a stay, is that there has been a “slowing down” of proceedings in Singapore, which allowed for the Texas proceedings to pull ahead, resulting in an easier case for Mr Civelli to stay Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim.

</div>
</div> There is, however, a need for Mr Mulacek to demonstrate that he was prejudiced <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> by Mr Civelli’s six and a half week delay in bringing the application for a stay, which would be the date that Mr Civelli formally raised the matter for the first time. This he has not done. There is no indication that this period of delay radically changed the state of affairs of the Texas proceedings. Any delay after 8 August 2018 was occasioned only by Mr Mulacek’s application for an adjournment for the stay and ASI applications. As may be surmised from the costs order made, the application would likely have weighed against him at the first adjournment, but for the plea to consider new arbitration matters that had yet to be raised, on the argument that a dismissal of his ASI would prejudice the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>. Subsequently, the stay in favour of arbitration was not raised. Nor was prayer 2 for which the summons was amended in October 2018, because Judge Atlas clarified subsequently that its premise was flawed. I recount these facts solely as an illustration of the complexity of the litigation between Mr Civelli and Mr Mulacek, which gives, in my view, an important perspective to the various omissions that each party has complained of against the other. As events unfolded, the effect of the adjournment and amendment of the summons was to allow Mr Mulacek to press ahead with his stay application in Texas in November 2018 with the matter still open for the Texas court’s decision in January 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Coming then to Mr Mulacek’s late adoption of the objection, the rationale for any requirement for an extension of time is to obviate use of judicial resources to consider an application that has no merit. This matter having been partially argued before me on 8 August 2018, the object for arguing against an extension in this regard may have been overtaken by events. Having said that, the rules of court are foundational to procedural justice. They frame the expectations of parties and aid good order in litigation. The onus was on Mr Civelli to have applied in a timely manner for a stay, or at least to have applied for an extension of time by the time he applied for the stay at the latest. And on either application, the onus was on him to furnish good reason. His application for a stay was late, his application for an extension of time later still, and no sufficient explanation has been given for either omission. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Multiplicity of litigation, and Mr Civelli’s responsibility for its existence, lay at the heart of Mr Mulacek’s arguments. Having decided that the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> for the various disputes between parties is Texas, I consider that the appropriate way to deal with the multiplicity at hand is to dismiss Mr Mulacek’s application for an ASI, and, subject to Mr Civelli fulfilling his undertaking, grant Mr Civelli’s application for a stay of Mr Mulacek’s counterclaim, and for an extension of time to apply for the same. I shall hear counsel on costs, at which time they may wish to revisit my comments on Mr Civelli’s conduct. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cavinder Bull, SC, Woo Shu Yan, Tay Hong Zhi, Gerald and Ho Wei Wen, Daryl (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Toby Landau, QC, Calvin Liang (Essex Court Chambers Duxton) (Instructed), Salem Ibrahim, Ashwin Singh Riar and Charlene Wee Swee Ting (Salem Ibrahim LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
