<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><em><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Cur Adv Vult</strong></font></em></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The Plaintiffs sued the Defendant for

losses they claimed they incurred through her negligence when she acted for them in

connection with a house known as 70 Hythe Road ("the property").</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The Plaintiffs are brothers, and are

the registered owners of the property. The Defendant, an advocate and solicitor of long

standing, practises under the name of Ng &amp; Co. The Plaintiffs’ brother

Balakrishnan s/o Kandasamy @ Mohd Feroz bin Abdullah, who is referred to as

"Bala" or "Captain Bala" was very much involved in the dealings

between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The Plaintiffs were the registered

owners of the property since 1990 when they bought it with a $451,000 loan from the

Citibank N.A. ("Citibank") and by withdrawing parts of their earnings from their

Central Provident Fund ("CPF") accounts. The solicitors who acted for the

Plaintiffs in these transactions were Rajah &amp; Tann.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. In June 1992 the Citibank loan was paid

off and the property was mortgaged to UMBC Finance Ltd to secure a $475,000 loan. Another

law firm Gurdaib Cheong &amp; Narmal acted for the Plaintiffs at this time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. In December 1992, there was another

change of mortgagee. The UMBC Finance mortgage was discharged and replaced by a mortgage

to OCBC Finance Singapore Ltd ("OCBC Finance") to secure a loan of $485,000.

Simultaneously the Plaintiffs executed a collateral mortgage of the property as sureties

for a loan of $2,880,000 from OCBC Finance to a company Seawell Shipping Management &amp;

Agencies Pte Ltd ("Seawell") for the purchase of the vessel "Seawell

Success". The directors and shareholders of the company were Bala and Yeo Chong Lin.

The Defendant acted for the Plaintiffs and OCBC Finance in these transactions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. On 27 August 1993, the Plaintiffs

executed a second collateral mortgage of the property in favour of OCBC Finance. The

Plaintiffs executed this mortgage to secure a further loan from OCBC Finance to Seawell

for $2,500,000 for the purchase of another vessel, the "Seawell Sapphire". The

Defendant also acted for the Plaintiffs and OCBC Finance in this mortgage, which was

perfected on 26 October 1994 after OCBC Finance paid out the loan in full.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. The Plaintiffs and Seawell did not keep

up with the scheduled repayments of the loans, and OCBC Finance pressed the Plaintiffs for

payment. The Plaintiffs were advised that they should sell the property to repay the

loans, or the mortgagees would sell it. On 2 May 1996 the Plaintiffs issued an option to

Yeo Holdings Pte Ltd ("Yeo Holdings") a company controlled by Yeo Chong Lin, to

purchase the property at $2.5 million. The option was exercised on 10 June 1996. The sale

was completed on 18 June 1996 simultaneously with the discharge of the mortgage and

collateral mortgages. The Defendant acted for the Plaintiffs, OCBC Finance and Yeo

Holdings in these transactions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The Plaintiffs did not receive any part

of the sale proceeds beyond the repayment to their CPF accounts the sums they withdrew to

purchase the property with accrued interest because the payment was effected in accordance

to a letter of authority they executed dated 18 June 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. They pleaded that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In breach of her contractual duty and/or

  negligence, the Defendant failed to exercise all proper skill and care, diligence and

  competence in and about the sale and/or conveyance of the said property.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Inducing the Plaintiffs to sign the

  Transfer in favour of the Purchasers without disclosing the balance amount due to them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Failed to render a completion account

  for the approval of the Plaintiffs before the completion of the sale of the property.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) Failed to obtain instructions of the

  Plaintiffs’ interest in the purported redevelopment of the property was properly

  protected.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) In all circumstances, failing to carry

  out her work with due skill and care.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. They quantified their claim at

$1,740,294.85 "being the balance of the sale price of $2.5 million less payment to

CPF Board in the sum of $228,698.34, payment to OCBC Finance $530,800.81 being the Housing

Loan, and $206.00 being the legal costs paid to CPF Solicitors."</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Plaintiffs’ case</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The Plaintiffs’ case is that they

wanted to buy a property for their home. They were looking for a house of about $400,000,

which was what they could afford. Their brother Bala learnt that the property was

available and persuaded them to buy it although the price was $630,000. Bala promised to

help them get a housing loan, and also to assist them with the mortgage repayments.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. Bala played an active role in the

purchase. He made the arrangements with Citibank, and appointed the solicitors who acted

in the purchase.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. The Plaintiffs were obliged to make

monthly repayments to Citibank. They intended to do that by making withdrawals from their

CPF accounts, by monthly $800 cash payments they handed to Bala, then Bala would help to

top up the shortfall. The payments Bala made were to be considered as loans which had to

be repaid.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. Bala did not sustain his assistance

with the mortgage payments and the Plaintiffs fell behind in the payments. Bala found a

solution for the Plaintiffs. He arranged for them to repay Citibank with a loan from UMBC

Finance. Bala made the arrangements and appointed the solicitors for these transactions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. The relief was short-lived and soon

the Plaintiffs were having difficulties in servicing the UMBC Finance loan. Bala arranged

another change of lenders, this time to OCBC Finance. This was accomplished on 23 December

1992 when the UMBC Finance mortgage was discharged with the help of a $485,000 loan from

OCBC Finance secured on the property. On this occasion Bala also requested the Plaintiffs

to help him obtain a loan for Seawell by offering the property as security.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. The First Plaintiff alleged that the

Defendant did not explain to him and the Second Plaintiff the terms of the mortgage

documents they executed or advise them on their liability and obligations thereunder. The

same complaint was made in respect of the second collateral mortgage they executed

subsequently.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. The First Plaintiff referred to an

occasion in February 1996 when the Defendant and Sharon Lee-Tay, Assistant General Manager

of OCBC Finance came to the property. They told him that the shipping loans were not paid,

and that OCBC Finance may sell that property to recover the loans. He told them that he

and the Second Plaintiff could not repay the shipping loans and suggested that OCBC

Finance look to Bala and his associates for payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. He told Bala about the visit and Bala

promised to do something. In May or June 1996 Bala brought an option for him and the

Second Plaintiff to sign. Bala told them the option was prepared by the Defendant and was

for the sale of the property for $2.5 million to Yeo Holdings. They signed the option and

handed it back to Bala. A few days before the completion Bala saw them again with a letter

of authority. He told them that the letter was needed to allow repayments to be made to

OCBC Finance and the CPF, and they signed the letter. The First Plaintiff deposed that

Bala also told them that after buying the property, </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… the Purchasers were going to

  redevelop the property soon after the completion of the purchase, and the Purchasers would

  sell one unit in the redevelopment to us.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">They signed the letter of authority on the

strength of the assurance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. The letter is an important document in

these proceedings. It reads</font></p>

Plaintiff that the handwritten words and figures were not inserted when the letter of

authority was produced for him and his brother to sign.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. Their next dealing with the property

was in 18 June when Bala took them to the Defendant’s office. After they arrived at

her office they were taken to another office to execute a statutory declaration before

they were brought back to the Defendant’s office to execute the transfer instrument.</font></p>

  by her in order to pay on our behalf for the semi-detached house to be built on the

  redevelopment of the property by the Purchasers. The Defendant told us that Balakrishnan

  would have told us about the redevelopment and we confirmed. The Defendant told the 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Plaintiff and me that the Purchasers were going to build two semi-detached houses by

  redeveloping the property, and one semi-detached house would be sold to us. We accepted

  what the Defendant had told. The Defendant did not provide any advice on the need to have

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Yeo Chong Lin confirmed that the matters

set out in the letter were correct and that Bala had eventually received $929,800 from the

sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. The Plaintiffs said they glanced

through the letter but did not understand it. They vacated the property in March 1997

without protest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. In March 1998, they went to see the

Defendant to enquire about the redevelopment of the property. The Defendant told them that

Bala had received $929,800 of the sale proceeds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. They were unhappy with the situation

and consulted their current lawyers, Palakrishnan &amp; Partners in April 1998.

Palakrishnan &amp; Partners wrote to the Defendant on 16 November 1998, informing her</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We act for Mr Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27. That remained as the Plaintiffs’

claim till they filed these proceedings and enlarged the claim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Defendant’s case</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28. The Defendant’s case is that Bala

informed her that although the property was registered in the name of the Plaintiffs, it

belonged to him and she accepted and acted on this representation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29. She did not seek confirmation of that

in writing from Bala or the Plaintiffs. She explained that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When the Plaintiffs attended before me to

  execute the Mortgage and Collateral Mortgage of the Property in favour of OCBC Finance,

  they confirmed that I was to act for them and that the Property was beneficially owned by

  Captain Bala. They said that the Property belonged to Captain Bala and that they would act

  in accordance with his instructions. Further, all correspondence pertaining to the

  Property was to be sent to Captain Bala. In any event, before they signed the Mortgage and

  Collateral Mortgage, I explained the contents and implications to them.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30. With regard to the sale of the

property, the Defendant deposed that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometime before 2 May 1996, Captain Bala

  told me that he intended to sell the Property to settle the debt owing to OCBC Finance and

  Yeo. He asked me to prepare an Option to Purchase the Property and gave instructions to me

  for the preparation of a letter of authority as regards the distribution of the sales

  proceeds. On or before 2 May 1996, I gave him a copy of the Option and letter of authority

  which I had prepared on his instructions.<sup> </sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31. On 10 June when Yeo Holdings exercised

the option, she received the Plaintiffs’ letter of authority which was signed but

undated. She sent it back to the Plaintiffs with a request for them to date it. At the

same time, she also informed them that she had requested OCBC Finance for a rebate on the

redemption amount. The next day she wrote to them again with a revised letter with a

correction of the figure in item 2 of the letter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32. She saw the Plaintiffs again on 18

June when the sale was completed. They brought back to her the letter of authority in its

original form. She inserted the words in handwriting and added in the date. She explained

to them the transfer and statutory declaration that they executed that day. The sale was

completed that day, with payment made in accordance with the terms of the letter of

authority, and on 4 July she wrote to the Plaintiff, Bala and Yeo Holdings to report on

the completion.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. Nothing happened till March 1998 when

the Plaintiffs went to her office and asked her for Bala’s whereabouts and told her

that he had absconded, and had not fulfilled his promise to give them a share of the sale

proceeds. She contacted Yeo Chong Lin and obtained from him Bala’s last-known

telephone number and a copy of his accounts with Bala and gave them to the Plaintiffs.

They returned a few days later because they were unable to contact Bala and said that they

will engage a lawyer to sue Bala. She next heard from them through Palakrishnan &amp;

Partner’s letter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The issues to be determined</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. At the end of the hearing, I found

that the issues to be determined are</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Was the Defendant negligent in acting

  on Bala’s instructions?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Was Bala the beneficial owner of the

  property?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Did the Defendant explain the

  mortgages to the Plaintiffs? and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Had the Defendant handled the sale of

  the property properly?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Was the Defendant negligent in acting on

Bala’s instructions?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35. The Defendant was careless in

accepting Bala as the beneficial owner of the property. Bala’s claim that he was the

beneficial owner of the property was self-serving. The certificate of title did not

support his claim as the Plaintiffs were registered as the proprietors, and there was no

caveat lodged to give notice of his interest. Bala did not support his claim with any deed

of trust in his favour. The Defendant should not act on Bala’s assertion without

getting written instructions from him and the Plaintiffs, and to ensure that the proper

documentation is done.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36. Her knowledge that the Plaintiffs had

used their CPF funds to pay for the property should have raised doubts whether they were

bare legal owners; she should be aware that the CPF Board would not release CPF monies for

the acquisition of the legal title in a property when the beneficial interest is vested in

another party. Although she did not act for the CPF Board she should consider these

matters when they came to her attention.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37. In any event, she acted for the OCBC

Finance in the mortgage and the two collateral mortgages. In each of these, the Plaintiffs

mortgaged to OCBC Finance "all the Mortgagor’s registered estate or

interest" in the property. The Plaintiffs were registered as the tenants in common

and equal shares in the certificate of title. That was clearly inconsistent with

Bala’s claim that he was the beneficial owner, yet the Defendant did not bring this

to OCBC Finance’s attention. If Bala’s claim was true, she may have put OCBC

Finance at risk when they made the loans on the assurance of the security offered.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38. Even if Bala was the sole beneficial

owner of the property, the Defendant should nevertheless take instructions from the

Plaintiffs because they were the legal owners. Bala’s claimed beneficial interest did

not entitle him or her to ignore their legal interests.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39. There is further basis for criticism.

The letter of authority she prepared on Bala’s instruction referred to "the

beneficial owners of the property" in plural. Her evidence was that she was informed

that the beneficial owners were Bala and his wife. If that was right, it would be another

reason for her not to act on instructions issued by Bala alone.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Was Bala the beneficial owner of the

property?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40. This issue is relevant because

Bala’s claim may be true even if the Defendant did not verify it. The Plaintiffs were

not Bala’s nominees. They had invested their CPF monies in the property which became

their home. In all the previous dealings with the property, there was no suggestion that

they were not the beneficial owners. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41. Having said that, it does not follow

that Bala did not have any interest in the property. Bala was involved with the property

from the start. He persuaded the Plaintiffs to buy it instead of keeping to their budget

of $400,000 and promised to pay for the shortfall from the Plaintiffs’ CPF and

personal contributions. He found the property, negotiated the price, arranged for the

housing loan and engaged the lawyers. He arranged for it to be used as security for the

two shipping loans, and was very much involved in its eventual sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42. I found the Plaintiffs’ evidence

that Bala’s payments or promised payments were loans difficult to accept. They did

not know how much he had paid or was to pay or how and when they were to repay him. They

allowed the property to be used as security for the shipping loans taken by his company

without any knowledge as to how these loans were going to be repaid.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43. In additional to that, their account

of their payment for the property was unsatisfactory. They claimed that they made payments

by withdrawing from their CPF accounts, by making cash payments of $800 a month and by

relying on Bala’s assurance. However in reply to the Defendant’s interrogatory

on how they had financed the purchase, their answer was "The Plaintiffs borrowed

money from their Central Provident Fund Account, Citibank N.A. and from Captain

Bala", with no reference to any cash payments from them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44. I find on the evidence that Bala may

have had some beneficial interest in the property together with the Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Did the Defendant explain the mortgage to

the Plaintiffs?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45. The Plaintiffs admit that they knew

the mortgages were executed to secure the housing loan and the shipping loans. They also

knew that a mortgagee may take possession of the property and sell it if its loans are not

repaid.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46. They complained that the Defendant had

not explained the mortgage terms to them. The Defendant on the other hand maintained that

she had explained the documents to them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47. I considered the evidence. The

Plaintiffs’ first complaint in the letter of Palakrishnan &amp; Partners of 16

November 1998 was significant. This letter referred to the Defendant’s letter of 4

July 1996. In her letter the Defendant had referred to a payment to Yeo Holdings for

advances made in the repayment to OCBC Finance of loans in respect of the "Seawell

Sapphire" and "Seawell Success" and with the redemption monies paid to OCBC

Finance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48. Palakrishnan &amp; Partners stated

specifically that the Plaintiffs had not instructed her to deduct the $948,591.50 of the

sale proceeds, and demanded payment of that sum. The letter is significant for what it did

not state. It did not state that the Defendant had not explained the terms of the

mortgages to the Plaintiffs or that the other deductions were unauthorised or improper.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49. After receiving their instructions and

the reading of the Defendant’s letter, Palakrishnan &amp; Partners’ considered

opinion was that the balance sum of $948,591.50 should have been paid over to the

Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50. It must be remembered that the sale

was completed on 18 June 1996. The Plaintiffs were unhappy about not receiving any part of

the proceeds when they went to see the Defendant at her office in March 1998, more than a

year and a half later. They went to consult Palakrishnan &amp; Partners in the following

month, when they had lost faith in the Defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51. They must have recounted their

dealings with the Defendant and showed her letter of 4 July to their new lawyers. Their

lawyers must have explained the letter to them to get their instructions on the deductions

made.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52. Nevertheless, Palakrishnan &amp;

Partners only demanded for the $948,591.50 and did not allege that the mortgages were not

explained to the Plaintiffs. That was the Plaintiffs’ position until the writ was

filed on 17 June 1999 with the enlarged claim. In the interim period the letter of 16

November was not withdrawn or supplemented.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53. If the Defendant had not explained the

mortgages which led to the deductions, they would have brought that up with their lawyers,

and their lawyers would have raised that in their letter to the Defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54. I find on the evidence on a balance of

probabilities that the Defendant had explained the terms of the mortgages to the

Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Had the Defendant handled the sale of the

property properly?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55. The property was sold to Yeo Holdings

through the issuance of the option on 2 May which was exercised on 10 June, leading to the

completion on 18 June. The Plaintiffs complained that they were not advised about the $1

fee paid for the option. The consideration for an option is a commercial decision. It can

be $1, $5,000, $10,000 or any sum that may be agreed upon. The Defendant had no duty to

advise the Plaintiffs on it, especially when her advice was not sought.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56. Was she right to comply with the

letter of authority? As I have pointed out earlier, when Palakrishnan &amp; Partners wrote

to the Defendant they informed her "(w)e have been informed, that no instructions

whatsoever, were given by our clients to you, as their solicitors, authorising you to

deduct in particular the sum of $948,591.50 mentioned in your said letter" and they

demanded payment of the $948,591.50.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57. The Plaintiffs signed the letter of

authority, and in the letter of 16 November they accepted the accounts rendered in the

letter of 4 July except for the final balance of $948,591.50 after it was explained to

them. They subsequently enlarged the claim when they instituted this action to

$1,740,294.85, as particularised in paragraph 10. It is difficult to understand the

revision. They had not objected before to the $760,000 paid by Yeo Holdings on Bala’s

behalf to discharge the collateral mortgages and the interest accruing thereon were spelt

out in the letter of authority and also referred to in the Defendant’s letter of 4

July. They also did not explain their claim that the Defendant refunds the costs for

acting for them in the transactions. Whether the Defendant had acted properly or not they

cannot have the proceeds from the sale without paying legal costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58. I find on the facts that the

Plaintiffs’ real complaint was that they did not receive any part of the final

balance of the sale proceeds. The Plaintiffs claim that they were content not to receive

payment when the property was sold because the Defendant represented to them that she was

holding the money for it to be used to pay for one of the houses to be developed on the

property and sold to them. The Defendant maintained that she had complied with the letter

of authority and had reported on the sale in her letter of 4 July.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59. The weight of evidence is against the

Plaintiffs’ account. They knew very little of the house they claimed they were

buying. The First Plaintiff did not know how large the house would be, or how many rooms

it would have. The Second Plaintiff only knew that it would be of two storeys, with

4-plus-1 rooms. Neither knew the price they were to pay for the house because the price

was to be fixed after the house is constructed. Both Plaintiffs acknowledged that there

was no commitment to buy, and both said they would not buy if they could not afford the

price. That was consonant with Yeo Chong Lin’s undisputed evidence that "Bala

and I had never discussed that one of the semi-detached houses was to be sold to the

Plaintiffs".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60. It was improbable that the Defendant

would have told the Plaintiffs that she was holding money for them for the payment of the

house when there was no agreement to buy and no money was received or held by her except

the legal costs. The Defendant would be quite irrational to make that representation on 18

June, then contradict herself with the letter three weeks later.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61. I find that the Defendant had

completed the sale properly in accordance to the Plaintiffs’ letter of authority of

18 June as reported in her letter of 4 July.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62. Although I find that the Defendant was

wrong to act on Bala’s instructions without verification, and that Bala was not the

sole beneficial owner of the property that she accepted him to be, she had explained the

mortgages to the Plaintiffs, acted in accordance with the letter of authority and

accounted for the proceeds of the sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63. In the circumstances, I dismiss the

Plaintiffs’ claim. On the question of costs, I feel that the Defendant should not be

awarded the full costs of the action because her conduct in the transactions relating to

the property was certainly not beyond criticism. She did not discharge her duties properly

in accepting Bala’s assertion without verification and in failing to report to OCBC

Finance Bala’s instructions and her belief that the Plaintiffs were the bare legal

owners of the property. She should receive half the costs of the action instead.</font></p>
