                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by DBS Bank Ltd
                    (“DBS”) against the decision of the trial judge (“the
                    Judge”) in setting aside a charge (“the Charge”) granted by
                    Jurong Hi-Tech Industries Pte Ltd (under judicial management)
                    (“JHTI”) over 74,411,620 shares in MAP Technology Holdings Limited
                    (“MAP”) on the ground that the Charge was an unfair preference
                    under s 227T of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“CA”), read with s 99 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20,
                    2000 Rev Ed) (“BA”) (see <em>Tam Chee Chong
                        and another v DBS Bank Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 310 (“the
                    GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The background facts in these proceedings are as
                    follows. JHTI was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jurong Technologies Industrial
                    Corporation Ltd (under judicial management) (“JTIC”), a public
                    company whose shares were listed on the Singapore Exchange
                    (“SGX”). JHTI and JTIC (collectively, “the
                    Companies”) were in the business of providing electronic manufacturing
                    services (“EMS”). Most of their EMS operations were carried out by
                    JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Companies’ business operations were
                    financed by DBS and a group of banks (“Creditor Banks”), which
                    included ABN AMRO Bank NV (“ABN-AMRO”), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
                    UFJ (“BTMU”), KBC Bank NV (“KBC”), Malayan Banking
                    Berhad (“Maybank”), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd
                    (“OCBC”), RHB Bank Berhad, Coöperatieve Centrale
                    Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, trading as Rabobank International, Singapore
                    Branch (“Rabobank”) and United Overseas Bank Ltd
                    (“UOB”). All the bank facilities were unsecured. These facilities
                    were granted by the Creditor Banks subject to negative pledges given by the
                    Companies and agreements that the Creditor Banks would be entitled to <em>pari passu</em> distribution of the Companies’ assets
                    in the event of the Companies’ insolvent liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In 2006, DBS offered banking facilities to the
                    Companies, which accepted the offer subject to the same conditions as those
                    applicable to the facilities granted by the other Creditor Banks. On
                    27 December 2006, DBS agreed to provide banking facilities to the Companies
                    jointly and severally on this basis. By February 2008, DBS had become the
                    Companies’ main banker in providing the following facilities of various
                    types up to the limit of U$137m:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

                        US$10m.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       When Ms Joyce Lin Li Fang
                    (“Joyce” or “Ms Lin”), a founding member of
                    JTIC and a director since 26 April 1986, and also a director of JHTI since
                    26 August 2003, was appointed Chairman of JTIC in March 2006, she began to
                    be concerned with the level of the Companies’ debts to the Creditor Banks.
                    Sometime in April or May 2008, Ms Lin made a presentation to DBS of the
                    Companies’ financial position and told DBS that some of the
                    Companies’ assets could be “monetised”, <em>ie</em>, sold, to reduce the Companies’ loans. These assets
                    included the Companies’ EMS business, shares in MAP (“MAP
                    shares”) and shares in Min Aik Technology Co Ltd (“Min Aik
                    shares”). From September 2008 to November 2008, the other Creditor Banks,
                    including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, were also informed of the
                    possible sale of these assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       By 30 June 2008, the Companies’ total
                    borrowings had reached the level of S$340m, of which about S$87m was owing to
                    DBS, S$70m to UOB, S$60m to OCBC and the remainder to the other Creditor Banks.
                    In July 2008, JHTI deposited with ABN-AMRO at its request 18.6m of the MAP
                    shares which it (JHTI) held. They were subsequently released to JHTI for
                    conversion into scripless shares. JHTI acquired more MAP shares, bringing its
                    total investment to 74,411,620 MAP shares (slightly below 20% of the paid-up
                    capital of MAP), <em>ie</em>, the total number of MAP
                    shares over which the Charge was eventually granted (we will hereafter refer to
                    the 74,411,620 MAP shares which were the subject of the Charge as “the
                    MAP Shares”). Between August and October 2008, ABN-AMRO requested that
                    the MAP Shares be put in a custodian account with it. The October 2008 request
                    was made as a “non-negotiable condition” for ABN-AMRO to refrain
                    from recalling its facilities. JHTI refused to do so for the reason that, as
                    stated by Dr Chung Siang Joon (“Dr Chung”), JTIC’s
                    executive director of finance, “this can trigger off and become a risk
                    factor should the other [Creditor] Banks come to learn about
                        it”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. He pleaded for support: “I do hope you
                    can understand my difficulty and obligation to the other [Creditor]
                    Banks”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       From September 2008 onwards, the Companies
                    encountered significant financial difficulties, due primarily to the global
                    recession and credit crunch, which had resulted in reduced orders from their
                    customers. During this period, the Companies’ trade creditors were chasing
                    for payment of their debts, and so were all the Creditor Banks. The Companies
                    could only make payments in the ordinary course of business from trade
                    receivables or by drawing on credit lines. The Companies continued to promise
                    the Creditor Banks that they would pay their loans and facilities from the
                    proceeds of sale of the MAP Shares, their Min Aik shares and their EMS business.
                    Although the Companies were defaulting in the payment of debts due to the
                    Creditor Banks, they continued to roll over the debts. The Creditor Banks really
                    had no choice but to wait for the Companies to sell their assets in order to pay
                    their debts to the Creditor Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 14 October 2008, JTIC signed a
                    non-binding term sheet with Global Emerging Markets (“GEM”) to
                    sell part of JTIC’s EMS business (“the GEM Deal”). The
                    announcement made by JTIC the next day on the SGX was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Board of Directors of [JTIC] wishes to announce that [JTIC] has
                        received and signed a non-binding term sheet with [GEM] … pursuant to
                        which GEM, together with various investors … have proposed the
                        formation of a special purpose vehicle … to acquire a significant
                        interest in selected electronic manufacturing services businesses and assets
                        … for cash consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shareholders should note that the Proposed Disposal will be subject to,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, the negotiation and execution
                        of definitive agreements and the conduct of a due diligence ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Creditor Banks were informed that the GEM Deal could bring in as
                    much as US$160m. Two officers from GEM had visited Singapore in October 2008 to
                    evaluate the deal, and KPMG was to conduct the necessary due diligence in
                    January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       During this period, the Companies were in
                    default in paying certain short-term loans given by DBS (<em>ie</em>, the short-term loans mentioned at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> below), which continuously pressed for payment by the
                    deadline of 14 November 2008 from the proceeds of sale of the MAP Shares,
                    as Ms Lin had promised. On 13 November 2008, at a meeting with DBS,
                    Ms Lin had signed a security document which created the Charge. This
                    document (“the Security Memorandum”) was fully executed on
                    17 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 8 December 2008, JTIC made a public
                    announcement that its audit committee had commenced an investigation into
                    alleged irregularities in the administration of the receivables financing
                    facilities extended by Rabobank and OCBC to the Companies. On 9 December
                    2008, KordaMentha Pte Ltd, JTIC’s financial advisers, called a meeting of
                    all the Creditor Banks and informed them of JTIC’s outstanding debts. On
                    10 December 2008, DBS registered the particulars of the Charge with the
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. By the end of December 2008, the
                    Companies had received letters of demand from KBC (on 7 November 2008),
                    Maybank (on 2 and 22 December 2008), ABN-AMRO (on 18 December 2008),
                    OCBC (on 26 December 2008) and BTMU (on 29 December 2008).
                    Additionally, the Companies had also received letters of demand from their trade
                    creditors, some of whom had filed actions in court as early as 12 December
                    2008 to recover their debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 20 February 2009, the Companies were
                    placed under judicial management by the court on the application of some of the
                    Creditor Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 22 June 2009, JHTI’s judicial
                    managers (the respondents in the present appeal) commenced the proceedings
                    against DBS in the court below to set aside the Charge on the basis that it
                    constituted an unfair preference under s 227T of the CA. In a reserved
                    judgment delivered on 18 November 2010 (<em>ie</em>,
                    the GD), the Judge allowed the application, holding that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Charge was an unfair preference
                        under s 227T of the CA, read with s 99 of the BA;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     JHTI was
                        insolvent when it granted the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sole issue in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In this appeal, DBS has not appealed against
                    the Judge’s finding that JHTI was insolvent at the time it granted the
                    Charge. Hence, the sole issue is whether the Judge’s decision that the
                    Charge was an unfair preference under s 227T of the CA, read with s 99
                    of the BA, is correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Before we consider the Judge’s decision
                    and the arguments of the parties in this appeal, it is convenient that we first
                    discuss the principles of law on unfair preference applicable in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on unfair preference in judicial management</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The statutory provisions relating to unfair
                    preferences are set out in s 227T and s 329 of the CA, which provide
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It may be noted that s 329 of the CA
                    makes a distinction between a “void” preference and a
                    “voidable” preference. But, it should also be noted that
                    s 329 makes no reference to judicial management. We highlight these points
                    because under the former bankruptcy regime, the now-repealed Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 BA”) made a distinction
                    between a void preference and a voidable preference, but the BA has abrogated
                    such a distinction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In this appeal, DBS has not raised the issue
                    as to whether an unfair preference is a void, as distinguished from a voidable,
                    transaction under s 227T(1) of the CA: see s 329 of the CA. We assume
                    that this omission was a deliberate decision for the reason that the 1985 BA,
                    which had created such a distinction, was repealed on 15 July 1995 by the
                    new Bankruptcy Act No 15 of 1995 on the same day that the then equivalent
                    of s 329 of the CA was amended to refer expressly to, <em>inter alia</em>, the then equivalent of s 99 of the BA. In other
                    words, the retention of the distinction in s 329 of the CA between a void
                    transaction and a voidable one was a drafting oversight (see the apt comments of
                    Lim Teong Qwee JC in <em>Buildspeed Construction Pte Ltd (in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Section 99 of the BA is derived from
                    s 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (“the 1986 UK
                    Insolvency Act”), which was enacted to give effect to the recommendations
                    of the Report of the Review Committee on Insolvency Law and Practice
                    (Cmnd 8558, 1982) (“the <em>Cork
                    Report</em>”). Prior to 1986, the statutory test of an unfair
                    preference (under s 44(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 (c 59) (UK) and
                    s 53 of the 1985 BA) was that the debtor must have a <em>dominant</em> intention of preferring the creditor before the
                    relevant transaction could be set aside : see <em>Sharp (Official
                        Receiver) v Jackson and others</em> [1899] AC 419 at
                    423–425, 427 and <em>Lin Securities Pte v Royal Trust Bank
                        (Asia) Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 899 at [23]. The 1986 UK Insolvency Act introduced
                    the test of whether the debtor was influenced by a subjective desire to prefer a
                    specific creditor or creditors to the general body of creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The seminal and illuminating decision on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>MC Bacon</em>,
                    Millett J explained the new statutory test as follows (at
                    335E–336A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What the court has to do is to interpret the language of the statute and
                        apply it. It will no longer inquire whether there was ‘a dominant
                        intention to prefer’ the creditor, but whether the company’s
                        decision was ‘influenced by a desire to produce the effect mentioned
                        in sub-s (4)(<em>b</em>)’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a completely different test. It involves at least two radical
                        departures from the old law. It is no longer necessary to establish a
                        dominant intention to prefer. It is sufficient that the decision was
                        influenced by the requisite desire. That is the first change. The second is
                        that it is no longer sufficient to establish an intention to prefer. There
                        must be a desire to produce the effect mentioned in the subsection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This second change is made necessary by the first, for without it it would
                        be virtually impossible to uphold the validity of a security taken in
                        exchange for the injection of fresh funds into a company in financial
                        difficulties. A man is taken to intend the necessary consequences of his
                        actions, so that an intention to grant a security to a creditor necessarily
                        involves an intention to prefer that creditor in the event of insolvency.
                        The need to establish that such intention was dominant was essential under
                        the old law to prevent perfectly proper transactions from being struck down.
                        With the abolition of that requirement intention could not remain the
                        relevant test. Desire has been substituted. That is a very different matter.
                        Intention is objective, desire is subjective. A man can choose the lesser of
                        two evils without desiring either.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not, however, sufficient to establish a desire to make the payment
                        or grant the security which it is sought to avoid. There must have been a
                        desire to ... improve the creditor’s position in the event of an
                        insolvent liquidation. <em>A man is not to be taken as
                            desiring all the necessary consequences of his actions</em>.
                            <em>Some consequences may be of advantage to him and
                            desired by him; others may not affect him and be matters of indifference
                            to him; while still others may be positively disadvantageous to him and
                            not be desired by him, but be regarded by him as the unavoidable price
                            of obtaining the desired advantages</em>. It will still be
                        possible to provide assistance to a company in financial difficulties
                        provided that the company is actuated only by proper commercial
                        considerations. Under the new regime a transaction will not be set aside as
                        a voidable preference unless the company positively wished to improve the
                        creditor’s position in the event of its own insolvent
                        liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Millett J’s propositions may be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The test is not whether there is a
                        dominant intention to prefer, but whether the debtor’s decision was
                        influenced by a desire to prefer the creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The court will look at the desire (a subjective
                        state of mind) of the debtor to determine whether it had positively wished
                        to improve the creditor’s position in the event of its own insolvent
                        liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     The requisite desire may be proved by direct evidence or its existence may
                        be inferred from the existing circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     It is sufficient that the desire to
                        prefer is one of the factors which influenced the decision to enter into the
                        transaction; it need not be the sole or decisive factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     A transaction which is actuated only
                        by proper commercial considerations will not constitute a voidable
                        preference. A genuine belief in the existence of a proper commercial
                        consideration may be sufficient even if, objectively, such a belief might
                        not be sustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>MC Bacon</em>,
                    Millett J found as a fact that the security was given to the bank as a
                    result of proper commercial pressure and not from a desire to produce the effect
                    of a preference. He said (at 336F–337E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Glover and Martin both gave evidence; Mr Creal did not. I
                        accept Martin as a reliable witness. Mr Glover was far from reliable,
                        but I accept him as an honest witness who tried his garrulous best to help
                        the court. His recollection was poor and much of his evidence consisted of
                        inaccurate reconstruction. It was chiefly valuable for the insights it gave
                        of his own and others’ motives ... I am satisfied that he remained a
                        de facto director and that he was a party to and greatly influenced all
                        decisions of importance in relation to financial matters. In relation to the
                        bank’s debenture ... he did not take sides but gave his evidence
                        fairly and impartially ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am satisfied that ... Mr Glover, Mr Creal and Martin <em>knew</em> ... (ii) that [the company’s]
                        continuing to trade was entirely dependent on the continued support of the
                        bank; (iii) that if the debenture ... were not forthcoming the bank
                        would withdraw its support; and (iv) that if the bank withdrew its
                        support the company would be forced into immediate liquidation. I am also
                        satisfied that they had decided to continue trading in a <em>genuine belief</em> that the company could be pulled around. It
                        follows that they had no choice but to accede to the bank’s request
                        for a debenture. I accept Martin’s evidence: ‘It was viewed as a
                        simple decision. Either we gave the bank a debenture or they called in the
                        overdraft.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That sufficiently explains the decision to grant the debenture and there
                        is no justification for inferring any other reason. There is no evidence
                        that either Martin or Mr Creal wanted to improve the bank’s
                        position in the event of an insolvent liquidation and there is no reason why
                        they should. I find as a fact that in deciding to grant the debenture to the
                        bank neither [Martin nor Mr Creal] was motivated by any desire except the
                        desire to avoid calling in the overdraft and to continue trading. That,
                        however, is not the end of the matter. They were greatly influenced by
                        Mr Glover’s recommendation that the debenture should be granted,
                        and I turn to examine his evidence to see whether he was influenced by a
                        desire to improve the bank’s position in the event of a liquidation
                        for, if he was, then, in my judgment, the company’s decision was
                        similarly influenced, even though Mr Glover did not communicate any
                        such desire to the others.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Glover’s evidence was to the same effect. He
                        knew that if the company was to continue to trade it had no choice but to
                        grant the debenture. He had a further reason for recommending it to the
                        others. He <em>believed</em> that a debenture was not
                        valid unless the company continued to trade for six months after it was
                        given. Accordingly, he conceived the <em>eccentric
                            notion</em> that if the bank took a debenture it would have to
                        continue to support the company for a further six months. As he put
                        it:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">‘A.    I viewed the bank, that the bank, having
                                got the debenture, would then have to give us credit for a further
                                six months...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Q.    What was the point in giving the bank a
                                debenture, in your mind? A. In the first and foremost, to secure an
                                overdraft of £250,000 for a guaranteed six
                                months.’</p>

                    the logical implications of the subjective statutory test (at 374):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the one hand, it seems to me that it would be unsatisfactory that a

                        future prospects of a company which is in fact insolvent can result in an
                        undoubted act of preference to a director escaping the accountability
                        imposed by s 239. On the other hand, of course, <em>the
                            section does require, in conclusion, that the transaction was,
                            subjectively, motivated by the relevant desire</em>. [emphasis

                        Hartigan</em> [1993] BCLC 643, where Mummery J said (at
                    649G):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [I]t does not follow that, because there was a desire to grant the
                        debenture or to make the payment, there was a desire to prefer the creditor
                        in the event of insolvency. If the company is influenced by ‘proper
                        commercial considerations’ and not by a ‘positive wish to
                        improve the creditor’s position in the event of its insolvent
                        liquidation’, then the debenture will be valid. If a desire to prefer
                        is present, however, it is sufficient that it influences the decision. It
                        does not have to be the sole or decisive influence on the decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Amrae
                        Benchuan</em>, Sundaresh Menon JC expressed a similar view in
                    stating at [51]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A person is taken to intend the natural consequence of his
                        action. As every payment or grant of security potentially has the effect of
                        preferring the payee or the grantee in the event of the paying
                        company’s subsequent insolvency, something more has to be shown.
                        Otherwise, the question of preference would be determined in every case
                        simply by undertaking an objective inquiry into whether in effect there had
                        been a preference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The “something more” referred to by Menon JC is, of
                    course, the debtor’s subjective desire to improve the creditor’s
                    position in the event of its own insolvent liquidation, which desire must be a
                    factor that influenced the debtor’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The burden of proof is on the Official
                    Assignee to show that the bankrupt had the desire to improve the position of a

                    principles to the facts as found by him. He found that there was ample evidence

                                            is more than ample evidence that in granting the Charge,
                                            JHTI desired putting [DBS] in a better position than it

                                            influenced the granting of the Charge. Ms Lin
                                            stated in her first affidavit, filed on 22 June
                                            2009, that she was willing to sign the Security
                                            Memorandum to grant the Charge as [DBS] had helped the
                                            Companies by granting the Companies short term loans
                                            when no other bank was willing to do so, and [DBS] had
                                            been very supportive of the Companies. She further
                                            stated in her second affidavit, filed on 27 August
                                            2009, that the “fact that DBS wanted to provide
                                            financing to the Companies even in November 2008 made me
                                            feel that DBS was very supportive of the Companies, and
                                            this support <em>contributed</em>

                                            letter of demand. Prior to 13 November 2008, there
                                            was no indication that [DBS] had approved the recall of

                                            granting of the Charge. Although [DBS] alleged that the

                                            extension for payment, this was not conveyed to the
                                            Companies. In any event, it is questionable that a
                                            two-week extension would have constituted a proper
                                            commercial consideration, given JHTI’s dire
                                            situation ... <em>There were, therefore,
                                                no valid commercial reasons for JHTI to grant the
                                                Charge to [DBS]. Thus, there was clearly a desire to
                                                prefer [DBS] that influenced the granting of the
                                                Charge</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In connection with his finding that KBC had
                    exerted greater pressure on JHTI than DBS (because KBC had issued a letter of
                    demand to recall all its facilities, whereas DBS had not done so), the Judge
                    referred to <em>Re Sweetmart</em>, where the court set
                    aside a payment to one of the creditors as an unfair preference. In coming to
                    this conclusion, the court in <em>Re Sweetmart</em> held
                    (at [29]) that the steps taken by the
                    other banks were “more concrete, more serious, and instituted much more
                    promptly” than those threatened by the preferred bank, and furthermore
                    (at [30]), given the company’s
                    disastrous financial position, it could not have thought that it would be able
                    to carry on business for any decent length of time so as to benefit from
                    maintaining its relationship with the preferred bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Judge concluded (at [50] of the GD) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    Similarly, in the case at hand, the pressure
                            exerted by [DBS] pales in comparison with that exerted by the other
                            [Creditor] [B]anks that had already sent the Companies formal letters of
                            demand ... As for [DBS’s] attempts to justify the grant of the
                            Charge as being based on commercial reasons, the reasoning in <em>Re Sweetmart</em> is apropos: given JHTI’s
                            overall indebtedness and the letters of demand that had been served on
                            JHTI up to that point, JHTI could not possibly have envisaged carrying
                            on its business for any decent length of time even if it had managed to
                            avoid having [DBS] issue a letter of demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For these reasons, the Judge found that there was no proper
                    commercial reason for JHTI to grant the Charge to DBS at the relevant
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Judge also rejected DBS’s argument
                    that JHTI had been influenced by proper commercial considerations in granting
                    the Charge in these words (at [51]–[53] of the
                    GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    Counsel for [DBS], Mr Ashok Kumar, made
                            several arguments. First, he argued that the Charge was granted in order
                            to avert [DBS] recalling its facilities and allow the Companies to
                            pursue and close the GEM Deal. (Ms Lin had testified that this
                            deal, had it closed, would have possibly brought in US$160m for the
                            Companies.) The GEM Deal would have been scuttled if [DBS] had issued a
                            letter of demand; thus, [JHTI] was influenced by proper commercial
                            considerations in granting the Charge. Furthermore, KBC, one of the two
                            creditors that had served a letter of demand prior to the granting of
                            the Charge, had agreed to a standstill arrangement with the Companies
                            and not to do anything until the GEM Deal had carried through. It
                            emerged at trial that the letter of demand from the other creditor,
                            Rabobank, was never received by the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    However, this contention was untenable.
                            Realistically, it could not have been a proper commercial consideration
                            to grant the Charge with a view to averting a declaration of default by
                            [DBS] when the Companies were heavily indebted to many other [Creditor]
                            [B]anks at the same time. JHTI could not possibly have expected them to
                            wait patiently while the GEM Deal was pursued, and especially not after
                            letters of demand had already been issued – much less after
                            finding out about the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    On cross-examination, Ms Khua agreed with
                            counsel for the plaintiffs [the respondents in the present appeal] that
                            if the other [Creditor] [B]anks had found out about the Charge, the GEM
                            Deal could not close. It may have been the case that KBC was willing to
                            hold off until the closing of the GEM Deal; but that did not mean that
                            the other creditors, Rabobank included, would have been willing to do so
                            as well. Moreover, once the other creditors discovered that [DBS] had
                            been given the Charge, they would have applied either to wind up the
                            company or to place it under judicial management so as to preserve their
                            right to impugn the preference. In fact, it was only after [DBS] had
                            lodged the Charge for registration on 10 December 2008 that the
                            other [Creditor] [B]anks, namely, ABN AMRO, BTMU, Maybank and OCBC sent
                            the Companies letters of demand. This is not surprising, as the
                            [Creditor] [B]anks would have found out about the Charge upon its
                            registration. I therefore did not agree with [DBS’s] counsel that
                            there were proper commercial considerations influencing the decision to
                            grant the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To summarise the Judge’s findings of
                    fact:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ms Lin and her co-directors had
                        executed the Charge as they felt that DBS had been very supportive of the
                        Companies in their hour of need.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     The other Creditor Banks had exerted equal, if not more,
                        pressure on the Companies to pay their debts, and, yet, DBS was given the
                        Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     DBS
                        provided no proper commercial consideration for the Charge, in that:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       JHTI was not placed in a
                            position where DBS would call a default (and thereby scuttle the GEM
                            Deal) if it did not execute the Charge because DBS had not issued a
                            letter of demand. Even if such a letter had been issued and JHTI had
                            averted the risk of DBS calling a default by granting the Charge, the
                            other Creditor Banks would have called a default once they found out
                            about the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       No new facilities were granted or disbursed by
                            DBS as a result of the grant of the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_32-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       DBS had not given the Companies an
                            extension of two weeks to repay certain short-term loans (<em>ie</em>, the short-term loans mentioned at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> below) in return for JHTI granting
                            the Charge, but, even if DBS had given such an extension, it would also
                            have been a futile exercise as the other Creditor Banks would have
                            called a default eventually (which they
                did).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision in this appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As we have stated earlier, the sole issue
                    before us is whether the Judge was justified in finding that the Charge was an
                    unfair preference. Thus, this entire appeal turns on whether JHTI agreed to
                    grant the Charge because it desired to improve DBS’s position in the event
                    of its (JHTI’s) liquidation, or because it had no choice as DBS would
                    otherwise have declared an event of default and recalled its facilities, thus
                    scuttling the GEM Deal. In this appeal, DBS no longer relies on the ground that
                    it had given an extension of time of two weeks to the Companies to repay the
                    short-term loans mentioned at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> below as
                    consideration for the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     DBS’s case is essentially that the Judge
                    was wrong to have accepted Ms Lin’s testimony and that of her
                    co-directors that JHTI had agreed to give the Charge because DBS had been
                    supportive of the Companies. In our view, the Judge was correct to find, on the
                    evidence, that DBS had been supportive of the Companies – certainly more
                    than the other Creditor Banks. The question is whether this was a factor which
                    had influenced JHTI to agree to give the Charge. DBS has argued that the Judge
                    should have inferred from all the circumstances – especially the desperate
                    financial straits of the Companies, the ongoing intention of the Companies to
                    monetise their assets (especially the GEM Deal) and DBS’s oral threats to
                    call a default if JHTI did not agree to give the Charge – that JHTI had no
                    choice but to give the Charge. It had no choice because the GEM Deal was
                    critical to the Companies’ survival, and, therefore, it could not afford
                    to allow DBS to call a default and thereby scuttle the deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is an established principle that an
                    appellate court will not ordinarily disagree with the findings of fact of the
                    trial judge, especially where he has heard oral testimony and has based his
                    findings on his evaluation of the witnesses’ credibility. An appellate
                    court is entitled to reverse the findings of fact of the trial judge only when
                    they are manifestly wrong and any advantage which the trial judge enjoyed by
                    having seen and heard the witnesses is not sufficient to explain his conclusion:
                    see <em>Watt or Thomas v Thomas</em>
                    [1947] AC 484 at 487–488, cited with approval by the Privy
                    Council in <em>Chow Yee Wah &amp; Anor v Choo Ah Pat</em>
                    [1978] 2 MLJ 41 (an appeal from Malaysia); see also <em>Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v Comtech IT Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1998] 2 SLR(R) 1010 at [32]. Let
                    us now look closer at the evidence of the two main witnesses in this case,
                        <em>viz</em>, Ms Lin and Ms Khua (the DBS
                    officer who was managing the Companies’ account at the material time) on
                    the circumstances leading to the grant of the Charge on 13 November
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     DBS had granted three short-term or ad hoc
                    loans to the Companies: (a) a S$5m loan made on 2 July 2008 to assist
                    JHTI to acquire 100% of the shares in Priver Electric (BVI) Co Ltd; (b) a
                    S$6m loan made on 26 September 2008 to enable JTIC to pay dividends to its
                    shareholders; and (c) a S$0.5m loan made on 29 September 2008 for the
                    Companies’ working capital. These short-term loans are referred to in the
                    pleadings as “the S$9m short-term loans”, and we will use the same
                    expression in the rest of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     According to Ms Khua, JHTI had agreed to
                    deposit the MAP Shares in a custodian account with DBS Nominees Pte Ltd as a
                    condition for DBS granting the Companies the second of the S$9m short-term
                    loans. The custodian account was opened on 23 September 2008 and the MAP
                    Shares were placed in that account. DBS did not ask for a charge on the MAP
                    Shares at that time (presumably because of the negative pledges given by the
                    Companies to the other Creditor Banks). By 29 October 2008, the
                    Companies’ debts to DBS had reached a level that was causing great concern
                    to DBS, probably exacerbated by its knowledge of the level of the
                    Companies’ debts to the other Creditor Banks. Ms Khua’s more
                    immediate concern was the repayment of the S$9m short-term loans, which the
                    Companies had promised to repay from the proceeds of sale of the MAP Shares,
                    whose market value had been falling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On 29 October 2008, Ms Khua sent an
                    e-mail (copied to Ms Lin) to Dr Chung and another director of the
                    Companies, Mr Yeo Pek Heng Roland (“Roland” or
                    “Mr Yeo”), which set a deadline of 14 November 2008 for
                    payment of the S$9m short-term loans from the proceeds of sale of the MAP
                    Shares. On 6 November 2008, Ms Khua and Mr Law Heng Huan Terry
                    (Ms Khua’s subordinate) met Ms Lin and followed up with the
                    following e-mail:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

                    sent an e-mail to Dr Chung, copied to Mr Yeo and others, asking him

                    Ms Khua, she was told that since the MAP Shares had not been sold and since
                    their market price kept on falling, DBS wanted a charge on the MAP Shares as
                    security. Ms Lin agreed, and signed the Security Memorandum to create the
                    Charge. Her understanding was that the Charge was meant to secure only the S$9m
                    short-term loans, which she had promised JHTI would repay from the proceeds of
                    sale of the MAP Shares. She deposed that JHTI decided to give the Charge because
                    DBS had helped the Companies by giving them the S$9m short-term loans when no
                    other bank was willing to do so, and because DBS had been very supportive of the
                    Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Ms Lin was cross-examined on this issue.
                    Counsel for DBS put to her that JHTI had agreed to grant the Charge because it
                    did not want DBS, the Companies’ main banker, to pull the plug, <em>ie</em>, to declare a default and recall all the loans which
                    DBS had made to the Companies. The notes of evidence show the following

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In her affidavit dated 13 August 2009,
                    Ms Khua made the following statements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     DBS informed the Companies on 17 and
                        20 October 2008 that events of default had occurred and that DBS had
                        the right to recall all the banking facilities which it had granted them (at
                        paras 38–39).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     Ms Lin agreed on 6 November 2008 to sell the
                        MAP Shares to meet the Companies’ repayment obligations punctually (at
                        para 48).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     On 11 November 2008, Ms Lin sought an extension of time to sell
                        the MAP Shares as there was a proposal to make MAP private, and she believed
                        the price of MAP shares would go up. Ms Lin agreed that JHTI would give
                        the Charge as consideration for the extension of time (at
                        para 56).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     On 12 November 2008, Ms Lin informed DBS that JHTI’s board of
                        directors would be approving the sale of the MAP Shares to meet the
                        Companies’ payment obligations to DBS (at
                    para 57).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_e"></a>(e)     On
                        13 November 2008, DBS again impressed on the Companies the total amount
                        due to DBS and stated that JHTI was to sell the MAP Shares immediately (at
                        para 58).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_f"></a>(f)     JHTI gave DBS the Charge so that DBS would not recall the entire banking
                        facilities (at para 59).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_g"></a>(g)     DBS insisted that the Security Memorandum be signed by
                        13 November 2008 as Ms Lin was going on a long business trip (at
                        para 62).</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of the evidence of Ms Lin and Ms Khua</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We have referred to the above passages
                    relating to the affidavits of the two key witnesses in this case –
                    Ms Lin for JHTI and Ms Khua for DBS – and have set out the
                    material parts of their oral evidence to show why the Judge chose to accept
                    Ms Lin’s evidence as credible and Ms Khua’s evidence as
                    not credible. Ms Lin’s oral testimony was consistent with what she
                    had deposed in her affidavit, and she gave her testimony in a forthright manner
                    and did not fudge her evidence. In contrast, Ms Khua prevaricated in her
                    testimony and tried to make up answers to counsel’s questions in order to
                    support her assertions that JHTI gave the Charge because it had no choice in the
                    matter. In our view, the evidence clearly shows that DBS asked for the Charge on
                    the MAP Shares on 13 November 2008 in lieu of the Companies’ promise
                    to sell the MAP Shares to pay off the S$9m short-term loans by 14 November
                    2008, which the Companies could not do. Further, in asking for the Charge, DBS
                    did not specifically tell Ms Lin that it wanted the MAP Shares to secure
                    all its facilities. Had DBS informed Ms Lin of this, JHTI would have
                    refused to grant the Charge because of the negative pledges given by the
                    Companies to all the Creditor Banks. The Companies were certainly in default in
                    repaying their loans, and had been in default for some time. But, at no time did
                    DBS threaten to declare an event of default and recall all its banking
                    facilities because it was not in its interest then to bring down the Companies.
                    Ms Khua’s evidence that Ms Lin had agreed that JHTI would give
                    the Charge as consideration for an extension of time to sell the MAP Shares was
                    found to be Ms Khua’s own justification as recorded in an internal
                    memo. Ms Lin was never made aware of this, nor was she made aware that
                    Ms Khua intended to use the Charge to secure the Companies’ total
                    indebtedness to DBS. Ms Khua’s assertion that the consideration for
                    the Charge was the two-week extension of time to sell the MAP Shares was not
                    consistent with her allegation that Ms Lin had succumbed to DBS’s
                    threat (or contemplation) to recall all the facilities on 13 November 2008
                    if JHTI refused to execute the Charge. In fact, DBS did not formally recall its
                    facilities until 14 January 2009, when it sent a formal letter of demand
                    after all the other Creditor Banks had done so. Ms Khua gave an
                    inconsistent, and at times incoherent, account of the reasons why DBS had asked
                    Ms Lin to agree to JHTI giving the Charge due to the fact that she
                    (Ms Khua) was trying to justify using the Charge to secure all the
                    Companies’ liabilities to DBS when that was neither Ms Lin’s
                    nor Ms Khua’s intention when the Charge was given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Thus, on the evidence, Ms Lin
                    consistently said that JHTI gave the Charge to secure the S$9m short-term loans
                    to honour her promise that JHTI would pay those loans from the proceeds of sale
                    of the MAP Shares. At the same time, she testified that JHTI gave the Charge
                    because DBS had been very supportive of the Companies. In contrast, what we have
                    from Ms Khua is a somewhat disjointed account of why the DBS asked for the
                    Charge <em>only</em> on 13 November 2008, when
                    Ms Lin was about to go overseas. It seems to us that on the evidence, there
                    was nothing manifestly wrong with the Judge’s finding. In fact, we would
                    go so far as to say that the Judge was perfectly justified in finding that
                    JHTI’s decision to grant the Charge was influenced by a desire to give DBS
                    what it wanted because it had been good to the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There was also produced to the Judge a DBS
                    internal memorandum dated 17 November 2008, prepared four days after
                    Ms Lin signed the Security Memorandum and on the day the Charge was duly
                    executed and returned to DBS (see Ms Khua’s affidavit at
                    para 63). The material portions of this memorandum (sent through
                    Ms Khua and three other officers) read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The S$9m short-term loan[s] which we accommodated on an adhoc basis [are]
                        to be repaid by 14 Nov 08 … JHT [<em>ie</em>, JHTI] agreed to repay the [S$9m] short-term loan[s] via
                        proceeds from sale of the [MAP Shares].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of a possible privatization of MAP by private equity firm,
                        JHT requested that the [S$9m] short[-]term loan[s] be extended. In
                        consideration, JHT agreed to DBS’[s] charge on [the] MAP [S]hares
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Total bank borrowings amounted to S$318m as at 30 Sep 08, all granted
                        on a clean basis based on negative pledge and pari passu clauses. We will
                        seek legal advice on our rights in taking the shares as security. In the
                        meantime, the [C]harge on [the] MAP [S]hares is taken for whatever it is
                        worth. JHT has placed [the] MAP [S]hares in our custody and we are now
                        effecting the transfer into the collateral account to have control over the
                        proceeds for repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">JHT’s 74.412m shares represents 19.95 % of MAP’s total issued
                        share capital … and is in breach of the 10% concentration limit under
                        our Core Credit Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">CCO’s approval is now sought to accept excess collateral of MAP
                        shares of up to 20%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     What this memorandum shows clearly is that
                    when Ms Khua or her colleague asked JHTI (through Ms Lin) for a charge
                    on the MAP Shares, no internal approval had been granted to accept the MAP
                    Shares as security for all the credit facilities extended by DBS to the
                    Companies. It also shows that Ms Khua’s testimony that JHTI had given
                    the Charge as security because it did not want DBS to declare an event of
                    default and that the MAP Shares were meant to secure all the liabilities of the
                    Companies to DBS was a fairy tale. DBS’s case rested entirely on
                    Ms Khua’s discredited testimony, which was inconsistent with her own
                    internal memorandum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For these reasons, we agree with the
                    Judge’s finding of fact that JHTI’s decision to give the Charge to
                    DBS was influenced by its desire to prefer DBS to the other Creditor Banks. We
                    also agree with the Judge’s finding that there was no proper commercial
                    consideration for the Charge, and this reinforced the conclusion that JHTI had
                    positively wished to improve DBS’s position in the event of its
                    (JHTI’s) insolvency.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our observations on the negative pledges and the <em>pari passu</em> clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Before we conclude our judgment, we would like
                    to make some observations of the relevance in these proceedings of the negative
                    pledges and the <em>pari passu</em> clauses which the
                    Companies had undertaken in respect of all the Creditor Banks. We have earlier
                    referred to DBS offering, and the Companies accepting, its banking facilities
                    subject to these two contractual terms. The precise terms are set out in
                    DBS’s letter of offer dated 27 December 2006 as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">5.1 <u>Negative
                        Pledge</u></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except for overseas subsidiaries, you [the Companies] will not and will
                        ensure that none of your subsidiaries will create or permit to arise or
                        subsist any debenture, mortgage, charge (whether fixed or floating), pledge,
                        lien or any other encumbrance whatsoever or any other agreement or
                        arrangement having substantially the same effect on your assets or factor
                        any of your accounts receivables.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">5.4 <u>Obligations to rank
                            Pari-passu</u></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You [the Companies] will ensure that your obligations under the facility
                        documents are unconditional and unsubordinated and will at all times rank at
                        least pari passu with all your other unsecured and unsubordinated
                        obligations (except for such obligations mandatorily preferred by
                        law).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It is not disputed that the material terms of
                    the negative pledges and the <em>pari passu</em>
                    undertakings given by the Companies to all the Creditor Banks are substantially
                    the same in effect (see also <em>Coöperatieve Centrale
                        Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International, Singapore
                        Branch) v Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp Ltd (under judicial
                        management)</em> [2011] SGCA 48, our decision in a related appeal,
                    Civil Appeal No 5 of 2011).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     A negative pledge is an undertaking by a
                    borrower or debtor to a lender or creditor not to give security to any other
                    present or future lender or creditor. It is a device usually employed by a
                    borrower who has commercial bargaining power not to encumber any of its assets
                    where its business or operations are financed by more than one lender so that it
                    can deal with its assets freely in its own commercial interests. A negative
                    pledge clause fulfils the function of contractually preventing any creditor from
                    trying to obtain security over the assets of the debtor at any time, and
                    particularly when the debtor is in deep financial distress and the creditor
                    wants its overdue debts paid before the claims of other creditors. In such
                    cases, a creditor who induces the debtor to breach the latter’s negative
                    pledges to other creditors may be liable for the tort of interfering with the
                    contractual relations of the debtor with those creditors: see <em>First Wyoming Bank v Mudge</em> (1998) 748 P 2d
                713.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Hence, the relevance of a negative pledge to
                    the law of unfair preference is indirect and peripheral. It is a contractual
                    gloss on a legislative scheme which large corporations who need to borrow large
                    sums of money from financial institutions may find inadequate in protecting them
                    from undue pressures at a time when they need to satisfy the demands of all
                    their creditors, but do not have sufficient resources to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     A <em>pari passu</em>
                    undertaking has the function of preventing a creditor from applying undue
                    pressure on the debtor to pay its overdue debts to the former. Unlike a negative
                    pledge, which is directed against the giving of security, a <em>pari passu</em> undertaking is directed against the payment of moneys
                    to creditors. Further, unlike a negative pledge, a <em>pari
                        passu</em> undertaking is a positive obligation to treat all creditors
                    on a <em>pari passu</em> basis at all times, and it is
                    inherent in such an undertaking that the borrower will not prefer one creditor
                    to another creditor. Accordingly, the inducement by one creditor of a breach of
                    the debtor’s obligation under a <em>pari passu</em>
                    undertaking will have the same effect in law as the inducement of a breach of
                    the debtor’s obligation under a negative pledge, <em>ie</em>, it will amount to an interference with contractual
                    relations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Hence, the combined operation of a negative
                    pledge and a <em>pari passu</em> undertaking given by a
                    debtor to a group of creditors has the effect of creating among the contracting
                    parties a “cessation of payments”, except in the ordinary course
                    of business. This notion of a “cessation of payments” introduced
                    by Australian law was rejected by the <em>Cork Report</em>
                    for the reasons given in the paragraphs reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1250. In Australia, a more radical solution has been
                            adopted, by dispensing altogether with the need to establish an
                            intention to prefer. ... [T]he test is no longer whether the debtor made
                            the payment <em>with a view to giving</em> a
                            preference to the creditor, but whether the payment <em>had the effect of</em> giving a preference to the
                            creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1251. Of course, such a test could not be adopted
                            without qualification, for every payment by an insolvent debtor ...
                            must, in the absence of <em>pari passu</em> payment
                            to all, have the effect of preferring the creditor who has the good
                            fortune to receive it. Accordingly ... the Australian Act [the
                            Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth)] excludes any payment to a creditor who can
                            prove that the payment was made in good faith and in the ordinary course
                            of business; and ... the payment should not be regarded as being made in
                            good faith if the creditor ... knew or had reason to suspect that the
                            debtor was unable to pay his debts as they became due from his own
                            money, and that the effect of the payment would be to give him a
                            preference ... over other creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1252. We have given long and anxious consideration to
                            the question whether to recommend dispensing altogether with the need to
                            establish an intention to prefer, and adopting a test similar to that
                            adopted in Australia. We have found this a difficult question. We have
                            observed that, whereas the requirement of proving an intention to prefer
                            has never formed part of the law in the United States of America, in
                            Canada the Senate which has been examining proposals to reform and
                            modernise the law of insolvency, proposes to retain it in the Canadian
                            Insolvency Bill. Our own Committee has been divided. A minority would
                            dispense with the requirement, and indeed see no reason why pressure for
                            payment on the part of the creditor, which even before 1869 prevented
                            the payment from being recoverable, should continue to afford the
                            creditor a defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1256. The majority of
                            the Committee have therefore reached the conclusion that the requirement
                            of an intention to prefer should be retained, and that genuine pressure
                            by the creditor should continue to afford a defence. Their reasons for
                            reaching this conclusion are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    The law should not lightly permit the recovery
                                of payments made in discharge of lawful debts properly due when the
                                payment was made, particularly since the creditor may well have used
                                the money to pay his own creditors. Such payments should be
                                recoverable only if really improper.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The creditor who is active to obtain payment
                                of his own debt ought in principle to be allowed to retain the
                                fruits of his own diligence. He ought not to be made to refund them
                                for the benefit of others who were less diligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    Creditors who delay taking steps to obtain
                                payment of their own debts, whether by commencing insolvency
                                proceedings or otherwise, take the obvious risk that the debtor will
                                pay other creditors in the ordinary course of business or in
                                response to commercial pressure. But there is no reason why they
                                should expose themselves to the risk that he will put his own family
                                and associates first, or discriminate between his creditors on any
                                but normal commercial principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    The proposed change [<em>ie</em>, in favour of the Australian model] would
                                introduce into the law of insolvency a notional ‘cessation of
                                payments’, and would be inconsistent with our approach to the
                                commencement of insolvency proceedings, and in particular with our
                                proposals to abolish the concept of the act of
                            bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It would thus appear from the facts of this
                    case that the Companies and their Creditor Banks, including DBS, found it
                    commercially convenient to finance the business of the Companies on the
                    principle (no longer a notion) that none of them should be allowed to steal a
                    march on the others by applying pressure on the Companies to obtain security or
                    payment of its debts to the disadvantage of the others. This kind of
                    arrangement, if too tightly controlled, may make it difficult for a business to
                    obtain fresh loans in case of need, but, as such an arrangement cannot be said
                    to be contrary to public policy, there would be no reason why a court would not
                    enforce it in an appropriate case, <em>eg</em>, where the
                    debtor is induced to breach its negative pledge or its obligation to ensure that
                    no creditor of it would have an advantage over the other creditors in the event
                    that the debtor becomes insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In the present case, if we had found that the
                    Charge was not an unfair preference, it might well be that DBS would have been
                    liable for interfering with the contractual rights of the other Creditor Banks
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Companies under the negative
                    pledges given by the latter. We cannot help but observe the irony of DBS seeking
                    to defend the validity of the Charge, a course of action which, even if
                    successful, might have rendered DBS liable for the tortious act of interfering
                    with the aforesaid contractual rights of the other Creditor Banks and might have
                    exposed it to liability to those banks. In other words, even if DBS had
                    succeeded in this case, it might have been nothing more than an exercise in
                    futility. For the same reason, the same observations apply to the breach of the
                        <em>pari passu</em> undertakings by JHTI in giving the
                    Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the above reasons, we dismiss the appeal
                    with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
