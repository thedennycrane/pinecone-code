<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The Charge</p>
</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. The Accused was originally charged with murder. Before the trial

commenced, the Prosecution tendered an amended charge which reads as follows :<i></i></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"That you, <b>SIVARAMAN REDDY SIVAKUMAR</b></p>
<p align="justify">on or about the 29<sup>th</sup> day of September 2001, between

  12.00 p.m. and 1.45 p.m., at Blk 12 Pine Close #12-87, Singapore, did commit culpable

  homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Charulatha d/o Kuppusamy

  Raman, to wit, by stabbing her in the abdomen with a knife, which act was done with the

  intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and you have thereby

  committed an offence punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.<i></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">The Accused pleaded guilty to the above charge. Section 304 (a) Penal Code provides for

imprisonment for life or for up to 10 years. The Accused may also be subject to a fine or

to caning.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p><br/>

The Statement of Facts</p>
</b></u>
<p xmlns="">2.    The Accused admitted all the facts set out below :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"<i>Background</i></p>
<p align="justify">1 The informant is Corporal Riduan Bin Raja Marican of Tan Tock

  Seng Hospital Police Post (TTSH).</p>
<p align="justify">2 The deceased is Charulatha D/O Kuppusamy Raman, female, 30 years old,

  NRIC No: S-7120039F. Before her death, she was a customer service officer with Qantas

  Airways.</p>
<p align="justify">3 The accused is Sivaraman Reddy Sivakumar, male, 26 years old, Indian

  National, Passport number: A-8911944. Accused is in Singapore on a social visit pass. The

  Deceased and accused were married. They have a 1 year old baby boy.</p>
<p align="justify">4 On 29 Sep 01 at about 3.40 pm, Corporal Riduan who was then on duty

  at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Police Post, was informed by staff nurse Bavani that

  the deceased, had died from stab wounds. Deceased was pronounced dead at 2.37 pm.</p>
<i><p align="justify">Investigations</p>
</i><p align="justify">5 Sergeant Azam from Tanglin Police Division was at TTSH conducting

  investigations into another case when he received the information on the death of

  deceased. He conducted preliminary investigations.</p>
<p align="justify">6 Sergeant Azam interviewed the accused person at the waiting area of

  the hospital. The accused stated that the deceased was his wife and they stayed at Blk 12,

  #12-87, Pine Close. On 29 Sep 2001, at about 12.00 – 1.45 pm, he had a dispute with

  the deceased over her desire to meet her mother and staying at her grandmother’s

  house at No: 10B Jubilee Road for the night.</p>
<p align="justify">7 The accused claimed that the deceased had stabbed herself once on the

  stomach when the accused refused to allow her to leave the house. After the deceased

  collapsed, the accused pulled the knife out of the deceased’s abdomen. He broke the

  knife and washed his hands and the knife over the kitchen sink. Accused then threw the

  knife into a rubbish bag located in the kitchen. The accused then sent the deceased to Tan

  Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
<p align="justify">8 SIO Patrick Lim, from Bedok Police Division, took over investigations

  from Sergeant Azam. He went to the residence of deceased and accused and entered the unit

  #12-87, Pine Close. He found a few droplets of blood on the floor near the entrance

  leading into the kitchen. 2 handbags and 1 plastic bag containing costume jewelry

  belonging to the deceased were found on the floor in the living room. Some cast-off

  droplets of blood were found on the wall of the living room adjacent to the handbags. A

  kitchen knife with a broken blade used in the stabbing was found in a rubbish bag inside

  the kitchen.</p>
<p align="justify">9 There was no evidence to suggest that a violent struggle had taken

  place. The immediate neighbours were questioned and they did not hear any commotion coming

  from the unit at about the time of incident.</p>
<i><p align="justify">Autopsy Report, Annex A</p>
</i><p align="justify">10 On 30 Sep 2001 at about 9.00 am, the forensic pathologist, Dr

  Wee Keng Poh, conducted a post-mortem on the deceased. He found that the deceased had

  suffered two stab wounds, one at the lower abdomen with a 2.5 cm cut and had a

  penetrating-depth of 13 cm. The other stab wound was near the rib-cage with a 2 cm cut and

  a penetrating-depth of 9 cm. Besides the 2 stab wounds, the deceased had a ‘defence

  injury’ in the form of a bruise on her left had.</p>
<p align="justify">11 Dr Wee was of the opinion that 2 injuries were sufficient to have

  caused the death of the deceased in the ordinary course of nature as the 2 stab-wound were

  inflicted on a vital area of the body – the abdomen. He certified the cause of death

  was hemorrhage due to stab wounds of the abdomen. Dr Wee opined that each of the stab

  wounds was fatal.</p>
<p align="justify">12 Dr Wee opined that that 2 stab wounds could not have been

  self-inflicted. There were no "hesitation-cuts" found on the skin which are

  characteristic of a self-inflicted stab wound. He found that the stab wounds were made

  deliberately by someone intent to cause harm to the deceased. In addition, the clothing

  that the deceased was wearing at the time of the incident usually would not have any stab

  tears if these wounds were self inflicted. He was of the opinion that a person intent on

  committing suicide by self-stabbing would bare that area of his body that he intends to

  inflict the injury.</p>
<p align="justify">13 Dr Wee also opined that it is not likely that two fatal abdominal

  stab wounds with a single defensive injury (bruise) over the left arm were caused in the

  course of a struggle. Considering the totality of the circumstances, Dr Wee is of the

  opinion that it may be possible for one stab wound to be caused in the course of a

  struggle, but not two stab wounds. One stab wound would have incapacitated the deceased

  because of the pain and blood loss that there will not be any further need for the

  assailant to continue to struggle to "take control of the knife" and further

  inflict the second stab wound.</p>
<p align="justify">14 The accused had maintained that the deceased had stabbed herself not

  once but twice with the kitchen knife with a blade measuring 20.2 cm. When told of the

  autopsy findings, the accused admitted that he had stabbed his wife twice.</p>
<i><p align="justify">Circumstances Leading To Death</p>
</i><p align="justify">15 On 29 Sep 2001, both the accused and deceased woke up at about

  11.00 am. A while later, deceased received a phone call from her mother. They were to meet

  up at Serangoon Road at about 1-1.30 pm for the deceased to buy a gold ‘thali’

  (worn on the neck) representing that the deceased is married.</p>
<p align="justify">16 After the phone conversation, deceased dressed up in her uniform as

  she was working on the afternoon shift that day. Deceased told accused that she was going

  to Serangoon Road to meet her mother before she goes to work. Upon hearing that, accused

  told her that he would come along with her to meet her mother. The request was refused by

  the deceased. Accused insisted on coming along since he was alone in the house and he

  needed to pass time.</p>
<p align="justify">17 An argument ensued and the accused refused to allow the deceased to

  leave the house without him. Accused stood at the main door preventing the Deceased from

  going out of the house.</p>
<p align="justify">18 According to the Accused, deceased went to the kitchen and reached

  for 2 knives from the knife-stand. She placed one of the knives near her throat. The

  Accused claimed that the deceased threatened to commit suicide if the accused did not let

  her go. Accused claimed that he relented to her demands.</p>
<p align="justify">19 The deceased went into the baby’s room and took a set of her

  clothing from the baby’s play-pen and walked out of the room. She then placed the

  clothes into her blue coloured bag, which was on the floor in the living room. After

  placing the clothes in the bag, she carried it together with her handbags and plastic bag.

  The accused asked the deceased where she was going with the extra clothes. She replied

  that she was going to Jubilee Road. The argument continued.</p>
<p align="justify">20 The accused got hold of deceased’s left hand which was holding

  the knife, with his right hand, to grab the knife away from her by pulling it towards him.

  While snatching the knife away, the accused stabbed the deceased on her stomach. He then

  withdrew the blade from the deceased’s stomach and stabbed her a second time. The

  deceased collapsed. The accused had deliberately inflicted both stab wounds on the abdomen

  and which act was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to

  cause the death of his wife.</p>
<p align="justify">21 The accused pulled the knife out from the deceased’s stomach

  with his hands. He broke the knife. When he noticed that his hands were stained with

  blood, he ran to the sink and washed his hands together with the broken knife. Thereafter,

  he dropped the broken knife into the rubbish bag.</p>
<i><p align="justify">History Between Deceased and Accused</p>
</i><p align="justify">22 The accused and deceased were married sometime in 2000. They

  registered their marriage in Mar 2000 at the Registry of Marriages, in Singapore. Since

  then, the accused stayed at No. 10B Julibee Road. Accused was not able to get an

  employment pass to work in Singapore. The accused has been renewing his social visit

  status since his arrival in Singapore until the incident. The deceased supported him

  financially.</p>
<p align="justify">23 Soon after marriage, they had frequent quarrels over domestic

  problems. Disagreements with their parents and parents in law and family members staying

  in the house at Jubilee Road, strained their relationship further. There was one prior

  incident of assault of the deceased by accused when deceased was found with a swollen

  cheek.</p>
<p align="justify">24 On 2 Dec 2000, deceased gave birth to their son. The birth of their

  son, elevated the mood of the deceased and she was extremely happy. However, the

  relationship with accused deteriorated.</p>
<p align="justify">25 To save their marriage and for the sake of their son, the deceased

  bought a 3-room resale flat at Blk 12 Pine Close #12-87 for them to stay together. They

  had just moved into Pine Close a week before the deceased met her death.</p>

<u xmlns=""><b>
<p><br/>

Antecedents</p>
</b></u>
<p xmlns="">3. The Accused had a clean record before this case.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p><br/>

The Mitigation Plea</p>
</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The Accused is 26 years old and was born and brought up in India.

His father abandoned the family of 3 children when the Accused was 5 years old and they

were brought up by the mother, a woman steeped in tradition. His mother had regular prayer

meetings in Singapore and the deceased got to know her through her aunt.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The deceased was very depressed by a failed relationship and her

thyroid disorder at that time and turned to the Accused’s mother for advice and

spiritual guidance. She was advised to seek medical treatment in India. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. On one such visit, the deceased got to know the Accused and their

relationship developed to the extent that they decided to get married. His mother

disapproved of the proposed marriage as the deceased was several years older than the

Accused and because she felt that the deceased might not fit into their culture and

tradition. Despite this, the couple registered their marriage in Singapore on 9 Mar 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Subsequently, they informed the Accused’s mother that they

wished to hold their customary wedding in May 2000. When the mother found out that the

deceased was pregnant, she advised them against going through the customary rites during

their wedding. However, the Accused went along with the wishes of the deceased to carry

out the customary rites. As a result, the Accused’s mother refused to attend the

wedding on 15 May 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. After the wedding, the couple moved into the house of the

deceased’s uncle and her grandmother at 10B Jubilee Road as they had no home of their

own. The deceased’s uncles and their families were already living there.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The Accused remained unemployed as he was unable to obtain an

Employment Pass to work here. He had been working in the State Bank of India and was in

charge of sales, being the top performer for 1999, before he resigned in December that

year to join the deceased in their new life in Singapore. He was undergoing a course of

study leading to a Bachelor of Business Administration degree but did not complete it. He

arrived here in Feb 2000 and has remained here on a social visit pass since then, save for

a period of about one month when he returned to India.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. The members of the deceased’s extended family in 10B Jubilee

Road did not treat the Accused too kindly. They were unhappy that they had to vacate one

room for the couple to live in. They ridiculed, taunted, humiliated and embarrassed him,

reminding him constantly of his inability to find work. His occasional verbal retaliation

to their remarks created problems in the relationship between him and his wife.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. The Accused loved his wife dearly, preparing meals for her,

accompanying her to the bus stop when she left for work and waiting for her return to have

their meals together. He made sure she took her prescribed medication. During her

pregnancy, he also ensured that she had a cup of milk daily as advised by the doctor. On

one occasion when she refused to take the milk and threw it away, the Accused became angry

and slapped her once. That was the only time he had laid hands on her.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. When their son was born on 2 Dec 2000, the Accused and his wife

were overjoyed. However, the members of his wife’s family took control of the child

and gave the Accused hardly any time to be alone with his son. When his wife told him she

would be sending their son to join her parents, who have emigrated to Australia, he was

not happy with the arrangement but relented for the sake of the son.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. In April 2001, the Accused was assaulted by his wife’s father

at a bus stop. He had to seek medical attention as a result of that incident. He produced

a medical report in support of this allegation.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    Things got so bad that the Accused decided to leave 10B Jubilee

Road in May or June 2001. He went to stay with his friends, returning constantly to visit

his young son. When he tried to explain his difficult position to the members of the

deceased’s family by way of a letter, they were deeply offended by it and an aunt

rubbed the letter on his face, tore it into pieces and threw them at his face. </p>
<p xmlns="">15.    All these eventually led to the purchase of the flat at Pine

Close. A housewarming ceremony was held on 12 Sep 2001 and the couple moved into their new

home about a week later.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    On 29 Sep 2001, the Accused wanted to accompany the deceased to

meet her mother at Serangoon Road so that he could explain to her their marital problems.

He hoped that her mother would then advise her to go for counselling and to take her

medication regularly. A bitter quarrel took place when she vehemently refused to allow him

to accompany her. She also wanted to stay at 10B Jubilee Road that night and the Accused

was concerned that would give the wrong impression to her family members that they were

having marital problems. The quarrel became physical when she scratched and hit him. He

was then clad in a towel only and allowed her to scratch him without resisting. She took

the knife and threatened to get him into trouble by hurting herself. She abused him

physically and verbally and his pent up frustrations began to work on him when the

deceased raised the old family issues again.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    The Accused’s main concern was to take the knife away from

the deceased who was behaving erratically. However, this resulted in a struggle and he

stabbed her twice.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    Immediately after the stabbing, the Accused came to his senses

and cried out in despair in Tamil, " Latha, this thing has happened to us ". He

then sought frantically to bring her to a doctor. Forgetting to even put on his footwear

or closing the door to the flat, he carried his badly hurt wife into the lift and brought

her downstairs. He asked someone to call for an ambulance but when he saw a car passing

by, he pleaded with the driver to send him and his wife to the nearest doctor. The driver

kindly agreed to do so.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    During the journey in the car, he held on to his weakening wife,

kept talking to her and praying for her. His wife asked him to hold her tightly. He also

performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and pounded her chest when she lost consciousness.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    Counsel for the Accused also tendered a report by Dr Lim Yun

Chin, a psychiatrist in private practice who is also a Visiting Consultant in the

Singapore General Hospital and the Institute of Mental Health. After interviewing the

Accused on 7 Mar 2002, during which essentially the same matters mentioned in the

mitigation plea were recounted, Dr Lim opined that "<i>there was a rapid building up

of intense anxiety and fear when he saw his wife brandishing the knife. He was acutely

aware of his wife’s propensity to harm herself, given her unpredictable outburst and

his paramount concern was to snatch the knife away from her. However, when he felt the

searing pain from the cut inflicted by her actions and she showed no remorse, he began to

feel the surge of anger and rage towards her".</i></p>
<p xmlns="">21.    Dr Lim went on to explain that when a person was hurt or injured

physically or emotionally, it was a very primal emotional response to feel angry and that

this could lead to a sudden surge of aggression, even for a mild-mannered person. He was

also of the opinion that the Accused’s behaviour after the stabbing suggested intense

remorse following the abatement of the anger, fear and anxiety.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    The psychiatrist also perused the medical reports on the deceased

made in Feb 1996, Aug 1998 and Jun 1999 and stated that the thyroid disorder diagnosed in

1998 and the other auto-immune diseases that the deceased could have been suffering from

were often associated with mental instability including depression and irritability. Her

own doctor reported in 1998 that she was "feeling unstable". Dr Lim added an

opinion that the deceased was prone to mental instability due to her thyroid illness but,

upon objection by the Prosecution, Defence Counsel agreed that that opinion should be

deleted.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    Finally, the Accused pleaded for leniency and compassion to be

shown by the Court. It was submitted, on the authority of <i>PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan

<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48224&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999]</a></i> <i>2 SLR 288</i> that life imprisonment was not an appropriate sentence in this

case.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p><br/>

The Prosecution’s Response</p>
</b></u>
<p xmlns="">24.    The Prosecution objected to the admissibility of the psychiatric

report insofar as it related to the deceased as Dr Lim was attempting to do a

psychological autopsy on her state of mind. Two authorities were cited to support the

objection against admissibility – <i>R v Gilfoyle</i> <i>[2001] 2 Cr App Rep 57</i>

and <i>Teh Thiam Huat v PP <nobr>[1996] 3 SLR 621</nobr>. </i>In any event, the Prosecution argued, the

autopsy report dated 30 Sep 2001 on the deceased indicated that her thyroid appeared

normal.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Sentence</p>
</b></u>
<p xmlns="">25.    I will first deal with the legal issue raised by the Prosecution

that, on the authority of the cases cited, the psychiatrist’s report here is

inadmissible. I do not think <i>R v Gilfoyle </i>went so far as to hold that a medical

expert who has not interviewed a subject cannot give an expert opinion on his condition.

That case was concerned with the admission of further evidence after trial and the

psychologist’s reports were held to have failed to identify any criteria by which the

Court there could test the quality of his opinions. The application to admit further

evidence was dismissed in any event as the Court of Appeal did not think that the jury

would have returned a different verdict even if the further evidence had been admitted.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    As in <i>Teh Thiam Huat v PP, </i>Dr Y C Lim’s report in our

present case is admissible but it is at best a hypothesis based on past medical reports

concerning the deceased and is therefore of not much assistance to the Court. In any

event, as will become apparent from the rest of my judgment, the question whether the

deceased had suicidal tendencies or not is quite immaterial to the facts of this case.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    The only witness of the events leading to the fatal stabbing on

29 Sep 2001 is the Accused. Except where admitted by the Prosecution, the Court is not

bound to accept everything said in mitigation as the truth. The Court is entitled to test

his account against the admitted facts and the objective evidence and to decide whether

his version is inherently incredible or self-contradictory.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    The matters pleaded by Defence Counsel show at best that the

Accused was subject to occasional taunts and uncomplimentary remarks from the

Deceased’s family members. However, the Accused was not a poor, pitiful victim of

circumstances. It appears that he was quite capable of standing up for himself whenever

the circumstances required him to do so. He was capable of giving his wife a swollen cheek

when he was angry. He is not an uneducated man. He is no stranger in this country and

neither is his mother. He also has friends here.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Even if all the things he alleges about the treatment he received

from the deceased and her family are true, do they justify or mitigate his conduct on 29

Sep 2001 in the new matrimonial home ? By then, he had already left 10B Jubilee Road

sometime ago. He and his wife had a place of their own to call home. The fact that his

wife wanted to go alone to Serangoon Road to meet her mother was of no great import and

would certainly not cause a man to fly into an implacable rage unless he is an extremely

unreasonable and suspicious sort of person and it is quite apparent from the events of

that day that the Accused is indeed such a person.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    Even if it were true that his wife had taken the knives from the

kitchen, she was not threatening to harm him with the knives in any way. The Statement of

Facts and even the Accused’s statement to the psychiatrist (at paragraph 19 of the

report) show that all the wife wanted to do was to get her clothes and leave the flat. She

was clearly not about to stab or slash him or herself. There was no reason at all for any

fierce struggle to take place unless the Accused was the aggressor.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    How could a man who, a few moments earlier, stood submissively

clad in a towel while his wife clawed ferociously at his unprotected flesh suddenly become

so overcome by anger and rage over a cut inflicted unintentionally in the course of a

struggle precipitated by himself that he would wrest the knife away and plunge it twice

into his wife’s abdomen ? Why would a man determined to thwart any attempt at suicide

stab his wife not once but twice in such a violent manner ? The chain of events points

undoubtedly to the Accused being the aggressor on 29 Sep 2001.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    I am also not convinced that he experienced ‘intense

remorse’ after the stabbing. He was more fearful and anxious about the consequences

of his actions than he was remorseful. This is shown by the fact that he maintained that

his wife had stabbed herself until confronted with the forensic report the next day.</p>
<p xmlns="">33.    The following are the mitigating factors in his favour :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(1)    he pleaded guilty upon being offered the amended charge ;<br/>

  (2)    he had no criminal record ; and <br/>

  (3)    he did try quite frantically to save his wife after the stabbing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">34.    In the circumstances, I do not think life imprisonment is

appropriate here. I sentence the Accused to 10 years’ imprisonment with effect from

29 Sep 2001 and to receive 15 strokes of the cane.</p>
