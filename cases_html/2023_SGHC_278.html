Having regard to the points made in the appellant’s supporting affidavits and the Appellant’s Written Submissions for the Motion (“AWS (Motion)”), it would appear that the appellant had sought to adduce the following evidence at the hearing of the Appeal:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant told a senior Central Narcotics Bureau officer, Mr Khairul Bin Jalani, (the “Senior Officer”) whom he had met by chance on 31 January 2021 that he had neither smoked any controlled drugs nor known that FA-A contained controlled drugs, because he had only smoked cigarettes offered by the Four Individuals rolled with “Butterfly” rolling tobacco which he had earlier purchased for them.

</div> The appellant, who was working at the drinks stall, told him that the drink cost $1.50 but he could just pay $1. The Senior Officer did not understand why the appellant would give him a $0.50 discount but he thought that the appellant might be closing up the shop, so he just paid him $1 and walked off.

The appellant went on to “[talk] briefly about buying a cigarette from a shop and that he did not know it was a drug”. The Senior Officer then ascertained that the appellant was on bail for a pending charge and thus he returned to the drinks stall and paid the balance of $0.50 and requested for a receipt. He clarified that the appellant “did not inform [him] about meeting an elderly uncle and a group of 4 individuals at Woodlands”.

</div> I was of the view however that the appellant could have genuinely believed that telling the Senior Officer about the Four Individuals might help his case.

</div> At the case management conference on 19 July 2023, the appellant waived legal privilege in respect of his communications with Mr Dubey. These emails were appended to the Appellant’s Second Affidavit. They show that the appellant told Mr Dubey that the Senior Officer should be called as a witness and that Mr Dubey then spoke to the trial prosecutor. The appellant was also made aware of the potential corruption charge.

In addition, Mr Dubey pointedly asked the appellant why he had only raised the Fresh Evidence then, and the appellant’s response was that he had “suddenly remembered this in court”.

</div> was not helpful. The appellant’s evidence was that the IO spoke to the trial prosecutor, and not that he spoke to either the appellant or Mr Dubey. Nonetheless, in the first place, the Fresh Evidence relating to the IO’s conduct on 27 April 2022 did not assist the appellant. Even if the IO did know of the appellant’s conversation with the Senior Officer, any evidence given by the IO would constitute hearsay under section 62 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) and would hence have been inadmissible.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Materiality of the Fresh Evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Lastly, I found that the Fresh Evidence was unlikely to have an important influence on the result of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Given my finding that the Fresh Evidence was not credible, it would logically follow that it could not have any material influence on the outcome of the case even if the evidence had been taken into account. A related question was whether the appellant had furnished relevant details pertaining to the Four Individuals’ involvement prior to the trial. The fact remained that he did not mention the Four Individuals in his four investigation statements, one of which was recorded as late as 17 June 2021, well after he had allegedly spoken with the Senior Officer on 31 January 2021. In addition, as clarified by the respondent, the appellant did not disclose any details pertaining to the Four Individuals in his Case for the Defence (“CFD”), including any information which might lead to their identification. I set out my analysis in respect of the CFD further at [41]–[43] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Furthermore, the substance of the appellant’s Fresh Evidence in so far as the involvement of the Four Individuals was concerned was inconsistent with what he had told the police during the investigations.

</div> He did not mention the Four Individuals. As was the case in <span class="font-italic">Sanjay Krishnan</span>, the inconsistency in an accused’s position would point towards limited materiality of fresh evidence sought to be adduced (<span class="font-italic">Sanjay Krishnan </span>at [22]). Accordingly, even if the Fresh Evidence had been led, there was no basis to suggest that it would probably have resulted in a different view as to the appellant’s guilt (<span class="font-italic">Sanjay Krishnan</span> at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I also noted that, while the appellant emphasised how the Fresh Evidence supported his innocence, he glossed over the prior question of the <span class="font-italic">threshold</span> the said evidence has to meet in order to rebut the s 22 MDA presumption. It was insufficient to merely raise a reasonable doubt by making a bare denial or a declaration of innocence: <span class="font-italic">Cheng Siah Johnson v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 839 at [15]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Kenneth Choo Chee Fye</span> [2017] SGDC 207 (“<span class="font-italic">Kenneth Choo</span>”) at [44]. In the circumstances, even if the Fresh Evidence was adduced, the appellant had merely put forth dubious assertions concerning the Four Individuals, whose existence was not verifiable and whose identities were not known. Accordingly, although the Fresh Evidence did not have to be incontrovertible or dispositive, it would not have had an important influence on the result of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 By virtue of the foregoing, I concluded that leave should not be granted for the appellant to adduce additional evidence at this stage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the trial prosecutor had threatened the appellant or wrongfully suppressed evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For completeness, I shall also address an additional argument that was raised by the appellant in the Motion. It was repeatedly suggested that the trial prosecutor had informed Mr Dubey on 27 April 2022 that a corruption charge would be brought against the appellant, and therefore there was a “conscious decision to disallow evidence by the eminence of a corruption charge”. According to the appellant, there was a “bargain, of a tit for tat occurrence that [the appellant] will be prosecuted for a corruption charge will not transpire if [he] refrains from airing in court his version of events”.

To the best of my recollection, we were either at or almost at the close of the Prosecution’s case when you instructed me that you had suddenly recalled that in January 2021, you had informed two (2) CNB officers that you had obtained the tobacco which tested positive for the illicit substances (“<span class="font-weight-bold">FA-A</span>”) from third parties. I asked you for further details, and you informed me that the CNB officers were at the food stall that you were working at, and you had recognised one of the CNB officers and when they were leaving, you approached them and informed them that you received FA-A from third parties, and that it was not yours. You then asked them to help you and the CNB officers nodded. I then asked you why you were only now mentioning it, and you informed me that you had suddenly remembered this in court. I do not recall you instructing me that you had provided the CNB officers with the level of detail which you have set out at paragraph 9 of your 8 July letter.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. I then advised you that if what you told me is true, then we should ask for those CNB officers to come to court to give evidence and be cross-examined. You agreed, and I approached the DPP, Mr R Arvindren (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">DPP</span>”) to inform him of what you had informed me and to request that the CNB officers be called as witnesses. The DPP then informed me (I do not recall if the IO was involved in this conversation) that the CNB officers recall this interaction going differently. Specifically, the CNB officers stated that they had been at your stall and you had asked them to help with your case but they did not recall being informed by you that you received FA-A from third parties. When the CNB officers were leaving or had left, they realised that you had paid for their drinks, and so they had returned to the stall to make payment for the drinks. The DPP then informed me that this issue had not been escalated internally at the material time, but <span class="font-italic">if you gave evidence in open court on your version of events, then the CNB officers would have no choice but to state their version of events, and this matter would have to be escalated within the AGC and investigated which may lead to a charge being brought against you for corruption.

I proceeded to inform you about what the DPP had stated, including the version from the CNB officers, and the DPP’s point that an investigation and a potential charge for corruption may be brought against you.</span> I then asked you whether it was true that you had paid for the CNB officers’ drinks, and you told me that you did pay for their drinks which was around S$1 because you were trying to be friendly.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. I then approached the DPP again, and informed him that there should not be a corruption charge because you stated that you were simply being friendly and had no corrupt intent. The DPP noted my views but maintained his point. I then informed you of what the DPP stated again, and asked you to decide if you wished to call the CNB officers. You asked me to decide on your behalf, but I informed you that this was not a decision I could make for you since I could not tell you what evidence to give. However, I did advise you that on the facts as told to me, I did not think a corruption charge would be made out, though I could not guarantee that a charge would not be brought or that you would be acquitted of such a charge. Nevertheless, <span class="font-italic">if you were telling the truth, then you had nothing to worry</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">about. I gave you some time to think about this issue, and you decided against calling the CNB officers, which I then told the DPP.

From his recollection, the trial prosecutor had merely pointed out, quite fairly, that there might be a need to further investigate the matter and this could possibly lead to a corruption charge. The trial prosecutor did not go so far as to threaten the appellant with a corruption charge. Neither was there any “tit for tat occurrence”, as alleged, to suppress evidence by preventing the appellant from calling the “CNB officers” to testify. It did not appear to be Mr Dubey’s opinion that the appellant was being prevented from doing so; rather, Mr Dubey had left it up to the appellant to decide if he wished to call the relevant “CNB officers”. The Senior Officer confirmed that he was ready and willing to testify.

</div> Accordingly, he submitted that the DJ had erred in finding him guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, it should be borne in mind that the CFD was not admitted in evidence, notwithstanding that it had been admissible under s 258A of the CPC. It was hence not clear if the appellant had, in fact, disclosed in the CFD that he had smoked hand-rolled cigarettes which were prepared and given to him by the Four Individuals. More importantly, I considered that if the CFD had supported the appellant’s case, one would have expected the appellant himself to have sought to adduce it in evidence during his trial. At the hearing of the Motion, the appellant also did not elaborate on what was contained in the CFD although there was ample opportunity for him to do so. Moreover, the appellant did not seek to admit the CFD as part of the Motion. As all this was not done, the obvious inference was that the CFD did not, in fact, aid his defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It was also for this reason that the appellant’s submission that the Prosecution had misinformed the court about the CFD was questionable.

</div> On the appellant’s own case, the CFD would have constituted evidence of such misinformation, but the appellant had not sought to adduce it. Similarly, it was not open to the appellant to take issue with the fact that the CFD should have been introduced at trial to dispel the allegation that the Prosecution had not known about the Four Individuals prior to the trial.

</div> This submission was also not convincing. The appellant’s grievance appeared to be that the police did not conduct further investigations into the Four Individuals and how they had purportedly caused him to consume and possess controlled drugs. But the appellant had apparently not provided any descriptions to help identify the Four Individuals to begin with. As noted above at [31], their existence was not verifiable and their identities were not known. The police were not required to conduct investigations specifically to support the appellant’s case. In the first place, the appellant did not establish that the police had failed to conduct their investigations diligently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The appellant also pointed out that two Prosecution witnesses, namely Insp Leong Li An and the IO, had not been questioned about the Four Individuals.

</div> But it was unclear how this would assist him or what evidence they could have given in relation to the Four Individuals even if they had been questioned. If the appellant’s complaint was that they had not been cross-examined on any aspects pertaining to the Four Individuals, it had been for the appellant to put any relevant questions to them at trial. There was nothing to preclude him from doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In addition, the appellant referred to <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Choo </span>and suggested that the trial judge in that case had “made reference to the Case for the Defense filed by the Appellant there when considering the reliability of the Appellant’s Defense”.

</div> If the appellant had believed that this evidence was so material as to be able to exculpate him at trial (and now on appeal), he would have raised it as soon as he could on his own accord. The second reason was that he was afraid that the Four Individuals would “do something” to him. However, no reason was proffered as to why he was so afraid of them that he could not have disclosed this information during the course of investigations, but was seemingly no longer fearful at the trial or on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, although the appellant seemed to take issue with the DJ’s adverse inference against him only in relation to the 3rd Charge (which I deal with below at [59]–[60]), I noted that the DJ had not erred in drawing an adverse inference arising from the appellant’s material non-disclosure in his statements, in so far as the 1st and 2nd Charges were concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For these reasons, I agreed with the DJ’s finding that the appellant’s narrative concerning the Four Individuals was untrue and was an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the appellant’s conduct around the time of his arrest corroborated his defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The appellant highlighted his conduct around the time of his arrest, including that he had openly smoked at the bicycle bay of Woodlands MRT Station and in view of police officers, and had co-operated with the said police officers.

</div> With respect, this reflected a basic misunderstanding of the difference between the legal and evidential burdens. The Prosecution always retains the legal burden. In this case, the Prosecution satisfied its evidential burden by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, relying on the presumption in s 22 of the MDA. The Prosecution was justified in doing so, and therefore the evidential burden to rebut that presumption shifted to the appellant. If the appellant was unable to rebut the presumption, then the Prosecution’s case was made out. This was, in fact, what transpired in this case. While the Prosecution bore the legal burden, it remained incumbent on the appellant to rebut the operative presumption under s 22 of the MDA in order to succeed in his appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In order to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA, a bare assertion was insufficient (see [31] above).

</div> The appellant merely made the repeated assertion that he had not consumed anything which had contained controlled drugs. Even if I were to take into account his evidence concerning the Four Individuals, these were mere uncorroborated assertions that the Four Individuals had laced his tobacco with controlled drugs without his knowledge. Apart from the appellant’s own say-so, no other evidence was adduced as to the existence or identity of the Four Individuals. There was nothing to substantiate his claims that they had with them controlled drugs, that they had laced tobacco with controlled drugs, or that they had given him cigarettes which contained controlled drugs to smoke. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The appellant’s evidence was thus not credible or cogent.

</div> However, as I had also explained above at [44], the evidence indicated that the appellant had not disclosed details pertaining to the Four Individuals to the police and the Prosecution over the course of investigations.

He did not dispute knowing that FA-A was in his possession. As such, the element of physical possession was proved and the Prosecution did not need to invoke the presumption of physical possession in s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. The sole contentious issue was in relation to whether the appellant knew that the contents of FA-A contained PINACA, a controlled drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As the DJ correctly observed, the appellant had erroneously conflated the element of physical possession with the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Muhamm</span><span class="font-italic">ad Shafiq</span>, the High Court made an express finding on the facts of that case that the accused did not know of the existence of the four packets of crystalline substance (containing methamphetamine). These four packets were found in a baby milk powder box contained within the boot of a taxi which the accused had entered Singapore in. In the present case, the burden fell squarely on the appellant to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA that he had known the nature of the drug in FA-A, which was indubitably in his physical possession, custody and control. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The appellant argued that the DJ erred in finding that the s 18(2) MDA presumption had not been rebutted because the Prosecution bore the legal burden even if the evidential burden had shifted to the appellant by virtue of the presumption.

While tobacco was found among the vegetable matter in FA-A, it was purely speculative for the appellant to assert that it would not have been difficult for the Four Individuals to have laced the vegetable matter in FA-A with PINACA without him noticing them doing so.

</div> This suggestion was predicated on the appellant’s narrative concerning the Four Individuals, which has been rejected. Additionally, there was no reason for the Four Individuals to have deliberately given controlled drugs to the appellant while concealing this fact from him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It was also submitted once again that the DJ failed to give proper weight to the appellant’s conduct around the time of his arrest which corroborated his defence that he had not known that FA-A contained a controlled drug.

I dismissed the Appeal primarily for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The DJ rightly decided that the appellant’s account of the Four Individuals was a fabrication and should not be accepted. His failure to disclose their involvement in his statements justifiably led to an adverse inference being drawn against him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant’s evidence that he had not known of the existence of controlled drugs in FA-A or that he had consumed anything which contained controlled drugs, and had merely smoked hand-rolled cigarettes which were prepared and given to him by the Four Individuals was rightly rejected.
