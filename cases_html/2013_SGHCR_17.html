<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction and brief procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 7 September 2009, a road traffic accident
                    (“the accident”) occurred between a motor vehicle bearing
                    registration plate number SFL5663U (“SFL5663U”) and another motor
                    vehicle bearing registration plate number SFH303M (“SFH303M”)
                    along the Pan Island Expressway. The plaintiff, Ms Chang Mui Hoon (“the
                    Plaintiff”), was then sitting in the front passenger seat of SFL5663U.
                    SFH303M, which collided into the rear of SFL5663U, was at the material time
                    driven by Ms Lim Bee Leng (“the Defendant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff commenced a suit against the
                    Defendant on 8 March 2011. On 25 January 2012, interlocutory judgment
                    (“the consent judgment”) was entered by consent in favour of the
                    Plaintiff. The Notice of Appointment for Assessment of Damages No 46 of 2012
                    (“NA 46/2012”) was filed on 27 September 2012, after which NA
                    46/2012 came up for hearing before me from 1 October 2012 to 4 October 2012, at
                    the end of which it became part heard. The hearing of the evidence eventually
                    concluded on 15 January 2013, and parties’ closing written submissions and
                    reply submissions were tendered and exchanged by 7 March 2013 and 15 March 2013
                    respectively. In the meantime, however, an application to amend what was by then
                    the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) was taken out by the Plaintiff on 13
                    March 2013 and it came up for hearing on 2 May 2013 (“the SOC amendment
                    hearing”) whereupon it was partially granted. With the leave of this
                    court, the parties later exchanged further consequential closing written
                    submissions for NA 46/2012 on 23 May 2013. Having read and considered all the
                    written submissions tendered in respect of NA 46/2012, I now deliver my judgment
                    with my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff’s claim for general damages
                    is in respect of a whiplash injury to her neck, alleged post-traumatic stress
                    disorder and alleged depression which the Plaintiff claims she suffered as a
                    result of the accident. The Plaintiff had earlier in the course of proceedings
                    also claimed damages for alleged injury to her back (in particular, injury to
                    her lumbar spine). However, this claim was abandoned at the SOC amendment
                    hearing before me on 2 May 2013 (see [2] above). The Plaintiff has also claimed
                    general damages for future medical expenses and loss of earning
                capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff’s claim for special damages
                    includes medical expenses, maid expenses, transport expenses and pre-trial loss
                    of income. I now deal with each of these categories of claims
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General damages</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whiplash injury on the Plaintiff’s cervical spine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There is no dispute that the Plaintiff sustained
                    whiplash injury on her neck (<em>ie</em>, the cervical
                    spine) as a result of the accident. The only dispute before me was the severity
                    of the whiplash injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiff’s case is that she sustained
                    a “Grade 2” whiplash injury under the Quebec Severity
                    Classification of Whiplash Associated Disorders (“the Quebec Severity
                        Classification”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and seeks damages in the sum of
                    $35,000. The Defendant, on the other hand, argues that the Plaintiff’s
                    whiplash injury is merely a “Grade 1” injury warranting a
                    significantly smaller sum in damages. For completeness, the Quebec Severity
                    Classification is set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the Quebec Severity Classification,
                    the expression “musculoskeletal signs” means a “decrease in
                    the range of motion and point tenderness”, and the expression
                    “neurological signs” means a “decrease or absence of deep
                    tendon reflexes, weakness and sensory deficits”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In support of the Plaintiff’s claim for a
                    “Grade 2” whiplash injury, Dr Chang Wei Chun (“Dr
                    Chang”), an orthopaedic surgeon, was called to give expert evidence on
                    the extent of the Plaintiff’s whiplash injury. According to Dr Chang, he
                    had examined the Plaintiff on 1 June 2011 whereupon he observed restrictions in
                    the movements of the Plaintiff’s cervical spine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Dr Chang explained that he
                    had arrived at the opinion that the Plaintiff’s whiplash injury was a
                    “Grade 2” injury because in an earlier medical report dated 22
                    October 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> (prepared by another
                    orthopaedic surgeon named Dr David Wong Him Choon (“Dr Wong”) who
                    examined the Plaintiff around two and a half weeks after the accident), Dr Wong
                    had recorded that the Plaintiff had complained of “pain radiat[ing] down
                    the right shoulder and upper limb as well as the interscapular region”.
                    This, Dr Chang explained, would have placed the Plaintiff’s whiplash
                    injury under “Grade 3” according to the Quebec Severity
                    Classification since there were manifestations of “neurological
                    signs” beyond just pain and restriction of movement in the
                    Plaintiff’s neck (see table at [6] above). However, Dr Chang also noted
                    that by the time he examined the Plaintiff on 1 June 2011, these neurological
                    symptoms were no longer present. Taking the middle ground between a
                    “Grade 1” whiplash injury (based on Dr Chang’s examination
                    of the Plaintiff on 1 June 2011) and a “Grade 3” whiplash injury
                    (which Dr Chang derived from Dr Wong’s medical report dated 22 October
                    2009), Dr Chang concluded that the most appropriate classification for the
                    Plaintiff’s whiplash injury in the circumstances would be “Grade
                        2”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dr Chang’s conclusion is disputed by the
                    Defendant. The Defendant’s expert witness, Dr Teh Peng Hooi (“Dr
                    Teh”), a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, gave evidence that the
                    Plaintiff’s whiplash injury was a mild one at “Grade 1”
                    under the Quebec Severity Classification. In arriving at this opinion, Dr Teh
                    relied on, <em>inter alia</em>, a report of the
                    Plaintiff’s medical examination conducted at Raffles Hospital several
                    hours after the accident happened where the examining doctor, Dr Raj
                    Jayarajasingam (“Dr Raj”), stated the following
                        observations:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I saw [the Plaintiff] in our Accident and Emergency Department, Raffles
                        Hospital on 07<sup>th</sup> September 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">She said she had been in a road traffic accident earlier that day. She
                        said she had some neck and left face pain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Clinically examination unremarkable</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">X-ray of her face and neck C spine was normal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Dr Teh explained that had the Plaintiff indeed
                    sustained a “Grade 2” whiplash injury from the accident, Dr Raj
                    would not have simply recorded a finding of “[c]linically examination
                    unremarkable” which, contrary to Dr Chang’s dismissal of that
                    statement for being “subjective”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    meaningfully indicated that there were no remarkable symptoms insofar as the
                    Plaintiff’s neck was concerned at the time of the medical
                        examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Dr Teh in his evidence also gave his
                    medical opinion that in order for one to be able to fully assess the severity of
                    any physical injury, medical examination of the injury has to be conducted
                    within a “window of opportunity” of no more than two to three days
                    after the injury was sustained:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… When you assess an injury, invariably most time the window of
                        opportunity for knowing the seriousness of the condition after an injury, I
                        would say is within 2-3 days at the most. That is the best window of
                        opportunity to know what damage has been done and what injury was sustained.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, Dr Teh averred that Dr Raj’s medical report (see
                    [9] above) would provide the most accurate account of the extent of the
                    Plaintiff’s neck injury, and that all other accounts given by the
                    Plaintiff’s medical experts, including that of Dr Chang’s, were
                    unreliable because the medical examinations conducted by those experts all took
                    place several months after the date of the accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With regard to the alleged <em>neurological</em> symptoms which the Plaintiff has complained of (see
                    [8] above), Dr Teh was of the view that those symptoms were attributable to a
                    pre-existing degenerative condition known as cervical spondylosis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and further added that the neck pain complained
                    of was and continues likely to be of a psychological origin instead – a
                    medical condition referred to as somatoform disorder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This latter assertion echoes the findings in
                    a medical report dated 15 August 2011 prepared by the Defendant’s other
                    expert witness, Dr Calvin Fones Soon Leng (“Dr Fones”), who is a
                    consultant psychiatrist.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Having considered the evidence before me, I am
                    of the view that the Plaintiff has suffered a “Grade 1” whiplash
                    injury under the Quebec Severity Classification. I accept that Dr Raj’s
                    medical report (see [9] above), given its contemporaneity vis-à-vis the time of
                    the accident, cannot simply be dismissed as being “subjective” or,
                    to use some of Dr Chang’s harsher words, to be considered “not
                    worth the paper it is written on”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> By
                    comparison, all other accounts given by the Plaintiff’s expert witnesses
                    (in particular Dr Chang’s account) and documented in their medical

                    relied upon by the Plaintiff to prove that she has sustained a “Grade

                    same regard, because those accounts arose from medical examinations of the
                    Plaintiff which took place long after – in the order of months – the
                    accident happened. <em>Apropos</em>, it is worth mentioning
                    that Dr Chang’s medical examination of the Plaintiff took place more than
                    one and a half year after the accident took place (see [8] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With regard to Dr Wong’s medical report
                    dated 22 October 2009, some additional observations need to be made other than
                    that Dr Wong’s medical examination of the Plaintiff took place around two
                    and a half weeks (see [8] above) after the accident (<em>ie</em>, around six times more than the “window of
                    opportunity” as explained above would allow). Dr Wong had earlier deposed
                    to an affidavit of evidence-in-chief as one of the Plaintiff’s expert
                    medical witnesses for the proceedings. However, according to the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Andrew Hanam (“Mr Hanam”) on the
                    first day of the hearing, Dr Wong had declined in the last minute to attend the
                    court proceedings to give evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> As it
                    turned out, Dr Wong was the owner of SFH303M (see [1] above) and was sitting in
                    the front passenger seat of SFH303M when the accident happened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> As a result of Dr Wong’s
                    refusal to attend the proceedings, Dr Wong’s affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief containing his medical report dated 22 October 2009 was
                    expunged from the Plaintiff’s Bundle of Affidavits pursuant to O 38 r 2(1)
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) which lays down the general
                    rule that a deponent’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief shall not be
                    received in evidence if he or she fails to attend trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> On that basis, Dr Chang’s evidence,
                    insofar as his reliance has been placed on Dr Wong’s medical report dated
                    22 October 2009, has been disregarded. In any event, the Defendant’s
                    counsel, Mr Niru Pillai (“Mr Pillai”), has also brought this
                    court’s attention to a letter dated 14 March 2011 which he received from
                    Mr Hanam’s firm stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    “[the Plaintiff] takes the position that [Dr Wong’s] report is
                    unreliable, may be tainted with bias, and is not admissible”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I should also add, however, that even if Dr
                    Wong’s medical report dated 22 October 2009 were to be admitted and
                    considered, I would have been inclined to accept that the Plaintiff’s
                    complaint(s) of persistent pain in her neck was not a result of
                    “neurological symptoms” manifesting from her whiplash injury but
                    was likely instead due to some form of somatoform disorder as suggested by Dr
                    Teh and Dr Fones (see [11] above; but for which no award would be made given
                    that the Plaintiff’s belated attempt to amend her pleadings to include a
                    claim for somatoform disorder was rejected in the SOC amendment hearing (see [2]
                    above), with no appeal arising therefrom), although I would not take the further
                    view that the same complaint(s) of pain could also be explained away with
                    cervical spondylosis. This means that one of the fundamental bases for Dr
                    Chang’s ‘middle ground’ approach (see [8] above) in arriving
                    at a “Grade 2” whiplash injury would have been seriously flawed in
                    any case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In assessing the appropriate sum to be awarded
                    to the Plaintiff for her “Grade 1” whiplash injury, I have
                    considered the precedents as set out in <em>Assessment of
                        Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents</em> (LexisNexis,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2005) at pp 206-214 and I note that,
                    historically, the damages awarded for whiplash injuries tend to be from $5,000
                    upwards depending on the severity of the injury in each particular case.
                    However, I am also mindful that the precedents cited therein may now be of more
                    limited guidance today than they were in the past given that these cases were on
                    average decided close to a decade ago. The courts have taken economic realities
                    such as monetary inflation into account when making awards in assessment of
                    damages proceedings (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 178
                        (“<em>Tan Siew Bin Ronnie</em>”) at
                    [18]), and in principle I see no reason to do otherwise in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At the same time, I also note that there are
                    three relatively recent road traffic accident cases involving whiplash injuries
                    that are of useful guidance in the present case. In <em>Tan Siew
                        Bin Ronnie</em> (see [15] above), Chan Seng Onn J upheld an assistant
                    registrar’s award of $24,000 to the plaintiff for whiplash injury to the
                    cervical spine with residual disabilities such as frontal headaches, neck
                    stiffness and occasional bouts of vertigo (see <em>Tan Siew Bin
                        Ronnie</em> at [4]). In <em>Clark Jonathan Michael v
                        Lee Khee Chung</em> [2010] 1 SLR 209 (“<em>Clark Jonathan Michael</em>”), Judith Prakash J
                    declined to interfere with an assistant registrar’s award of $25,000 to
                    the plaintiff for whiplash injury involving long-lasting effects such as neck
                    pain, headaches, tinnitus and numbness of the arm (see <em>Clark
                        Jonathan Michael</em> at [26]). That award of $25,000, it should be
                    added, included damages for the plaintiff’s “losses due to one year
                    delay in graduation” (see <em>Clark Jonathan
                        Michael</em> at [2]). In <em>Menjit Singh s/o Hari
                        Singh v Ong Lay Peng</em> [2012] SGHC 11 (“<em>Menjit Singh</em>”), the plaintiff who suffered a relatively
                    uncomplicated whiplash injury was awarded $12,000 for pain and suffering (see
                        <em>Menjit Singh</em> at [13]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having reviewed the case authorities, I find
                    that the Plaintiff’s whiplash injury in the present case is more elaborate
                    than that in <em>Menjit Singh</em>. However, I am unable to
                    reach the further conclusion that the whiplash injury in the present case is as
                    severe as that in either <em>Tan Siew Bin Ronnie</em> or
                        <em>Clark Jonathan Michael</em>. In my view, a fair and
                    reasonable award in the circumstances of the present case would accordingly be
                    $16,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Post traumatic stress disorder and depression suffered by the
                Plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff is also seeking general damages
                    in the sum of $50,000 for post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”)
                    and $10,000 for depression arising from the accident. In particular, the
                    Plaintiff complains that she has, <em>inter alia</em>, now
                    become fearful with headaches and giddiness whenever she is sitting in a motor
                    vehicle, has trouble sleeping and has become easily irritable ever since the
                    accident happened. The Defendant does not dispute that the Plaintiff is
                    suffering from PTSD and depression. Instead, the Defendant is arguing that the
                    quantum of damages sought by the Plaintiff is excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The evidence given by the Plaintiff’s
                    medical witness on her PTSD and depression are as follows. In a medical report
                    dated 5 April 2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Dr Clarice Hong Pei Hsia (“Dr
                    Hong”), a consultant psychiatrist who treated the Plaintiff for her

                    from PTSD and “severe depression requiring pharmacotherapy and
                        psychotherapy”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Referring to what is known as the

                    Hong gave her opinion in court that the Plaintiff’s PTSD was at a
                    “severe” level as at January 2011, but that her PTSD had since
                    improved to a “moderate” level by February 2012 with some residual

                    would mean that the Plaintiff’s PTSD prior to January 2011 after the
                    accident might be even worse than “severe” under the DSM-IV
                        Criteria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

                    (introduced earlier in [11] above), disagreed with Dr Hong’s assessment of
                    the Plaintiff’s PTSD and depression. In his assessment using the DSM-IV
                    Criteria, Dr Fones placed the Plaintiff in the category of “mild”
                    for her PTSD. Dr Fones also assessed the Plaintiff’s depression to be
                    “moderate”. In his medical report dated 28 October 2011, Dr Fones
                        wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>

                        threshold criteria for PTSD. The severity of PTSD is mild, although she
                        continues to be troubled by continued symptoms and related avoidance and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While it is understandable how she tends to attribute all her present
                        problems and symptoms to the accident more than 2 years ago, it is likely
                        that a combination of factors have contributed to her stressful emotional
                        state that precipitated and continues to maintain her symptoms. The PTSD,
                        depression and comorbid somatoform pain disorder have combined to
                        significantly affect her psychosocial and occupational functioning. The
                        nature of her various symptoms and their progression however, make it
                        difficult to conclude unequivocally that there was direct causation from the

                    unable to accept that the Plaintiff has suffered “severe” PTSD as
                    a result of the accident. The main symptoms experienced by the Plaintiff in the
                    present case are that she has become fearful with headaches and giddiness
                    whenever she is sitting in a motor vehicle, has trouble sleeping and has become
                    easily irritable ever since the accident happened (see [18] above). There is
                    nothing seriously debilitating in these symptoms experienced by the Plaintiff,
                    and neither was there any evidence positively establishing that the
                    Plaintiff’s prognosis is poor. According to Dr Fones in his medical report
                    dated 28 October 2011, he stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would not consider any of [the Plaintiff’s] psychiatric conditions

                        symptoms would predict a recovery that could span 2-3 years. Her continued
                        efforts at trying to regain her previous level of social and occupational
                        functioning and participation in therapy would be very helpful in achieving

                    preferred to take a relatively noncommittal view that there is generally no
                    rough timeframe that can be ascribed to a person’s recovery from
                        PTSD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This cannot be taken to mean that Dr Hong
                    was asserting that the Plaintiff’s recovery in the present case would take
                    an indefinite or extraordinarily long period of time. In any case, it is also
                    noted that Dr Hong agreed with Mr Pillai during cross-examination that the
                    conclusion of the present legal proceedings would provide a major relief for the
                    Plaintiff as regards her PTSD:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    If [the Plaintiff] sought treatment, as recommended
                            by you and Dr Fones, would you agree with him that the condition --- the
                            therapy she needs is about 2 years?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I can’t agree with the duration because I
                            can’t qualify and quantify a time when a person can get better. I
                            can also add that she has been very stressed by the legal
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Would the end of the legal proceedings bring
                            closure to one major stressful aspect of PTSD?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Theoretically, yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Based on the evidence discussed above, I am of
                    the view that the Plaintiff’s PTSD falls more appropriately within
                    somewhere between a high “moderate” and a low “moderately
                    severe” category instead (see [21] above).</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this category, full recovery is achieved within a short period of time

                        to previous employment with little or no residual disabilities. The level of
                        the award takes into consideration the relatively short length of the period
                        of disability and the extent to which daily activities and sleep were
                        affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Similarly, I do not agree that the
                    Plaintiff’s depression falls within the “severe” category.
                    In my judgment, the Plaintiff’s depression can at most be placed at a low
                    “moderately severe” category under the general guidelines as set
                    out above. Taking into account that there is some overlap between the
                    Plaintiff’s PTSD and depression, I will award the Plaintiff $20,000 for
                    all the psychiatric conditions that she has suffered as a result of the accident
                        (<em>ie</em>, $12,000 for PTSD, $10,000 for depression,
                    and applying a discount of $2,000 for the overlap). In arriving at this figure,
                    I have also considered the cases of <em>Pang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe
                        Phing</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 366 and <em>Goh Eng Hong v

                    SLR(R) 209 which were cited to me by Mr Hanam, and I do not find that the
                    Plaintiff’s psychiatric condition as gleaned from the evidence in the
                    present case is as severe and elaborate as those that featured in those two
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Future medical expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Plaintiff has put in a claim of $16,406.40
                    for future medical expenses for her whiplash injury, PTSD and depression. More
                    specifically, the claim is $12,000 for psychotherapy and $4,406.40 for
                    chiropractic treatment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Mr Pillai has argued for the
                    Defendant that no award should be made under this category of claim because
                    there is a lack of cogent evidence to support the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is true, as pointed out by Mr Pillai in his
                    submissions, that the Plaintiff’s own witness, Dr Hong, did not in her
                    medical report fully address the issue of future treatment for the
                    Plaintiff’s PTSD and depression, for example the nature of the treatment,
                    the duration for which the treatment is required, the number of sessions that
                    the Plaintiff should undergo, and the costs involved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> All that was stated in Dr Hong’s
                    medical report dated 5 April 2011 was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [the Plaintiff] will need to recuperate from the Post traumatic
                        Stress disorder she is currently suffering from. A time frame is difficult
                        to ascertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The cost can be computed only if I am able to estimate the time
                        frame [the Plaintiff] requires to restore her former self.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, the Plaintiff is not basing her claim
                    of $12,000 on Dr Hong’s medical report. Instead, the Plaintiff is relying
                    on Dr Fones’ medical report dated 28 October 2011 which stated as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I opine that [the Plaintiff] would continue to benefit from
                        regular psychotherapy in addition to medication. She had described her
                        treatment sessions as ‘just chit-chat’. I had advised that if
                        she wanted to overcome her PTSD symptoms, particularly the residual
                        avoidance, she should consider engaging in specific targeted treatments like
                        cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), especially exposure therapy, or
                        Eye-movement desensitization response (EMDR). I advised that she should
                        discuss the treatment plan with her psychiatrist [<em>ie</em>, Dr Hong] but cautioned that her motivation to
                        participate in treatment would be crucial for optimal response.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>Her treatments would ideally be about once a month and is
                            estimated to cost $150-300 a session. It is estimated that she may need
                            about 2 years of therapy and medication costing up to $6,000 a
                            year</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Dr Fones may be the Defendant’s witness,
                    but I know of no authority (nor have I been cited any by Mr Pillai) which
                    precludes the Plaintiff in the present case from relying on evidence which has
                    been volunteered by the Defendant’s witness regarding the
                    Plaintiff’s future medical treatment for her psychiatric conditions. In
                    any case, the court is entitled to look at all the evidence presented to it
                    before making its judgment as to whether any award ought to be made in the case.
                    I therefore allow the Plaintiff’s claim of $12,000 for future medical
                    expenses in relation to her PTSD and depression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Moving on to the Plaintiff’s claim of
                    $4,406.40 for chiropractic treatment, the Plaintiff has arrived at this sum by
                    relying on Dr Chang’s medical report dated 10 April 2012 where he
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>FUTURE MEDICAL
                            TREATMENT</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Long-term treatment would essentially be pain medications and muscle
                        relaxants as and when required.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Plaintiff] found TCM treatment helpful when she was in Singapore.
                        [The Plaintiff has migrated to Canada in October 2011.]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Vancouver she found chiropractic treatment beneficial. <em>Hence, it would be reasonable for her to have four sessions a
                            month of such treatment for an arbitrary 12 months. The cost would be
                            what she has been paying [in Canada].</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I note that this particular aspect of Dr
                    Chang’s evidence was not challenged by Mr Pillai during Dr Chang’s
                        cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> However, two observations need to
                    be made. Firstly, Mr Hanam has taken the cost of the Plaintiff’s
                    chiropractic treatment in Canada to be C$75 per session before applying a
                    currency conversion rate of 1.224 Singapore Dollars is to 1 Canadian Dollar to
                    arrive at the sum of $4,406.40 (<em>ie</em>, C$75 x 1.224 x
                    4 x 12).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> This is not an accurate calculation.
                    According to the receipts of the Plaintiff’s chiropractic treatment in
                    Canada which were tendered in court, the cost per session of those treatments
                    was not consistently at C$75. In fact, out of the four receipts which were
                    tendered, three were charged at C$50 each while only one was charged at
                        C$75.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> In the
                    circumstances, the appropriate cost per session should instead be the average of
                    those four individual sums. This comes down to around C$56 per
                session.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, Dr Chang’s recommendation that
                    the Plaintiff should undergo four chiropractic treatment sessions per month for
                    a duration of twelve months was made apparently on the basis that the Plaintiff
                    has suffered a “Grade 2” whiplash injury under the Quebec Severity
                    Classification. As I have found earlier, the Plaintiff’s whiplash injury
                    should more appropriately be classified as “Grade 1” under the
                    Quebec Severity Classification (see [12] above). A discount should therefore
                    correspondingly be applied in calculating the final sum to be awarded for the
                    Plaintiff’s future chiropractic treatment. In the circumstances of the
                    present case, I am of the view that a fair and reasonable discount to be applied
                    would be to halve Dr Chang’s recommended twelve-month duration for the
                    Plaintiff’s future chiropractic treatment, while maintaining Dr
                    Chang’s recommendation of four sessions per month. The end result would be
                    a total sum of around $1,645 (<em>ie</em>, C$56 x 1.224 x 4
                    x (12 ÷ 2)). For the avoidance of doubt, the same currency
                    conversion rate which Mr Hanam has adopted in his calculation (see [33] above)
                    was similarly applied in my calculation here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Accordingly, I award the Plaintiff $1,645 for
                    future medical expenses in respect of her whiplash injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Loss of earning capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Plaintiff is presently 43 years old and
                    married with two children – a son of around 11 years old and a daughter of
                    around 13–14 years old as at the date of this judgment. Her highest
                    academic qualification is the GCE ‘O’ Level which she attained in
                    secondary school, and her last full-time occupation was an assistant ticketing
                    manager at a travel agency, earning around $2,744 a month. In 2005, she resigned
                    and became a full-time housewife because she wanted to look after her children
                    and also because she claimed she had problems with her domestic worker who had
                    to be terminated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> She
                    has not had any permanent employment since, save for some occasional freelance
                    ticketing services which she rendered from time to time to another travel agency
                    for a small unspecified fee. She claims it was always her intention to return to
                    the workforce once her children are old enough to look after themselves, and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    The Plaintiff was not employed at the time of the
                            assessment but this by itself does not prevent the Plaintiff from
                            claiming for loss of earning capacity. [cites <em>Ng Chee

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    There is clear evidence from Dr Fones that the
                            Plaintiff is at a disadvantage in the open employment market due to her
                            mental condition, namely PTSD and depression, which were caused by the
                            accident. Dr Fones said … that due to PTSD and depression, the
                            Plaintiff’s perceived pain was an impediment to her conducting
                            herself maximally leading to her reluctance to actually look for a job.
                            Dr Fones said it would take 2 years of therapy for the Plaintiff to
                            recover. The Plaintiff’s inability to get a job is due to the PTSD
                            and depressed state which in turn were caused by the
                        accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.    The Plaintiff’s evidence was that she
                            intended to return to the workforce once her son turned 8 years of age.
                            That is not an unusual situation with many mothers joining or re-joining
                            the workforce once they have more time on their hands. Further the
                            Plaintiff previously did in fact work, stopping work only because her
                            children needed her and not because she did not want to
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25.    From the evidence of the Defendant’s own Dr
                            Fones, after 2 years of therapy, the Plaintiff should be able to re-join
                            the workforce. How should the Plaintiff be compensated for the next 2
                            years? According to the Defendant she should be given no or nominal
                            damages for loss of earning capacity. This cannot be right. The
                            Plaintiff was put into a state that at least for the next 2 years, the
                            Plaintiff will be at a disadvantage in the open employment market
                            because of her PTSD and depression both sustained because of the
                            accident. The Court has to take a figure in the round but some Judges
                            have found it useful to use a multiplier and multiplicand method to
                            arrive of [sic] the figure. This would be a more scientific figure. The
                            Plaintiff will be out of income for the next 2 years as she undergoes
                            therapy. The sums that she was content to earn are what a dog groomer in
                            Canada would earn (lowest 5% of incomes in Canada) and we have provided
                            what their figures are based on data from the Canadian Government. This
                            is reliable evidence and the Defendant has not provided any contrary
                            evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    The figures from the Canadian government show that
                            a dog groomer earns S$2,241 per month. Multiply this by the 2 years that
                            the Plaintiff would need to fully recover, the sum is $53,784. Our claim
                            for $55,000 for loss of earning capacity is not unreasonable based on
                            the medical evidence of incapacity, the average monthly earnings and the
                            Plaintiff’s evidence of wanting to be a dog groomer.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For completeness, it is apposite to mention that Mr Hanam arrived
                    at the sum of $2,241 with the help of certain statistics and data that he
                    obtained from a website named ‘Service Canada’ which is maintained
                    by the government of Canada.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I pause at this juncture to mention one other
                    aspect of the evidence which the Plaintiff has presented in respect of her
                    claim. In the proceedings, the Plaintiff called her cousin, Ms Ho Chui Yan
                    (“Ms Ho”), a pet stylist in Singapore, to give evidence as a
                    factual witness on the salary she (Ms Ho) earns a month, as well as what pet
                    stylists <em>in Singapore</em> generally earn every
                        month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    Insofar as the Plaintiff’s claim for future loss of earning capacity is
                    concerned, Ms Ho’s evidence is in any case of no consequence because the
                    Plaintiff is no longer living in Singapore since she has already migrated to
                    Canada in October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Coming back to Mr Hanam’s reliance on
                    ‘Service Canada’ to support the Plaintiff’s claim, Mr Pillai
                    has highlighted to this court a disclaimer found on the same website which
                        states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Some of the information and services found on this Web site have been
                        provided by external sources. Service Canada is not responsible for the
                        accuracy, reliability or currency of the information or services provided by

                        should consult directly with the appropriate source.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Just so to address any intention the Defence
                    may have in seeking to exclude any statistics or data found in the website, I do
                    not think that the existence of such a disclaimer in the present case
                    necessarily precludes any reliance by the Plaintiff on the information in the
                    website for the purposes of the current proceedings. The disclaimer seeks to
                    disclaim ‘Service Canada’ from any potential liability for putting
                    up those statistics and data on its website. The purpose for which the
                    disclaimer was made in the website is quite obviously different from that which
                    the Defence is presumably asserting in drawing this court’s attention to
                    the disclaimer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In submissions, Mr Pillai also argued that
                    given that the Plaintiff has not been working for close to five years as at the
                    date of the accident (see [35] above), she has “no competitive edge which
                    would have been lost as a result of any residual deficit suffered from the
                    injury sustained in the accident”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I do not agree with this contention. Given
                    the Plaintiff’s age and academic qualifications (see [35] above), I find
                    it difficult to accept that the Plaintiff’s “competitive
                    edge” in the employment market is, as Mr Pillai would have suggested,
                    totally non-existent to begin with. As noted earlier, the Plaintiff still
                    rendered occasional freelance ticketing services for a travel agency over the
                    years as a housewife. The Plaintiff, in my opinion, is still relevant in terms
                    of the basic skills required of her in order to compete in the general job
                    market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Moving on, I agree with Mr Hanam’s
                    submission that Dr Fones did mention that the Plaintiff’s PTSD, depression
                    and, to a limited extent, somatoform disorder, is an impediment to her
                    functioning maximally:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    The Plaintiff has not looked for a job in Canada
                            since migrating in October 2011. Would this ---- would the somatoform
                            disorder have contributed toward her reluctance to look for a
                            job?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Can you elaborate please?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Together with the PTSD and depression, her
                            perceived pain would to her be an impediment to conducting herself
                            maximally, or rather functioning maximally. This would have led to her
                            reluctance to actually look for a job. I however felt that it is
                            primarily the avoidance that stems from her PTSD and depressed state
                            that contributes more to her reluctance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    As opposed to the somatoform
                        disorder?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, I am doubtful whether this, as a
                    matter of evidential proof, necessarily translated into the Plaintiff actually
                    suffering a reduction of her “competitive edge” in the employment
                    market which is compensable by way of damages for loss of earning capacity. Dr
                    Fones’ allusion to the Plaintiff experiencing an
                    “impediment” and not being able to “function
                    maximally” must be understood in the context of the question that was
                    asked of him, <em>viz</em> what caused the
                    Plaintiff’s <em>reluctance to look for a job</em> in
                    Canada after the accident? An impediment causing a person’s reluctance to
                    seek gainful employment and an impediment adversely affecting that
                    person’s “competitive edge” in the job market ought
                    conceptually be distinguished, and for good reason – the former may call
                    for <em>loss of future earnings</em> to be used as the
                    proper measure of damages to be awarded (which is not pleaded here), while the
                    latter (if proven) is more appropriately compensated by way of awarding damages
                    for <em>loss of earning capacity</em>. Conceptually
                    speaking, Mr Hanam’s computation of the sum of $55,000 as gleaned from
                    [36] above is therefore faulty because he was actually building a case for loss
                    of earning capacity with a claim for loss of future earnings which the Plaintiff
                    has not pleaded at all. As Judith Prakash J observed in <em>Clark
                        Jonathan Michael</em> (see [16] above) at [91]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    … the approach taken [in respect of damages
                            for loss of earning capacity] … where the award was made by
                            ascertaining, in so far as it was possible, the earnings foregone per
                            month because of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff and multiplying
                            that by the length of time the plaintiff was expected to work for, is
                            … not very satisfactory as it makes the award akin to an award
                            for loss of future earnings. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I therefore reject Mr Hanam’s computation of $55,000 as
                    damages for the Plaintiff’s future loss of earning capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Nevertheless, given my finding that the
                    Plaintiff has suffered a high “moderate” to low “moderately
                    severe” form of PTSD and at most a low “moderately severe”
                    level of depression (see [24] and [26] above) requiring two years of
                    psychotherapy (see [29]-[30] above), as well as my finding that the Plaintiff
                    has suffered whiplash injury requiring six months’ worth of future
                    chiropractic treatment (see [33] above), I am prepared to independently find on
                    irresistible inference that there is some extent of temporary (since there are
                    no <em>permanent</em> disabilities in the present case)
                    weakening of the Plaintiff’s “competitive edge” in the job
                    market while she is en route to full recovery, which ought to be compensated
                    with damages. Having said that, I wish to however also state that while some
                    time allowance may be given to the Plaintiff to cope with her injuries, any
                    further <em>substantial</em> delay occasioned by the
                    Plaintiff’s continued <em>reluctance</em> to seek
                    re-employment is likely to be unreasonable. Time is that wherein there is
                    opportunity, but opportunity is that wherein there is no great time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff must endeavour
                    to pick herself up swiftly and seize every opportunity to move on with her life
                    as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In assessing the appropriate damages, I am
                    mindful again of Judith Prakash J’s holding in <em>Clark
                        Jonathan Michael</em> at [91] which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    … The assessment for damages for loss of
                            earning capacity can be an exercise in speculation as often the court
                            does not know the extent to which a plaintiff will be disadvantaged by
                            his disabilities if he has to seek a new position. In the end, it is
                            clear from the cases that the assessment is a rather rough and ready one
                            which really reflects the amount that the particular court thinks is
                            reasonable in the particular circumstances to compensate the particular
                            plaintiff for the disadvantage he has been put into in the job market by
                            his disabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I find that an award in the sum of $12,000
                    would fairly and reasonably compensate the Plaintiff for her future temporary
                    loss of earning capacity in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Special damages</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pre-trial loss of income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Plaintiff is claiming a total sum of
                    $49,092 for pre-trial loss of income comprising $22,200 for the period covering
                    17 February 2011 to 30 September 2011 (the “pre-migration loss of
                    income”) and $26,892 for the period covering 10 October 2011 to 30
                    September 2012 (the “post-migration loss of income”). In this
                    regard, it will be recalled that the Plaintiff has migrated together with her
                    family to Canada in October 2011 (see [37] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Plaintiff, as mentioned earlier, has been
                    a full-time housewife since 2005 with no significant income (see [35] above). In
                    court, she explained that she had planned to resume working life as a dog
                    groomer by starting a small dog grooming business after her son reached eight
                    years old and finished his primary one education in school (<em>ie</em>, sometime in the beginning of 2011).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Referring to Ms Ho’s evidence (see [37]
                    above) that she (Ms Ho) earned around $3,000 a month as a pet stylist in
                    Singapore, Mr Hanam submitted that this would similarly have been a reasonable
                    monthly income that the Plaintiff could have earned but for the injuries she
                    suffered from the accident. Accordingly, Mr Hanam argued that the multiplicand
                    for computing the Plaintiff’s pre-migration loss of income should be
                    $3,000. As to the multiplier, Mr Hanam pointed out that in furtherance of her
                    plan to be a dog groomer, the Plaintiff had in late 2010 signed up for a dog
                    grooming certification course which she completed on 16 February
                        2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> but unfortunately she
                    was unable to bring the plan to fruition as she was medically advised against
                    working as a dog groomer as it was considered to be too physically demanding in
                    light of her whiplash injury.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Taking the
                    date of the certification as well as the time the Plaintiff eventually migrated
                    to Canada into account, Mr Hanam obtained a multiplier of 7.4 months, thereby
                    arriving at a total claim of $3,000 x 7.4 = $22,200 for the Plaintiff’s
                    pre-migration loss of income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     With regard to the Plaintiff’s
                    post-migration loss of income, Mr Hanam adopted the figure of $2,241 which he
                    derived from the ‘Service Canada’ website (see [36] above) as the
                    multiplicand. Taking into account the Plaintiff’s migration as well as the
                    time this current proceedings came up for hearing, Mr Hanam computed a figure of
                    12 months as the multiplier, thereby giving the sum of $2,241 x 12 = $26,892 for
                    the Plaintiff’s post-migration loss of income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Defendant, on the other hand, submitted
                    that no award for pre-trial loss of income should be made at all. The following
                    objections were raised in submissions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiff was not earning any
                        income at the time of the accident, and it was therefore impossible to allow
                        any award for pre-trial loss of income;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Plaintiff in obtaining a dog grooming

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     Ms Ho’s evidence on her own salary was not

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_e"></a>(e)     it would be presumptuous to think that the Plaintiff would have
                        succeeded in her dog grooming business in any case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As I understand it, objection (a) was premised
                    on the proposition that an award for pre-trial loss of income is by way of
                        <em>special damages</em> which must be put to strict
                    proof (<em>cf</em> Michael F Rutter, <em>Handbook on Damages for Personal Injuries and Death in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> (Butterworths Asia, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed,
                    1993) at pp 195-196). The Plaintiff, in Mr Pillai’s submissions, has
                    failed to discharge her burden of strict proof as there was no and there could
                    not have been any evidence of the Plaintiff’s monthly income at the time
                    of the accident as she was then a full-time housewife for almost five
                    years.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.2    In <em>Paff v Speed</em> [(1961) 105 CLR 549 at 558-559],
                            Fullagar J referred to the fact that in cases concerning the award of
                            damages at common law for personal injuries the ‘orthodox
                            direction’ to the jury ‘begins … by drawing and
                            explaining a distinction between “special damages” and
                            “general damages”. His Honour continued:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Special damages are awarded in such cases in respect of monetary loss
                            actually suffered and expenditure actually incurred. Their two
                            characteristics are (1) that they are assessed only up to the date of
                            verdict, and (2) that <em>they are capable of precise
                                arithmetical calculation or at least of being estimated with a close
                                approximation to accuracy</em>. The familiar examples are
                            medical and surgical fees paid or payable, ambulance and hospital
                            expenses, and loss of income. Where the plaintiff has been employed at a
                            fixed wage or salary, his loss of income can commonly be calculated with
                            exactness. Where the plaintiff has not been employed, but is, for
                            example, a professional man, his monetary loss can be estimated without
                            difficulty by reference to his past earnings. In a high proportion of
                            cases the amount of the ‘special damages’ is agreed between
                            counsel for the plaintiff and counsel for the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘General damages’ on the other hand are, of their very
                            nature, incapable of mathematical calculation, and (although the
                            expression is apt to be misleading) commonly very much ‘at
                            large’. They are at large in the sense that a jury has, in serious
                            cases, a wide discretion in assessing them. Also general damages may be
                            assessed not with reference to any limited period, but with reference to
                            an indefinite future. Damages may be awarded for ‘pain and
                            suffering’, and such damages are assessable for past, present and
                            future pain and suffering. But here calculation is obviously impossible,
                            and damages for pain and suffering should clearly be regarded as
                            ‘general’ and not ‘special’ damages. In fact,
                            the question of general damages is generally, I think, put to a jury
                            under three heads – (1) ‘economic loss’, (2) loss of
                            ‘amenities’ or ‘enjoyment of life’, and (3) pain
                            and suffering.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.4    The [Australian] High Court has repeatedly
                            preferred to describe the loss sustained by a person who is unable to
                            earn in consequence of injuries as ‘loss of earning
                            capacity’, rather than ‘loss of earnings’. The High
                            Court has nevertheless insisted that loss of earning capacity does not
                            attract an award of damages except in so far as it is or may be
                            productive of economic loss. <em>The question has arisen
                                whether it is appropriate to apply the distinction between
                                ‘special’ and ‘general’ damages as described
                                by Fullagar J in 6.2 to loss of earning capacity that is productive
                                of economic loss up to the date of the trial and loss of earning
                                capacity that may be productive of future economic
                            loss</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Arthur Robinson (Grafton) Pty Ltd v
                            Carter</em> [(1968) 122 CLR 649 at 658 [(a case where the
                        plaintiff was employed at the time of the accident)]] Barwick CJ thought it
                        illogical that wages that would have been earned between receipt of the
                        injury and the date of the trial are treated as special damages. He also
                        thought that it would be better that they not be so treated because this
                        would emphasise that loss of earning capacity rather than loss of earnings
                        is what is to be compensated. The Full Court of Victoria [in <em>Freudhofer v Poledano</em> [1972] VR 287 (FC)] disagreed,
                        finding justification for the practice in the fact that the date of the
                        verdict, not the date of the injury, is the proper date for the assessment
                        of damages and, at that date, the court must not speculate when it
                        knows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although it is true that we can never be certain that if the injury had
                        not occurred, the plaintiff would have received the earnings on which the
                        claim for lost earning capacity is based, we can be relatively more certain
                        with regard to those to the date of trial. While we cannot be certain that
                        there would not have been some other injury precluding the plaintiff from
                        earning, we can at least be sure, if such be the case, that the employer is
                        still in business, that workers in similar positions have not been laid off,
                        that wage-rates are as claimed, that the plaintiff has been able to earn
                        certain amounts despite the injury, and so on. All this is necessarily
                        speculative with regard to the future, though the degree of speculation
                        needed may vary from case to case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is true that in some cases what the plaintiff would
                            have earned to the date of the trial is as doubtful as what would have
                            been earned after that date; or the defendant shows that despite the
                            injury the plaintiff could have resumed the former employment. In such
                            cases there may be little advantage in making a division between loss of
                            earning capacity as part of special damages and loss of earning capacity
                            as part of general damages; it should all be dealt with as part of
                            general damages. But where they are capable of being estimated with a
                            close approximation to accuracy, and so long as these damages are
                            treated as earnings-related by the courts, damages for loss of earning
                            capacity up to the date of verdict should be regarded as
                            special</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.5    
              <em>One danger from the practice of
                                treating pre-trial loss of earning capacity as a matter for special
                                damages is that a plaintiff who is unable to prove with precision
                                the earnings lost up to the date of the trial may wrongly be denied
                                any compensation for loss of earning capacity during that period,
                                whereas the law is clear that the court must estimate the loss of
                                earning capacity as best it can in the
                            circumstances</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Another danger, to the opposite effect, is that proof
                            of precise figures could implant in the minds of a jury the idea that
                            the earnings would definitely have been received and so make the jury
                            forgetful of contingencies to which such earnings were
                            subject</em>. Since, however, many matters are no longer uncertain
                        at the date of the trial, contingencies should not be taken into account in
                        the same way with regard to past loss as to future loss. It is enough if the
                        jury is reminded of some of the chances that might have prevented the
                        plaintiff from earning the wages. In most cases where it is possible to
                        treat pre-trial loss of income as part of special damages, the allowance for
                        such contingencies need be small. The contrary danger is that failure to
                        allocate pre-trial and post-trial loss of earning capacity to special and
                        general damages respectively may lead to the pre-trial loss being
                        overlooked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The law is thus not so rigid – nor
                    should it be – such that all claims tending to assume the character of
                    seeking pre-trial loss of income must be shoehorned as claims for special
                    damages (for which there must be strict proof). It cannot be taken for granted
                    that all claims of such character are “capable of being estimated with a
                    close approximation to accuracy”, although instances of such incapability
                    are quite uncommon in practice. What this means is that when a claim is made by
                    a plaintiff seeking compensation for pre-trial income that he asserts he could
                    have earned but for his injuries suffered from the accident, <em>and what the plaintiff would have actually earned is as doubtful as what
                        would have been earned post-trial</em>, it is to be preferred that
                    pre-trial loss of <em>earning capacity</em> attracting
                        <em>general</em> damages and not pre-trial loss of
                        <em>income</em> attracting <em>special</em> damages be used as the proper measure of damages for the
                    purposes of assessment. This is, however, not to say that the former approach
                    must invariably prevail where the plaintiff was not employed at the time of the
                    accident; Fullagar J’s example of the professional man quoted above at
                    [51] would attest to that. The court’s evaluation at the end of the day
                    must depend on the factual matrices of each and every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the present case, the proper measure of
                    damages to be applied in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial
                    earnings-related loss should be the Plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of
                        <em>earning capacity</em> attracting <em>general</em> damages. As compared to what she could earn post-trial,
                    I find it equally if not more doubtful what the Plaintiff, having been a
                    housewife for almost five years at the time of the accident, would actually have
                    earned during the period leading up to the date of trial. The fact that the
                    Plaintiff has obtained a dog grooming certificate sometime after the accident
                    does not in any way alter my analysis because the Plaintiff has pitched her
                    claim as one seeking income that she would otherwise have been able to earn
                        <em>by way of setting up a dog grooming business</em>.
                    In other words, the claim, properly characterised, is for loss of pre-trial
                        <em>business</em> earnings, not loss of pre-trial wages
                    that she would have earned as an employee in the job market. There is no
                    business without any commercial risks, and there is no guarantee of success in
                    business. To assess and award the Plaintiff special damages under the rubric of
                    pre-trial loss of income using the method that Mr Hanam has adopted (see
                    [47]-[48] above) would be tantamount to making the Defendant insure the
                    Plaintiff against all risks of business failure in the dog grooming business
                    that she had intended to start, and that cannot be right. This is precisely what
                    the learned author in <em>Assessment of Damages for Personal
                        Injury and Death: General Principles</em> would have cautioned against
                    in the light of his warning against the danger that “proof of precise
                    figures could implant in the minds of a jury the idea that the earnings would
                    definitely have been received and so make the jury forgetful of contingencies to
                    which such earnings were subject” (see [51] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Having determined that the proper measure of
                    damages under the present category of claim should be general damages for
                    pre-trial loss of earning capacity, the question is what amount, if at all,
                    should be awarded to the Plaintiff. A claim for loss of earning capacity is a
                    claim seeking compensation for the weakening of the “competitive
                    edge” in the open employment market which a plaintiff has suffered as a
                    result of his or her injury arising from the accident. The evidence of Ms Ho and
                    the data from ‘Service Canada’ which at best only tend towards
                    proving <em>pre-trial loss of income</em>, do not assist
                    the Plaintiff in this regard. The Plaintiff’s proposed sum of $49,092 (see
                    [46] above) is therefore rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Again having regard to Prakash J’s
                    holding in <em>Clark Jonathan Michael</em> at [91] (see
                    [44] above), I will award the Plaintiff a sum of $10,000 for her pre-trial loss
                    of earning capacity which is to be added to the general damages that I have
                    assessed earlier in [45] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pre-trial medical expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Plaintiff has put in a claim for pre-trial
                    medical expenses for the treatment of her whiplash and psychiatric injuries.
                    Copies of the billing receipts were tendered in court as proof and, with the
                    help of a table prepared by Mr Hanam,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> it became apparent that
                    many of the receipts billed to the Plaintiff contained lump sum charges for
                        <em>both</em> neck and back medical treatment without
                    any specific apportionment of charges between the two types of treatment. Given
                    that the Plaintiff has abandoned her claim for the alleged back injury (see [3]
                    above), it follows that such amounts which were incurred by the Plaintiff for
                    the treatment of her alleged back injury should be excluded. In that respect, Mr
                    Pillai has suggested that it would be fair that a 50 percent reduction be
                    applied to those unapportioned bills. I agree.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Mr Pillai further argued that the bills
                    charged for epidural injections administered on the Plaintiff should be totally
                    excluded as those treatments were unnecessary. I disagree as I consider them to
                    be reasonable avenues of treatment that the Plaintiff was entitled to explore in
                    the circumstances at the time, although I would apply a 25 percent discount to
                    the bills associated with those epidural injections<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> as the evidence showed that for each
                    of those sessions, three injections were administered to the Plaintiff’s
                    neck while one injection was administered to the Plaintiff’s
                        back.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Based on the foregoing reasoning, I arrived at
                    the sum of around $59,613 in my calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Pillai has also raised an issue of double
                    recovery in the sense that some of the medical expenses which the Plaintiff has
                    incurred might be or have been covered by her own insurance policy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> I do not think I need to delve into this
                    issue in great detail other than to refer to a passage in Harvey McGregor,
                        <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        18<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2012), pp 1384-1385, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As early as 1874 it was decided in <em>Bradburn v G.W.
                            Ry</em> [(1874) L.R. 10 Ex. 1] that, where the claimant had taken
                        out accident insurance, the moneys received by him under the insurance
                        policy were not to be taken into account in assessing the damages for the
                        injury in respect of which he had been paid the insurance moneys. This
                        decision has withstood time and is solidly endorsed at House of Lords level
                        by <em>Parry v Cleaver</em> [[1970] A.C. 1], not only
                        by the majority who relied upon it by analogy but also by the minority who
                        sought to distinguish it, and more recently by Lord Bridge speaking for the
                        whole House in <em>Hussain v New Taplow Paper
                            Mills</em> [[1988] A.C. 514 at 527G] and in <em>Hodgson v Trapp</em> [[1989] A.C. 807 at 819H], and by Lord
                        Templeman similarly in <em>Smoker v London Fire
                            Authority</em> [[1991] 2 A.C. 502 at 539B-F]. The matter is
                        clearly now incontrovertible. The argument in favour of non-deduction is
                        that, even if in the result the claimant may be compensated beyond his loss,
                        he has paid for the accident insurance with his own moneys, and the fruits
                        of this thrift and foresight should in fairness enure to his and not to the
                        defendant’s advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     This position has been adopted by our Court of
                    Appeal in <em>The “MARA”</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R)
                    31 at [28] (see also <em>Seagate Technology Pte Ltd and another v
                        Goh Han Kim</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 836 at [47] and [51]). I therefore
                    dismiss Mr Pillai’s argument on double recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Accordingly, I will allow an award of $59,613
                    to the Plaintiff as special damages for medical expenses she has incurred prior
                    to the commencement of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Maid/domestic helper expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Plaintiff is also seeking $9,646 for maid
                    expenses for the period between April 2010 and September 2011. In her affidavit
                    of evidence-in-chief, the Plaintiff stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Due to the pain that I was experiencing to my back and neck, I could not
                        do the housework and had to employ a maid to do the housework. The monthly
                        salary for the maid was $340 for April 2010 with the worker’s levy of
                        $170 per month except for April 2010 which was $150. Between April 2010 to
                        September 2011 I incurred $9,646:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    Agency Fees
                            -     $
                            376</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    Salary
                            -     $
                            6,210</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c)    Levy
                                -     <u>$
                                3,060</u></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-4">
<u>$ 9,646</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     However, the documents produced by the
                    Plaintiff do not tally with the sum of $9,646 claimed by the
                        Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> In
                    fact, the documents only went so far as to show that the Plaintiff had employed
                    a maid for the period of April 2010 to November 2010. Documentary evidence for
                    the alleged period of December 2010 to September 2011 was completely absent. No
                    attempts were made to reconcile the figures presented in the Plaintiff’s
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (see [62] above) with the documents produced by
                    the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In any case, I find that there is no merit in
                    the Plaintiff’s claim for maid expenses. Claims for maid/domestic helper
                    expenses are not uncommon where domestic helpers are employed for the care and
                    well-being of tortious victims who have suffered serious and often permanent
                    disabilities, and even so the court has on occasion applied a discount to such
                    claims to take into account such other concurrent services which the domestic
                    helpers would provide to assist in the victim’s household chores (see,
                        <em>eg</em>, <em>Toon Chee Meng Eddie v
                        Yeap Chin Hon</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 407 at [38]). In the present case,
                    the maid expenses were incurred not to provide any direct care to the Plaintiff
                    for her own well-being, but to assist in the household chores for her entire
                    family in lieu of her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> Cases such as the present one fall
                    within a penumbral class where the court is entitled to exercise its own
                    judgment, based on the particular facts of each case, as to whether the expenses
                    incurred in the hiring of the domestic helper is truly and fairly a necessity
                    arising from the accident/tort which ought in law be compensated by way of
                    damages (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Tan Juay Mui
                        (by his next friend Chew Chwee Kim) v Sher Kuan Hock and another (Liberty
                        Insurance Pte Ltd, co-defendant; Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd and another,
                        third parties)</em> [2012] 3 SLR 496 at [55]-[58]). Here, I am unable
                    to find that such necessity truly and fairly existed in the circumstances. Given
                    that (a) the Plaintiff has a history of once hiring a maid prior to the
                        accident,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> (b) the
                    Plaintiff did not engage a maid until around seven months after the accident
                    happened, and (c) the Plaintiff agreed in cross-examination that the hiring of
                    the maid was for the benefit of her entire family,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> I find on balance that the
                    employment of the domestic helper from April 2010 to September 2011 was borne
                    more likely out of convenience and/or factors that are not inextricably linked
                    to the accident instead. I therefore reject this category of claim in its
                    totality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Before leaving this category of claim, I will
                    add in passing that nowhere in the Plaintiff’s statement of claim or her
                    written submissions has she framed any claim for pre-trial loss of <em>housekeeping capacity</em> which, if the English authority of
                        <em>Daly v General Steam Navigation Co Ltd</em> [1981]
                    1 WLR 120 were to be applied, would probably constitute a claim under <em>general</em> damages for pain and suffering and loss of
                    amenities. There is therefore no reason for me to assess any damages as
                    such.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Transport expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In submissions, the Plaintiff has also put in
                    a claim of $3,500 for transportation expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> However, this claim was totally devoid of any
                    elaboration in the submissions. Neither was there any evidence presented in
                    court to support this particular claim. The claim is therefore dismissed for
                    failure of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In conclusion, the following award is made in

                                was therefore allowed, and the 50% reduction was only applied to the
                                remainder before applying GST. For Items 54 and 72, copies of the

                                claims are therefore rejected. (Note: Items 40, 42, 45, 49, 52, 58,
