<p xmlns="">number of documents by a specified date and time, failing which judgment would be entered

against the defendants. The order was made pursuant to the plaintiffs’ action against

the club for misrepresentation and breach of contract. The plaintiffs allege that the

‘common law prospectus’ promised lavish reception and facilities to all selected

and accepted by the defendants as members of the club, which representations the

plaintiffs allege were false and misleading. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">    The defendants appealed against discovery of the

following documents in the order: A document recording the number of members to be taken

in the 1<sup>st</sup> offering (Item 1); a document recording the number of members to be

taken in the second offering (Item 2); a document recording the number of applications

received and determining the number to be accepted in the 1<sup>st</sup> offering (Item

3); any document(s) revealing a change in approval criteria between the 1<sup>st</sup> and

2<sup>nd</sup> offering (Item 4); application forms submitted and approved at the fee of

$28,000 in the relevant period (Item 5); a document reflecting the membership numbers at

various dates from 1996 to 2002 (Item 7); any document relating to the decision before

June 2001 to use $100,000,000 for additional facilities (Item 9(b)); copies of

correspondence from members raising complaints and the club management’s replies over

a period of time (Item 10); documents relating to the use of presidential or executive

suites of RTC by non-members in the relevant period (Item 11); and finally, the original

document entitled "F &amp; B Daily Sales and Cost of Sales Analysis" (Item 12).</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held, allowing the appeal save for Item 7 of the Order, </p>
<p align="justify"></p></b><font size="3" xmlns="">(1) Whether a class of documents as a whole would be

relevant and should be produced for the purposes of discovery must depend upon the

court’s evaluation that the documents sought would contain such information that

might enable the plaintiffs to advance their own case or damage that of the defendants; <i>O

Co. v M Co.</i> [1996] 2 Lloyd’s LR 347 followed (see  14). </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">(2) A court would not order discovery of material which

would be used solely for cross-examination of a witness as to credit since it would be

oppressive if a party was obliged to disclose any document which might provide material

for cross examination as to his credibility as a witness; <i>Thorpe v Chief Constable of

the Greater Manchester Police</i> [1989] 2 All ER 827 followed (see  15).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) If the request for discovery is too wide, too onerous or oppressive

then the courts are likely to reject the request. Save for Item 7, which is germane to the

issues addressed in this case, the other discoveries appealed against are too wide,

extremely onerous and appear to lack the essential ingredient of relevance. (see  17

<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    This is an appeal by the defendants against

the order of the learned Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court made on 23 April 2002,

requiring the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a number of documents by 5 p.m. on

7 May 2002. Failure to comply with the order would have resulted in the plaintiffs

entering judgment against the defendants. The background to the present appeal is provided

below.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    The plaintiffs, a group of about 4,895 disgruntled

members of a proprietary social club, have brought this action against the club, the

defendants herein, based on actionable misrepresentation and breach of contract. The

purpose of this action, as stated in the plaintiffs’ statement of claim is to seek

declaratory orders and compensation for the said alleged actionable misrepresentation and

breach of contract, reportedly contained in a set of documents which the plaintiffs term

as a ‘common law prospectus’, promising lavish reception and facilities to all

selected and accepted by the defendants as members of the club.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    The plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued

and caused to be despatched to members of the public the said common law prospectus.

According to the plaintiffs, the said common law prospectus comprised:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) a letter of invitation dated 9 November 1996;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) a document giving general information in the form of questions and

  answers; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) a brochure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    The plaintiffs further aver in their statement of

claim that the said prospectus contained, inter alia, the following highlights either by

express representation or by way of necessary implications:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) It was planned that the Club would have nearly 600 car park lots

  for the use of the members.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) "Raffles Town Club members will enjoy unparalleled privileges

  and facilities".</p>
<p align="justify">(c) "The Club’s exclusive and limited memberships will be

  fully transferrable".</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The Club would be constructed to have a total built-up area in

  excess of 400,000 sq. ft. catering for the "business entertainment, networking,

  socializing, personal and family leisure requirements" of each successful

  subscription for the duration of the membership. The Club would have "separate

  formal, casual, sporting, children’s and family facilities" for the successful

  subscribers.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) A supplementary card would be issued to the spouse or fianc of

  the member allowing full membership privileges and benefits at no additional cost. This

  was intended to convey the meaning and message that each subscriber would receive two

  licences for the price of one.</p>
<p align="justify">(f) The Club would be "without peer in terms of size, facilities

  and sheer opulence".</p>
<p align="justify">(g) There would be two classes of individual members:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) first, a limited number of exclusive transferable founder members

    at S$28,000 (exclusive of GST) available to the credit-card holding customers on a

    first-come-first-served basis. This class of founder members would be selected from those

    who submitted their applications not later than 30 November 1996. Based on "priority

    applications", this class of members were called "founder members"; and</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the second class of members would be selected from those not

    selected from the priority applications and from fresh applications submitted in response

    to a public launch to be made after 30 November 1996. The allotment price for this class

    of members was to be S$40,000. This class of members will hereafter be called "second

    class members".</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    In paragraphs 10 to 14 of the statement of claim,

the plaintiffs outlined how they understood the said representations and their grievances.

Insofar as is material, the said segment reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">10. The Plaintiffs and other members of the Class understood the

  representations to mean that the total number of members at any given time would be

  limited such that at any given time no member and the supplementary card-holder would be

  shut out from or be unable to use the facilities of the Club, including the car parks in

  the manner or up to the standard as represented in the prospectus. Such limitation was

  also to be inferred from the holding-out and the representations (a) that the Club would

  be "without peer in terms of size, facilities and sheer opulence", (b) that

  there would be "a limited number of exclusive individual founder member

  memberships" and (c) as to the number of car park lots and the total built-up area.

  Further, the representations were to be understood, implied or inferred in the light of

  the provisions of the Building Control Act, the regulations made thereunder as construed

  and applied by the consultant architects engaged by the Defendant for the construction of

  the Club.</p>
<p align="justify">11. Additionally or alternatively, the representations and the

  holding-out set out above became terms of the contractual licences spawned by the

  acceptance of the Plaintiffs and other members of the Class.</p>
<p align="justify">12. The Plaintiffs and other members of the Class on the faith of the

  representations as set out above and the contents of the prospectus as a whole subscribed

  to and became the founder members. Each of them paid the subscription in the sum of

  S$28,000. All made their applications not later than 30 November 1996. In addition, they

  paid monthly subscriptions and deposits for the Food and Beverage Account.</p>
<p align="justify">13. The representations as set out above turned out to be untrue, false

  and misleading.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u><i><b><p align="center">Particulars</p>
</b></i></u></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. The Club in fact accepted 19,000 members each of whom had paid

    S$28,000. The acceptance was communicated by the Defendant to the successful applicants in

    December 1996. There was no public launch of $40,000 for the second class members.</p>
<p align="justify">b. The Club was opened in March 2000 and not end of 1998 as promised

    and was woefully inadequate shockingly short of the representations to cater for and

    accommodate the huge number of members and the supplementary card-holders.</p>
<p align="justify">c. Not all facilities stated in the prospectus were available to the

    members.</p>
<p align="justify">d. The Defendant dreadfully failed to realise the representations set

    out above with the result that the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class were

    unable to realise the aspirations and representations conveyed by the prospectus.</p>
<p align="justify">e. The membership became virtually useless.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">14. Additionally or alternatively, by reason of the matters set out in

  paragraph 13, the Defendant was in breach of the contract of the terms as asserted above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    In the result, the plaintiffs, alleging loss and

damage, seek declaratory orders and damages.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    The defendants, in the defence filed by them

without prejudice to their rights to apply to the court to strike out the plaintiffs’

claim resist the claim and aver that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the remedies

sought by them. Insofar as is material, paragraphs 10 and 13 of the defence require

reproduction and they are as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">10. Insofar as Paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim alleges that the

  Plaintiffs and other members of the Class understood that there were certain

  representations made, and that these representations were understood to mean such

  allegations as are contained in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim, the

  Plaintiffs’ state of mind and the stage of mind of the members of the Class is not

  within the Defendant’s knowledge. Consequently, no admission is made thereto.</p>
<p align="justify">13. The Defendants further aver that the Club is a proprietary club,

  providing facilities and amenities for the use of its members, who, in turn, have no

  interest in the club property and/or income. The Plaintiffs and the members of the Class

  applied to become members of the Club, by submitting the application forms. That is an

  offer by the Plaintiffs and the members of the Class. The Defendant accepted the offer.

  Plaintiffs and members of the Class thereby became members of the Club. The contract

  between the parties is as set out in the said application forms and acceptance. The terms

  of the contract are as set out in the said application form, which, as stated earlier is

  an offer by the Plaintiffs and the members of the Class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    Further particulars were provided by the

plaintiffs pursuant to an order of Court dated 4 March 2002 and they are too long to be

entered upon here.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    As mentioned by me at the outset, the appeal

before me is confined only to the order made by the Assistant Registrar on 23 April 2002,

requiring the defendants to provide the plaintiffs a host of documents by 7 May 2002,

failing which the plaintiffs are entitled to enter judgment against the defendants. In

order to comprehend the issues raised by the parties in regard to the present appeal, it

would be helpful at this stage to reproduce a schedule submitted by counsel setting forth

the description of the documents ordered to be produced by the defendants and the position

of the defendants in this appeal in relation to the said documents. The said schedule

appropriate at this stage. It is an agreed position between both counsel that in regard to

item 7 of the said schedule, the last four documents listed there, i.e., documents

reflecting the membership numbers for the periods: (iii) 31 January 1999; (iv)

31 March 2000; (v) 31 March 2001; and (vi) 31 March 2002 were never requested by

plaintiffs were not asking for them to be produced.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    In the appeal before me, in the main, the

submission by the counsel for the appellants was that in the absence of a plea of

fraudulent misrepresentation, a party is not entitled to ask for documents to evince the

other party’s frame of mind. He further submitted that the court should not allow

wide-ranging discovery where the party’s purpose is to fish for possible claims, as

discovery in such a case may be oppressive. He added that the over-riding test in respect

of discovery is relevance and this does not appear to be case in relation to the

plaintiffs’ requests.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the

documents ordered are relevant to the issues and matters in question in the action; they

are documents which the plaintiffs may or will rely on; they are documents which could

adversely affect the defendant’s case or support the plaintiffs’ case; they are

documents which may lead the plaintiffs to a train of inquiry resulting in the plaintiffs

obtaining information which may adversely affect the defendant’s case or support the

plaintiffs’ case; and above all they are necessary for disposing fairly of the cause

or matter or as necessary for saving costs. Reliance was placed on O 24 r (5) of the

Rules of Court which provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="justify">5.</p></b>–(1) Subject to Rule 7, the Court may at any time, on the

  application of any party to a cause or matter, make an order requiring any other party to

  make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application

  or any class of document so specified or described is, or has at any time been, in his

  possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he

  parted with it and what has become of it.

  <p align="justify">(2) An order may be made against a party under this Rule

  notwithstanding that the party may already have made or been required to make a list of

  documents or an affidavit under Rule 1.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) An application for an order under this Rule must be supported by an

  affidavit stating the belief of the deponent that the party from whom discovery is sought

  under this Rule has, or at some time had, in his possession, custody or power, the

  document, or class of document, specified or described in the application and that it

  falls within one of the following descriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) a document on which the party relies or will rely;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) a document which could –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) adversely affect his own case;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) support another party’s case; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) a document which may lead the party seeking discovery of it to a

    train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information which may –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) adversely affect his own case;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) support another party’s case.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(4) An order under this Rule shall not be made in any cause or matter

  in respect of any party before an order under Rule 1 has first been obtained in respect of

  that party, unless, in the opinion of the Court, the order is necessary or desirable.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Decision</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    In my view, whether a class of documents as a

whole would be relevant and should be produced for the purposes of discovery must depend

upon the court’s evaluation that the documents sought would contain such information

that might enable the plaintiffs to advance their own case or damage that of the

defendants. Colman J in <i>O Co. v M Co.</i> [1996] Vol. 2 Lloyd’s LR 347 at 351

observed:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[T]he document or class of documents must be shown by the applicant to

  offer a real probability of evidential materiality in the sense that it must be a document

  or class of documents which in the ordinary way can be expected to yield information of

  substantial evidential materiality to the pleaded claim and the defence to it in the broad

  sense which I have explained. If the document or class cannot be demonstrated to be

  clearly connected to issues which have already been raised on the pleadings or which would

  in the ordinary way be expected to be raised in the course of the proceedings, if

  sufficient information were available, the application should be dismissed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.    Still on this subject, it was held by the Court

of Appeal in England, in <i>Thorpe v Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police</i>

[1989] 2 All ER 827, that it would not order discovery of material which would be used

solely for cross-examination of a witness as to credit since it would be oppressive if a

party was obliged to disclose any document which might provide material for

cross-examination as to his credibility as a witness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.    The cause of action as put forth by the

plaintiffs is based on actionable misrepresentation and breach of contract. In this

regard, the plaintiffs, in fact 4,895 of them in all, by and large rely on a so-called

common law prospectus. Let me now deal with the nature of the documents requested and

ordered to be produced.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.    <i>Items 1 to 4 of the schedule</i>: Documents

requested are in relation to decisions of the defendants’ board taken (a) before 6

November 1996, (b) after 30 November 1996 but before 31 March 1997, and (c) after

1 January 1996 but before 31 September 1997, on the criteria for approving membership

applications as well as the number of members to be taken in for the fee of $28,000 in the

first offering and for $40,000 in the second offering.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    In my view, the decision of the board as to the

criteria to be adopted by them and the number of members they intended to recruit cannot

be a basis for any actionable misrepresentation or breach of contract and in this respect

no material is placed before me to warrant an inference that the said documents might

enable the plaintiffs to advance their case or damage that of the defendants. One can

imagine that in any commercial venture there is bound to be discussions and decisions as

to how the said venture should proceed to obtain optimum returns. In a dynamic and fluid

corporate environment, decisions are made and unmade to provide for contingencies. On the

question how the criteria contemplated and decisions taken by the defendants’ board

would enhance the plaintiffs’ case, or damage that of the defendants, there was very

little forthcoming from the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    <i>Item 5</i>: The document here relates to

application forms to the club submitted after 30 November 1996 and before March 2000

approved for membership at the fee of $28,000. Quite apart from the fact, the applicants

might well object to their personal particulars disclosed to all and sundry, in my view,

these application forms have little relevance to the representations allegedly made to the

plaintiffs and breach spoken of. The request covers not only the period the alleged

representations were supposedly made in the said common law prospectus but also the

ensuing four years. Again, I was not persuaded as to the relevance how this group of

documents might advance the case of the plaintiffs or damage the case of the defendants.

Cases referred to by the plaintiffs’ counsel (<i>Manilal &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd v

Bhupendra KJ Shan</i> (<i>t/a JB International)</i> [1989] SLR 1182, <i>The Patraikos 2</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62174&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 308</a>, <i>Standard Chartered Bank v SSangyong Cement (Singapore) Limited</i>

S1173/1991 unreported), all of them do not detract from the principle that in general

where there is an order of court for discovery, a party is obliged to make discover all

documents relevant to the matters in the action and what these matters are would depend on

the pleadings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    <i>Item 6</i>: Documents ordered to be produced

under this item are not the subject of appeal before me.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    <i>Item 7</i>: As mentioned by me earlier (see

para 10 infra), documents in respect of membership numbers as on 31 January 1999,

31 March 2000, 31 March 2001 and 31 March 2002, although not asked for by the

plaintiffs, were still ordered to be produced by the Assistant Registrar. During arguments

before me, plaintiffs’ counsel informed me that he was not pressing for these

documents. As for membership numbers as on 30 December 1996 and 31 March 1997, I was not

inclined to disturb the order below as it would appear that the number of members in

respect of the periods mentioned are germane to the issues to be addressed in this case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    <i>Item 8</i>: The document ordered is a copy of

invitation to membership in the month of November 1996 by the defendants and their

associates. This is indeed a relevant document and at any rate that there is no appeal by

the defendants in respect of this document.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    <i>Item 9</i>: There are two categories of

documents, categories (a) and (b), ordered to be produced under this head. The defendants

are not appealing against category (a) documents which relate to building plans and

designs. The subject of appeal under this item is confined to documents grouped under

category (b) only. They pertain to decisions made by the defendants or their associates

shortly before June 2001 to use $100,000,000 for additional facilities and the

implementation of the plan using the said sum. In relation to these documents, I am

inclined to agree with the defence contention that any decision that may have been made in

the course of the year 2001 cannot have any bearing or relevance to the alleged

representations made in the year 1996.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    <i>Item 10</i>: The documents ordered under this

head relate to members’ complaints and management replies concerning the inadequacy

and overcrowding in the club’s facilities for the period March 2000 to July 2001. The

first observation in regard to this request is that the plaintiffs, comprising a united

group of 4,995 members, would by themselves, have been able to produce the letters of

complaints they wrote to the management and the replies they might have received without

having to pass the burden to the defendants. In any event, the complaints and the response

are not shown to me to be of relevance to the issues to be decided.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    <i>Item 11</i>: The documents ordered relate to

the use of the presidential or executive suites of the club by a non-member or body

corporate and the fees charged for such use for the period March 2000 and March 2001. What

light, the documents requested would throw on the issues to be determined, I was not made

aware of. In any event, in my evaluation, this request is clearly an endeavour to unsettle

the defendants and has little relevance to the issues at hand.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    <i>Item 12</i>: Under this head, the defendants

are required to produce for inspection the originals of item 106 – 129 of their List

of Documents identified as "F &amp; B Daily Sales Analysis" with liberty for the

plaintiffs to take copies at their cost. I was told that the defendants that they on their

own disclosed and produced these documents with certain parts blanked out. The blanked

parts relate to how much money is charged and paid. The defendants’ contention is

that those parts are not relevant at all to the issues to be decided. The plaintiffs’

counsel’s reply is that inasmuch as the defendants have disclosed the documents to

the plaintiffs, the latter must bare all. In <i>G.E. Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd

v. Bankers Trust Co. and Others</i> [1995] 1 WLR 172, it was held by the Court of Appeal

in England that a party giving discovery of a document is not obliged to disclose any part

which is irrelevant to the issues in the case. In that case, the plaintiff had blanked out

from the documents in a list served on the defendants passages considered irrelevant. The

judge in the first instance ordered the complete documents to be disclosed since it had

not been alleged that they were irrelevant. The plaintiff appealed and the court of appeal

allowed the appeal holding that the judge had applied the wrong test. Hoffmann LJ (as he

then was) observed at p.175 H that the irrelevant parts can be covered without destroying

the sense of the rest or making it misleading. In the case before me, counsel for the

plaintiffs did not address me on the relevance of the blanked parts except to venture that

he would like to know whether the covered parts are relevant or not.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.   In <i>Marks and Spencer plc v Granada TV and Another</i>

(unreported), a transcript of which is provided by the defendants’ counsel, Ebsworth

J, commented at page 4 of the transcript (last paragraph) "<i>[I]t is incumbent upon

a party making an application for a discretionary order, such as specific <b>discovery</b>,

to ensure that which is sought is within the proper limits of relevance and sufficiently

specific to be the subject of the affidavit which is required to be sworn. If it is too

wide then it is both extremely onerous for the opposing party and will add to, rather than

save costs by including matters which are not relevant. In those circumstances, as Aldous

J pointed out in Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd v Carr’s Paper Ltd and others [1989] RPC 713,

the court is entitled to refuse to make an order at all.</i>"</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    In my opinion, the very rationale for the

discovery process, provided for in the Rule referred to, is relevance. If it is too wide,

too onerous or oppressive then the courts are likely to reject the request. In my

determination, the discoveries sought are too wide, extremely onerous and appear to lack

the essential ingredient of relevance.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.    Having considered all the arguments and the

learning referred to, I am of the view that discoveries requested and ordered, save for

matters conceded and not appealed against appear to straddle the realm of fishing. In my

determination, most of the documents requested appears to have little or no relevance to

the issues to be decided except for the purposes of expanding the armoury of the

plaintiffs, which the plaintiffs are now trying to assemble at the expense of the

defendants. When the appeal was in train before me, it was made apparent to me that the

present grievance by the plaintiffs arises from a disclosure obtained by the court in a

previous case where the membership numbers of the defendants surfaced. Having determined

that the categories documents sought by the plaintiffs are extremely wide and bear little

relevance to the issues, the following orders were made by me at the end. They are as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) Appeal is allowed save for paragraph 1(7) of the Notice of Appeal

  dated 25 April 2002;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) In relation to paragraph 1(7) of the Notice of Appeal dated 25

  April 2002, the Defendant shall give the Plaintiffs by 21 May 2002 either a document or

  furnish best particulars of the:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) number of members as at 30 December 1996; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) number of members as at 31 March 1997;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(3) Order the Defendant, by 5.00 pm on 21 May 2002 to comply with the

  orders made by the Assistant Registrar on 23 April 2002 which are not being appealed

  against and the orders made herein.</p>
<p align="justify">The Defendant to use its best endeavours to comply with the above

  orders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In default, the Plaintiff may apply to Court to enter judgment against

  the Defendant upon giving 48 hours’ notice to the Defendant;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(4) There be liberty to apply; and</p>
<p align="justify">(5) By consent, costs of the appeal and below be costs in the cause.</p>
