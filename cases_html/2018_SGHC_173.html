</div>
</div> The defendant, Mr Lee Fook Kheun (“Mr Lee”), is a patron to whom RWS extended a credit facility of $5 million on 20 August 2010 (“the Credit Facility”), which subsequently was increased by another $5 million on 22 August 2010. The Credit Facility was fully drawn down. Mr Lee has made partial repayment, and $5,930,595 remains outstanding. RWS claims this amount, together with the interest and costs provided under the agreements. Mr Lee contests this, and counterclaims for the sum he previously paid RWS. For reasons that follow, judgment is ordered for RWS and Mr Lee’s counterclaim is dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Mr Lee is a 67-year-old Malaysian who was a director and shareholder of various construction companies and is at present largely retired. Since the early 1990s, he has been a close friend and business associate of Mr Lim Kim Chai (“Mr Lim”). Mr Lim was and is in the gaming and gambling industry, and operates junkets to casinos with Mr Low Thiam Herr (“Mr Low”). Mr Lee also became acquainted with Mr Low through Mr Lim. All three men live in Kuala Lumpur. From 2007, the three men travelled together for business and leisure. From time to time, Mr Lee visited casinos as part of a larger group with Mr Lim and Mr Low.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Mr Lee’s first visit to RWS was on 7 July 2010. RWS was newly opened at the time, and he was interested to explore the possibility of opening a Chinese restaurant in RWS that would specialise in seafood dishes and turtle soup.

</div> He contends that he has successfully rescinded the Credit Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 His second line of defence is that the Credit Agreements are null, void and unenforceable under the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”). He argues the exemption provided by s 40(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CCA”) to s 5 of the CLA is inapplicable because RWS failed to comply with regulations 6(a) and 12 of the Casino Control (Credit) Regulations 2010 (S 53/2010) (“the Regulations”), issued under s 108 of the CCA. Regulation 6 requires a request for credit, which Mr Lee submits that he did not make. Rather, it was Mr Tan, and the Casino’s staff, who had persistently offered him credit, despite his repeated rebuffs.

</div> Regulation 12 requires the implementation of a credit policy. RWS’s credit policy is set out in its “Casino Credit Policy for Credit &amp; Cheque Cashing Facility”, dated 3 March 2010 (“the Credit Policy”). Paragraph 2.A.1.1 of the Credit Policy states that the credit application must be supported by documents, including a “credit application form”. Mr Lee’s case is that the Credit Policy was breached because the Credit Agreements were “not legitimately completed”, as he was intoxicated, did not request for credit, and a RWS representative had recommended him for credit despite having no basis to do so.

I heard this application on the first day of trial. RWS agreed to some of the amendments, but objected to the ones which introduced a new defence of unconscionability. After hearing parties, I disallowed the contested amendments because the new defence was clearly unsustainable and had no prospect of success. Mr Lee relied on <span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL and another</span> [2017] SGHC 316 (“<span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL</span>”) in requesting the amendments. In that case, I held that parties who attempt to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability must satisfy two criteria. First, there must be weakness on one side. Second, there must be exploitation, extortion, or advantage taken of that weakness. I also held, at [119], that <span class="font-italic">a transaction at an undervalue would be a necessary component of this requirement</span>. Thus, for example, <span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL </span>concerned a trust instrument which was a voluntary disposition, from which the plaintiff received no financial return. In this case, the Credit Agreements are commercial transactions and were not procured at an undervalue. Mr Lee obtained $10 million worth of chips, precisely the amount he contracted for. This head of claim was clearly unsustainable on the facts pleaded and the amendments, if not rejected, would have obscured, rather than allowed, the real issues in the proceedings to be determined.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The following issues, therefore, arise for consideration:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Lee’s contention that he has rescinded the Credit Agreements on the basis of his intoxication at the time the agreements were signed involves two questions as follows:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) As a factual issue, was Mr Lee intoxicated when he signed the Credit Agreements?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) If so, what is the effect of that intoxication?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Lee’s second contention, that the Credit Agreements are void under the CLA because of non-compliance of regulations 6 and 12,  involves the following two queries:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) As a factual issue, have regulations 6 and 12 been breached?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) If so, what is the effect of such non-compliance? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In gist, I am of the view that Mr Lee has not proved on the balance of probabilities that he was so intoxicated that he failed to understand the nature and effect of the Credit Agreements. Even if this were not so, he has not rescinded the agreements; indeed his delay and conduct have affirmed them. His arguments under the CLA are also not persuasive because regulations 6 and 12 have been complied with. Mr Lee requested for the Credit Facility by signing the Credit Agreements, and RWS conducted the necessary background checks when granting credit to Mr Lee. I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Intoxication</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Intoxication results in impairment of mental capacity, and for that reason has been likened in the law to mental incapacity: see <span class="font-italic">Molton</span><span class="font-italic"> v Camroux</span> (1849) 4 Exch 17,19; 154 ER 1107,1108. A person seeking rescission must show that, first, when he entered into the transaction he was so drunk that he was unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction. This level of understanding was explained by Hallett J in <span class="font-italic">Ma</span><span class="font-italic">nches v Trimborn</span> (1946) 115 LJKB 305, 307 as “such a degree of incapacity as would interfere with the capacity of the defendant to understand substantially the nature and effect of the transaction into which she was entering.” Second, the counterparty to the transaction must have known of his infirmity. In <span class="font-italic">York Glass Co </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Jubb</span> (1925) 42 TLR 1 (CA) 2, the claim failed as the counterparty “did not know and had no reasons to know that [the complainant] was out of his mind at the time.” </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factual premise for defence of intoxication </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Mr Lee must first prove that he was so drunk that he was unable to understand the nature or effect of the transaction. His contention is that while he was drunk on 20 August 2010, Mr Tan persistently pressured him to accept a credit facility of $5 million. He eventually relented, he says, because his intoxication “left [him] quite open to being influenced”, and he did not wish to embarrass or offend his friends who were with him, even though he did not intend to gamble.

</div> As a result of his intoxication, Mr Lee was unaware that the plaintiff was presenting for his signature documents that would render him liable to RWS under the Credit Agreements. In particular, when he signed the First Credit Marker on 20 August, he did not know that he was drawing down on the Credit Facility. Furthermore, Mr Lee has no memory of signing the Amendment Form and the Second Credit Marker on 22 August 2010. The legal effect of those documents were not explained to him. He only understood what Mr Tan told him, which is that he would not pay anything if he did not gamble. He was therefore surprised when $10 million worth of chips were provided to him on 20 and 22 August 2010. Thinking that there must have been a mistake, he left all those chips on the gambling table.

I begin with an observation of a concession within his own testimony. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), he deposed that he remembered feeling surprised when he was offered a credit facility of $5 million, which “was not a sum [he] could afford, and it was not a sum [he] would be willing to use to gamble and potentially lose”.

In his amended Defence and Counterclaim, the references to the Credit Agreement were deleted, and it is only stated at paragraphs 4(c)(iv)-–(vii) that Tan procured Mr Lee to sign various documents and forms.

In his AEIC, however, he contended, at paragraphs 64 and 69, that Dato’ Sri Joseph had called and asked him to meet, and it was only at the meeting that the payment terms were discussed. When cross-examined on this inconsistency at trial, Mr Lee contended his Amended Defence was wrong, and it was only when the two men met in Kuala Lumpur were the terms discussed.

In response, Mr Lee points out in his closing submissions that there is no record of him gambling on 20 August 2010, and that the Player Rating Report dated 22 August 2010 only shows that he gambled $1.032 million, not $10 million.

</div> This response is not apposite, because the evidence was adduced on the premise that it was not comprehensive. The extent to which he had gambled personally on his own credit line is not relevant to any defence to his drawing down on his Credit Facility. The issue was, rather, one of his credibility.

</div> The payments continued, however, well past any period of stupor, and long after he returned to Kuala Lumpur, with regularity and consistency. I find it difficult to believe that Mr Lee would pay large sums with such regularity to RWS if he had indeed believed from the outset that he was not liable under the Credit Agreements. Mr Lee explained that he made these payments for the three reasons: he did not want to make it difficult for Mr Lim or affect his relationship and reputation with RWS or other parties in the gambling industry; he did not want his reputation as businessman to be affected; and he did not want his family to worry.

</div> His concerns to avoid harming his business reputation and to avoid causing worry to his family do not gel with him eventually deciding to contest the validity of the Credit Agreements, which would (and did) expose himself to a public lawsuit. His primary explanation, his concern for Mr Lim, is also not credible. Under cross-examination, Mr Lee was not able to explain how a potential claim by RWS against him would “make it difficult for Mr Lim”, given that Mr Lim did not guarantee his debt. Certainly Mr Lim saw no difficulty. Mr Lee’s own evidence on cross-examination was that Mr Lim told Mr Lee not to pay RWS when he mentioned the matter to Mr Lee about one year after the debt arose. Mr Lim’s advice, he testified, was “[d]on’t pay”.

Indeed, this letter was drafted in the comfort of his own office with the help of an engineer employed by him.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 None of these contentions are persuasive. Dato’ Sri Joseph’s loss of employment would not be significant to him because they were not close. Regarding the threat of legal action, it follows as a matter of logic that a creditor who is owed money would threaten to sue. A creditor’s determination to take action as entitled is therefore not illegitimate pressure as Mr Lee suggests, and does not explain why Mr Lee would take on a liability that he does not believe he owes. Lastly, if he had wanted legal advice, he could also have taken such advice after 22 August 2010. Mr Lee was aware that he owed a debt to RWS and Dato’ Sri Joseph asked to meet him regarding its settlement. There was nothing so new in the documents that was a surprise that he could not anticipate in the run up to 8 January 2015 such that he would have been unable to obtain legal advice on the matter.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I should mention that Mr Lee initially attempted to contend, on the same facts, that he signed the Settlement Agreement under economic duress. It is settled law that to establish economic duress, a plaintiff must show pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim, and that such pressure exerted was illegitimate: Andrew Phang Boon Leong (gen ed), <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) at para 12.008. It is also settled law that a threat to enforce one’s legal rights do not amount to duress, where the threat was made bona fide, and was not manifestly frivolous or vexatious: <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 8, at [42]. On the first day of trial, counsel for Mr Lee dropped this defence on the excuse that this was in response to a clarification by RWS that it was not relying on the Settlement Agreement to establish Mr Lee’s liability to RWS.

In fact, it was clear by the point at which Mr Lee filed his AEIC that the defence of economic duress was clearly unsustainable, even on Mr Lee’s version of the facts. Notwithstanding, the fact remained that it was incumbent on Mr Lee to explain his contradictory behaviour in signing the Settlement Agreement in the light of his argument that the Credit Agreements were voidable. This he wholly failed to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On a related note, Mr Lee made 12 more payments after signing the Handwritten Letter and Settlement Agreement.

I immediately told the bank to stop payment on the Cheque.  Mr Joseph then called me, and demanded that I make immediate payment as agreed to under the Alleged Settlement Agreement. I was incredibly upset and surprised. <span class="font-italic">I reminded Mr Joseph of the agreement and assurances that the Plaintiff would ask me before presenting any of the Cheques for payment. I also reminded Mr Joseph that I had been making periodic payments in the manner that had been agreed, and no one had raised any issues</span>. Mr Joseph then said that I had to follow what I had signed. I shouted at Mr Joseph that I had never agreed to such a thing, <span class="font-italic">and that Mr Joseph had gone against what we had expressly agreed</span>. Mr Joseph then said that if I did not make payment in accordance with the Alleged Settlement Agreement, the Plaintiff would commence legal action against me. I told him that the Plaintiff could go ahead, and that I refused to make any further payments. I had by this time engaged a lawyer in Malaysia, who after hearing my account of the events had advised me to not make any further payments to the Plaintiff. From that point onwards, I did not make any more payments to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Mr Lee’s point, in this part of his AEIC was simply that <span class="font-italic">RWS had not asked him before presenting the cheque for payment</span>, and that RWS would not take action so long as he continued making periodic payments. <span class="font-italic">His</span><span class="font-italic"> quarrel as framed in his AEIC was not regarding the validity of the Credit Agreements</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Mr Lee’s silence on the validity of the Credit Agreements was also conceded in his cross-examination:

At this point, Mr Lee expressed his shock to the employee whose name he does not remember, informing him that he had not gambled nor drawn down on the Credit Facility.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 These protestations are nevertheless insufficient to amount to rescission, because considering the factual context as a whole, they did not amount to an unequivocal demonstration of an intention to disaffirm the transaction. Nor did Mr Lee rely on them as acts amounting to rescission in his closing submission. They were simply feeble and half-hearted complaints, not put, at any time, into written form, and not unequivocal, because Mr Lee made continued payments to RWS at the same time. Despite telling Dato’ Sri Joseph he had been intoxicated at the time he signed the Credit Agreements, Mr Lee signed the Handwritten Letter and the Settlement Agreement. Subsequently, he failed to state his position. When RWS sent him their letter of demand dated 23 September 2015, he did not reply to assert his rescission, even though he was legally advised by then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is quite clear, therefore, that there was no act of rescission.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">   Mr Lee’s closing submissions dated 9 May 2018 at para 16(b).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Lee premised this submission on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lanjani</span> [1985] Ch 475 (“<span class="font-italic">Peyman</span>”). Peyman was considered in <span class="font-italic">Strait Colonies</span>, and the Court of Appeal declined to follow the decision, choosing instead to confine it to its “unusual” facts – that the plaintiff was helpless because he was an Iranian who spoke no English: see <span class="font-italic">Strait Colonies</span> at [55]–[60]. As the Court of Appeal explained at [61], the “position that knowledge of one’s legal rights is required for affirmation could lead to unfairness if the [party at fault] is allowed to hide behind his ignorance of the law and to choose deliberately not to seek legal advice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Strait Colonies</span>, a landlord commenced an action against a tenant over certain units in a shopping mall. In its defence, the tenant asserted that the landlord had misrepresented that the units could be used for the purposes of operating a pub, bar, and club with live entertainment. This was because the landlord had failed to obtain the requisite permission for such uses from the relevant authorities: see <span class="font-italic">Strait Colonies </span>at [1]. The landlord succeeded in its action at first instance as Chua Lee Ming J found that the tenant had affirmed the contract after discovering the misrepresentations. The tenant appealed to the Court of Appeal, but was unsuccessful. In upholding the High Court’s decision, the Court of Appeal observed that while the landlord had misrepresented to the tenant that certain premises could be used for entertainment purposes, there was no evidence that the tenant had made any qualification when subsequently entering into the lease agreement, taking possession of the relevant premises, commencing business there, or paying rent, even though it was open to the tenant to do so: see <span class="font-italic">Strait Colonies</span> at [44]–[45]. As a result, the Court of Appeal took the view that the tenant had affirmed the lease agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Hyundai Construction Co Ltd (The Atlantic Baron)</span> [1979] 1 QB 705, Mocatta J held that a shipbuilding company’s threat to break a contract without any legal justification unless the ship owners increased their payments by 10 per cent amounted to economic duress. However, by making further payments under the contract without protest, and delaying for about seven months before making a claim for the return of the extra payments, the ship owners had, through their conduct, affirmed the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, Mr Lee did affirm the Credit Agreements by making payments over a five-year period, followed by his signing the Settlement Agreement, and thereafter continuing to make payments on the premise of the settlement. Such conduct is consistent with affirmation, and wholly inconsistent with rescission. As was said by Kelly CB in more traditional language in <span class="font-italic">Mat</span><span class="font-italic">thews v Baxter</span> (1873) LR 8 Exch 132 at p. 133, “… if a drunken man, upon coming to his senses, ratifies the contract, I think he is bound by it”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Are the Credit Agreements void under the CLA?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I come then to Mr Lee’s second broad argument, that s 5 of the CLA renders the Credit Agreements void because RWS did not comply with the Regulations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 5 of the CLA states that “[a]ll contracts or agreements… by way of gaming or wagering shall be null and void”. Section s 40 of the CCA (the version in force in August 2010) disapplies s 5 of the CLA in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Certain contracts in relation to gaming valid and enforceable</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40. Section 5(1) and (2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) shall not apply in relation to –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) any contract entered into with a casino operator or his agent for the playing in the casino of a game that is conducted by or on behalf of the casino operator or his agent, as the case may be, at any time while the casino licence is in force;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) any contract entered into with a casino operator or his agent for the use of a gaming machine in the casino, at any time while the casino licence is in force; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">any contract for any transaction permitted under section 108, at any time while the casino licence is in force.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Mr Lee argues that s 40(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is inapplicable in this case because RWS failed to comply with s 108 of the CCA.

I begin by considering regulation 6, which allows the provision of credit to patrons only if the patrons <span class="font-italic">request</span> for it: <span class="font-italic">supra</span> [62]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 RWS points to the fact that Mr Lee requested credit by signing the Credit Agreement on 20 August 2018. He also signed a promissory note, which served as collateral for the credit which he would draw down on. He then received $5 million worth of chips and signed the First Credit Marker acknowledging receipt of those chips. In relation to the credit facility obtained on 22 August 2010, RWS relies upon the fact that Mr Lee requested for another $5 million worth of credit by signing the Amendment Form. He then received another $5 million in chips and signed the Second Credit Marker acknowledging receipt of those chips. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Mr Lee argues that there was no prior request for credit. His factual case could be summarised as follows: first, he did not orally request the chips; second, RWS staff persistently pressed him to sign documents and take chips; he was so intoxicated that he was not able to understand what he was signing; he was told that if he did not gamble, he would not have to pay; and lastly, he did not gamble. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I start with Mr Lee’s contention that he did not make an oral request and signed the Request Form and Amendment Form because of Mr Tan’s persuasion. In my view, what regulation 6 prohibits is the provision of credit without any request of the patron. In other words, a patron making a request in some form is mandatory prior to the provision of credit. There is nothing, however, that prohibits a written request that is made after an approach by staff. It bars unsolicited credit, not solicited requests for credit. By signing the Request Form and the Amendment Form, he made requests for credit on 20 and 22 August. A similar approach was taken by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ong Boon Lin Lester </span>[2013] 4 SLR 593 (see [65]-–[67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It follows then that the only way his request would have been vitiated, is in the event that he had been so drunk that he did not understand the fact that he was signing a request for credit. I have dealt with this contention above, and found that he was not so drunk as not to have understood the nature and effect of the Credit Agreements. He also conceded in cross-examination that Mr Tan broadly explained the documents to him. The following passage in his cross-examination on the transaction on 20 August 2010 and his receipt of chips of $5 million is extremely informative:

Misrepresentation was neither pleaded nor alleged. His contentions, in any event, were unbelievable in the light of the fact that he knew he received $10 million worth of chips. He would have been aware that by signing the Credit Agreements, he became responsible for the chips, whether it was he or the others in his group who used them. In my judgment, it is clear that Mr Lee requested for credit by signing the Credit Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I deal next with regulation 12. Mr Lee’s case is that RWS breached this regulation, because RWS had, contrary to paragraph 2.A.1.1 of its Credit Policy, failed to ensure that proper checks were conducted before the Credit Agreements were filled up. This reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A1.1 Application Approval</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a.

Again, allegations were made about Mr Tan on this issue. As I have found that Mr Lee was not intoxicated and that he had also requested for credit, the only contention remaining, and which I shall deal with here, is whether the RWS representative had acted properly in recommending Mr Lee for credit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The internal recommendation was made by Yap Ee Lim (“Mr Yap”), RWS’s director of business development. Mr Yap’s signature appears at the top right of the Request Form, under the heading “for internal use only”. Through signing the Request Form, Mr Yap recommended that Mr Lee be provided credit of up to $5 million. The following paragraph appears above his signature on the Request Form:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I believe the information contained herein supports the credit limit requested. I also believe that this customer will repay the credit granted in accordance with the terms stated herein. I will be responsible for assisting in the collection of any outstanding balances associated with this recommendation. This customer has been made aware of the collection policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Mr Lee takes issue with the fact that Mr Yap was, on his own account, not familiar with Mr Lee, and signed the Request Form only because Mr Tan had told him to. In other words, Mr Yap had not seen the results of any credit searches conducted on Mr Lee, and did not otherwise have first-hand knowledge of Mr Lee’s background when he made the recommendation.

</div> Mr Lee further highlights that on RWS’s own case, the credit and background checks would be conducted by its credit department, which would hand the results over to the marketing department. However, the only communication between the two departments tendered by the plaintiff is an email from the credit department to the marketing department, setting out the credit background check of Mr Lee.

</div> Pertinently, the email is dated 29 September 2010, more than a month after the Request Form was signed. In the circumstances, Mr Yap could not have relied on the credit department to highlight any issues with Mr Lee, because its findings were only brought to the attention of the marketing department more than a month after the event. Thus, Mr Yap signed the Request Form without having reviewed the credit department’s findings, in breach of the Credit Policy.

This assertion was not, however, put to any of RWS’s witnesses, including Ms Tan. It was the unchallenged evidence of Ms Tan that before Mr Lee drew down the Credit Facility on 20 August 2010, the signed Request Form was passed to the credit department for the following checks to be conducted:

</div> but, as it were, there were none. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I am of the view, therefore, that the requirements specified in regulations 6 and 12 have been met. Mr Lee had made written requests for credit. Thereafter, RWS carried out various credit searches pursuant to its policy prior to granting his requests. There was no breach of the statutory provisions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effect of non-compliance  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 RWS further submits that any breach of the Regulations would not by itself confer on Mr Lee a private law cause of action. RWS premises this submission on two cases, the first of which is <span class="font-italic">X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</span> [1995] 2 AC 633 (“<span class="font-italic">X (Minors)</span>)”. In that case, local authorities breached their statutory duties by failing to protect certain children who were at risk. The question before the House of Lords was “whether, if Parliament had imposed a statutory duty on an authority to carry out a particular function, a plaintiff who has suffered damage in consequence of the authority’s performance or non-performance of that function has a right of action in damages against the authority”: see p 730. Their Lordships held, at p 731, that a breach of a statutory duty would only give rise to a private law cause of action only if “as a matter of construction of the statute, that statutory duty was imposed for the protection of a limited class of the public and that Parliament intended to confer on members of that class a private right of action for breach of the duty”. Applying this test, their Lordships concluded that the local authorities did not owe a duty of care to the claimants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 That holding in <span class="font-italic">X (Minors)</span> was applied by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 788 (“<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>”), the other case relied on by RWS. In <span class="font-italic">Skandavanviska</span>, the plaintiff sought to premise its negligence claim on the defendant’s breach of s 199(2A) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), which obliges every public company (and its subsidiaries) to maintain a system of internal accounting controls to safeguard its assets. Ang J, in rejecting the plaintiff’s arguments, held that the plaintiff did not fall within the limited class intended to be protected under s 199(2A), nor was there any indication that Parliament intended to arm those within the limited class with a civil remedy against the company for breach of that statutory duty: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span> at [212].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In my view, the present case is different in context from <span class="font-italic">X (Minors)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>. In those cases, the plaintiffs sought compensation for the defendants’ breach of statutory duty. This is not the case here. Mr Lee does not seek compensation from RWS for its alleged breach of the Regulations. What he argues is that their breach renders any contracts effected to be void. This is because: (1) s 5 of the CLA lays down the general rule that gaming contracts are void; (2) this rule is subject to exceptions; (3) the exception relied on by RWS does not apply because the conditions set out in the Regulations were not complied with; and (4) the Credit Agreements are thus void under s 5 of the CLA. Mr Lee does not rely on the purported breaches as a direct basis for a claim; he merely relies on them show that the agreements are unenforceable under the CLA. It would perhaps have been appropriate to consider the application of <span class="font-italic">Ochroid</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Ltd and another v Chua Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 363 (“<span class="font-italic">Ochroid</span>”), where the Court of Appeal dealt with the doctrine of illegality and public policy in the context of contracts prohibited by statute. But as neither counsel argued the point, I do not deal with it here. In any case, it is unnecessary for me to do so given my findings on regulations 6 and 12.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Mr Lee’s defences having failed, I dismiss his counterclaim.
