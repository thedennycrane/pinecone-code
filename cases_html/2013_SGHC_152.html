        Tay Yong Kwang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the Prosecution against
                    the sentences meted out to the Accused (“the Respondent”) by the
                    District Judge (“DJ”) in respect of four charges of harassment
                    with property damage. The Respondent committed the offences on behalf of an
                    unlicensed moneylender, such offences being punishable under s 28(2)(<em>a</em>) read with s 28(3)(<em>b</em>)(i)
                    of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“Harassment
                    Charges”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the appeal, I allowed the
                    Prosecution’s appeal. I now set out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent, now 38 years old, stood as a
                    guarantor for his friend, “Eric”, to borrow money from three
                    unlicensed moneylenders. A few weeks later, “Eric” disappeared and
                    the unlicensed moneylenders harassed the Respondent for repayment. As the
                    Respondent was left to bear “Eric’s” debts, he started to
                    take loans ranging from $500 to $1000 from other unlicensed moneylenders in
                    order to pay off the existing debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in early 2012, the Respondent took a
                    $500 loan from an unlicensed moneylender known as “Paul” as he
                    needed cash urgently. Thereafter, whenever the Respondent needed cash urgently,
                    he contacted “Paul” and obtained new loans from him. Sometime in
                    mid July 2012, the Respondent was unable to repay “Paul”.
                    “Paul” offered the Respondent the job of a “runner”,
                    which included splashing paint at borrowers’ flats and scrawling
                    “O$P$” at staircase walls. The Respondent was promised $70 for
                    each unit which was harassed, with such payments to be used to set off the
                    Respondent’s outstanding debts with “Paul”. The Respondent
                    agreed and started working for “Paul” sometime in late July
                    2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent also borrowed from an unlicensed
                    moneylender named “James”. In May 2012, he was unable to repay the
                    loan. “James” told the Respondent that his flat would be harassed
                    unless he opened a bank account for the use of his unlicensed moneylending
                    business. The Respondent agreed to open a bank account and did so on 5 May 2012.
                    He passed the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card and Personal Identification
                    Number (PIN) linked to the account to “James”. This formed the
                    subject matter of the charge of assisting “James” in the carrying
                    on of the business of money-lending punishable under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) read with s 14(1A)(<em>a</em>) of the Moneylenders Act (“Assisting Moneylender
                        Charge”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 21 August 2012 at about 2.17am, one Zakaria
                    Bin Osman called the police stating that “There is a Chinese man wearing
                    grey T-shirt and black bermudas with spectacle just open his bag and write
                    something on the wall”, giving the location as Block 17 Hougang Ave 3.
                    The police arrived and managed to arrest the Respondent at the void deck of the
                    said block of flats after a short chase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Respondent was found with the following
                    items:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     One bag;</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_i"></a>(i)     One bottle of WD40 – stain
                    remover;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_j"></a>(j)     One Nokia
                        hand-phone;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_k"></a>(k)     One
                        piece of paper with entries;</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_m"></a>(m)     One can of used paint in a yellow plastic
                    bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Respondent consented to seven other charges
                    of harassment on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender (by splashing paint and
                    writing loan shark related graffiti) to be taken into consideration for
                    sentencing purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Respondent pleaded guilty before the DJ to
                    the following charges:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The punishments provided for the Harassment

                    fine between $5,000 and $50,000 in amount and caning with three to six strokes.
                    The DJ sentenced the Respondent to seven months’ imprisonment and three
                    strokes of the cane for each of the four Harassment Charges<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and to one month’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DJ ordered two of the imprisonment terms
                    for the Harassment Charges to run consecutively. The aggregate sentence was

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The

                        committed the offences due to unforeseen financial difficulties that were
                        not of his own doing. He was a victim of circumstances spiralling beyond his
                        control. Specifically, the Respondent had helped a friend by standing as the
                        guarantor but the friend ‘turned out to be wholly unworthy and
                        disappeared’. Further, as a dutiful son, he had to foot the medical
                        bills of his sickly parents which further added to his financial
                        woes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     He
                        pleaded guilty and was remorseful;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     His employers were willing to re-employ him after his
                        period of incarceration; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     He was unlikely to reoffend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The DJ highlighted that in <em>Ong Chee Eng </em><em>v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2012] 3 SLR 776 (“<em>Ong Chee Eng</em>”) at
                    [39], the High Court had observed that a “discount ought to have been
                    given by the District Judge for the charges that dealt only with the splashing
                    of the paint and the writing on the walls”. Further, the DJ noted that it
                    was highlighted in <em>Ong Chee Eng</em> (at [10]) that
                    deterrence was just one aspect of a sophisticated and holistic solution. Hence,
                    in the DJ’s view, the 12-month benchmark sentence laid down in <em>Public Prosecutor v Nelson Jeyaraj s/o Chandran</em> [2011] 2
                    SLR 1130 (“<em>Nelson Jeyaraj</em>”) was not
                    meant to be a hard and fast rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The DJ also observed that the courts have not
                    indiscriminately imposed 12 months’ imprisonment as seen in the cases of
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Chiah Khing</em> [2012]
                    SGDC 35 (“<em>Tan Chiah Khing</em>”) and
                    Public <em>Prosecutor v Abdullah Bin Abdul Rahman</em>
                    [2011] SGDC 380 (“<em>Abdullah Bin Abdul
                    Rahman</em>”). In <em>Tan Chiah Khing</em>,
                    the offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and the
                    Prosecution’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court. In
                        <em>Abdullah Bin Abdul Rahman</em>, the offender, who
                    stood as a guarantor for a friend and committed the offences after his friend
                    disappeared, was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment and three strokes
                    of the cane on each of the harassment charges. On appeal, the imprisonment
                    sentence was enhanced to seven months for each of the harassment
                charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Prosecution urged this court to enhance
                    the individual sentences of seven months’ imprisonment and three strokes
                    of the cane for the Harassment Charges as these were manifestly inadequate. The
                    usual tariff for such offences committed in similar circumstances was between
                    nine and 12 months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane. The
                    Prosecution submitted that the individual sentences for the Harassment Charges
                    should be enhanced to 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Prosecution argued that the sentences
                    imposed for the Harassment Charges were manifestly inadequate because the DJ had
                    erred in fact and in law by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Failing to give sufficient weight to
                        the need for general deterrence with regard to the nature of such offences
                        and Parliament’s clear intent to take a tougher stance against
                        loanshark related offences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Failing to give sufficient weight to the need for
                        specific deterrence and placing undue weight on the Respondent’s
                        personal circumstances;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Failing to adequately appreciate the distinguishing
                        elements between this case and the cases relied on by the DJ to justify
                        departure from the benchmark sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     Failing to give adequate consideration to sentencing
                        precedents exhibiting similar facts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     Failing to give due weight to the aggravating
                        factors in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Prosecution also pointed out the following
                    aggravating factors here:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The offences were premeditated as
                        opposed to being carried out on the spur of the moment. The Respondent had
                        gone to the victims’ units equipped with paint and markers for
                        carrying out the acts of harassment. Further, the Respondent knowingly
                        worked for at least two different loan sharks; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Respondent went to six different
                        locations all over Singapore (Hougang, Yishun, Ang Mo Kio and Pasir Ris) to
                        carry out the acts of harassment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Respondent did not provide any documentary
                    evidence for his claims of financial hardship in his plea of mitigation. Even if
                    those claims were true, the financial difficulties faced by the Respondent
                    hardly amounted to such exceptional circumstances that warranted significant
                    weight to be placed on them as a mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Finally, in one of the Harassment Charges, the
                    Respondent went so far as to splash paint on the unit adjacent to the
                    debtor’s unit, thereby causing needless annoyance and distress to the
                    debtor’s neighbour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent, who was legally represented
                    before the DJ but not before me, made the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Respondent argued that, as
                        pointed out by the DJ, it was clearly not meant to be a “hard and
                        fast rule” that 12 months’ imprisonment was the “usual
                        benchmark” for harassment cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     He emphasized the circumstances in which he had
                        resorted to the borrowing of money from loan sharks, namely, the fact that
                        he had exhausted all legal avenues to raise funds and, when faced with his
                        family’s emergencies, he really had no choice but to turn to loan
                        sharks. He stated that he belonged to “those, who, out of genuinely
                        desperate financial need brought about by events not within their control
                        (eg. sudden sickness and prolonged retrenchment) borrow from loan sharks
                        whom they are then forced to work for ...” (<em>Ong
                            Chee Eng</em> at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Respondent stated that he splashed paint on
                        others’ homes unwillingly after the loan sharks became aggressive,
                        phoned him at his office, threatened to harass his colleagues and to make
                        him lose his job. His health also suffered due to the long-term
                        stress.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     He
                        asked the Court to show compassion towards him and maintain the sentence
                        given by the DJ. This was because he had aged and sickly parents to care for
                        and he was remorseful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The present case presents an opportunity to
                    elaborate on the benchmark sentence for non-fire harassment cases with resultant
                    property damage under the Moneylenders Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parliament’s approach towards loan shark offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Parliament’s approach towards loan shark
                    offences is clear - it has prescribed mandatory imprisonment and caning for even
                    first-time offenders. Hence, in the light of the severity of the mandatory
                    sentences, Parliament’s intention is clearly to strongly deter the
                    commission of loan shark offences: <em>Ong Chee Eng</em> at
                    [10].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Benchmark sentence for non-fire harassment cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Nelson
                        Jeyaraj</em>, the High Court (at [47]) stated that the benchmark
                    sentence for non-fire harassment cases with property damage is 12 months’
                    imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The High Court in <em>Ong Chee
                        Eng</em> (at [14] and [18]) grouped accused persons into two
                    categories: the first category consists of those who turn to loan sharks not to
                    pay off their gambling debts but because of genuinely desperate needs such as
                    sudden sickness and prolonged retrenchment (<b>“</b>genuine financial need” category).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The second category consists of those less
                    deserving of sympathy such as youth harassers lured by the easy money and the
                    thrill and gamblers who harass for the easy money they can obtain to repay their
                    gambling debts (“greed and self-interest” category).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Although the offender in <em>Ong Chee Eng</em> fell into the “genuine financial
                    need” category, the High Court did not depart from the benchmark sentence
                    of 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. However, it did
                    state that a small discount of one to two months could have been given where
                    steps had been taken by the offender to minimize damage. The High Court gave 12
                    months’ imprisonment and three strokes for each of the non-fire harassment
                    charges and 16 months’ imprisonment and three strokes for each of the fire
                    harassment charges. One of the non-fire harassment charges and three of the fire
                    harassment charges were ordered to run consecutively making the total sentence
                    60 months’ imprisonment and the maximum 24 strokes of the
                cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The High Court in <em>Ong Chee
                        Eng</em> therefore left undisturbed the 12-month imprisonment term and
                    three strokes of the cane for each of the non-fire harassment charges involving
                    property damage. In the same vein, although the Respondent here belonged to the
                    “genuine financial need” category – as he claimed he needed
                    money for his parents’ hospitalisation bills and was a guarantor turned
                    debtor turned harasser – there was no reason why the benchmark sentence of
                    12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for non-fire harassment
                    cases with property damage should not apply to his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Respondent also appeared to have been in a
                    better financial position compared with the offender in <em>Ong
                        Chee Eng</em>. While both of them became involved with loan sharks
                    after they had guaranteed their friends’ loans, the Respondent here was
                    still working and drawing a monthly salary of $2,500 at the time of the
                    commission of the Harassment Charges. In contrast, the offender in <em>Ong Chee Eng</em> was retrenched and had to go to the extent
                    of selling his HDB flat to try to repay the loans but even that proved to be
                    insufficient for the repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The offender in <em>Ong Chee
                        Eng</em> had also confessed to the majority of the charges that were
                    brought against him and which the police would otherwise have been unable to pin
                    on him. In contrast, the Respondent was caught red-handed with the addresses of
                    the flats that he was instructed to harass still stored in the SMS inbox of his
                    mobile phone. These formed the subject-matter of the charges that were preferred
                    against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Distinguishing the cases cited by the DJ that departed from the
                benchmark sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The cases relied upon by the DJ that departed
                    from the benchmark sentence –
                    <em>Abdullah Bin Abdul Rahman</em> and <em>Tan Chiah Khing</em> – could be distinguished from the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Abdullah Bin Abdul
                        Rahman</em>, the 49-year-old offender was sentenced by the district
                    judge in that case to eight weeks’ imprisonment with three strokes of the
                    cane for each of the harassment charges with property damage. On appeal, the
                    High Court increased the sentence to seven months’ imprisonment and three
                    strokes of the cane for each of those charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     While no written grounds of decision were
                    given for that case, it should be noted that the offender had been released on 3
                    December 2011 (after remission of sentence). He could not be located to attend
                    the hearing of the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence, originally fixed
                    on 31 January 2012. By the time he was present in court for the hearing of the
                    appeal on 3 October 2012, it had been some ten months after his release from
                    prison. In those circumstances, the Prosecution conceded before the High Court
                    that a sentencing discount could be given to the offender, in view of the
                    hardship that would be caused to him if his sentence were to be increased to the
                    benchmark of 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. In
                    contrast, there were no such peculiar facts in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Further, the offender there was approaching 50
                    years of age and had recently undergone heart surgery to insert a stent, as he
                    had purportedly suffered a heart attack whilst committing an act of harassment.
                    In the present case, the Respondent was a healthy 37-year-old at the time of the
                    offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Tan Chiah
                        Khing</em>, the accused was sentenced to six months’
                    imprisonment for the charge of non-fire harassment with property damage on
                    behalf of an unlicensed moneylender. The offender there faced only one count
                    each of non-fire harassment with property damage and assisting in unlicensed
                    moneylending. In contrast, the Respondent faced four Harassment Charges and one
                    charge of assisting a moneylender, with seven similar charges of harassment
                    taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The district judge in <em>Tan
                        Chiah Khing</em> took into consideration the following factors in
                    departing from the benchmark sentence: the offender was above 50 years old and
                    not in good health and the offences were committed within a period of two days.
                    However, these factors do not apply in the present case to the healthy and then
                    37-year-old Respondent who committed the offences over a longer period of time
                    of about five weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In other cases with unusual circumstances,
                    custodial sentences below the 12-month benchmark have been meted out. For
                    example, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kalaiselvan
                        Subramaniam</em> (DAC 30535/2012 &amp; another), the offender was
                    sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment as he was suffering from
                    schizophrenia at the material time. In the present case, I did not find that the
                    Respondent’s personal background amounted to such unusual circumstances as
                    to warrant a discount in the benchmark sentence with regard to the Harassment
                    Charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discount in sentence when steps are taken to minimise damage caused
                to property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     A small discount of one to two months to the
                    benchmark sentence could be given for non-fire harassment cases when the accused
                    person had taken steps to minimize the damage caused to property (<em>Ong Chee Eng</em> at [39]). For example, the offender in
                        <em>Ong Chee Eng</em> “wrote on the walls with a
                    non-permanent white board marker so the intimidating scrawls could be removed
                    with a wet cloth” (at [8].)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In our present case, there was no evidence
                    before the Court that the Respondent had taken steps to minimize the damage
                    caused to the various flats and their surroundings. In fact, he had even gone to
                    the extent of splashing paint on a debtor’s neighbour’s flat (see
                    further at [39] to [44] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aggravating factor when innocent persons are harassed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In my view, it is an aggravating factor when
                    innocent persons are deliberately targeted and harassed. This could take the
                    form of harassing the debtor’s neighbours or vandalising the flat when the
                    harasser knows that the debtor is no longer residing there. Innocent parties
                    should not be made to suffer the anxiety, frustration and helplessness caused by
                    such acts of harassment. Such indiscriminate acts disturb the peace of mind and
                    sense of well-being of the community by enlarging the area of
                conflict.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Nelson
                        Jeyaraj</em> , the High Court stated that (at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Harassment offences threaten the safety of a considerably
                        wider scope of persons beyond the debtors and/or sureties. <u>Innocent victims are often </u><u>utilised as deliberate targets, not because of any prior association
                            with the </u><u>illegal moneylenders, but
                            because the unlicensed moneylenders and their </u><u>“runners” see them as nothing more than a pawn
                            in order to pressure the </u><u>actual debtors
                            to pay up</u>. At the Second Reading of the 2010 amendment bill
                        which brought the Moneylenders Act to its current form, the Senior Minister
                        of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee) said at col 2051:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<u>Loansharks now increasingly target innocent
                                neighbouring households by </u>
<u>splashing
                                paint on their doors, or on their cars in multi-storey
                                carparks</u>,<u>hoping that peer pressure
                                would force the borrowers to pay up</u>. Indeed, in some
                            instances, knowing that innocent parties are frustrated, loansharks
                            demand that they pay up on behalf of the actual debtors! These acts,
                            though generally non-confrontational in nature and non-life threatening,
                            nevertheless disrupt the community’s sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Mohammad Suhairi Bin Mail</em> [2011] SGDC 31, the district judge
                    imposed higher imprisonment sentences for the harassment of neighbours’
                    units and for securing the main gate, as these were aggravated forms of
                    harassment. He sentenced the offender to 14 months’ imprisonment and three
                    strokes of the cane for each of the two charges of harassing the debtor’s
                    neighbours’ units by writing graffiti and splashing paint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, the Respondent harassed
                    the debtor’s neighbour by splashing paint on the neighbour’s unit.
                    When I asked the Respondent about this incident, he admitted that he knew that
                    he was harassing the debtor’s neighbour before he splashed the paint. He
                    claimed that he was reluctant to do so and had called his boss to express his
                    reservations but was instructed nevertheless to carry out the act of harassment
                    against the neighbour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, the Prosecution in the present case
                    did not seek to make a distinction between the sentences to be meted out for
                    offences involving innocent persons and those involving debtors. It merely used
                    the fact that a neighbouring unit was targeted as a factor to support its
                    arguments that the benchmark should not have been departed from.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In my view, offenders who knowingly harass
                    innocent persons such as debtors’ neighbours ought to be given an
                    imprisonment term of two to three months higher than the benchmark sentence of
                    12 months’ imprisonment. Unlicensed moneylenders and their assistants
                    should not be allowed to treat debtors’ neighbours as mere collateral
                    damage in their unrelenting quest to make debtors pay up. Similarly, offenders
                    in the “greed and self-interest” category could justifiably be
                    given enhanced sentences of three to six months above the said benchmark, with
                    due consideration accorded to their youthfulness and other relevant
                    factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the above reasons, I allowed the
                    Prosecution’s appeal against the sentences imposed by the DJ. In respect
                    of the four Harassment Charges, I ordered the imprisonment terms imposed by the
                    DJ to be enhanced to 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge with the
                    three strokes of the cane for each charge to remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The imprisonment terms for DAC 30189/2012 and
                    DAC 31095/2012 were ordered to run consecutively, with the rest of the
                    imprisonment terms running concurrently with them. The total sentence was
                    therefore 24 months’ imprisonment with effect from 6 March 2013, 12
                    strokes of the cane and a $30,000 fine (in default, 3 weeks’
                    imprisonment).</p>
