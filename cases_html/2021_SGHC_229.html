</div> The parties had, from May 2018 to September 2018, an “amicable working relationship” during which six sale and purchase agreements for gasoil of various quantities, ranging from 9,588.743 metric tons (“MT”) to 13,930.843 MT, were executed without any problems. The plaintiff thus decided “to increase the volume of gasoil to be ordered under the seventh and eighth agreements” dated 8 October 2018 (the “First Contract”) and 19 October 2018 (the “Second Contract”) respectively (collectively, the “Contracts”).

</div> The defendant in turn counterclaimed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for the plaintiff’s breach in its failure and/or refusal to “take delivery of the cargo as agreed”. Instead, the plaintiff “only took delivery of 1,994.862MT of cargo under [the First Contract] on 30 October 2018, and took no further deliveries thereafter”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As will be elaborated below, the defendant subsequently changed tack and proceeded on the basis that the damages, if any, due to the defendant were to be calculated based on s 50(3) of the SOGA instead. Section 50(3) of the SOGA provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been accepted or (if no time was fixed for acceptance) at the time of the refusal to accept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the arbitral proceedings, the plaintiff advanced two arguments relating to the aforementioned issues (the “Arguments”). According to the plaintiff, the defendant “had failed to adduce evidence of actual losses (the “No Actual Losses Argument”)” and “had no goods [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the requisite gasoil to supply] for the majority of the [33-day loading period] and therefore suffered no losses (the “No Goods No Losses Argument”)”.

</div>
</div> In summary, the plaintiff’s No Actual Losses Argument was that the defendant “had failed to adduce evidence of actual losses and accordingly, had not suffered any actual losses despite [the plaintiff’s] breach of contract” and thus claimed for “forecasted” losses which “were never incurred”.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff’s No Goods No Losses Argument was that the defendant “did not have sufficient [g]asoil to supply to [the plaintiff] under the [Contracts] and therefore could not have suffered any losses”. In that regard, the plaintiff argued that the defendant’s own documents “showed that they did not have the necessary goods to meet [the required volume of gasoil] all the way until 24 October, just a week left until the end of the loading period” under the First Contract.

The plaintiff contended that the defendant ought to have mitigated its losses by entering into gasoil hedging contracts on or shortly after 30 October 2018 and 6 November 2018 for the First and Second Contracts respectively, when the defendant had initially denied that there was an available market for the gasoil.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, about a week prior to the evidentiary hearing, the defendant conceded that there was an available market. Thereafter, the question of whether there was an available market was no longer a contentious issue or contemplated in parties’ submissions in the arbitration. Consequently, the issue of hedging became irrelevant and s 50(2) of the SOGA was no longer the focus.

The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had breached Clause 26 of the First Contract by: (a) failing to ensure that its own sale contract with its buyer, Great Sign Ltd (“Great Sign”), regarding the OSLO Parcel contained the same or equivalent Restricted Destination clause (as required by Clause 26.6); and (b) failing to provide documentation verifying the final destination of the OSLO Parcel (in breach of Clause 26.3). Clause 26.8 thus entitled the defendant to an indemnity from the plaintiff for any fines or penalties imposed on it.

As such, the plaintiff sought to adduce expert evidence on whether Clause 26 would survive termination as a matter of industry practice. This forms the contextual backdrop to the second ground of objection which the plaintiff raised in OS 51 (see [19] below). The plaintiff also submitted that, in any case, Clause 26.8 is a compensatory indemnity<span class="font-italic"> </span>and not a preventive indemnity. In that regard, the defendant has not suffered any losses as a result of any alleged breach of Clause 26 which the plaintiff ought to indemnify.

In that regard, an applicant will have to persuade the court that there has been some actual or real prejudice caused by the alleged breach which is “more than technical unfairness” (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>at [91]).

The relevant rule of natural justice that OS 51 is concerned with is encapsulated in the Latin maxim <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”) held, the <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem </span>rule includes an arbitrator bringing his or her mind to bear “on an important aspect of the dispute” (at [46]). In <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46], the Court of Appeal further elaborated that an inference that an arbitrator had “indeed failed to consider an important pleaded issue” will not be drawn readily. The threshold is a <span class="font-italic">very high </span>one – namely, such inference “must be shown to be clear and virtually inescapable” (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]). For example, that threshold would be satisfied where it is undisputed that the arbitration tribunal simply “failed to consider, whether explicitly or implicitly” the arguments “notwithstanding the pleadings … to [that] effect” (<span class="font-italic">BRS v BRQ and another</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 390 at [106]). However, in instances where the arbitrator had “misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case, or having been mistaken as to the law, or having chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary”, such inference should not be drawn (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]). With regard to arguments raised by a party on an issue, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> also stated at [47] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The judge in <span class="font-italic">AQU</span> also considered the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”), and reiterated the proposition that no party to an arbitration had a right to expect the arbitral tribunal to accept its arguments, regardless of how strong and credible it perceived those arguments to be (see <span class="font-italic">AQU</span> at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">TMM</span> at [94]). <span class="font-italic">This principle is important because it points to an important distinction between, on the one hand, an arbitral tribunal’s decision to reject an argument (whether implicitly or otherwise, whether rightly or wrongly, and </span><span class="font-italic">whether or not as a result of its failure to comprehend the argument and so to appreciate its merits), and, on the other hand, the arbitral tribunal’s failure to even consider that argument. Only the latter amounts to a breach of natural justice; the former is an error of law, not a breach of natural justice.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The imposition of such a high threshold by our courts is congruent with the principle of party autonomy, which is the “critical foundational principle in arbitration”. The courts “do not and must not interfere in the merits of an arbitral award and, in the process, bail out parties who have made choices that they might come to regret, or offer them a second chance to canvass the merits of their respective cases” (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [37]). The court does not exercise any appellate jurisdiction over an arbitral tribunal and the grounds for curial intervention are narrowly<span class="font-italic"> </span>circumscribed. As such, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> cautioned (at [39]) that the courts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… must resist the temptation to engage with what is substantially an appeal on the legal merits of an arbitral award, but which, through the ingenuity of counsel, may be disguised and presented as a challenge to process failures during the arbitration. A prime example of this would be a challenge based on an alleged breach of natural justice. When examining such a challenge, it is important that the court assesses the <span class="font-italic">real</span> nature of the complaint. Among the arguments commonly raised in support of breach of natural justice challenges are these:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) that the arbitral tribunal misunderstood the case presented and so did not apply its mind to the actual case of the aggrieved party;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) that the arbitral tribunal did not mention the arguments raised by the aggrieved party and so must have failed to consider the latter’s actual case; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) that the arbitral tribunal must have overlooked a part of the aggrieved party’s case because it did not engage with the merits of that part of the latter’s case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although such arguments may be commonly raised, more often than not, they do not, in fact, amount to breaches of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The foregoing principles, naturally, inform the way in which our courts approach challenges to an award based on a complaint of breach of natural justice. In <span class="font-italic">CDI v CDJ </span>[2020] 5 SLR 484 (“<span class="font-italic">CDI</span>”), which the plaintiff referred to in its submissions, this court distilled some of the pertinent points and I would highlight those summarised at [31(c)]–[31(e)]:

Such reference to the Arguments “only in the latter section” was both “convenient” and “somewhat of an afterthought” by the Arbitrator – it “[did] not mean that the Tribunal had this in mind when dealing with the issues of damages”.

</div> In my view, the reference to putting a party into the “same position it would have been in had performance taken place” demonstrated two things – one, that the Arbitrator had put his mind to considering <span class="font-italic">both </span>the <span class="font-italic">fact </span>of losses suffered as a result of the other party’s breach as well as the <span class="font-italic">measure </span>of such losses, and two, in arriving at that conclusion, the Arbitrator was in effect <span class="font-italic">agreeing</span> with the defendant’s arguments on s 50(3) of the SOGA and its operation.

The plaintiff thus sought to emphasise that the agreement between parties in the arbitral proceedings was for s 50(3) of the SOGA to be used only for calculating the quantum of damages, and not that the defendant had in fact suffered any losses as a result of the plaintiff’s breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the arbitration, the defendant had made the specific submission that the parties’ agreement that there was an available market meant that the s 50(2) measure of damages and the issue of hedging became irrelevant; the defendant also made the argument that neither party was contending that hedging outcomes were relevant to an assessment of damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA. On the basis that there was an available market, the “‘available market’ measure builds in mitigation”, and it did not matter “what the seller <span class="font-italic">actually</span> does with the goods” [emphasis in original] – the assessment of damages under <span class="font-italic">s</span><span class="font-italic"> 50(3)</span> of the SOGA was simply “the differential between the contract and market price.”

I could not quite see how, in substance, a distinction could then be drawn by the plaintiff such that the Arbitrator nevertheless had to also ascertain if a loss was in fact incurred. As I mentioned at [37], it did not appear to me that the Arbitrator regarded s 50(3) of the SOGA as a provision that <span class="font-italic">only</span> dealt with calculating the damages suffered by a seller for a buyer’s non-acceptance of goods sold. If a tribunal had evidence before it of the difference between the contract price and the market or current price at the time when the buyer ought to have accepted the goods, that would, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, be relevant to demonstrating both whether a loss had in fact been incurred and provide the reference points for determining the quantum of such loss suffered.

It may have been an accidental omission on his part to indicate expressly why he was rejecting the submissions since the Adjudicator took care to explain the reasons for his other determinations and even indicated matters on which he was not making a determination. Alternatively, he may have found the points so unconvincing that he thought it was not necessary to explicitly state his findings.

</div> The Arbitrator went on to summarise the parties’ submissions on the issue of mitigating losses, and then reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">164. Year Sun alleges that Gunvor failed to mitigate any losses it might have suffered because it did not sell the undelivered portion of gasoil under the First Contract on 31 October 2018 (being the day after the last day of the loading period) and the gasoil under the Second Contract on 7 November 2018 (being the date after which Year Sun sought to cancel the Second Contract). Year Sun's submissions in this regard rely on well-established authority as to the principles of mitigation of damages. As I set out at paragraph 160 above, <span class="font-weight-bold">there does not appear to be any dispute that the measure of damages to be applied is that set out in section 50(3) of the Sale of Goods Act</span>. However, <span class="font-weight-bold">the effect of Year Sun's submissions as to mitigation is to suggest that such measure is subject to a duty to mitigate</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">165.  <span class="font-weight-bold">Gunvor</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> submits that questions of mitigation are not relevant when assessing damages pursuant to section 50(3) of the Sale of Goods Act because the concept of an available market </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"builds in" </span><span class="font-weight-bold">mitigation, irrespective of what </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Gunvor might actually have done with the cargo</span>, which was an independent speculation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">166. <span class="font-weight-bold">Gunvor's</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> submission is to my mind correct</span>. Section 50(3) provides for a measure of damages enabling an innocent party to be put into the same position it would have been in had performance taken place. Toulson J. (as he then was) summarised the position in <span class="font-italic">Dampskibsselskabet</span><span class="font-italic"> “Norden” A/S v Andre &amp; Cie SA</span> [2003] EWHC 84 Comm:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. The broad principle deducible from the <span class="font-italic">Elena D</span><span class="font-italic">’Amico</span> and the authorities there considered is that where a contract is discharged by reason of one party's breach, and that party's unperformed obligation is of a kind for which there exists an available market in which the innocent party could obtain a substitute contract, <span class="font-weight-bold">the innocent party's loss will</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> ordinarily be measured by the extent to which his financial position would be worse under the substitute contract than under the original contract.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42. <span class="font-weight-bold">The availability of a substitute market enables a market valuation to be made of what the innocent party has lost, and a line thereby to be drawn </span><span class="font-weight-bold">under the transaction.</span> Whether the innocent party thereafter in fact enters into a substitute contract is a separate matter. He has, in effect, a second choice whether to enter the market – similar to the choice which first existed at the time of the original contract, but at the new prevailing rate instead of the contract rate (the difference being the basis of the normal measure of damages). The <span class="font-italic">option</span> to stay out of the market arises from the breach, but it does not follow that there is a causal nexus between the breach and a <span class="font-italic">decision</span> by the innocent part [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]) to stay out of the market, so as to make the guilty party responsible for that decision and its consequences. The guilty party is not liable to the innocent party for the effect of market changes occurring after the innocent party has had a free choice whether to re-enter the market, nor is the innocent party required to give credit to the guilty party for any subsequent market movement in favour of the innocent party.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my judgment, the paragraphs from the Award quoted above demonstrate that the Arbitrator had considered and understood the thrust of the Arguments. In that regard, the Arbitrator did not simply determine the issue on the basis of the parties’ agreement that the measure of damages is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time when the gasoil ought to have been accepted. The Arbitrator had gone further to consider the substance of the Arguments and, in my view, implicitly rejected them by virtue of his acceptance of the defendant’s arguments. Furthermore, the excerpt quoted by the Arbitrator from <span class="font-italic">Dampskibsselskabet</span><span class="font-italic"> “Norden” A/S v Andre &amp; Cie SA</span> (<span class="font-italic">“Norden”</span>) [2003] EWHC 84 Comm, especially the portions I have added emphasis to at [41]–[42] of <span class="font-italic">Norden</span>, show that the Arbitrator was also considering <span class="font-italic">what the defendant’s loss was</span> and not just whether there was mitigation of loss by the defendant.

There was nothing in the arbitration record put into evidence before me that suggested that this specific point or argument was in fact made to the Arbitrator. During the hearing before me, Mr Lee accepted that the point was not made “in such direct language” but argued that there was no need to because many of the opening paragraphs in the plaintiff’s written closing submissions were spent on the general issue of “no actual loss”.

</div> I disagree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Court of Appeal has reminded parties on more than one occasion that they cannot run to the courts to cry foul and contend that there has been a breach of natural justice when they have failed to properly make a point or raise an argument before the tribunal (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another</span> [2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>”) at [168]; <span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span><span class="font-italic"> Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 114 at [67] and [76]; <span class="font-italic">BLC </span><span class="font-italic">and others v BLB and another</span> [2014] 4 SLR 79 at [53]). It is not the court’s role to rescue the parties <span class="font-italic">ex-post facto</span> from strategic decisions made in the course of the arbitration, and this would include decisions made to advance or craft arguments in a certain way before the tribunal. In this case, if the Arguments were as critical to Issue 12(d) as the plaintiff makes them out to be, it was, in my judgment, incumbent that the plaintiff made it clear to the Arbitrator that notwithstanding s 50(3) of the SOGA, there would still be no loss because of the Arguments, and that if the Arguments were accepted, the result would be no or at best nominal damages being awarded to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On the contrary, the Arbitrator was informed that it was common ground between the parties that there was an available market and s 50(3) of the SOGA would, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, apply as the measure of damages. If the Arbitrator could rely on that section without considering any evidence of actual loss and decided to take that path, I did not see how the plaintiff could thereafter complain that the Arbitrator had failed to apply his mind to considering the Arguments. Even if, for the sake of argument, the Arbitrator erred because he did not fully appreciate the true nature of the Arguments as advanced by the plaintiff, or simply misunderstood the plaintiff’s case on this issue or misunderstood how s 50(3) of the SOGA should be applied in light of the Arguments, that would nevertheless <span class="font-italic">still</span> be insufficient to get the plaintiff across the finish line (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [47]). It would, at best, demonstrate an error or errors of law. It is axiomatic that such errors are not subject to challenge before the courts under the guise of a breach of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Additionally, the fact that the Arbitrator did refer specifically to certain aspects of the Arguments in the Award demonstrated, in my view, that the Arbitrator had in mind and did consider the Arguments. The mere fact that no clear or express mention of the Arguments were set out in the relevant part of the Award dealing with the issue of damages or specifically on Issue 12(d) did not, without more, lead to the clear and virtually inescapable inference that the Arbitrator entirely failed to consider Arguments – as I have explained at [41] and [42] above, there could be a number of reasons for that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Arbitrator referred to parts of the No Goods No Loss Argument in another section of the Award which dealt with an issue pertaining to uncertainty of delivery terms under the Contracts. I reproduce those paragraphs below:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90. Year Sun raises two further arguments in response to the provisions of the FOB sale terms. First, it asserts that if Year Sun had nominated vessels for delivery before 30 October 2018, Gunvor in any event did not have gasoil to meet such nominations until 24 October 2018. Second, it asserts that Gunvor required a letter of credit to be issued ten days before any lifting could take place.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91. As to the amount of gasoil available to Gunvor for delivery, a point which Year Sun developed at great length during the evidentiary hearing, this to my mind is irrelevant. All Year Sun had to do was to nominate vessels. If it transpired that Gunvor did not have gasoil to meet its delivery obligations it would have found itself in breach of contract. It is by no means a foregone conclusion that Gunvor could not have performed its delivery obligations, and it is entirely speculative to assume this would have been the case. Whether or not Gunvor would have been able to supply gasoil upon nomination is also irrelevant for the purpose of determining the terms of the Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It can be seen that these paragraphs capture the essence of the No Goods No Loss Argument. The Arbitrator specifically noted that the plaintiff “developed at great length during the evidentiary hearing” the point that the defendant did not have sufficient gasoil available for delivery (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the No Goods No Loss Argument) and that such argument “to [his] mind [was] irrelevant”. Rather, if it transpired that the defendant “did not have gasoil to meet its delivery obligations it would have found itself in breach of contract” but it was by “no means a foregone conclusion that [the defendant] could not have performed its delivery obligations”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The fact that the No Goods No Loss Argument had not been advanced by the plaintiff specifically in relation to the uncertainty of terms issue is of relevance. In my judgment, that was indicative that the Arbitrator was alive to and had applied his mind to the Arguments or aspects of them, not in a silo, but laterally across <span class="font-italic">the entire case</span> where the Arbitrator felt that they might have relevance or more relevance. In my judgment, this is fatal to the plaintiff’s contention that the Arbitrator had completely failed to address his mind to the Arguments. It bears emphasising the very high threshold that a party has to meet to persuade the court that an arbitral tribunal failed to address a material issue (or arguments on such an issue) – the inference has to be clear and <span class="font-italic">virtually</span> <span class="font-italic">inescapable</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]), which means that no other reasonable inference or conclusion could be arrived at. Thus, if it is equally plausible that the tribunal had either implicitly rejected the argument or considered it irrelevant <span class="font-italic">to the issue</span> in relation to which it was advanced, the objection that a breach of natural justice was occasioned will not pass muster. In my judgment, in this case, it could equally be concluded that the Arbitrator either rejected the Arguments implicitly or did not find them convincing, or at all relevant <span class="font-italic">to Issue 12(d)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(reproduced at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 A similar reasoning applies in relation to the Arbitrator’s express reference to the Arguments when dealing with the issue of costs.

It submits that it should be reimbursed its costs in full and that Gunvor should bear its costs in full because Gunvor (a) has wasted Year Sun's time and costs for one and a half years pursuing hopeless and unarguable counterclaims; (b) has suffered no actual loss, and/or did not have goods to supply for the most part of the duration under both Contracts. Year Sun also submits that it acted reasonably in rejecting two sealed offers to settle made by Gunvor, and that Gunvor unreasonably refused to accept Year Sun's own sealed offer to settle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It was common ground that, with consensus of the parties, the drafting of the substantive and costs portions of the Award were undertaken by the Arbitrator at separate times even though the Award as published dealt with the substantive issues and the issue of costs (see [35]). Nevertheless, that does not mean that the court should not read the Award as a whole. When so read, the picture that emerges is that express reference was made by the Arbitrator to the Arguments or aspects of them in <span class="font-italic">several</span> parts of the Award, even if not specifically under the issue of damages. Mr Lee submitted that the Arbitrator’s summary of the Arguments in the costs section of the Award was merely an afterthought and only in response to costs submissions that had been made by the plaintiff where the Arguments had been mentioned. That did not mean, according to Mr Lee, that the Arbitrator had addressed his mind to the Arguments on the issue of damages.

</div> Even if there was a breach, there was no prejudice occasioned by such breach. The defendant highlighted that the plaintiff “did have the opportunity to convince the Tribunal that Clause 26 did not survive the termination of the First Contract, and in fact fully exercised that opportunity”. As the issue was one of construction of the First Contract which, in turn, was based on ascertaining the parties’ intentions as to the scope of Clause 26, expert evidence on industry practice could have “no bearing on the issue”.

</div> In that case, the arbitrator directed that “there would be no witnesses presented at the hearing” and only allowed the hearing “<span class="font-italic">for oral </span><span class="font-italic">submissions only</span>” [emphasis in original] (at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is well established that Article 18 of the Model Law, while providing that each party shall have a “full opportunity” of presenting its case, is understood to mean that each party has a right to have a reasonable<span class="font-italic"> </span>opportunity to present its case (<span class="font-italic">ADG and another v ADI another matter</span> [2014] 3 SLR 481 (“<span class="font-italic">ADG</span>”) at [104]). The “full opportunity” to present one’s case is “not an unlimited one and must be balanced against considerations of reasonableness, efficiency and fairness” (<span class="font-italic">CBS </span>at [50]; <span class="font-italic">ADG </span>at [105]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 What amounts to a reasonable opportunity to be heard is, in turn, an intensely factual inquiry. The court’s concern is whether the proceedings were “conducted in a fair manner” (<span class="font-italic">CBS </span>at [51]). Ultimately, the overarching enquiry is whether “what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done” (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In applying this test, the court assesses the tribunal’s decision with reference to “<span class="font-italic">what was known to the tribunal at the material time</span>” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [99]). Furthermore, the court accords a “margin of deference to the tribunal in its exercise of procedural discretion” precisely because an arbitration tribunal “possesses a wide discretion to determine the arbitral procedure” and such discretion “is exercised within a highly specific and fact-intensive contextual milieu, the finer points of which the court may not be privy to” (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [103]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The foregoing principles are particularly apposite to a party’s conduct <span class="font-italic">during </span>the arbitral proceedings and, in particular, with regard to procedural issues that may arise in the course of the arbitration. The Court of Appeal has made it clear that if a party “intends to contend that there has been a fatal failure in the process of the arbitration, then there <span class="font-italic">must</span> be fair intimation to the tribunal that the complaining party intends to take that point at the appropriate time if the tribunal insists on proceeding” [emphasis in original]. If a party so alleges that there has been such a fatal process failure and its hopes for a fair hearing have thereby been “irretrievably dashed by the acts of the tribunal”, then it “cannot simply ‘reserve’ its position until after the award and if the result turns out to be palatable to it, not pursue the point, or if it were otherwise to then take the point” (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [168], [170]). As this court observed in <span class="font-italic">CAI v CAJ</span> [2021] SGHC 21 at [2], if an aggrieved party equivocates or keeps silent on the manner in which the arbitral proceedings are conducted only to raise objections subsequently in a setting aside application, such conduct would be viewed unfavourably by the court as an illegitimate attempt by that party to hedge its position. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My analysis and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Bearing these principles in mind, I conclude that there was no breach of natural justice occasioned by the Arbitrator’s decision to exclude expert evidence on Clause 26. The Arbitrator’s decision was reasoned and arrived at after considering the arguments raised by both parties. The manner in which the Arbitrator dealt with the application and issued his ruling on the plaintiff’s application could not in any way be described as irrational or capricious. The Arbitrator’s decision to disallow the plaintiff’s application to tender expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue was well within the ambit of the wide discretionary powers of the Arbitrator to determine matters pertaining to procedure and evidence, as well as the deference given to arbitrators on such matters. Nor could it be said that what the Arbitrator did fell outside the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Further, there was no objection raised by the plaintiff to the Arbitrator’s decision which was rendered on 9 January 2020. Mr Lee referred me to an email sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors to the Arbitrator on 16 January 2020, where the plaintiff indicated that it “will comply, <span class="font-italic">but under protest</span>, with [the Arbitrator’s decision rendered on 9 January 2020] (with compulsive force) for exchange of expert evidence, which has shifted from a full simultaneous exchange, which was Parties’ longstanding agreement since the procedural architecture was fixed, to a part-simultaneous-part-sequential one” [emphasis added]. In this regard, the plaintiff indicated its “rights are respectfully reserved”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I disagreed with the plaintiff that this purported reservation of rights was adequate; on the contrary, it was clear to me that it was in fact woefully inadequate. I say this for several reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, the plaintiff’s purported reservation of rights was <span class="font-italic">not</span> in fact directed at the Arbitrator’s decision to disallow expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue. Rather, the plaintiff’s complaint and purported reservation of rights was in relation to the Arbitrator’s <span class="font-italic">further </span>procedural decision directing that part of the expert evidence be submitted <span class="font-italic">sequentially</span> instead of being exchanged. Thus, insofar as the Arbitrator’s decision disallowing expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue was concerned, there was in fact <span class="font-italic">no</span> reservation of rights at all. Further, for completeness and as stated below at [74], even the complaint pertaining to sequential submission of expert evidence was dropped by the plaintiff and was no longer in issue in OS 51. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Second, the Arbitrator’s ruling disallowing the expert evidence was made <span class="font-italic">prior</span> <span class="font-italic">to </span>the evidentiary hearing which took place in March 2020. Nevertheless, the plaintiff continued with the proceedings right through to the completion of the evidentiary hearing and closing submissions without demur. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my judgment, the plaintiff’s conduct was precisely the sort of hedging and equivocation that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> had expressly cautioned arbitrants against (see above at [65]). It was thus not open to the plaintiff to belatedly raise the objection before this court that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard by reason of the Arbitrator’ procedural decision to disallow expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In any event, I failed to see what prejudice was occasioned to the plaintiff. I accept the defendant’s argument that, based on the Arbitrator’s reasoning and conclusions reached on the substantive issue pertaining to Clause 26 (identified by the Arbitrator as Issue 13(a) in the List of Issues), any expert evidence led by the plaintiff, even if allowed, could not have reasonably made any difference to the outcome. It is clear that ultimately, the Arbitrator’s decision on whether Clause 26 survived termination of the First Contract turned entirely on the construction of the First Contract and clause 26.
