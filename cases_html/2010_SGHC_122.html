<p class="Judg-Heading-1">GROUNDS OF DECISION:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This originating summons raised the question of
                    whether a party to an arbitration agreement is able to obtain an order from the
                    court for pre-arbitral discovery, <em>ie</em> discovery
                    prior to and for the purpose of commencing arbitration
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Equinox Offshore Accommodation
                    Limited, and the defendant, Richshore Marine Supplies Pte Ltd, had entered into
                    an agreement under which the defendant was appointed as the plaintiff’s
                    sole and exclusive agent in Singapore for the purchase of goods of a certain
                    description (“the Agreement”). In consideration of the services
                    provided, the defendant was entitled to payment based on a 12 percent mark-up on
                    the price of such goods purchased on behalf of the plaintiff. Under clause
                    3(iii) of the Agreement, the defendant agreed that it would:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“…
                        <b><em>keep proper and accurate accounts and records of
                            purchases made on behalf of [the plaintiff]</em></b> including full
                        details of the persons from whom they are purchased, the quantity, the total
                        price paid and whenever possible the price per quantity and also of the
                        expenses incurred by them in making the purchases and arranging for delivery
                        as required by [the plaintiff] and of all other charges incurred in relation
                        to such purchases and <b><em>will permit [the plaintiff] by its
                            duly appointed agents to inspect those accounts and records at such
                            times as it may respectively require</em></b>.” [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Agreement contained an arbitration clause which stated that any
                    dispute arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be referred to
                    arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the
                    Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC
                Rules”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff brought this originating summons,
                    pursuant to O 24 r 6(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed), to seek discovery of the accounts and records falling within
                    the definition in clause 3(iii) of the Agreement, from 1 January 2008 to date.
                    The basis of the application was that the plaintiff had grounds to believe that
                    the defendant had overcharged the plaintiff in respect of the goods purchased on
                    its behalf, in breach of the terms of the Agreement. In the alternative, the
                    plaintiff sought to enforce its contractual right under clause 3(iii) to inspect
                    the same category of documents. In response, the defendant initially filed a
                    summons (SUM 49/2010) to stay the <em>entire</em>
                    originating summons proceedings in favour of arbitration. Subsequently however,
                    the defendant filed another summons (SUM 589/2010) to amend SUM 49/2010, so as
                    to restrict the stay application to only the plaintiff’s prayer for
                    inspection of documents pursuant to clause 3(iii) of the Agreement, and to seek
                    instead for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s prayer for discovery under
                    O 24 r 6(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In resisting the defendant’s application
                    for stay under s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A,
                    2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”), the plaintiff cited the case of
                        <em>Navigator Investments Services Ltd v Acclaim Insurance
                        Brokers Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 25 (“<em>Navigator Investments</em>”), wherein the Court of
                    Appeal decided that an application for pre-action discovery does not fall within
                    the scope of s 6 of the IAA. This is because the earliest point in time at
                    which a stay application can be made is when a substantive claim has already
                    been crystallised, which would not be the case where the application is for
                    discovery <em>prior</em> to the bringing of a claim.
                    However, the plaintiff’s reliance on <em>Navigator
                        Investments</em> for this point was misplaced in the context of the
                    present case because leave had been granted to the defendant to amend the
                    summons such that the stay application only related to the alternative prayer to
                    exercise the plaintiff’s contractual right of inspection. The defendant
                    was not seeking to stay the application for discovery, but rather to ask the
                    court to dismiss it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Section 6 of the IAA provides that any party to
                    an arbitration agreement to which the Act applies may, “at any time after
                    appearance”, apply to stay the court proceedings. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Navigator Investments</em> clarified (at [51]) that
                    even though no appearance is required to be entered in respect of all
                    originating summons following amendments to the Rules of Court in 2006 (see in
                    particular O 12 r 9), this does not mean that originating summonses
                    cannot now be stayed. The plaintiff was clearly, by its alternative prayer,
                    contending that the defendant was in breach of its contractual obligation under
                    clause 3(iii) of the Agreement to allow the plaintiff to inspect the relevant
                    accounts and records. The defendant, on the other hand, argued that the
                    plaintiff was not entitled to such inspection under the terms of the Agreement
                    as the plaintiff had already made payment and accepted the goods as purchased by
                    the defendant. In this situation, there was, in my view, a dispute which fell
                    within the scope of the arbitration clause in the Agreement. It should also be
                    mentioned that the plaintiff’s counsel did not seriously pursue the
                    alternative claim for inspection under the contract, choosing instead to focus
                    primarily on the issue of discovery. I therefore granted the defendant’s
                    application to stay in favour of arbitration the aspect of the originating
                    summons which sought to enforce the contractual right of inspection. The other
                    aspect of the originating summons which pertained to discovery was less
                    straightforward, and necessitated a consideration of when the court can grant
                    discovery where the parties before the court have an arbitration
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The distinction between pre-action and pre-arbitral
                discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff’s counsel referred to the
                    approach of the Court of Appeal in <em>Navigator
                        Investments</em>, which was to facilitate and promote arbitration
                    wherever possible. This extended to recognising the availability of
                        pre-<em>action</em> discovery even where there is an
                    arbitration clause <em>prima facie</em> applicable to the
                    potential dispute between the parties involved. Following such a robust
                    approach, it was argued, there is no longer a need to maintain a distinction
                    between what may be classified as pre-action discovery and what may be
                    classified as pre-arbitral discovery. This argument was, in my view, untenable
                    in light of the Court of Appeal’s express recognition in the same case
                    that this distinction still exists (at [64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, of course, a difference between pre-<em>action</em> discovery on the one hand and pre-<em>arbitral</em> discovery on the other…It has, to the best
                        of our knowledge, not been settled by our courts as to whether or not the
                            <em>courts</em> would be able to grant
                            pre-<em>arbitral</em> discovery. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Court of Appeal in <em>Navigator Investments</em> also referred to its own earlier decision
                    in <em>Woh Hup (Pte) Ltd v Lian Teck Construction Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2005] SGCA 26 (“<em>Woh
                        Hup</em>”), in which the court had explained as follows (at
                    [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is helpful at this stage to clarify the terms “pre-action
                        discovery” and “pre-arbitral discovery”. We are of the
                        view that the term “pre-arbitral discovery” should be
                        restricted to discovery sought before the commencement of arbitral
                        proceedings <em>per se</em>. Thus, any discovery prior
                        to and for the purpose of commencing legal proceedings, including that
                        sought by a party to an arbitration agreement, should still be termed
                        “pre-action discovery”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Thus, where one party to a contract with an
                    arbitration clause believes that he may have a cause of action against the other
                    contracting party but which falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause,
                    and he brings an application under O 24 r 6(1) to try and determine
                    whether it is viable to commence that cause of action in court, it would be an
                    application for pre-<em>action</em> discovery. That was the
                    situation in <em>Woh Hup</em>, where the party seeking
                    discovery took the view that the arbitration clause in the parties’
                    agreement was not of universal application to all of its claims, and therefore
                    intended to institute legal proceedings in the High Court. This is in contrast
                    to a case where the party applying to court for discovery does so with the
                    intention of ascertaining whether it would have a viable cause of action
                        <em>to pursue in arbitration</em>. This latter scenario
                    involves an application for pre-<em>arbitral</em>
                    discovery. In the former case of pre-<em>action</em>
                    discovery, if the party seeking discovery subsequently commences an action in
                    court based on the strength of the documents discovered, it of course remains
                    open for the other party to apply to court to stay the proceedings in favour of
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the present case, despite the prayer in the
                    originating summons being couched as one for pre-action discovery, there was
                    little doubt that what the plaintiff sought was in fact pre-arbitral discovery.
                    The Chief Operating Officer of the plaintiff stated in his affidavit as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I verily believe that an examination of the Defendants’
                        accounts and records of purchases will enable us to ascertain whether we
                        have legitimate causes of actions [<em>sic</em>]
                        against the Defendants for overcharging in breach of the terms of the
                        Agreement. <b><em>If, in fact, the causes of action fall within
                            the scope of the arbitration clause of the Agreement, we will then
                            commence the appropriate proceedings to resolve the
                        dispute</em></b>.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Similarly, the affidavit of the
                    plaintiff’s Legal and Commercial Director stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[T]he Plaintiffs are not trying to avoid their obligations under
                        the Agreement. <b><em>The Plaintiffs remain ready and willing
                            to submit any disputes between the Parties to arbitration</em></b>
                        should such dispute fall within the scope of clause 11 [the arbitration
                        clause] of the Agreement.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It was thus clear that the purpose of seeking
                    discovery of the accounts and records of purchases was to enable the plaintiff
                    to determine whether it had a viable claim for which to commence <em>arbitration</em> proceedings. There was no suggestion at all
                    in the affidavits filed on behalf of the plaintiff or during submissions by its
                    counsel that the plaintiff’s possible claim against the defendant for
                    overcharging under the Agreement might fall outside the scope of the arbitration
                    clause and be the subject of a court action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Counsel for the plaintiff did allude to the
                    possibility that the plaintiff might also have a claim against the
                    defendant’s director, one Mr David Sim. To the extent that
                    Mr Sim was obviously not a party to the Agreement and accordingly was not
                    bound by the arbitration clause therein, the argument made was that the
                    documents were therefore sought also with a view to ascertaining whether to
                    commence <em>court</em> proceedings against Mr Sim.
                    With respect, this argument was tenuous. Nowhere in the several affidavits filed
                    by the plaintiff in support of the application was there any mention of a
                    possible claim against the individual directors such as Mr Sim. The
                    assertion was made only in the <em>reply</em> written
                    submissions, after the plaintiff’s counsel became aware of the
                    defendant’s objection on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to
                    order pre-arbitral discovery. In the circumstance, I found persuasive the
                    submission by the defendant’s counsel that Mr David Sim was added
                    into the picture more as an afterthought to justify the plaintiff’s
                    position that this application was for pre-action discovery, so as to get around
                    any difficulties of jurisdiction as to pre-arbitral discovery. In this regard,
                    it was telling that no indication whatsoever was given by the plaintiff as to
                    what would be the nature of the possible cause of action against Mr Sim,
                    short of alleging that several email correspondences suggested it was suspicious
                    why Mr Sim was reluctant to allow for the audit of the defendant’s
                    accounts. It was clear to me that any claim for overcharging had to be against
                    the defendant and not its directors. The plaintiff was seeking disclosure of
                    documents to ascertain the viability of such a cause of action, which would be
                    within the scope of the arbitration clause. This was an application for
                    pre-arbitral discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the court has jurisdiction to grant pre-arbitral
                discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The question of whether the court has the
                    power to order pre-arbitral discovery has not been resolved by our courts. In
                        <em>Woh Hup</em>, the Court of Appeal considered the
                    issue but left it open because the court reached the conclusion that the
                    application before it was in fact for pre-action discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff’s application for
                    discovery was based on O 24 r 6(1), which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Discovery against other person (O. 24, r.
                        6)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. —(1) An application for an order for the discovery of documents
                        before the commencement of <em>proceedings</em> shall
                        be made by originating summons and the person against whom the order is
                        sought shall be made defendant to the originating summons. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Rule 3 of the same Order states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)  An originating summons under paragraph (1)
                        … shall be supported by an affidavit which must —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)  in the case of an originating summons under paragraph
                            (1), state the grounds for the application, the material facts
                            pertaining to the intended proceedings and whether the person against
                            whom the order is sought is likely to be party to <b><em>subsequent proceedings in Court</em></b>;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The pertinent question would be whether the
                    word “proceedings” in O 24 r 6(1) is restricted to court
                    proceedings, or whether it encompasses proceedings in arbitration. The
                    requirement in rule 6(3) that the supporting affidavit state whether the
                    respondent to the application is likely to be party to “subsequent
                    proceedings in Court” suggests that O 24 r 6(1) is only
                    concerned with discovery prior to the commencement of a court action. Professor
                    Pinsler has expressed a similar view, by tracing the court’s power to
                    order discovery under the Rules of Court back to the primary Act (see Jeffrey
                    Pinsler, “Is Discovery Available Prior to the Commencement of Arbitration
                    Proceedings” [2005] SJLS 64 (“Professor Pinsler’s
                    article”) at 65):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would seem that this rule [O 24 r 6] does not apply
                        to an application for discovery prior to arbitration. The power to order
                        discovery is vested in the courts pursuant to paragraph 12 of the First
                        Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (‘SCJA’). This
                        paragraph states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Power before or after any proceedings are commenced to order discovery
                            of facts or documents by any party to the proceedings or by any other
                            person in such manner as may be prescribed by the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the SCJA concerns the courts, the term “proceedings” in
                        paragraph 12 should be construed to mean proceedings in court. Paragraph 12
                        provides that the power is to be exercised in accordance with the RC [Rules
                        of Court]. Order 23, rule 6 has a well-defined scope which does not appear
                        to encompass discovery in anticipation of arbitration. Order 23, rule 6(1)
                        is limited to “discovery of documents before the commencement of
                        proceedings”. The word “proceedings” requires
                        interpretation in the context of paragraph 12 of the First Schedule to the
                        SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Professor’s view was described by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Navigator Investments</em> as
                    “persuasive not only because of the detailed arguments set out in this
                    learned article, but also because it would be most appropriate for the courts
                    (if it is at all possible) to leave the <em>entire</em>
                    conduct of arbitration proceedings in the hands of the arbitral
                    tribunal”. Based on a reading of O 24 r 6 itself, and adopting
                    as well Professor Pinsler’s reasoning, I decided that O 24
                    r 6(1) does not grant the court the power to order discovery prior to the
                    institution of arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Although the originating summons prayed for
                    relief specifically under O 24 r 6(1), the plaintiff’s counsel
                    went further during submissions to argue that the court also has the inherent
                    jurisdiction to order discovery in aid of anticipated arbitration proceedings.
                    The invocation of the court’s inherent jurisdiction under O 92
                    r 4 was considered by the Court of Appeal in <em>Wee Soon
                        Kim v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821.
                    Chao Hick Tin JA, in delivering the judgment of the court, made the
                    following general comment on when the court should exercise such inherent powers
                    (at [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to us clear that by its very nature, how an inherent
                        jurisdiction, whether as set out in O 92 r 4 or under common law,
                        should be exercised should not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests.
                        In each instance the court must exercise it judiciously. In his lecture on
                        "The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court" published in <em>Current Legal Problems 1970</em>, Sir Jack Jacob (until lately
                        the general editor of the <em>Supreme Court
                            Practice</em>) opined that this jurisdiction may be invoked when
                        it is just and equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance
                        of the due process of law, to prevent improper vexation or oppression and to
                        do justice between the parties. <b><em>Without intending to be
                            exhaustive, we think an essential touchstone is really that of
                            "need"</em></b>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Chao JA went on to explain why the court
                    was of the view that there was no such “need” for the court to
                    exercise its inherent jurisdiction so as to allow the two solicitors in that
                    case, against whom complaints were made, to be able to intervene in the
                    disciplinary proceedings instituted against them:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    … Pt VII of the Act [Legal Profession Act]
                            sets out an <b><em>elaborate scheme</em></b> on how a
                            complaint against a solicitor should be dealt with, with emphasis on
                            objectivity and transparency and the need for maintaining the highest
                            standards of professionalism and integrity…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    It cannot be disputed that the solicitor complained
                            against has <b><em>an interest</em></b> in the outcome of
                            an application made by a complainant under s 96. It is also
                            understandable why the solicitor may wish to intervene in that
                            proceeding even though it is quite unnecessary for him to do so.
                                <b><em>But it is altogether another thing to say that
                                there is a necessity for him to do so, a need of such a gravity that
                                the court should invoke its inherent jurisdiction</em></b>. The
                            intervention in such a situation by the solicitor may or may not be of
                            assistance to the court … Thus, we hold that the circumstances do
                            not warrant the court invoking its inherent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    The question might well be asked, what prejudice
                            would the intervention cause to the complainant/applicant. But we do not
                            think that that is the correct approach upon which to invoke the court's
                            inherent jurisdiction. It may well be that the question of prejudice is
                            relevant to determine whether intervention should be allowed in the
                            circumstances of a case. <b><em>But that is not to say that
                                once no prejudice is shown, the court should invoke that
                                jurisdiction. There must nevertheless be reasonably strong or
                                compelling reasons showing why that jurisdiction should be
                                invoked</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is therefore insufficient to merely show
                    that you have an interest or desire that the court exercises its inherent
                    jurisdiction under O 92 r 4. A real “need” of sufficient
                    gravity must be shown. It also will not suffice to show that no prejudice will
                    be caused to the other party. The requirement is one of “strong and
                    compelling reasons” for the court to exercise its inherent powers. In
                    particular, if a statutory regime with detailed rules already exists to govern
                    the procedure in that particular area, it is unlikely that such necessity would
                    arise (see also Jeffrey Pinsler, “Inherent Jurisdiction Re-visited: An
                    Expanding Doctrine” (2002) 14 SAcLJ 1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, the arbitration clause in
                    the Agreement referred to the SIAC rules, and it was common ground that this
                    meant that the <em>lex arbitrii</em> was the IAA. The IAA,
                    and the corresponding O 69A of the Rules of Court, contain detailed rules
                    regulating the procedural rights and reliefs connected to international
                    arbitration, including <em>inter alia</em> the procedures
                    for setting aside of arbitral awards and enforcement of arbitral awards by the
                    court. However, the IAA and O 69A do not make provision for obtaining
                    discovery from the court prior to the institution of arbitration proceedings. In
                    fact, the effect of recent amendments to the IAA was to remove the power of the
                    court to grant discovery orders even in relation to <em>existing</em> arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     One key reason for amending the IAA was to
                    allow the court to make interim orders such as <em>Mareva</em> injunctions to support arbitrations conducted outside
                    Singapore. At the same time however, the court’s power to make orders
                    relating to matters that concern the actual conduct of the arbitration was
                    curtailed. In particular, the previous s 12(7) of the IAA (which provided
                    for the court to have the same power as the arbitral tribunal in making orders
                    for, <em>inter alia</em>, discovery) was replaced by a new
                    s 12A which specifically omits discovery from the types of orders that the
                    court is empowered to grant in aid of arbitration. During the Second Reading of
                    the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill (<em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates</em>, Official Report (19 October 2009)
                    vol 86), the Minister for Law explained the changes as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Court-ordered interim measures in support of foreign
                            arbitrations</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first [amendment] is to allow court-ordered interim measures in
                        support of arbitrations conducted outside Singapore…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While this amendment augments the powers of the Court in relation to
                        arbitration, it also places appropriate restrictions on the exercise of
                        these powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is in line with our policy of minimal curial intervention in
                        arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The scope of the new powers is limited to interim measures in support of
                        arbitration, for example interim injunctions to preserve assets. <b><em>They do not extend to procedural or evidential matters dealing
                            with the actual conduct of the arbitration itself – like
                            discovery</em></b>, interrogatories, or security for costs. <b><em>These procedural matters fall within the province of the
                            arbitral tribunal and must be decided by the tribunal
                        itself</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Given that there are specific legislative
                    provisions dealing with the types of court-ordered measures that can be granted
                    in aid of arbitration, it would appear that there is no “need” for
                    the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction. Furthermore, with the recent
                    amendments to the IAA which restrict the court’s power to make orders in
                    relation to the actual conduct of arbitration, it would seem more consistent
                    with Parliament’s intention for the court not to be granting pre-arbitral
                    discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Having said that, it may conceivably be argued
                    that pre-arbitral discovery is a different type of relief from the interim
                    measures contemplated by these legislative provisions, and hence should be
                    regulated by other rules. Such discovery orders are by their very nature made
                    prior to the commencement of any arbitration proceedings and in that sense, it
                    may be contended, do not impact the actual conduct and outcome of the
                    arbitration. The flaw in such an argument has however been convincingly pointed
                    out (see Professor Pinsler’s article at 66):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It might be contended that as the purpose of pre-arbitration discovery is
                        to determine whether there is a cause of action to be pursued and would not
                        affect the outcome of the arbitration, therefore the process may be governed
                        by rules other than those found in the arbitration legislation. There are
                        weaknesses in this argument. As the evidence obtained in advance of the
                        arbitration would be crucial to the issues to be adjudicated in the course
                        of arbitration, discovery would most certainly affect the conduct of the
                        proceedings. Furthermore, the issue of whether a party has a right of action
                        against another party pursuant to their arbitration agreement is obviously
                        within the scope of the arbitration legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     If the issue of pre-arbitral discovery is one
                    that ought properly to fall within the purview of arbitration legislation, could
                    this be a case where there has been a “gap”, in that the IAA and
                    O 69A have failed to provide for the same, such that there is a need for
                    the court to intervene by its inherent jurisdiction? Counsel for the plaintiff
                    argued that his client was in the position of a putative claimant, and needed
                    the assistance of the court to determine if it had a viable claim to pursue
                    against the defendant in arbitration proceedings. If relief similar to that
                    under O 24 r 6(1) was unavailable, should the court not exercise its
                    inherent powers to order discovery in aid of such a putative claimant who needed
                    to know whether to commence arbitration?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     While such an argument is not completely
                    unpersuasive, primacy must always be accorded to the fact that arbitration is
                    the <em>contractually</em> chosen mode of dispute
                    resolution by the parties themselves. This means one of two things. First, the
                    issue of whether pre-arbitral discovery should be available must also be viewed
                    from the perspective of the other contracting party, against whom the discovery
                    order is sought. His interest in having the matter resolved solely by means of
                    the arbitration process, be it for considerations such as confidentiality or to
                    save time and reduce costs <em>etc</em>, ought to be taken
                    into account. Again, I can do no better than quote from Professor
                    Pinsler’s article (at 74):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If arbitration is the dispute resolution mechanism chosen and agreed to by
                        the parties as the preferred alternative to court proceedings, an
                        application to invoke the court process in order to obtain discovery would
                        be improper in the absence of agreed terms to this effect. <b><em>The respondent to such an application might well complain that
                            he is being unjustly deprived of the benefits which form the basis of
                            his agreement to arbitrate. Court proceedings would involve increased
                            expenditure, delays arising from this initial application and possible
                            appeals, the risk of adverse publicity in a more public forum, formality
                            and complexity in adjudication compared to the relatively relaxed
                            atmosphere of an arbitration</em></b>. Such outcomes would also be
                        contrary to the spirit of the arbitral process which is intended to operate
                        independently of the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, if the concern is that there is no mechanism for compelling
                    the disclosure of documents prior to the institution of arbitration proceedings,
                    as Professor Pinsler also pointed out, it surely is for the parties to make the
                    necessary contractual provision for such a pre-arbitral process of discovery. If
                    commercial parties contractually chose arbitration as the form of their dispute
                    resolution, then they should be bound by the arbitration rules and procedure to
                    which they had subscribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>Woh Hup</em>, although not expressing any conclusive view on
                    whether the court could order pre-arbitral discovery, commented as follows (at
                    [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t appeared to us that any matter submitted to arbitration should, in
                        general, and certainly wherever possible, be dealt with by the arbitral
                        tribunal. To invoke the assistance of the courts prior to the commencement
                        of arbitral proceedings may, in certain instances, appear to run contrary to
                        the spirit and scheme of arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Importantly, the court further noted the potential for abuse, in the
                    context of pre-<em>action</em> discovery:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    We are cognisant of the policy-related concerns
                            raised by the appellants’ counsel, who has pointed out that
                            allowing parties to an arbitration agreement to obtain pre-action
                            discovery might potentially <b><em>give rise to an abuse of
                                process, since the court would not consider the applicability of the
                                arbitration agreement at that juncture</em></b>. The appellants
                            also argued that the trial judge’s qualification that the
                            disclosed documents be used only for court proceedings was of little
                            assistance; such a qualification might not sufficiently safeguard
                            against the possibility that <b><em>a party who had
                                obtained discovery might subsequently institute arbitration
                                proceedings, while falsely claiming that the arbitration proceedings
                                were not premised on the documents
                        disclosed</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    There seems to be a conflict between a
                            plaintiff’s need to know whether he has a likely cause of action
                            and the prejudice that may be caused to the defendant who has given
                            discovery if the parties end up going to arbitration instead. While the
                            plaintiff may legitimately apply for pre-action discovery, <b><em>the potential for abuse is particularly high where the
                                arbitration clause is or is very likely to be operative</em></b>.
                            It appeared to us, therefore, that in circumstances where, on a plain
                            literal reading, the arbitration clause <em>prima
                                facie</em> covers the dispute in question, the court may
                            refuse to grant discovery to prevent a possible abuse of process by the
                            applicant. Such a refusal would be made without prejudice to a later
                            court’s determination on the applicability of the arbitration
                            clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The court in <em>Woh
                        Hup</em> was concerned with the possible abuse in that a party to an
                    arbitration agreement may be able to obtain documents from the other side by an
                    application to court (which at that juncture would not consider whether the
                    arbitration clause applies), and then subsequently making use of those documents
                    for the purpose of initiating arbitration proceedings instead. That would appear
                    to be precisely the effect if an order for pre-<em>arbitral</em> discovery is granted by the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Taking into account all the above
                    considerations, I reached the view that the court has no power, whether under
                    O 24 r 6(1) or pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction, to make an order
                    for <em>pre-arbitral</em> discovery in relation to
                    arbitration that may but have not been commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">If the court has jurisdiction to grant pre-arbitral discovery, should
                it be granted in the present case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I proceeded further to consider what the
                    result ought to be in the event that I was wrong and the court does have the
                    power to order pre-arbitral discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Bayerische Hypo- und
                        Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 4 SLR(R) 39, Belinda Ang J refused to order pre-action
                    discovery primarily on the basis that the applicant banks had not shown
                    sufficient grounds for the application. Ang J explained (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that the banks are not constrained from starting
                        proceedings without pre-action discovery. From their contentions, it is
                        obvious that the banks have taken a view as to whether they have a case that
                        APBS is responsible for the loans and whether to plead a case. It has not
                        been said anywhere in the affidavits or in submissions by counsel that
                        without pre-action discovery the banks are unable to plead a case. <b><em>This is unlike the case of an applicant who is unable to plead
                            a case as he does not yet know whether he has a viable claim against the
                            opponents, and needs pre-action discovery to fill the void or gaps in
                            his knowledge. That is the nature (and I should add, function) of
                            pre-action discovery, and the rule is there to assist him to search for
                            the answer</em></b>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Ang J further stressed the important
                    overriding requirement of necessity under O 24 r 7. While it is common
                    for lawyers to focus on the relevance of the documents sought, it must also be
                    shown that the pre-action discovery is necessary for disposing fairly of the
                    proceedings or for saving costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The above principles should be equally
                    applicable to an application for pre-arbitral discovery, whether under O 24
                    r 6(1) or pursuant to the court’s inherent jurisdiction (assuming my
                    primary conclusion is wrong and such relief is available). Despite submissions
                    to the contrary by the plaintiff’s counsel, this was, in my view, not a
                    case where the claimant was unsure and needed to ascertain the nature of its
                    claim. As pointed out by the defendant’s counsel, the plaintiff had stated
                    the basis of its possible claim against the defendant, namely that of
                    overcharging and claiming for interest which the defendant was allegedly not
                    entitled to under the Agreement. The plaintiff also possessed sufficient
                    evidence on which to mount a claim in arbitration against the defendant. In
                    particular, it had competing quotes from other suppliers, which upon a
                    comparison with the prices charged by the defendant allegedly showed that the
                    defendant had inflated the prices. Of course, inspection of the
                    defendant’s accounts and records of purchases would assist the plaintiff,
                    but discovery prior to the commencement of proceedings should not be ordered to
                    enable the plaintiff to formulate a <em>better</em> claim.
                    It should only be ordered to assist a claimant who is in the dark as to what
                    claim to pursue. As stated in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em> (at paragraph 24/6/5), where the plaintiff has sufficient
                    evidence to commence a claim, he is generally not entitled to discovery before
                    action in order to <em>fully</em> plead his
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff’s counsel also failed to
                    persuade me that ordering the discovery prayed for in this application was
                    necessary to dispose of the matter fairly or to save costs. The category of
                    documents for which discovery was sought mirrored the class of documents covered
                    by clause 3(iii) of the Agreement. The plaintiff had a contractual right to the
                    inspection of those documents, and there was no necessity for a court order. If,
                    as the plaintiff asserted, the defendant was wrongfully denying its contractual
                    right of inspection, the plaintiff’s recourse ought to be, as
                    contractually provided for, to enforce that right by the process of
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the result, I dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s discovery application, primarily on the basis that the
                    plaintiff was in fact seeking not pre-action discovery but rather pre-arbitral
                    discovery, for which the court has no jurisdiction to order.</p>
