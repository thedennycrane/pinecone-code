</div> Mr Hamish Alexander Christie was appointed as the trustee of the Bankrupt’s bankruptcy estate (the “Private Trustee”). The Private Trustee commenced this application (“SUM 5249/2020”) for declarations that the Transfers are void under ss 98 and/or 99 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “Act”) as the transactions entered into with FT were undervalued and the payments to TPS and TBH were unfair preferences. The Private Trustee also seeks court orders for each of the Recipients to transfer the sums received to the Private Trustee within 14 days of the orders.

TPS and TBH were (and continue to be) unsecured creditors of the Bankrupt and these transfers improved their position in the Bankrupt’s bankruptcy regime relative to the other unsecured creditors, thereby giving both of them an unfair preference.

The burden is on TPS and TBH to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

These statutory provisions under the Bankruptcy Act and the IRDA are substantially the same.

An “associate” includes a relative of the individual, which in turn includes his brother, sister, and lineal descendant (ss 101(2) and 101(7) of the Act). I shall refer to this two-year period as the “clawback period for unfair preferences”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Further, the individual must have either (a) been insolvent at the relevant time of the preference, or (b) become insolvent in consequence of the preference (s 100(2) of the Act).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Pursuant to s 99(3) of the Act, an individual gives an unfair preference to the recipient if: (a) the recipient is one of the individual’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for any of his debts or other liabilities; and (b) the individual does anything or suffers anything to be done which (in either case) has the effect of putting the recipient into a position which, in the event of the individual’s bankruptcy, will be better than the position the recipient would otherwise have been in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In addition, pursuant to s 99(4) of the Act, the court will only make an order if the individual who gave the preference was influenced, in deciding to give it, by a desire to produce in relation to the recipient the effect of putting the recipient into a position which, in the event of the individual’s bankruptcy, will be better than the position the recipient would have been in if the preference had not been given. For convenience, I shall refer to this as the “desire to prefer”.

</div> Furthermore, although the A&amp;G Letter of Demand was sent to the Bankrupt in March 2017, this was very close to the Transfers in January 2017. This indicates that the Bankrupt was already unable to fulfil the demands set out in the A&amp;G Letter of Demand. Thus, contrary to TPS’s and TBH’s assertions, there is indeed evidence that at least one of the Bankrupt’s non-family creditors had pressed him for payment of a significant sum by the time of the Transfers and that he had been unable to pay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Counsel for TPS and TBH argues that the Bankrupt’s non-payment of HEP’s bills does not show that he was unable to pay his debts as they fell due. He stresses that HEP continued to act for the Bankrupt and did not press him for payment and that it is not unusual for clients not to pay their solicitors’ bills promptly, especially since clients may wish to apply for such bills to be taxed. However, I do not find these arguments persuasive. The fact that HEP continued to act for the Bankrupt does not indicate that their letters were merely reminders rather than unequivocal requests for payment. HEP did not press for payment vigorously as HEP were unaware that the Bankrupt was insolvent at that time. If HEP had suspected that their bills would not be paid because the Bankrupt was insolvent or faced financial difficulty, HEP would have insisted that their bills be paid before it would continue to represent the Bankrupt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Bankrupt offered no explanation for his non-payment of these bills, other than stating that HEP were “always prepared to give [him] time to pay”.

</div> Neither the Bankrupt nor any of the Recipients suggested that the reason for non-payment was that the Bankrupt wished to have HEP’s bills taxed.

As I have noted at [23] above, the two tests are disjunctive and not conjunctive. The remarks of Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Living the Link </span>(at [28]) are particularly apposite in the present case: “no matter how asset rich the company might be, it will still fail the cash flow test and be held to be insolvent under s 100(4) of the [Act] if it is proved that the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due”. These remarks apply equally to individuals. Nevertheless, since the parties have made extensive submissions on the balance sheet test, I shall also address whether the Bankrupt failed the balance sheet test at the time of the Transfers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The balance sheet test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Under s 100(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, an individual is balance sheet insolvent if the value of his assets is less than the amount of his liabilities, taking into account his contingent and prospective liabilities.

While HVS’s valuation report was the most contemporaneous (as it was prepared in October 2016 on the request of the Bankrupt), the parameters adopted by HVS significantly limit the accuracy of its valuation for present purposes for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, HVS’s valuation of S$313m was based on discounted cash flow projections for a period of 59 years (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the entire remaining term of the lease for the Hotel), with the net income of the Hotel projected to increase every year.

</div>
</div> Counsel for the Private Trustee explains that this position was taken for two reasons: (a) “to be fair” to the Bankrupt, as the CPF funds were refunded only in August 2017 (after the completion of the sale of the Ocean Drive Property), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>after the Transfers were made; and (b) to avoid a dispute over whether the Bankrupt’s refunded CPF funds should be considered the <span class="font-italic">Bankrupt’s</span> assets at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I do not agree with the Private Trustee’s reasons. In my view, even though the Bankrupt’s CPF funds were in fact refunded only in August 2017, the amount of the refund must be taken into account in ascertaining the value of the Ocean Drive Property at the time of the Transfers. This is because the refund of the Bankrupt’s CPF funds was a prospective liability which the Bankrupt already had at the time of the Transfers. If the Ocean Drive Property had been sold in January 2017, the Bankrupt would have been under an obligation to refund his CPF funds at that time. Further, the Bankrupt’s CPF funds could only be used for limited purposes, and it was not argued before me that the Bankrupt’s CPF funds should generally be included in his assets for the purpose of the balance sheet test. Therefore, I agree with TPS’s and TBH’s submissions that the value of the Ocean Drive Property at the time of the Transfers was approximately S$300,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) The Melbourne Property</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Private Trustee submits that, as the Melbourne Property was sold by the Bankrupt’s estate in 2019 for A$1.41m and the Bankrupt’s share of the sale proceeds (after deducting Australian capital gains tax) was approximately S$300,000, the value of the Melbourne Property as an asset of the Bankrupt at the material time was S$300,000.

</div> On the other hand, TPS and TBH contend that the market value of the Melbourne Property was A$1.425m in January 2017 and that, after repaying the outstanding mortgage loan on the property together with interest, a sale of the Melbourne Property at that time would likely have yielded surplus proceeds of more than A$1m.

</div> As for the Maybank-CGH Contingent Debt of S$30m, this sum was not included in the Recipients’ calculations and was also not addressed in their submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Further, with regard to the valuation of these contingent liabilities, counsel for the Private Trustee submits that the Maybank-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt and the NAFA-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt owed by the Bankrupt should be valued in full because Treasure Resort was deeply in the red at the time of the Transfers and the likelihood of the Bankrupt’s personal guarantees being called upon was, therefore, a certainty. In response, counsel for TPS and TBH argues that the value of the Bankrupt’s contingent liabilities should be substantially discounted because there was no reason for the Bankrupt to think that there was a real risk that his various guarantees would be called upon in January 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 There are, therefore, two issues in dispute: (a) whether the Maybank-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt and the NAFA-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt should be <span class="font-italic">included</span> among the Bankrupt’s liabilities at the time of the Transfers; and (b) whether the Bankrupt’s contingent liabilities should be <span class="font-italic">valued</span> in full, or instead should be discounted to reflect the possibility that the relevant contingencies might not occur. These issues overlap, but I shall deal with them in turn for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The Bankrupt’s contingent debts as a personal guarantor for Treasure Resort  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I agree with the Private Trustee’s submission that the Maybank-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt and the NAFA-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt should be included among the Bankrupt’s liabilities at the time of the Transfers. As I have found (at [41] above) that the value of the Hotel at the time of the Transfers was only around S$173.2m, the sale proceeds of the Hotel would not have been sufficient for Treasure Resort to discharge its liabilities to both Maybank and NAFA (which amounted to a total of approximately S$206.17m). Thus, the Bankrupt’s personal guarantees under the Maybank-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt and the NAFA-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt would have been called upon. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Valuation of the Bankrupt’s contingent liabilities</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I turn now to consider how the Bankrupt’s contingent liabilities should be valued. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 4–39, there are two main approaches to valuing a contingent liability:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One is to say that if there is a more than even chance of the contingency occurring, the liability should be taken as the present value of the contingent liability, for example, the amount of a guaranteed debt discounted to take account of its futurity. On this approach, a contingent liability with an 80% chance of accrual, although discounted for futurity would not be discounted for the 20% chance that it would not accrue, whilst a liability with a 50% chance of accrual would be disregarded altogether. An alternative approach is to value the contingent liability at the percentage of likelihood of its occurrence, so that if the likelihood were 80% the liability would be taken in at the present value of 80% of the full liability, whilst a contingent liability with a 10% chance of accrual would be estimated at the present value of 10% of the full liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 However, later in the same paragraph, <span class="font-italic">Goode</span> observes that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Neither of these approaches seems fully satisfactory. The first seems to set the threshold of likelihood too high, while the second is contrary to prevailing practice, which is to value the contingency in full (less any discount for futurity) if it will probably occur and is capable of valuation and disregard it altogether in other cases. It is thought that <span class="font-italic">the question to be asked is whether there is a real prospect that the contingency will occur, in which case it should be brought in at its present value without further discount for the possibility that it may not accrue</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I agree with the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>that neither of the two approaches is fully satisfactory. The first approach seems overly mechanical, whereas the second approach would be highly speculative. In my view, the preferable approach (as <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>suggests) is to include the full value of contingent debts where there is a <span class="font-italic">real prospect </span>that the relevant contingency will occur. This seems to me to strike the most appropriate balance between giving effect to the statutory mandate to take into account the debtor’s contingent liabilities and reflecting the practical reality that contingent liabilities with only a remote possibility of accrual should not simply be taken at face value for the purpose of the balance sheet test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I agree with the Private Trustee’s submission that the Maybank-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt and the NAFA-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt owed by the Bankrupt should be valued in full. In this case, the relevant contingency is Treasure Resort defaulting on its debts of S$205.74m to Maybank and S$432,916 to NAFA. The Hotel was Treasure Resort’s primary asset and I have found that the sale proceeds of the Hotel (of around S$173.2m) would not have been sufficient to discharge Treasure Resort’s liabilities to both Maybank and NAFA (see [57] above). Furthermore, Treasure Resort was experiencing serious financial difficulties and faced a high risk of insolvency by December 2016 (see [37(a)] above). In these circumstances, there was indeed a real prospect that this contingency would occur and that the Bankrupt’s personal guarantees would be called upon. Consequently, the Bankrupt’s contingent liabilities under the Maybank-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt and the NAFA-Treasure Resort Contingent Debt should be valued in full, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$206.17m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The parties made no submissions before me regarding the likelihood of the Bankrupt’s personal guarantees for the liabilities of the other companies (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CGH, TCH Holding Pte Ltd and TDS Investment Pte Ltd) being called upon. Hence, I am not in a position to evaluate whether there was a real prospect, at the time of the Transfers, that these other companies would have defaulted on their debts. I, therefore, make no finding on the appropriate valuation of the contingent debts owed to UOB arising from the Bankrupt’s liability as a guarantor for facilities extended to CGH, TCH Holding Pte Ltd, and TDS Investment Pte Ltd, and the Maybank-CGH Contingent Debt. However, even if the Bankrupt’s contingent liabilities in respect of these other companies are valued at <span class="font-italic">zero</span> (which is extremely unlikely), the Bankrupt’s total liabilities would have been approximately S$235.87m at the time of the Transfers: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Value (rounded to the nearest S$)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Debts owed to the Bankrupt’s family members, as set out in the A&amp;G Letter of Demand</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">RM21,708,144.50 (S$6,957,739) and S$13,314,949</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Other debts owed to the Bankrupt’s family members </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">US$2,750,000 (S$3,795,000) <br/>and S$2,000,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Debts owed to HEP under Bill Number 128672 (dated 23 August 2016) and Bill Number 129194 (dated 28 September 2016)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$146,835</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Contingent debt owed to UOB arising from the Bankrupt’s liability as a mortgagor for a debt owed by the Bankrupt and his ex-wife </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$3,477,804</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Contingent debt owed to Maybank arising from the Bankrupt’s liability as a personal guarantor for Treasure Resort’s liabilities</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$205,740,857</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Contingent debt owed to NAFA arising from the Bankrupt’s liability as a guarantor of Treasure Resort’s liabilities </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$432,916</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Total</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">S$235,866,100</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Summary of the Bankrupt’s liabilities</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, I estimate the amount of the Bankrupt’s liabilities at the time of the Transfers to be at least S$235.87m.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion on the balance sheet test</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As the amount of the Bankrupt’s liabilities (at least S$235.87m) far exceeded the value of his assets (approximately S$3.29m) at the time of the Transfers, I find that the Bankrupt was also balance sheet insolvent at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Bankrupt was influenced by a desire to prefer TPS and TBH </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I shall now consider whether the transfers to TPS and TBH should be avoided as unfair preferences. As I have explained at [20] above, TPS and TBH were creditors of the Bankrupt and the transfers put them in a better position upon his bankruptcy than they would otherwise have been in. This is sufficient to establish that these transfers were unfair preferences under s 99(3) of the Act. However, the court will only make an order in respect of these unfair preferences if the Bankrupt was influenced by a desire to prefer in making the transfers (s 99(4) of the Act). Since TPS and TBH are associates of the Bankrupt, s 99(5) of the Act applies such that the Bankrupt is <span class="font-italic">presumed</span> to have been influenced by a desire to prefer them unless the contrary is shown. The burden of proving that the Bankrupt was not influenced by such a desire thus lies on TPS and TBH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 TPS and TBH argue that the following facts show that the Bankrupt lacked the requisite desire to place them in a better position in the event of his bankruptcy:

</div> Thus, the Bankrupt would have breached his own legal obligations if he had not made this payment to SDC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, TPS and TBH have failed to rebut the statutory presumption that the Bankrupt was influenced by a desire to prefer. In order to rebut this presumption, TPS and TBH must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the transfers were not influenced <span class="font-italic">at all </span>by any desire on the Bankrupt’s part to place them in a preferential position (see <span class="font-italic">Liquidators of </span><span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd </span>[2010] 4 SLR 1089 at [36]). They have not succeeded in doing so in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 TPS and TBH are correct to point out that the court must look at the subjective<span class="font-italic"> </span>desire of the debtor to determine whether he positively wished to improve the creditor’s position in the event of his own insolvency. The requisite desire may be proved by direct evidence or its existence may be inferred from the existing circumstances of the case (see <span class="font-italic">DBS Bank Ltd v Tam Chee Chong and another (judicial managers of Jurong Hi-Tech Industries Pte Ltd (under judicial management))</span> [2011] 4 SLR 948 (“<span class="font-italic">Tam Chee Chong</span>”) at [22] and [26]). However, the Bankrupt’s direct evidence on affidavit shows that he <span class="font-italic">was</span> influenced by a subjective desire to improve TPS’s and TBH’s absolute positions at the time of the transfers. I agree with the Private Trustee’s submission that the Bankrupt made the transfers to TPS and TBH to show his appreciation and gratitude to them. TPS and TBH are the family members who had been the most financially supportive of him. This evinces a clear desire on the Bankrupt’s part to place them in a preferential position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In this regard, the facts of the present case are similar to those of <span class="font-italic">Tam Chee Chong</span>, where the chairman of the insolvent company had testified that the company had given a charge to one of its creditors (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, DBS) because DBS “had been very supportive of” the company. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had been “perfectly justified” in finding that the company’s decision to grant the charge was “influenced by a desire to give DBS what it wanted because it had been good to the [company]” (at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Even if the possibility that he might be facing bankruptcy never crossed the Bankrupt’s mind, which I find difficult to accept, this does not negate a finding that the Bankrupt was influenced by a desire to prefer.

Based on the evidence before me, the Bankrupt was under a legal obligation to make this payment to SDC from the sale proceeds of the White House Park Property. Similarly, I am unable to agree with the submission made by counsel for TPS and TBH that, if the Bankrupt had been motivated by a desire to prefer his family members, he would have made payments to his other family members as well. In my view, the fact that the Bankrupt did not prefer <span class="font-italic">all </span>of his family members does not assist TPS and TBH in showing that the Bankrupt was not influenced by a desire to prefer <span class="font-italic">them</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Therefore, TPS and TBH have failed to rebut the statutory presumption that the Bankrupt was influenced by a desire to prefer them in making the transfers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the transfers to FT were transactions at an undervalue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I shall now address the question of whether the transfers to FT amounting to S$100,000 were transactions at an undervalue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Private Trustee submits that the transfers to FT were gifts made by the Bankrupt to her, or otherwise transactions entered into by the Bankrupt with FT on terms that provided for him to receive no consideration (under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act). In the alternative, the Private Trustee contends that the transfers were transactions in which the value of the consideration received by the Bankrupt was significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by him (under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act).

The facts of both cases were wholly exceptional. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In <span class="font-italic">Claridge</span>, the bankrupt (Mr Claridge) and the respondent (Mrs Claridge) were husband and wife. Their matrimonial home (the “Property”) was initially subject to a mortgage in favour of Birmingham Midshires Building Society (“BMBS”). After Mr Claridge was made bankrupt, Mrs Claridge owned the full beneficial interest in the Property and became solely liable to BMBS in relation to BMBS’s outstanding mortgage. Subsequently, Mr and Mrs Claridge jointly took out a loan from Kensington Mortgage Company Limited (“KMC”). On the joint instructions of Mr and Mrs Claridge, the loan moneys were paid into Mrs Claridge’s bank account. The loan moneys were used to discharge BMBS’s mortgage and re-mortgage the Property in KMC’s favour, as well as to repair and renovate the Property. Mr Claridge’s trustee in bankruptcy sought to impugn the transfer of half of the loan moneys (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, £26,689.50) from Mr Claridge to Mrs Claridge as a transaction at an undervalue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Sales J (as he then was) found that Mr Claridge had entered into a transaction the substance of which involved him conferring a benefit on his wife (<span class="font-italic">Claridge </span>at [29]). This was because Mr Claridge’s half-share of the loan moneys was paid to Mrs Claridge or to BMBS for her sole benefit (since Mrs Claridge was the sole beneficial owner of the Property). However, Sales J declined to make an order against Mrs Claridge under the provision of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) equivalent to s 98 of the Act. While one factor taken into account by Sales J was the fact that Mrs Claridge had spent the moneys in good faith believing that she was fully entitled to spend it (<span class="font-italic">Claridge </span>at [49(ii)]), Sales J also had regard to the following factors: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the context of this transaction, there was no simple way to restore the position to what it would have been if Mr Claridge had not entered into this transaction (<span class="font-italic">Claridge </span>at [49(ii)]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The extent to which Mrs Claridge had benefited from the transaction was limited. She remained liable to KMC to make <span class="font-italic">all</span> the mortgage repayments. There was no evidence of the extent to which the value of the Property was actually increased by the expenditure of Mr Claridge’s share of the loan moneys on it. It, therefore, did not appear unjust in all the circumstances that no order should be made against Mrs Claridge (<span class="font-italic">Claridge </span>at [49(iii)] and [49(vi)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 These factors do not apply in the present case. The transfers amounting to S$100,000 were direct gifts from the Bankrupt to FT which can be simply reversed by an order that FT transfer a sum of S$100,000 to the Private Trustee. Further, FT benefited significantly from the transaction as S$100,000 of her wedding expenses were defrayed by the transfers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I turn now to <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fowlds</span>. Several years before his bankruptcy, the bankrupt (Mr Fowlds) had retained his stepdaughter (Ms Wilson), a qualified management accountant, to provide forensic accountancy services on an arm’s length, commercial basis. Ms Wilson was owed a total of £99,330, and Mr Fowlds paid her about 48% of this sum (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, less than £50,000) within the applicable clawback period. Mr Fowlds’ trustees in bankruptcy sought to impugn this payment to Ms Wilson on the ground that it was an unfair preference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Jones J found that the payment was an unfair preference, but declined to order Ms Wilson to return the payment. Jones J took into account the following factors (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fowlds </span>at [79]–[93]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The debt arose from a commercial relationship and represented a fair amount for the work carried out. Further, Ms Wilson’s relationship to Mr Fowlds did not gain her any priority or advantage over his other commercial creditors. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ms Wilson played no part in the making of the preference other than receiving the payment; she acted in good faith and had no reason to question the payment at any material time.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ms Wilson no longer had the payment or realisable assets of remaining value purchased from those funds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ms Wilson had limited financial means and would not have been able to restore the payments without selling her family home, which would adversely affect her children (including their contact with their father) and her business. Restoration of the payments would thus have a significant and wholly disproportionate effect upon her, bearing in mind that only a sum of less than £50,000 would be restored to the bankruptcy estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The situation of Ms Wilson in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fowlds </span>is, therefore, very different from the situation of FT in the present case. I accept that FT may have received and spent the S$100,000 in good faith and that transferring S$100,000 to the Private Trustee would place a financial burden on FT and her family. However, I do not think the effect of such an order on FT is comparable to the hardship Ms Wilson would have suffered from having to sell her home and relocate her children and her business. Although FT has asserted that she and her husband “simply do not have the means to return such a large sum”,

</div> she has not adduced any evidence to support this. FT has also not given any evidence to show that she would suffer any particular hardship as a result of having to transfer the sum of S$100,000 to the Private Trustee. In addition, unlike Ms Wilson in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fowlds </span>(who had received the payment from Mr Fowlds as consideration for the professional services she had provided to him on a commercial basis), FT was a volunteer for the full sum of S$100,000 and provided no consideration for the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Furthermore, Jones J was careful to emphasise that it would be a “departure from the wide scope of the norm to refuse relief if all the other requirements of the statutory provision are satisfied”. He added that there would have to be “something unusual” to justify such a course, given that the purpose of the relevant statutory provisions was to “achieve the equal rate of distribution to which creditors should be entitled under the statutory waterfall” (<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Fowlds </span>at [12]). Indeed, Jones J expressly stated that he “would not be considering exercising the discretion if the [p]ayment had been a gift or a transaction at an undervalue” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fowlds </span>at [101]). In this case, I have found that the transfers to FT were gifts. <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fowlds </span>therefore does not assist FT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Two additional considerations further undercut FT’s argument that she would be unfairly prejudiced if she is ordered to transfer S$100,000 to the Private Trustee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The evidence suggests that FT would have had the financial means to pay for her wedding expenses even without the transfers from the Bankrupt. FT had booked the Ritz-Carlton hotel as the venue for her wedding banquet by 15 December 2015, and had been required to pay deposits amounting to S$39,787.31 (30% of the anticipated cost of the wedding banquet) by 9 June 2016.

</div> The transfers were only made to FT in November 2016 and January 2017, and the Bankrupt referred to the S$50,000 transferred to FT in November 2016 as “stand by for her wedding”.

</div>
</div> Thus, although FT stated during the hearing that she had booked the wedding venue and paid the required deposits before receiving the transfers on the faith of the Bankrupt’s verbal agreement to defray the costs of the wedding, the objective evidence adduced by FT herself suggests that she did not <span class="font-italic">rely</span> on the transfers to pay for her wedding banquet expenses. The transfers were, therefore, more akin to the Bankrupt’s contributions towards defraying the cost of her wedding, rather than funds which she depended on to be able to afford her very lavish wedding banquet.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At the hearing, FT estimated that she received <span class="font-italic">ang pow </span>money amounting to approximately S$50,000 as gifts from the guests who attended her wedding. This would have further helped to defray the cost of the wedding banquet. Indeed, the combined amount of the transfers and the <span class="font-italic">ang pow </span>money was more than sufficient to cover the cost of the wedding banquet, which was S$135,292.20.

</div>
</div> In other words, after taking into account the transfers and the <span class="font-italic">ang pow </span>money, it appears that FT and her husband did not need to pay a single cent towards their wedding banquet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Therefore, I find that the circumstances of this case do not justify the court exercising its discretion under s 98(2) of the Act not to make an order restoring the position to what it would have been if the Bankrupt had not entered into these transactions. I agree with the Private Trustee’s submission that the Bankrupt’s creditors should not be made to foot the bill for FT’s lavish wedding banquet on her behalf.

</div> If I were to decline to make the order sought by the Private Trustee against FT, this would be tantamount to allowing FT to receive an unqualified windfall at the expense of the Bankrupt’s creditors, when she has given no value for her receipt of the transfers from the Bankrupt. This would be an inequitable outcome.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In summary, I make the following findings: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the time of the Transfers, the Bankrupt was insolvent under s 100(4) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The transfers to TPS and TBH were unfair preferences, and they were given within the applicable clawback period for unfair preferences. In deciding to give these preferences, the Bankrupt was influenced by a desire to prefer TPS and TBH.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The transfers to FT were transactions at an undervalue, and they were entered into within the applicable clawback period for undervalue transactions. The circumstances of the present case do not justify the court exercising its discretion under s 98(2) of the Act not to make an order restoring the position to what it would have been if the Bankrupt had not entered into these transactions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For all of the above reasons, I grant the Private Trustee’s application for the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an order that TBH transfers the sum of S$150,000 to the Private Trustee;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an order that TPS transfers the sum of S$250,000 to the Private Trustee; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an order that FT transfers the sum of S$100,000 to the Private Trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Recipients are to make the necessary transfers within 14 days of the date of this judgment, unless otherwise agreed with the Private Trustee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In addition to the above orders, the Private Trustee sought declarations that the Transfers are void under ss 98 and/or 99 of the Act. However, I am reluctant to make these orders. Sections 98(2) and 99(2) of the Act empower this court to “make such order as it thinks fit for <span class="font-italic">restoring the position</span> to what it would have been” [emphasis added] if the Bankrupt had not entered into the undervalue transactions or given the unfair preferences. The court may do so by, for example, requiring the Recipients to pay, in respect of benefits received by them from the Bankrupt, such sums to the Private Trustee as the court may direct (s 102(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act). I have made such orders at [93] above. These orders are sufficient for the Private Trustee to claw back the moneys from the Recipients for distribution to the creditors of the Bankrupt. It is not necessary for me to declare the Transfers to the Recipients void. Furthermore, unlike the earlier version of the Act which was in force prior to 15 July 1995, the relevant provisions of the present Act do not refer to undervalue transactions or unfair preferences being void (or, for that matter, voidable) (see <span class="font-italic">Buildspeed</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Theme Corp Pte Ltd and another </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 287 at [51]). Hence, I decline to declare that the Transfers to the Recipients are void or voidable as it serves no useful purpose to the Private Trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I shall now hear parties on the issue of costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Siew Guo Wei and Yeow Yuet Cheong (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the applicant; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first respondent absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chua Sui Tong and Tang Abigail (Rev Law LLC) for the second and third respondents; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The fourth respondent in person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
