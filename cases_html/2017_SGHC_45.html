If Metropole had wanted to raise this issue, it had had this document in its possession since 17 November 2015, well before DPL served the payment claim on Metropole (on 17 February 2016) and well before Metropole served its payment response (on 24 February 2016) and adjudication response (on 17 March 2016). Despite this, Metropole accepted throughout the adjudication that the contract sum was  $7,116,500 as stated in DPL’s payment claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 DPL submits that the adjudicator’s only obligation arising from the telephone call to DPL’s solicitors was to afford Metropole an opportunity to respond to the adjudicator’s two questions and to DPL’s response to them. Metropole had this opportunity. At no time did the adjudicator prevent Metropole from responding to the email. It is Metropole who chose not to respond to DPL’s email despite having had the opportunity to do so and the time to do so between 12.36 pm on 31 March 2016 and the issuance of the determination.

</div> Metropole’s argument is therefore no more than an afterthought, raised for the first time for purely tactical purposes in this setting aside application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The rule of impartiality</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Section 16(3) of the Act obliges an adjudicator to act in accordance with the rules of natural justice: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“an adjudicator shall –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) act independently, impartially and in a timely manner;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) avoid incurring unnecessary expense; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) comply with the principles of natural justice.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It can be seen that an adjudicator comes under a statutory obligation to act impartiality under two provisions of s 16(3). First, that obligation is set out expressly in s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Second, that obligation is implicit in his wider obligation to comply with the principles of natural justice under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). But there is no need to analyse these separate statutory obligations separately. The content of the obligation to act impartially under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is no different from the content of the obligation to act impartially in complying with the principles of natural justice under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). An adjudicator who breaches one also breaches the other (<span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>at [49]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The test for apparent bias in Singapore law was set out by Sundaresh Menon JC (as the Chief Justice then was) in <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar Alan</span>. The test is whether there are circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the decision-maker was biased in a fair-minded, reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The mere fact that a decision-maker communicates with one party to the proceedings does not lead, by itself, to the conclusion that he has failed to act impartially. In <span class="font-italic">Re Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Kalpanath</span>, the High Court recognised the existence of the principle that “a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings”. The High Court relied on <span class="font-italic">R v Magistrates Court at </span><span class="font-italic">Lilydale, ex p Ciccone</span> [1973] VR 122 to illustrate the principle: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88     In <span class="font-italic">R v Magistrates Court at </span><span class="font-italic">Lilydale, ex p Ciccone</span> [1973] VR 122, the court held that there was an appearance of bias where the magistrate accepted a lift to and from a view in a car in which counsel for one side and a witness were also passengers. McInerney J, at 27, described the responsibility of a judge as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The sound instinct of the legal profession – judges and practitioners alike – has always been that, <span class="font-italic">save in the most exceptional cases</span>, there should be no communication or association between the judge and one of the parties (or the legal advisers or witnesses of such a party), otherwise than in the presence of or with the previous knowledge and consent of the other party. Once the case is under way, or about to get under way, the judicial officer keeps aloof from the parties (and from their legal advisers and witnesses) and <span class="font-italic">neither he nor they should so act as to expose the judicial officer to a suspicion of having had communications with one party behind the back of or without the previous knowledge and consent of the other party.</span> <span class="font-italic">For if something is done which affords a reasonable basis for such suspicion, confidence in the impartiality of the judicial officer is undermined</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Communication or association by an adjudicator with one party in the absence of the other party is always to be avoided and is always undesirable. It is always to be deprecated by the court. It may even be said that it always, or almost always, gives rise to a suspicion of bias. It does not always, however, give rise to a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> suspicion of bias within the meaning of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Shankar Alan</span>. Whether it does will depend on the facts of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I find that the adjudicator did not breach the rule of impartiality when he communicated privately with DPL.

</div>
</div> I also have no basis to disbelieve the adjudicator’s evidence that he had tried to call Metropole’s solicitors to inform them of his conversation with DPL’s solicitors but was unable to reach them. Knowledge of these relevant and critical facts must be imputed to the fair-minded and reasonable person in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Although the adjudicator did not expressly ask Metropole for its response to his two questions or to DPL’s answers to his questions, I cannot find from that a reasonable suspicion of bias against Metropole, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that he would have rejected any response which Metropole might have taken upon itself to offer or any request by Metropole for an opportunity to do so. The fact that the adjudicator asked DPL’s solicitors to copy Metropole’s solicitors suggests quite the contrary. It suggests that he was open to the possibility that Metropole may take it upon itself to make submissions in response to DPL’s answers or, at the very least, ask him for an opportunity to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Metropole argues that s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Act places on the adjudicator a duty to direct Metropole to respond. I disagree. Section 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) provides that an adjudicator shall have regard to “the submissions and responses of the parties to the adjudication, and any other information or document provided at the request of the adjudicator in relation to the adjudication”. This does not mean that parties can make no submissions and furnish no responses that the adjudicator has not requested. That is not the practice. The antecedent for the phrase “at the request of the adjudicator” in this context is only “any other information or document”. In fact, s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of  the Act in my view would have operated to require the adjudicator to consider any response Metropole might have made to DPL’s email of 31 March 2016. Metropole might have more of an argument on apparent bias if it had asked for an opportunity to respond to DPL’s email but was denied it by the adjudicator, or if Metropole had actually responded to it and the adjudicator refused to take the response into account. But that is not what happened.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Metropole argues that it did not respond to DPL’s email of 31 March 2016 because it could have been estopped from relying on a breach of the rules of natural justice if it had done so. The authorities cited by Metropole do not support this position. For there to be a waiver, there must be a “clear and unequivocal act” by a party which shows that it does not intend to rely on a ground for a natural justice challenge available to it (<span class="font-italic">Paice</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55]). In <span class="font-italic">Farrelly</span>, the English High Court held at [31] that the fact that “the party asserting a breach of the rules of natural justice does nothing but continues with the adjudication” does not prevent that party from relying on the breach to resist enforcement. This principle would apply to the present case. Even if Metropole had responded to DPL’s email of 31 March 2016, it would nonetheless have been able to rely on the natural justice arguments it makes before me now. Also, Metropole’s fear that a response to DPL’s email would be construed as a waiver could easily have been addressed by Metropole expressly reserving its right in any response nevertheless to rely on the adjudicator’s breach of natural justice as a ground for setting aside the determination.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Metropole also argues that the adjudicator failed to act impartially because he was driven by his own pecuniary interest. The argument is that adjudicator was not concerned with Metropole’s response because he was more concerned with meeting his statutory deadline to issue his adjudication determination in order to earn his adjudication fee.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I reject this argument. The Act imposes tight deadlines on the parties and the adjudicator to establish a “fast and low cost adjudication system to resolve payment disputes” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (16 November 2004) vol 78 at col 1113 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, Minister of State for National Development)). There is thus a statutory intent that an adjudicator should work quickly. Section 31 of the Act further incentivises an adjudicators to issue his determinations in time because he will not be entitled to remuneration unless he meets the deadline. The framework of the Act therefore anticipates – and indeed expressly creates in order to advance the purposes of the Act – the adjudicator’s pecuniary interest which Metropole now complains of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Metropole has absolutely no basis for suggesting that the adjudicator prioritised his pecuniary interest in earning his fee over his duty to arrive at a fair and impartial determination of the payment claim dispute before him. The adjudicator’s conduct did not evince an intention to disregard any submissions Metropole may have advanced in order to meet his deadline. Neither does the adjudicator’s failure expressly to ask Metropole for a response lead a fair-minded and reasonable man to such a conclusion. Metropole’s argument that the adjudicator was driven by his self-interest in rendering his adjudication determination is entirely speculative. I therefore cannot find that the adjudicator failed to act impartially in rendering his adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The fair hearing rule and the materiality of the breach</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem </span>rule requires the adjudicator to receive both parties’ submissions and consider them (<span class="font-italic">AM Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Laguna National Golf and Country Club Ltd </span>[2009] SGHC 260 (“<span class="font-italic">AM Associates</span>”) at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the English case of <span class="font-italic">Dean and </span><span class="font-italic">Dyball</span>, a claimant sought to enforce an adjudication decision against a respondent by summary judgment. The respondent argued that the adjudicator had breached the rules of natural justice when he conducted separate interviews with the parties and their respective experts. Judge Richard Seymour QC held at [50] that while “there was no reason in law why an adjudicator should not have telephone conversation with one party to an adjudication on his own”, great caution must be exercised. He added at [52] that “if an adjudicator receives a communication about a matter of significance to the substance of the adjudication from one party alone in the absence of the other, he should inform the absent party of the substance of the communication so as to give that party an opportunity to deal with it if it wishes”. Insofar as the party who did not provide the information is concerned, “what is important is that it should be aware of the perception of the tribunal of what it has been told and the potential significance of that information from the tribunal’s point of view” (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I find that the adjudicator breached the <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem </span>rule when he communicated privately with DPL’s solicitors. The adjudicator had a telephone conversation with DPL’s solicitors in the absence of Metropole’s solicitors. That should not have happened. Once it happened, it was incumbent on the adjudicator <span class="font-italic">himself</span> to convey to Metropole the substance of the conversation so that Metropole could be aware from the adjudicator the potential significance of that conversation to his determination. This he failed to do. Instead, he relied on DPL’s solicitors to copy their email of 31 March 2016 to Metropole’s solicitors. His only response to the parties came at 6.01 pm by email. Even in that email, he did not inform Metropole of the contents of his conversation with DPL’s solicitors.

</div> Metropole therefore had no way of knowing what the adjudicator’s perception of the information he received was. Metropole cannot reasonably be expected to rely on its opponent’s own summary of the telephone conversation. There may have been matters which, without any intention on the part of DPL’s solicitors to mislead, were not recorded in sufficient detail or from which the nuance or emphasis was not clearly articulated in DPL’s email.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Metropole submits that if the adjudicator had asked Metropole to answer his two questions or to comment on DPL’s answers, it would have told the adjudicator to exclude the contingency sum of $500,000 from the total of $7,116,500. Metropole submits that it was entitled to do so despite not having addressed this reason for withholding payment in its payment response.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my view, there was no patent error. At [97] of <span class="font-italic">APV </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v APW Pte Ltd </span>[2013] SGSOP 24 (“<span class="font-italic">APV</span>”), the adjudicator explained that the approach under <span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic"> Y Steel</span> requires him to “examine the documents exhibited in the [a]djudication [a]pplication to see if there is any obvious contradiction between the said documents and the [p]ayment [c]laim.” He added that he looks for “what appears to be an obvious discrepancy between the [c]ontract documents and the … items of claim in the [p]ayment [c]laim”. I agree that the search for patent error must be so limited. And following this approach, it becomes apparent that what Metropole seeks to raise is not a discrepancy between documents. It is instead an argument that Metropole seeks to make to further its case, despite not having raised it in its payment response. Hence, even if the adjudicator had asked Metropole for its views (which he did not), Metropole would not be entitled to submit that the contingency sum of $500,000 should be omitted from the construction cost of $7,116,500 to arrive at the contract sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Having found that the adjudicator acted in breach of natural justice, I turn to the issue of materiality and prejudice. In my view, the breach was not sufficiently material as to cause prejudice to Metropole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The High Court recognised in <span class="font-italic">Aik Heng Contracts and Services Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Deshin Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2015] SGHC 293 (“<span class="font-italic">Aik Heng</span>”) at [24] that not all breaches of natural justice warrant the setting aside of an adjudication determination. There must be a material breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I note that unlike s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(vii) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10 2002 Rev Ed) (“AA”), there is nothing s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act – or indeed elsewhere in the Act – which expressly requires a breach of natural justice to occasion prejudice before an adjudication determination can be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, the analogy with arbitration is flawed. I say that for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, the power to set aside an arbitration award is a statutory power. It is established and regulated entirely by statute. The power to set aside an adjudication determination, on the other hand, is not a statutory power. It is an aspect of the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals at common law: Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Security of Payments and Construction Adjudication</span> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at para 19.9. The Act does not expressly require a breach of natural justice to occasion prejudice before an adjudication determination can be set aside simply because the Act does not create the power to set aside an adjudication determination or define the grounds which have to be established in order to do so. So the place to look for a rule which requires a breach of natural justice to be material or to occasion prejudice in order to justify setting aside an adjudication determination is the common law and not the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Second, an arbitrator’s award has full finality. An adjudicator's determination has only temporary finality. Despite a prior adjudication, the parties remain entirely free to go on to resolve their disputes with full finality (see <span class="font-italic">JRP &amp; Associates Pte Ltd v Kindly Construction &amp; Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 575 at [70] and <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>at [22]). That is why there is the latitude on an application to set aside an adjudication determination to assess the consequences of a breach of natural justice in the context of the provisional nature of a determination and the need for speedy disposition of adjudications proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Aik Heng</span> at [27]). That, to my mind, means that a court hearing an application to set aside an adjudication determination for a breach of the rules of natural justice has less reason to intervene in adjudication than in arbitration, not more. If an adjudicator reaches a determination on a dispute in breach of the rules of natural justice, and even if that breach could have affected the outcome of the determination, the aggrieved party will nevertheless have occasion in the future to have that dispute resolved with full finality and in compliance with the rules of natural justice. There is even less reason for the court to intervene if the breach of natural justice is immaterial to the outcome of the adjudication or has occasioned the aggrieved party no prejudice. This approach finds support in adjudication cases from England and New South Wales (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd v Lambeth Borough Council </span>[2002] EWHC 597 at [29] and <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd t/as Time Cost and Quality v Davenport &amp; Anor </span>[2004] NSWCA 394 at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I consider the adjudicator’s breach in this case to have been wholly immaterial. Metropole never alleged that the sum of $7,116,500 was not the correct base figure for computing DPL’s entitlement to staged fees. DPL’s payment claim clearly states that the “Construction Cost (based on the lowest tender received from Poplar Construction Pte Ltd)” is $7,116,500.

</div> One must not forget that the purpose of the Act is a quick determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I agree with DPL that an adjudicator does not need to address every argument made by parties in order to afford that party natural justice. In <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>, Andrew Ang J held at [45] that the adjudicator failed to accord Front Row natural justice because he had “explicitly stated … that he was disregarding [Front Row’s submissions]”. Notably, Ang J recognised that there were situations where an adjudicator would not be in breach of natural justice although he did not explicitly address every single one of a party's submissions (at [45]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“…Her Honour found that there was no breach of natural justice in SEF Construction because the adjudicator clearly had regard to the submissions of parties and the material before him in arriving at his decision. In contrast, I could not make a similar finding in the present case. The Arbitrator had explicitly stated, at paras 55 and 56 of the Award, that he was disregarding the issue concerning Daimler’s obligation to organise, brand and promote the Asian Cup Series because Front Row had ceased to rely on this issue. <span class="font-italic">This was not a case where he had had regard to Front Row’s submissions on the issue but accidentally omitted to state his reasons for rejecting the same or had found the same to be so unconvincing as to render it unnecessary to explicitly state his findings on it</span> (<span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span> at [60]).”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) said at [60]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case, having studied the Adjudication Determination, I am satisfied that the adjudicator did have regard to the submissions of the parties and their responses and the other material placed before him. <span class="font-italic">The fact that he did not feel it necessary to discuss his reasoning and explicitly state his conclusions</span> in relation to the third and fourth jurisdictional issues, though unfortunate in that it gave rise to fears on the part of SEF that its points were not thought about, <span class="font-italic">cannot mean that he did not have regard to those submissions at all.</span> It may have been an accidental omission on his part to indicate expressly why he was rejecting the submissions since the adjudicator took care to explain the reasons for his other determinations and even indicated matters on which he was not making a determination. Alternatively, <span class="font-italic">he may have found the points so unconvincing that he thought it was not necessary to explicitly state his findings</span>. Whatever may be the reason for the adjudicator’s omission in this respect, I do not consider that SEF was not afforded natural justice. <span class="font-italic">Natural justice requires that the parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions made.</span> I should also point out that SEF could have taken the opportunity to ask for a review adjudication once the Adjudication Determination had been issued and, if it had done so, SEF could have raised all the points before the review adjudicator that it had brought before the adjudicator.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 These authorities establish that the fact that this adjudicator did not find it necessary to discuss his reasoning and explicitly state his conclusions in relation to the Defences does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that he did not have regard to those submissions at all. This is even more so in view of the tight timelines imposed by the Act, which reveal a statutory intention that the adjudicator should work quickly. This may militate against the standards of thoroughness and detail that are to be expected where no externally imposed time pressure applies (see <span class="font-italic">Shellbridge</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd v Rider Hunt Sydney Pty Ltd </span>[2005] NSWSC 1152 at [15]). It would be entirely inimical to the quick and efficient adjudication of disputes to expect an adjudicator to go down every one of the losing party’s rabbit holes in his adjudication determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In any event, the facts indicate that the adjudicator did expressly address the First, Second, and Third Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 With respect to the First Defence, the adjudicator recognised at [49] of the adjudication determination that Metropole “had argued that s 5 of the Act clearly stated that payment is only when work is carried out or when goods and services are supplied”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 With respect to the Second Defence, the adjudicator found that Metropole was seeking to raise an additional reason for withholding payment which was not found in the payment response. He was therefore entitled – an indeed obliged – to disregard it by virtue of the bar in s 15(3) of the Act. It cannot then be said that he had breached the rules of natural justice in failing to address the Second Defence (see <span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd</span> [2008] SGHC 159 at [55], which was affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd </span>[2010] 1 SLR 658 at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Neither can it be said that the Second Defence does no more than raise a patent error. Metropole has not pointed me to any discrepancy in the documents before the adjudicator which would justify characterising the Second Defence as raising a patent error. It is like any other defence which Metropole sought to advance in favour of its case. The adjudicator was correct to apply the s 15(3) bar to it. This argument is therefore entirely without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 With respect to the Third Defence, the adjudicator may not have stated that all the SIA terms were incorporated in the contract but he made reference to Clause 2.3(3) of the contract and relied on it to compute the payment claim for the completed and uncompleted stages of the project (see adjudication determination at [29] – [51]). That is sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I note that the adjudicator did not expressly address the Fourth and Fifth Defence in the adjudication determination. But as I have mentioned, the mere failure to address issues in an adjudication determination explicitly, without more, is insufficient on its own to establish that there has been a breach of natural justice. Metropole has not provided further evidence to suggest that the adjudicator indeed disregarded its submissions in respect of these Defences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I therefore find that there was no breach of natural justice sufficient to warrant setting aside the adjudication determination on this ground either. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Another ground which Metropole relies upon to set aside the adjudication determination is that of jurisdiction. Metropole submits that the adjudicator acted in excess of his jurisdiction because he (i) determined that monies were due from Metropole to DPL in respect of claims which did not fall within the Act.; (ii) failed to independently assess the work that DPL claimed to have done; and (iii) failed to determine whether a written contract existed between the parties and to identify the terms therein.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of s 5 of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Metropole argues that the adjudicator acted in excess of jurisdiction by determining that money was due from Metropole to DPL in respect of claims which did not fall within the Act.

Under s 5 of the Act, a party who carries out “<span class="font-italic">any </span>construction work or supplies <span class="font-italic">any </span>goods or services under a construction contract is entitled to progress payments” (<span class="font-italic">Tienrui</span><span class="font-italic"> Design</span> at [30]) [emphasis added]. Section 2 of the Act defines a “progress payment” as “a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under a contract”. This includes “a single or one-off payment” or a payment based on “an event or a date”. This means that a contractor is entitled to payment for work done partially, as long as the event or date arises for such payment. It is then up to the parties to decide how much payment a contractor is entitled to following the event or date. I agree with DPL that by including cl 2.3(3) as part of their contract, the parties have chosen the conditions under which DPL will be remunerated for work done.

The express words of the clause do not refer to any breach of contract or loss that may be suffered by DPL. Instead, a plain reading of the clause suggests that it is a clause stipulating the conditions under which DPL is entitled to payment. In any case, the manner in which cl 2.3(3) should be interpreted is a matter that falls within the adjudicator’s jurisdiction and is an aspect of the merits of his determination. The adjudicator has interpreted cl 2.3(3) to exclude claims for stages of work for which no work has commenced. He has also found that DPL commenced works for stages E and H but not for stages L, M, and N.

I note that the adjudicator did not give extensive reasons for his determination with respect to stages E and H of the project. Instead, he repeated DPL’s submission that it believed that all the documents and drawings necessary to complete its obligations under these stages had been prepared (see adjudication determination at [44]). The adjudicator then concluded in the subsequent paragraph that “the claimant had commenced work for [those] stages”. Metropole submits that this suggests that the adjudicator did not assess the merits of the claims for stages E and H. I disagree. The fact that the adjudicator articulated DPL’s belief in [44] of the adjudication determination must necessarily mean that the adjudicator held the same view which led to his finding that work for those stages had commenced. It should not matter that he did not use the words “I find”, or words to that effect, to indicate expressly that he had assessed the merits of the claim and was making an independent finding thereof. The adjudicator is entitled to readily find in favour of the claimant on the merits of his claim. He is also entitled to adopt DPL’s arguments to justify his decision. I am therefore not satisfied that the adjudicator failed to independently assess the claims by DPL for work done.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failure to determine existence of contract and terms therein</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Metropole submits that the adjudicator also exceeded his jurisdiction

At [22] of the adjudication determination, the adjudicator explained that although “[t]here was no specific agreement where both parties had signed that might suggest they have a contract in writing”, “there were numerous documents included in the adjudication application and also in the adjudication response that would satisfy the provisions in s4(3) of the Act for the parties to be treated as if they are parties to a contract in writing”. Hence, not only did the adjudicator make a clear finding that a written contract existed between Metropole and DPL, he also went to the extent of asking himself the specific statutory question by setting out s 4(3) of the Act, which stipulates the situations in which “a contract shall be treated as being made in writing” (see also adjudication determination at [21]). In fact, Metropole appears to concede that the adjudicator did find that the parties had entered into a written contract. At paragraph 320 of its submissions dated 5 July 2016, Metropole acknowledges that the adjudicator found that “there was enough evidence before him for him to find a ‘contract treated as being made in writing’”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Metropole argues that it is a jurisdictional requirement that the adjudicator identify the terms that govern the parties’ agreement and that he failed to do so. Assuming that to be correct, I am of the view that the adjudicator did make a finding with respect to the terms that governed the contract between Metropole and DPL. He may not have expressly stated that the terms of the contract between DPL and Metropole are precisely the same as the terms of the contract between the LLP and Metropole; that is nonetheless implicit beyond doubt in his determination. The adjudicator found that the LLP’s contract terms with Metropole carried over to DPL’s contract with Metropole. This is seen from his reference to the regulatory authorities, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that DPL stepped into the shoes of the LLP. This necessarily means that the adjudicator rejected Metropole’s argument that the SIA terms were not incorporated into DPL’;s contract with Metropole.

</div> It is not necessary for the adjudicator, who faces strict time constraints, to expressly state every finding he makes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Metropole argues that the adjudicator was not entitled to make such a finding because of the non-assignment clause in the SIA terms and the disapplication of the CRTPA.

</div> In my view, it is within an adjudicator’s jurisdiction to determine the terms that govern the parties’ contract and to interpret these terms. What <span class="font-italic">Northbuild</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Laing O’Rourke</span> suggest is that when an adjudicator does not apply the contract as he interprets it, but instead determines the claim upon some other basis, he acts outside his jurisdiction. In the present case, the adjudicator made his decision based on the SIA terms and not upon some other basis. Whether he found correctly that the SIA terms applied to the parties’ contractual relationship, however, is an issue that goes to the merits of the adjudicator’s decision. Even if he made an error, it was within his jurisdiction to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 For all these reasons, I find that there is no basis to suggest that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction in determining the dispute between Metropole and DPL.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 To conclude, I dismiss Metropole’s application in its entirety. There are no grounds upon which to find that the adjudicator acted in excess of jurisdiction or breached a rule of natural justice that was sufficiently material as to cause Metropole prejudice and justify setting aside the adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Because Metropole’s application has been dismissed, I order that Metropole shall pay the costs of and incidental to this application, such costs fixed at $11,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.
