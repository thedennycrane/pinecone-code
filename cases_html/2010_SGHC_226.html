<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Yip Kok Seng
                    (“Mr Yip”) said that he is a registered acupuncturist with
                    the defendant, The Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (“the
                    Board”) and not a full Traditional Chinese Medicine (“TCM”)
                    physician. He runs a wellness centre at Block 463 #02-21 Crawford Lane
                    known as the National and Electro Wellness Centre (“the
                    Centre”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       He had two primary complaints. The first was
                    that the Board had acted <em>ultra vires</em> its powers
                    when it acted on a complaint made by [B] on 2 May 2008 which was not
                    supported by a statutory declaration as required by Reg 3(2) of the
                    Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners (Investigation of Complaints)
                    Regulations (Cap 333A, Rg 4, 2002 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The second was that the Board lacked
                    jurisdiction to investigate a second complaint dated 2 June 2008 by [B]
                    because the conduct complained of was not performed in the course of a healing
                    session under TCM methods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In his action, Mr Yip sought the following
                    reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    There be a
                            declaration that the [Board] lacks the jurisdiction to investigate
                            [Mr Yip’s] conduct in respect of a complaint made against him
                            by [B] on 2 June 2008 because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    The conduct complained of was not performed in
                                the course of a healing session under [TCM]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    The [Board] has no powers to look into matters
                                outside the practice of [TCM].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    There be a declaration that the [Board] had acted
                                <em>ultra vires</em> its powers when it acted
                            on a complaint made by [B] on 2 May 2008 which was not supported by
                            a mandatory Statutory Declaration of [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The [Board] be restrained from convening hearings
                            of the Investigation Committee under [S 28 of the Traditional
                            Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act (Cap 333A, 2001 Rev Ed)]
                            pending the hearing of this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The [Board] be directed to refer the complaint of
                            [B] to the police for a formal investigation into the allegation of
                            molest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The costs of this application may be provided for
                            in [Mr Yip’s] favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the hearing before me, Mr P
                    Padman(“Mr Padman”), who was Mr Yip’s counsel,
                    said he would withdraw prayer 4. Prayer 3 would also be withdrawn since I would
                    be hearing the application before the Investigation Committee
                    (“IC”) convened its hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Eventually, Mr Yip was not successful on
                    the remaining prayers, <em>ie</em>, prayers 1 and 2.
                    However, in the course of arguments, a preliminary point was raised which is of
                    general importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I will state some background facts briefly
                    before I elaborate on the preliminary point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 2 May 2008, [B] complained to the Board
                    that Mr Yip had checked her private parts during her second appointment
                    with him, without the presence of a female nurse, and that he had molested
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       An Inspection Officer of the Board, Toh Keng
                    Wang (“Mr Toh”) was then sent to the Centre on 6 May
                    2008 to look into the matter. Mr Toh said that the purpose of his visit was
                    to inspect the Centre and the medical records maintained by Mr Yip to
                    confirm whether [B] did attend at the Centre on the dates she mentioned and the
                    type of treatment administered by Mr Yip. Mr Toh said that he informed
                    Mr Yip that the Board had received a written complaint and he briefly
                    described the nature of the complaint to him. Mr Toh requested to inspect
                    [B]’s medical records which Mr Yip acceded to. Copies were made for
                    Mr Toh. Mr  Yip then denied molesting [B] on the day of her second
                    appointment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 8 May 2008, the Board replied to [B]
                    to inform her that a complaint would have to be supported by a statutory
                    declaration and enclosed a form of the statutory declaration for her
                use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 2 June 2008, [B] lodged her complaint
                    with the required statutory declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Board was satisfied that the 2 June
                    2008 complaint disclosed a <em>prima facie</em> case for
                    inquiry. Accordingly, on 17 June 2008, Mr Yip was notified of the
                    2 June 2008 complaint with a copy of that complaint and [B]’s
                    statutory declaration. He was also invited to submit his written explanation to
                    the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Thereafter, between 3 July to
                    20 August 2008, there ensued a series of correspondence between Mr Yip
                    and the Board or the Board’s solicitors in which Mr Yip stated,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, his explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 30 December 2008, Mr Yip wrote to
                    the Board to inquire about the status of the complaint. On 2 January 2009,
                    the Executive Secretary of the Board replied that the Board had directed that
                    the matter be referred to an IC. As mentioned above, the crux of
                    Mr Yip’s complaint about this direction was that he was not
                    performing a healing session using TCM methods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The preliminary point</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Ms Chew, counsel for the Board, raised
                    the preliminary point that as regards prayer 1, the proper remedy was not a
                    declaration but <em>certiorari</em> and therefore
                    Mr Yip should have proceeded by way of O 53 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“O 53”). O 53
                    requires leave to be first granted. On the other hand, Mr Padman argued
                    that Mr Yip was not seeking a quashing order so he was not obliged to apply
                    for leave to make his application under prayer 1. This preliminary point is of
                    general importance and took up a considerable part of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The bifurcated procedural regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The preliminary point is founded on the
                    bifurcated regime for obtaining remedies in an administrative law action. The
                    prerogative remedies of mandamus, prohibition and <em>certiorari</em> are to be obtained via the procedure prescribed in
                    O 53, which, as mentioned above, requires <em>inter
                        alia</em> leave to be granted. Other remedies, including a
                    declaration, are to be obtained via the normal originating processes. The two
                    processes are exclusive – declaratory relief is not available under
                    O 53: see the High Court decision in <em>Re Application by
                        Dow Jones (Asia) Inc</em> [1987] SLR(R) 627 and the Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for
                        Information and the Arts</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 294 at [5] and
                    [6].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Our O 53 derives from the pre-1977
                    O 53 in the English equivalent (“English O 53”) of the
                    Rules of the Supreme Court 1965, with the distinction that it is (since 1994)
                    begun by <em>ex parte</em> originating summons and not
                    originating motion. The procedure is both uncertain and cumbersome. It is not
                    clear whether certain processes applicable to ordinary originating summons, such
                    as discovery, are applicable in addition to those prescribed under O 53. An
                    applicant seeking both prerogative and ordinary remedies is obliged to proceed
                    via two separate originating processes, and again it is not clear whether
                    subsequent consolidation is possible. From the perspective of a public body, it
                    enjoys the procedural protection in O 53, such as the requirement for leave
                    and the limitation of time, in respect of actions for the prerogative remedies,
                    but not in actions for other remedies. A detailed consideration of these
                    procedural issues can be found in Lord Diplock’s leading speech in
                        <em>O’Reilly v Mackman</em> [1983] 2 AC 237
                    (“O’Reilly”) at 280–282.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In England, the position was changed in 1977
                    upon the recommendation of the Law Commission: see <em>Report on
                        Remedies in Administrative Law</em> (Law Com No 73), 1976
                    Cmnd 6407; S.I. 1977 No. 1955. The English O 53 was deleted
                    and replaced with a procedure known as “the application for judicial
                    review”, under which the court can award declaratory and injunctive
                    relief and damages as an alternative or in addition to the prerogative remedies.
                    Reforms have also been made by other jurisdictions: see the Ontario Judicial
                    Review Procedure Act (RSO 1990, c J1), s 2; the New Zealand
                    Judicature Amendment Act 1972 (Act 130 of 1972), s 4; and the
                    Malaysian Rules of the High Court 1980, O 53.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It may be that reform is also needed in
                    Singapore, but that is something for the Rules Committee to decide. For present
                    purposes the bifurcated regime meant that I had to decide whether declaration
                    was an appropriate relief for Mr Yip’s prayer 1, and similarly
                    whether Mr Yip should have proceeded by way of <em>certiorari</em> and sought leave first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I should also observe that, because of our
                    bifurcated regime, the <em>ratio</em> of <em>O’Reilly</em>, cited by Ms Chew, is inapplicable to
                    Singapore. In that case, the House of Lords held that it would generally be
                    contrary to public policy and an abuse of the process of the court for a
                    plaintiff complaining of a public authority's infringement of his public law
                    rights to seek redress by ordinary action. However, the basis of <em>O’Reilly</em> is the presence of a unified procedure by
                    which all the remedies for the infringement of public law rights could be
                    obtained. In Singapore, we do not have such a unified procedure. Even in
                    Malaysia, where there is a unified procedure, it has been held by the Federal
                    Court that an application for a declaration can sometimes be made by ordinary
                    action: see <em>YAB Dato’ Dr Zambry bin Abd Kadir &amp; ors
                        v YB Sivakumar a/l Varatharaju Naidu (Attorney General Malaysia,
                        Intervener)</em> [2009] 4 MLJ 24.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I should also refer to <em>Chan
                        Hiang Leng Colin v PP</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 209, which was again
                    cited by Ms Chew. The relevant issue in that case was whether the
                    Minister’s decision to prohibit certain publications could be challenged
                    in a Magistrate’s Appeal from a conviction by the district court for
                    possessing those publications. The High Court appeared to take the view that
                        <em>O’Reilly</em> was <em>prima
                        facie</em> applicable, but in the end decided that there was an
                    exception because the parties were <em>ad idem</em> as to
                    the court’s competence to decide all the issues raised. The correctness of
                    this approach was not fully argued before me. For present purposes, I am content
                    to reiterate that the basis of the <em>O’Reilly</em>
                    principle is the existence of a unified procedure for judicial review. As
                    mentioned, the procedure in Singapore is bifurcated, and hence the only
                    preliminary question here is whether Mr Yip should have applied for
                        <em>certiorari</em> under O 53.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Certiorari or declaration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the following passage in HWR Wade,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One result of the procedural handicaps and incompatibilities mentioned
                        above [in relation to the old English O 53] was that a kind of rivalry
                        developed between <em>certiorari</em> (and prohibition)
                        on the one hand and the declaratory judgment on the other. This is worth
                        brief notice because it formed the background to the subsequent
                        reforms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The story goes back about thirty years, to a time when it seemed that
                            <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition might almost be
                        put out of business by the rapidly developing remedy of declaration, aided
                        where necessary by injunction. In legal history a shift of this kind from
                        inferior to superior remedies is a familiar method of progress. In the
                        United States declarations and injunctions have taken the place of
                        certiorari to quash in federal administrative law for over sixty years ...
                        There have been signs that a similar change might take place in England,
                        where likewise the evolution of remedies is governed by the survival of the
                        fittest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The advantages of the declaration were brought into prominence in 1953 in
                            <em>Barnard v National Dock Labour Board</em>
                        [1953] 2 QB 18. Dock workers in London had been dismissed for refusing
                        to operate a new system for the unloading of raw sugar. After there had been
                        a prolonged dock strike the men began actions for declarations that their
                        dismissal was illegal. When they obtained discovery of documents from the
                        Dock Labour Board they found that the vital order had been made not by the
                        local board but by the port manager, who had no power to make it. Thus they
                        won their case. But had they applied for <em>certiorari</em> they would probably have been unable to discover
                        the irregularity and they would have been out of time, more than six months
                        having expired. The Court of Appeal observed that <em>certiorari</em> was ‘hedged around by limitations’
                        and that it was right to grant declarations and injunctions to prevent
                        statutory tribunals from disregarding the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This policy of encouraging litigants to circumvent the limitations of
                            <em>certiorari</em> was twice adopted by the House
                        of Lords in later cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The two cases referred to were <em>Vine v National Dock Labour Board</em> [1957] AC 488 and
                        <em>Pyx Granite Co Ltd v Ministry of Housing and Local
                        Government</em> [1960] AC 260 (“<em>Pyx
                        Granite</em>”). In the first case, a dismissed labourer sought
                    a declaration that his dismissal was illegal, <em>ultra
                        vires</em> and void. In the second case, a company sought declarations
                    that a proposed development was in accordance with statute law, and that
                    ministerial decisions refusing them permission in respect of part of their
                    proposed development and granting permission subject to certain conditions in
                    relation to other parts of their operations were of no effect. In both cases the
                    declaratory relief sought was granted. Lord Goddard’s speech in the second
                    case (which Lord Oaksey agreed with) included the following passage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was also argued that if there was a remedy obtainable in the High Court
                        it must be by way of <em>certiorari</em>. I know of no
                        authority for saying that if an order or decision can be attacked by
                            <em>certiorari</em> the court is debarred from
                        granting a declaration in an appropriate case. The remedies are not mutually
                        exclusive, though no doubt there are some orders, notably convictions before
                        justices, where the only appropriate remedy is <em>certiorari</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>O’Reilly</em>, (<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 246, Lord Diplock also observed in
                    his leading speech that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prior to the institution of the application for judicial review there was
                        a long line of authority to the effect that a plaintiff could choose whether
                        to apply for a prerogative writ or to sue for a declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In support of this proposition, Lord Diplock referred to Lord
                    Goddard’s speech in <em>Pyx Granite</em>, and
                        <em>Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation</em> [1969]
                    2 AC 147.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There is also the Malaysian case of <em>Teh Guan Teik v Inspector General of Police &amp; anor</em>
                    [1998] 3 MLJ 137 (“<em>Teh Guan
                    Teik</em>”) which Mr Padman referred me to. There, Peh Swee
                    Chin FCJ, after reviewing the authorities and referring to O 15
                    r 16 of the Malaysian Rules of the High Court, concluded at p 148
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The entrenched principle that declaration and <em>certiorari</em> are not mutually exclusive and are concurrent
                        remedies was asserted several times in the United Kingdom and followed by
                        our courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge also said at p 150:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to make a general observation before I end this judgment of
                        mine, <em>ie</em> that a claim for a declaration is a
                        very efficient remedy for an aggrieved citizen against ultra vires actions
                        of all public authorities or governmental bodies. It has no coercive force
                        by itself, inter alia, so that no such governmental body need feel the
                        threat of such force. Thus, if a person’s rights are affected by an
                        order from such a public authority, he can sue for a declaration of the
                        impropriety of the said order and if he succeeds, he can ignore the said
                        order with impunity; see <em>Dyson v Attorney
                            General</em> [1911] 1 KB 410; or if a government servant
                        categorized under art 132 of the Federal Constitution is dismissed from his
                        post, he can claim a declaration that he still holds it. See <em>Surinder Singh Kanda v Government of Federation of
                            Malaya</em> [1962] MLJ 169.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I make no comment on the English judicial
                    policy, described by Professor Wade, of encouraging litigants to circumvent the
                    limitations of <em>certiorari</em>. But it appears to me
                    that the expansive approach taken towards declaratory relief is justified by the
                    wording of O 15 r 16 of our Rules of Court, which is similar to
                    O 25 r 5 of the English Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 and O 15
                    r 16 of the Malaysian Rules of the High Court in <em>Teh
                        Guan Teik</em>. Our O 15 r 16 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Declaratory judgment (O. 15, r. 
                            16)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16. No action or other proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground
                        that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court
                        may make binding declarations of right <em>whether or not any
                            consequential relief is or could be claimed</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, on a plain reading of O 15 r 16, the fact that
                        <em>certiorari</em> is or could be claimed is not a
                    ground for refusing declaratory relief. The wide powers of the court to give
                    declaratory relief also mean that there is likely to be a large degree of
                    overlap between declaration and <em>certiorari</em>. The
                    following exposition in HWR Wade &amp; C F Forsyth, <em>Administrative Law</em>, 10<sup>th</sup> Ed
                    (Oxford, 2009) at pp 480–481 on the utility of the declaration and
                    the history of the remedy is also helpful:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Declaratory judgments play a large part in private law and are a
                        particularly valuable remedy for settling disputes before they reach the
                        point where a right is infringed. The essence of a declaratory judgment is
                        that is states the rights or legal positon of the parties as they stand,
                        without changing them in any way; though it may be supplemented by other
                        remedies in suitable cases ... In administrative law there are additional
                        advantages, as in cases where it is difficult to choose the right remedy or
                        where the ordinary remedy is for some reason unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The common law, with its insistence on compulsory remedies and its horror
                        of maintenance and procedural abuse, long refused to countenance judgments
                        that were merely declaratory; and so did the Court of Chancery. But they
                        were needed inevitably in proceedings against the Crown, since in that case
                        there was no means of enforcement, so that they were in regular use in
                        connection with petitions of right and on the equity side of the Exchequer.
                        Scots law had the action of declarator, which Lord Brougham attempted to
                        import into England with only small success at first. Acts of 1850 and 1852
                        empowered the Court of Chancery to make declarations of right, but they were
                        construed as narrowly as possible by a still mistrustful judiciary. Even the
                        Judicature Acts 1873–75 did not implant any such power generally in
                        the remodelled judicial system. It arrived finally only with the rules of
                        court of 1883. It must therefore be considered a statutory rather than an
                        equitable remedy. The surprising thing is that this form of relief,
                        indispensable in any modern system of law, should be so recent an
                        invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[O 25 r 5 of the 1883 rules] is still the rule today, and the
                        courts have grown accustomed to using it very freely. A declaratory judgment
                        by itself merely states some existing legal situation. It requires no one to
                        do anything and to disregard it will not be contempt of court. By enabling a
                        party to discover what his legal position is, it opens the way to the use of
                        other remedies for giving effect to it, if that should be necessary ... The
                        declaration is a discretionary remedy. This important characteristic
                        probably derives not from the fact that the power to grant it was first
                        conferred on the Court of Chancery, but from the discretionary power
                        conferred by the rule of court. There is thus ample jurisdiction to prevent
                        its abuse...</p>

                    [1964] 1 All ER 448 (“<em>Punton</em>”).
                    In that case, the plaintiffs’ claims for unemployment benefit were
                    dismissed by the National Insurance Commissioner. They then sought a court
                    declaration that each of them was entitled to unemployment benefit. Apparently,
                    the plaintiffs could have challenged the decision of the Commissioner by
                        <em>certiorari</em> proceedings but they had to do so
                    within six months of his decision. Having failed to do so, they sought the
                    declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the High Court, Philimore J decided he
                    had jurisdiction to grant the declaration sought but he declined to do so. The
                    plaintiffs appealed against his decision and the Ministry of Pensions and
                    National Insurance cross-appealed against his decision that there was
                    jurisdiction to grant the declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Court of Appeal decided that there was no
                    jurisdiction to grant the declaration. Sellers LJ said at
                    pp 454-455:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that the Court of Queen’s Bench has an
                        inherent jurisdiction to control inferior tribunals in a supervisory
                        capacity and to do so by <em>certiorari</em> (which
                        would be the relevant procedure in this case) which enables the court to
                        quash the decision if the inferior court can be shown to have exceeded its
                        jurisdiction or to have erred in law. Neither <em>certiorari</em> nor mandamus usurp the function of a tribunal but
                        require it, having quashed its decision, to hear the case and determine it
                        correctly. There may be many cases where a summons for a declaration is at
                        least an adequate substitute for <em>certiorari</em>
                        proceedings and where it may have advantages over it with no defects. That
                        would be so where an authoritative statement of the law by the High Court
                        will serve to undermine a decision or order so that it need not be complied
                        with and could not in the light of the pronouncement of the law be
                        successfully enforced. This may arise, for instance, under the Town and
                        Country Planning legislation or the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment)
                        Order, 1947, but in the present case the plaintiffs claim benefit under the
                        Act in question and the position can be contrasted with that which arose in
                            [<em>Pyx Granite</em>] where Lord Jenkins said
                        ... at p 303:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“the company here cannot be said to occupy the position of the
                            undertakers in <em>Barraclough v. Brown</em>. They
                            are not seeking to enforce statutory rights by methods other than those
                            prescribed by the Act creating them. They are merely seeking to
                            ascertain the extent of their statutory liabilities.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Without employing the methods set out in the National Insurance Act, 1946,
                        that is without obtaining an award, the plaintiffs cannot enforce the
                        statutory right to unemployment benefit they claim and the decision in
                            <em>Barraclough v Brown</em> is more closely
                        applicable than the many other authorities cited to us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apart from <em>certiorari</em> there is no machinery
                        for getting rid of the decision of the National Insurance Commissioner and,
                        what is more important, no way of substituting an effective award on which
                        the claims could be paid. It would be out of harmony with all authority to
                        have two contrary decisions between the same parties on the same issues
                        obtained by different procedures, as it were on parallel courses which never
                        met or could meet, and where the effective decision would remain with the
                        inferior tribunal and not that of the High Court. I conceive that to be the
                        case here, and it seems to me to lead to a conclusion against the
                        jurisdiction of the High Court in this particular matter. …</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are a number of factors which in practice the court normally takes
                        into consideration in exercising its discretion. It is usual not to grant a
                        declaration where there are alternative remedies available and adequate and
                        had not been exhausted unless difficult and doubtful questions of law are
                        involved. It is the practice for the court not to interfere where the
                        statute has prescribed a mode of procedure for the parties to seek redress.
                        The court would not make a futile declaration. A declaration would have no
                        effect on the Collector’s award because it does not quash. Only
                            <em>certiorari</em> quashes. A declaration can go
                        no further than to state that the impugned order is invalid. Until it is so
                        quashed the order or the award remains binding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He then referred to the judgment of Sellers LJ in <em>Punton</em> and said at p 98:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus said it leaves me only to stress that a declaration is only as good a
                        substitute for <em>certiorari</em> where it seeks in
                        the words of Lord Justice Sellers just mentioned “to undermine a
                        decision or order so that it need not be complied with and could not in the
                        light of the pronouncement of the law be successfully enforced”.
                        Clearly, those conditions would not work to dislodge and quash the
                        Collector’s order by a declaration because the order has already been
                        made and complied with; namely, the land has already been registered in the
                        name of the defendant. And it follows that in so far as enforcing the order
                        is concerned the question hardly arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the purposes of reaching a decision, it
                    was sufficient for me to note that Mr Yip’s complaint was that the
                    Board acted <em>ultra vires</em> in investigating a
                    complaint of molest in the course of a healing session which did not fall within
                    the ambit of traditional Chinese medicine. If Mr Yip succeeded on this
                    point, a declaration would suffice – an <em>ultra
                        vires</em> decision is a nullity and after it is declared to be so
                    there is nothing left to be quashed by <em>certiorari</em>.
                    Also, since Ms Chew had informed me that the Board had, very properly,
                    suspended further steps pending my decision and would abide by it, there was no
                    need for <em>certiorari</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I should mention that Ms Chew did not
                    argue that the Board was in any way vexed or otherwise prejudiced because
                    Mr Yip did not proceed by way of O 53. She did make a policy argument
                    that allowing Mr Yip to proceed by way of an ordinary originating summons
                    would encourage future litigants to circumvent O 53. Such an argument was
                    also raised in <em>Drilex Systems Pte Ltd v Registrar of
                        Companies &amp; anor</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 511 but the court there
                    did not make a ruling on the argument. I was not persuaded by such an argument.
                    The court is well equipped to handle such abuses of process as and when they
                    arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Moreover, in respect of prayer 2, the
                    complaint was against Mr Toh’s investigation on 6 May 2008. That
                    act had been completed and had no continuing legal effect which could be
                    quashed. In the circumstances, I was of the view that a declaration would be the
                    only possible remedy for that investigation, should I find that it was
                    illegal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     If I were to compel Mr Yip to proceed
                    under O 53 for prayer 1, it would mean that he would have to proceed by way
                    of two applications, instead of one, for prayers 1 and 2 respectively. I did not
                    think it was right to order him to do so in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Accordingly, I decided that declaratory relief
                    was appropriate for the complaints made by Mr Yip in his prayers 1 and 2
                    and that he was not required to proceed by way of O 53 to obtain <em>certiorari</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The substantive merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As regards the substantive merits of prayer 1,
                    I accepted the general principle stated in <em>Wong Keng Leong
                        Rayney v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 934 that
                    it should be for the IC to decide in the first instance whether it has the
                    jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matter brought before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As regards prayer 2, the Board accepted that
                    it could not act on a complaint without a statutory declaration. Although the
                    Board purported to act on the 2 May 2008 complaint when Mr Toh was
                    sent to the Premises to investigate, the Board took the position that under
                    s 30(1) of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act
                    (Cap 333A, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), its authorized
                    officer could conduct investigations without a complaint. Section 30(1)
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>30</b>. —(1)   The Board may in
                        writing authorise any officer —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    to enter and inspect any premises which are used
                            or proposed to be used, or in respect of which there is reasonable cause
                            to believe that they are being used, for the carrying out of any
                            prescribed practice of [TCM];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    to inquire into and to report to the Board the
                            conditions under which any prescribed practice of [TCM] is being or is
                            proposed to be carried out by any person;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    to observe the conduct by any person of any course
                            in any prescribed practice of [TCM]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    to enter and inspect any premises where any such
                            course is or is proposed to be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I agreed that s 30(1) of the Act was not
                    premised on a complaint being made. For that reason, I declined to make a
                    declaration in terms of prayer 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, I was of the view that the scope of
                    the power of the Board’s officer to investigate under s 30(1) of the
                    Act is circumscribed by that provision and it did not empower Mr Toh to
                    inspect medical records. I made this observation at the hearing and I also take
                    this opportunity to remind the governing bodies of regulatory, professional and
                    other organisations that they should ensure that they act in accordance with
                    their power and duties under law. If they fail to do so, they should be prepared
                    to acknowledge the fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Although Mr Yip was not successful on his
                    substantive application, he had succeeded on the preliminary point which took
                    some time. In the circumstances, I decided that each party was to bear his/its
                    own costs of the application.</p>
