In the HK Judgment, D1 was ordered to pay the Claimant USD 7,140,096.20 plus interest, and the Defendants were ordered to jointly and severally pay the Claimant USD 220,620,022.33 plus interest. In OA 302, the Claimant was granted an order of court (“Registration Order”) to register the HK Judgment as a judgment of the General Division of the High Court of the Republic of Singapore. The Claimant then filed Summons No 2727 of 2022 (“SUM 2727”) to apply to serve the notice of the registration of the HK Judgment (“Notice of Registration”) on D1 by way of substituted service. SUM 2727 was granted by an Assistant Registrar (the “AR”). The present application, Summons No 3123 of 2022 (“SUM 3123”), was D1’s application to set aside the Registration Order and, further or alternatively, to set aside the order of court granting substituted service (“Substituted Service Order”) of the Notice of Registration and the substituted service effected pursuant to that order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This application raised both legal and evidential issues that required nuanced analysis. The first legal issue was the circumstances under which a claimant would have to first attempt to serve a notice of registration of a foreign judgment on a defendant out of jurisdiction before resorting to substituted service. This issue turned on the factual question of whether the Claimant knew or should have known that D1 was residing in Beijing in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) at the time SUM 2727 was made. The second legal issue was whether a notice of registration could be served by substituted service out of jurisdiction under the new Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”), as the ROC 2021 was silent on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing the parties’ submissions, I dismissed D1’s application and provided my brief reasons orally. I now provide the full grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Claimant was a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. D1 and D2 were Singapore citizens. D2 was D1’s son. It was undisputed that, according to D1’s “People Profile” registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”), D1’s place of residence was at Gallop Road in Singapore (“Gallop Road Address”). D2’s place of residence was in the Balmoral Hills condominium in Singapore (“Balmoral Hills Address”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Hong Kong Suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In Action No 1972 of 2020 (“HK Suit”), the Claimant brought a claim at the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Court of First Instance against the Defendants for liabilities arising from guarantees which the Defendants provided to the Claimant. On 15 June 2021, the Claimant applied for summary judgment against the Defendants. On 20 April 2022, the court delivered the HK Judgment and granted summary judgment in favour of the Claimant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">OA 302: The application to register the HK Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 6 July 2022, the Claimant filed OA 302 to register the HK Judgment as a judgment of the General Division of the High Court of the Republic of Singapore (“SG Judgment”) pursuant to s 4 of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act 1959 (2020 Rev Ed) (“REFJA”). On 7 July 2022, the AR granted OA 302. This was recorded in the Registration Order (HC/ORC 3481/2022), which was in Form 88 of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (“SupCt PD 2021”). The Registration Order also stated that the Defendants were at liberty to apply to set aside the Registration Order within 21 days after service of the Notice of Registration on them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 As there were two defendants, two separate notices of registration were issued for each defendant: the notice of registration for D2 was dated 15 July 2022 (“D2 notice of registration”) while the Notice of Registration for D1 was dated 20 July 2022. I shall refer to the two notices of registration collectively as the “Notices of Registration”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Attempts to personally serve D1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 From 15 to 22 July 2022, the Claimant made five attempts to personally serve the Registration Order and D2 notice of registration on D2 at the Balmoral Hills Address. However, all five attempts were unsuccessful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 20 and 21 July 2022, the Claimant made two attempts to personally serve the Registration Order and the Notice of Registration on D1 on the Gallop Road Address. The evidence from the process server who attempted to effect personal service was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) on Wednesday, 20 July 2022, at or about 8.10pm, upon the process server’s arrival, he was informed by D1’s domestic helper that D1 was not in; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) on Thursday, 21 July 2022, at or about 7.50pm, upon the process server’s arrival, he was informed by a Chinese woman claiming to be D1’s wife that D1 was in the PRC and she did not know when he would be back.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">SUM 2718 and SUM 2727: The substituted service applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 22 July 2022, the Claimant filed Summons No 2718 of 2022 (“SUM 2718”) and SUM 2727 to serve the respective Notices of Registration on D2 and D1 respectively, as well as any other documents to be filed in OA 302 which were required to be served personally (collectively, the “Registration Papers”), by way of substituted service in the following methods:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) sending a copy of the Registration Papers (i) by registered post to the Hong Kong address of Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley Austin HK”), who were the Defendants’ counsel in the HK Suit, and (ii) by email to Sidley Austin HK; <span class="font-italic">or</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) sending a copy of the Registration Papers by registered post to the Balmoral Hills Address and the Gallop Road Address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 27 July 2022, the Claimant requested permission to withdraw SUM 2718. On 28 July 2022, a hearing for both SUM 2718 and SUM 2727 was fixed before the same AR who had granted OA 302. The AR granted the Claimant permission to withdraw SUM 2718. The learned AR also granted the application in SUM 2727 but ordered the methods of substituted service outlined at [10(a)] and [10(b)] above to be <span class="font-italic">cumulative</span>, as opposed to alternative, methods. Therefore, the Claimant had to serve by <span class="font-italic">both </span>methods outlined at [10(a)] and [10(b)] above. This was recorded in the Substituted Service Order (HC/ORC 3822/2022). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 It was undisputed that, on 2 August 2022, the Claimant duly served the Registration Order, the Substituted Service Order, and the Notice of Registration on D1 by registered post and by email to Sidley Austin HK.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It was undisputed that the Claimant did not attempt to effect service on D1 in the PRC before attempting to personally serve on D1 at the Gallop Road Address or before making the application in SUM 2727.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 D1 made two principal submissions to set aside the Registration Order.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, D1 sought to set aside the Substituted Service Order on three alternative grounds: (i) the Claimant had not shown that it would be impractical to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC, so the Claimant should have attempted to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC first before resorting to substituted service; (ii) the Claimant should not be permitted to use substituted service as a shortcut to avoid employing the methods of service out of jurisdiction set out in O 8 r 2(1) of ROC 2021, which, following O 60 r 7(2) of ROC 2021, applied to service of a notice of registration out of jurisdiction; and (iii) the Claimant breached its duty to disclose all the relevant material facts in SUM 2727, which was an application without notice. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, even if the Substituted Service Order was not set aside, D1 sought to set aside service of the Notice of Registration on the basis that service was not effected in accordance with the laws of the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 D1 submitted that, if the answer to either of the foregoing questions at [15(a)] and [15(b)] above was in the affirmative, the Registration Order should be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Claimant submitted that the Substituted Service Order was correctly ordered because the Claimant did not know whether D1 was residing in the PRC at the time SUM 2727 was made. The methods of substituted service employed were not contrary to PRC law and were the most effective methods to serve and provide notice of the papers to D1. The Claimant further submitted that it gave full and frank disclosure of all material facts in SUM 2727. Even if the Substituted Service Order were to be set aside, or if the service of the Notice of Registration were found to be defective, the Claimant submitted that the court should not exercise its discretion to set aside the Notice of Registration, as D1 had not suffered any prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Before delving into the issues proper, it first bears highlighting a few preliminary observations at the outset to set the context for this case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Substituted service both in and out of Singapore</span>: First, the Substituted Service Order provided for <span class="font-italic">both</span> substituted service <span class="font-italic">out </span>of Singapore<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">in </span>Singapore (see [10] and [11] above). This meant that, in considering if the Substituted Service Order was valid, it had to be considered whether the ROC 2021 permitted substituted service of the Notice of Registration both in and out of<span class="font-italic"> </span>Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Substituted service was effective</span>: Second, D1 did <span class="font-italic">not</span> dispute that the methods of substituted service under the Substituted Service Order were<span class="font-italic"> effective </span>in bringing the Notice of Registration to D1’s notice. This was the requirement under O 7 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021 to determine if a method of substituted service should be ordered (see [31] below). Indeed, D1 would have no basis in this case to claim otherwise, as it was the effectiveness of these methods of service that allowed D1 to bring this application <span class="font-italic">on time</span> within the 21-day timeline.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">D1 was in the PRC</span>: The third pertinent undisputed fact was that D1 <span class="font-italic">was </span>in the PRC at the time when the Registration Order and SUM 2727 were made. It was also undisputed that no attempts to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 in the PRC were made before SUM 2727 was filed. Instead, SUM 2727 was filed after two unsuccessful attempts at personal service on D1’s residential address <span class="font-italic">in Singapore</span> were made, in accordance with para 65(2) of the SupCt PD 2021. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-underline">Test of “impracticality”</span>: Fourth, O 7 r 7(1) of the ROC 2021 provided that, if a document was required to be served personally and it was “<span class="font-italic">impractical</span> to serve it personally, a party may apply to serve it by substituted service” [emphasis added]. While it was not clear from the text of the ROC 2021 that the test for substituted service under O 7 r 7 applied (as I shall explain at [44] below), <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties accepted and applied the test of “impracticality” under O 7 r 7(1) to determine if the Claimant was permitted to apply for substituted service in this case. Therefore, I also considered the application on this basis.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Bearing in mind the foregoing points, the parties’ submissions raised the following issues to be determined in this application.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first main issue concerned whether the Substituted Service Order should be set aside. This in turn required determination of the following sub-issues.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The first issue was the first legal question highlighted in the introduction (at [2] above) and the first argument made by D1 at [15(a)] above. As D1 was in the PRC when the Registration Order and SUM 2727 were made, the question was whether the Claimant was required to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC before applying for substituted service under SUM 2727? As aforementioned at [18(d)] above, to determine this, both parties applied the test of “impracticality” under O 7 r 7. Thus, the question was, based on the information as it was known when SUM 2727 was made, was it “impractical” for the Claimant to serve on D1 personally in the PRC? Alternatively, was there any exception to the default requirement of service out of jurisdiction that applied in this case?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The second issue was the second legal question highlighted in the introduction (at [2] above) and the second argument made by D1 at [15(a)] above. O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021 outlined a list of methods of service out of Singapore. O 60 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021 stated that O 8 r 2 applied in relation to service of a notice of registration out of Singapore. However, the Substituted Service Order did not provide for any methods of service that fell within the enumerated methods of service under O 8 rr 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–2(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>). Thus, the second issue was whether the Substituted Service Order provided an impermissible “shortcut” to circumvent O 8 r 2(1).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The third issue was the third argument made by D1 at [15(a)] above: should the Substituted Service Order be set aside on the basis that the Claimant breached its duty to give full and frank disclosure of all material facts in SUM 2727?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second main issue was whether the Notice of Registration should be set aside on the basis that the methods of service under the Substituted Service Order were contrary to PRC law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, if either of the foregoing questions were answered in the affirmative, the remaining question was whether this court should exercise its discretion not to set aside the Registration Order on the basis that D1 did not suffer any prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I will first outline the applicable legal principles before turning to my analysis of the issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Service requirements under the revoked Rules of Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Before delving into the requirements of service under the ROC 2021, it was important to first consider the key requirements of service under the revoked Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”). This provided the context to consider the changes that had been effected by ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Personal service within Singapore (Order 10) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 First, if a defendant was in Singapore, a document need not be served on the defendant personally unless the ROC 2014 or an order of court explicitly required the document to be served personally (O 62 r 1(1), ROC 2014).

However, nothing in the records in Hansard or the Civil Justice Commission Report (29 December 2017) (“CJC Report”) showed that there was an intention to change the test by substituting the word “impracticable” with “impractical”. Indeed, the CJC Report simply stated that Order 7 of ROC 2021 “<span class="font-italic">simplifies and consolidates</span> the existing Orders 10 and 62” [emphasis added].

As alluded to earlier, the text of the ROC 2021 did not clearly permit this, unlike ROC 2014. None of the provisions in O 8 rr 1–8 of the ROC 2021 provided for substituted service. Unlike the ROC 2014 (see [25] above), none of the provisions in O 8 rr 1 to 8 of the ROC 2021 expressly stated that the provision on substituted service – O 7 r 7 – “shall apply” to service out of jurisdiction. Consequently, on the face of the text of Orders 7 and 8 of the ROC 2021, O 7 r 7 did not seem to apply to service out of jurisdiction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On 21 October 2022, which was after the parties had filed their written submissions in this case, Lee Seiu Kin J delivered His Honour’s grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">Janesh s/o Rajkumar v Unknown Person (“CHEFPIERRE”)</span> [2022] SGHC 264 (“<span class="font-italic">Janesh</span>”). In that case, Lee J held that substituted service out of jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">was</span> permissible under the ROC 2021. Lee J’s reasons may be summarised as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021, which outlined the methods of service out of jurisdiction, did not prescribe a closed list as to how service of a document could be effected out of Singapore, given that, first, O 8 r 2(1) omitted the use of imperative language, and merely stated that service “<span class="font-italic">may</span>” be effected out of Singapore “in the following manner”; and, second, the word “or” was not used between O 8 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and O 8 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>), unlike other provisions of the ROC 2021 such as O 6 r 1(3) (<span class="font-italic">Janesh </span>at [87] and [88]). This line of reasoning suggested that the court in <span class="font-italic">Janesh</span> considered that substituted service out of jurisdiction flowed from <span class="font-italic">O 8 r 2(1)</span>, and not O 7 r 7. I will return to this point later at [44] below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the ROC 2021 “was not intended to drastically change the regime relating to jurisdiction in general” or the regime relating to “the service of originating processes or other court documents out of Singapore”. Rather, “the intention was to simplify things, for example, by obviating the need for a claimant to scrutinise a list of cases in which service out of Singapore is permissible” (<span class="font-italic">Janesh</span> at [89]). This was evident from the observations made by the drafters of the ROC 2021 in the CJC Report, which stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Scope</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1  This Chapter sets out the provisions governing service of originating processes and other court documents out of Singapore. <span class="font-italic">It largely retains the existing Order 11 with a simplification and rearrangement of its provisions</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Service out of Singapore with Court’s approval</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Instead of enumerating all the permissible cases for service of an originating process out of Singapore, Rule 1(1) prescribes the criteria for <span class="font-weight-bold">obtaining the Court’s approval for service out of Singapore, namely showing</span> that the Court has the jurisdiction or is the appropriate court to hear the case. This makes it unnecessary for a claimant to scrutinise the long list of permissible cases set out in the existing Rules in the hope of fitting into one or more descriptions. It also avoids the possibility that a particular category of cases which could and should be heard in Singapore is actually not in the list.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Lee J’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Janesh </span>in bold; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The power of the court to allow substituted service out of jurisdiction was “one of considerable vintage”, having been expressed in O 62 r 5 of the ROC 2014. If “the drafters of ROC 2021 had intended to curtail the court’s power in such a radical fashion, there would have been express and specific language to that effect” (<span class="font-italic">Janesh</span> at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As such, following <span class="font-italic">Janesh</span>, substituted service out of jurisdiction was permissible under O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021. Following <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span>, where a defendant had left Singapore before the originating process was issued, a claimant would have to first seek permission to serve the originating process out of jurisdiction before resorting to substituted service out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 At this juncture, it bears highlighting that <span class="font-italic">neither party</span> disputed that substituted service out of jurisdiction was permissible under ROC 2021, either in their written or oral submissions before me. Indeed, when asked about this at the hearing before me, counsel for D1 expressly conceded that they accepted that substituted service out of jurisdiction was permissible under the ROC 2021. With this in mind, I now turn to the service requirements for the order for registration and notice of registration under the ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Order for registration and notice of registration (O 60 rr 5 and 7)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As aforementioned at [13] above, D1 sought to rely on s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of REFJA to set aside the Registration Order on the basis that the Notice of Registration had not been validly served on him.

Accordingly, I also proceeded on the basis that the court’s permission was required.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of applicable principles under the ROC 2021</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In summary, the requirements of service for the order for registration and notice of registration of a foreign judgment under the ROC 2021 were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Order for registration</span>: An order for registration of a foreign judgment must be “served on the judgment debtor” (O 60 r 5(1), ROC 2021) (see [42] above), which meant that the order for registration may be served by way of ordinary service rather than personal service (see O 7 r 1(1), ROC 2021). If an order for registration had to be served out of Singapore, the court’s approval under O 8 r 1(1) of the ROC 2021 had to be obtained. This was because O 60 r 5 did not state that the order for registration could be served out of jurisdiction without permission. If an order for registration had to be served out of Singapore by way of substituted service under O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021, following <span class="font-italic">Janesh</span>, this was permissible and the court’s approval would also need to be sought under O 8 r 1(1). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Service of notice of registration in Singapore</span>: On the other hand, a notice of registration must be “served personally” on the judgment debtor “unless the Court otherwise orders” (O 60 r 7(1), ROC 2021) (see [42] above). This meant that a notice of registration may be served by way of substituted service within Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Service of notice of registration out of Singapore</span>: A notice of registration may be served out of jurisdiction without obtaining the court’s prior permission (O 60 r 7(2), ROC 2021) (see [42] above). Applying <span class="font-italic">Janesh</span>, a notice of registration may be served by substituted service out of jurisdiction, though it was unclear if the court’s permission would be required for this. It was also uncertain if the tests under O 7 rr 7(1) and 7(2) applied. Nevertheless, in this case, the parties applied the test of “impracticality” under O 7 r 7(1), and there was no dispute that the requirement under O 7 r 7(2) was met (because the methods of substituted service under the Substituted Service Order were<span class="font-italic"> </span>effective<span class="font-italic"> </span>in bringing the Notice of Registration to D1’s notice).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having set out the applicable statutory framework and legal principles, I now turn to the issues raised by the parties’ submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Should the Substituted Service Order be set aside?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The first broad issue was whether the Substituted Service Order should be set aside. As highlighted at [15(a)] above, D1 made three submissions in this regard. I shall first turn to D1’s submission that the Claimant should have attempted to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC before resorting to substituted service.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-Issue 1: Did the Claimant need to attempt to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC before resorting to substituted service?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 D1’s main submission was that, following the default rule in <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span>, the Claimant should have first attempted to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC before resorting to substituted service. This was because D1 had been residing solely in the PRC since February 2020, and the Claimant had not shown that it would be “impractical” to serve D1 personally in the PRC. D1 submitted that the Claimant knew that D1 resided solely in the PRC because the Claimant’s representative, Mr Liu Kao (“Mr Liu”), regularly met D1 in Beijing, including in the China World Hotel, during the period when the Claimant was applying for the Substituted Service Order; and because the Claimant delivered mooncakes to the China World Hotel for D1 annually. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the other hand, the Claimant submitted that it had proved that it was “impractical” to serve D1 personally in the PRC. At the time when SUM 2727 was made, although the Claimant knew that D1 spent a significant time in Beijing and that D1 would stay in the China World Hotel when D1 was there, the Claimant did not know the exact whereabouts of D1’s residence in Beijing, including which specific room in the China World Hotel D1 stayed in, or even when and for how long D1 would be in the PRC. The Claimant relied on the following facts for this submission. First, D1 was an international businessman who appeared to maintain dual residence in Singapore and the PRC. Second, the China World Hotel was, by its nature as a hotel, an impermanent and temporary address. There was also no way for the Claimant to find out the specific room in the hotel which D1 stayed in. Third, D1 had provided at least two other addresses as his address in other official documents. Fourth, D1’s visa in the PRC appeared to be temporary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 To consider whether it was justified for the Claimant not to attempt service out of jurisdiction before resorting to substituted service, a careful scrutiny of the evidence needed to be undertaken. After having done so, I found that the Claimant’s submission was supported by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the Claimant know that D1 resided solely in the PRC?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The first important point to note was that the court had to consider what the Claimant knew or would have known had it made the proper enquiries <span class="font-italic">at the time when SUM 2727 was made</span>, not what the evidence showed by the time the present application was heard before me. In this regard, the Claimant’s affidavit filed in support of SUM 2727 stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. I verily believe that as <span class="font-italic">the exact whereabouts of the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Defendant is unknown and unascertainable</span>, it is impractical to serve the Registration Order, the Notice of Registration, and any other relevant documents filed or made in this action (the ‘Registration Papers’) on the 1st Defendant personally. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. In this regard, two attempts at personal service of the Notice of Registration and Order of Court on the 1st Defendant at [the Gallop Road Address] on 20 July 2022 and 21 July 2022 were unsuccessful. <span class="font-italic">The Gallop [Road] Address is the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Defendant’s address, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as indicated in his People Profile extracted from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11. Based on the Endorsement of Service:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.1. on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at or around 8:10pm, the Process Server went to the Gallop <span class="font-italic">[Road] </span>Address to serve the Notice of Registration. <span class="font-italic">The Process Server was informed by the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Defendant’s domestic worker that the 1st Defendant was not home</span>; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.2  on Thursday, 21 July 2022 at or around 7:50pm, the Process Server went again to the Gallop [Road] Address to serve the Notice of Registration but <span class="font-italic">was again informed that the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Defendant was overseas in the PRC at the moment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21. Whilst it appears from the remarks of the 1st Defendant’s domestic worker during the attempt to effect personal service on the 1st Defendant at the Gallop [Road] Address on 20 July 2022 … that 1st Defendant has been there recently, and was as of 21 July 2022 overseas in the PRC, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is not known as to when he will return to Singapore and how long he will continue to be in the PRC</span>.

Therefore, according to the official records, D1’s place of residence <span class="font-italic">was</span><span class="font-italic"> in Singapore</span>. There was no evidence on the record as to D1’s registered address on his National Registration Identity Card (“NRIC”), as confirmed by counsel for D1 when asked about this at the hearing before me. Bearing in mind that this was <span class="font-italic">D1’s</span> application to set aside the Registration Order, D1 had not adduced any evidence to prove that his official registered address was outside of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it was also undisputed that, when the Claimant’s process server sought to effect personal service on D1’s registered residential address in Singapore, neither D1’s domestic helper nor his wife<span class="font-italic"> </span>informed the process server that<span class="font-italic"> </span>D1<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">did not reside there </span>or had moved to the PRC or overseas. Rather, D1’s domestic helper informed that D1 was <span class="font-italic">not in</span>, while D1’s wife informed that, while D1 was in the PRC (on 21 July 2022), she was <span class="font-italic">unsure when he would be back in Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [9] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, D1’s registered residential address in Singapore was also <span class="font-italic">where his family – his wife – </span>resided in. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, whenever D1 was in the PRC, he would stay at <span class="font-italic">a hotel </span>(the China World Hotel).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, while the Claimant knew that D1 “spent significant time in the PRC, during which he would stay at [the] China World Hotel”, and “<span class="font-italic">may</span> [thus] be located there” [emphasis added], the Claimant did not know where D1’s specific place of residence in the PRC was (or which room in the China World Hotel D1 stayed in, if he was staying there), how long he will continue to be in the PRC, and when he will return to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Sixth, there was no way for the Claimant to find out D1’s specific place of residence in the PRC, including which specific room in the China World Hotel he stayed in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The foregoing facts led to the clear conclusion that, based on the objective evidence, what the Claimant knew or would have known at the time SUM 2727 was made was that D1’s <span class="font-italic">main place </span>of residence appeared to be in Singapore, although D1 would also spend significant time in the PRC. I agreed with the Claimant’s counsel, Mr Jason Teo (“Mr Teo”), that the objective evidence showed the Claimant that D1 seemed to maintain dual residence in Singapore and the PRC. This was because D1’s official registered address was the Gallop Road Address in Singapore, and D1’s wife also resided there. D1’s wife and domestic helper also did not inform the Claimant’s process server that D1 did not stay in the Gallop Road Address or that he had moved to the PRC. The fact that D1 stayed in a hotel whenever he was in the PRC would have also reinforced the inference that D1’s residence in the PRC was temporary, subject to possible change at any time, and that his main place of residence was in accordance with what he registered with ACRA in his People Profile – the Gallop Road Address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, in addition to the foregoing facts that were disclosed in SUM 2727, the additional facts highlighted by Mr Teo further bolstered the conclusion that D1 seemed to be constantly moving between Singapore and the PRC, and did not seem to have a permanent place of residence in the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, D1 had provided at least two other addresses in his official documents. D1 did not provide the China World Hotel as his address in the contracts underlying the dispute in the HK Suit. Instead, in these contracts, D1 provided a “c/o” address <span class="font-italic">in Guangzhou</span> as his address.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In these circumstances, it was permissible for the Claimant to first attempt to serve D1 personally in Singapore, and then apply for substituted service within and out of Singapore, because the circumstances of the case would have led the Claimant to the conclusion that D1 was constantly moving from country to country such that it was impossible to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Bearing in mind the key facts highlighted at [53] above, it would have been completely impractical to serve D1 in the PRC when he had <span class="font-italic">so many different addresses</span> (even within the PRC itself) and it was unclear <span class="font-italic">for how long</span> he would stay in the China World Hotel. While D1 sought to submit that his residence in the China World Hotel was not temporary, it was very telling that his lease with the China World Hotel began <span class="font-italic">from 1 April 2018</span>, but D1 had, on his own evidence, only been residing exclusively in the PRC <span class="font-italic">since 8 February 2020</span>. In other words, for almost two years from 1 April 2018 to 7 February 2020, D1 <span class="font-italic">did not always </span>reside in the PRC. This amply showed that he constantly moved from place to place (between Singapore and the PRC, and, even within the PRC, among different addresses), and explained why he had registered and used so many different addresses. Consequently, even if the Claimant somehow discovered D1’s specific room number in the China World Hotel, by the time service was attempted on D1 via the method under the Sino-Singapore Treaty months later, D1 might not even have been living there in the specific hotel room anymore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">D1’s meetings with the Claimant’s representative in the PRC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As aforementioned at [49] above, D1 also relied on the fact that Mr Liu was regularly meeting D1 during the period when the Claimant was seeking the Substituted Service Order, including at the Aria Café at the China World Hotel. These meetings were to discuss issues relating to the subject matter of the HK Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 To this, Mr Teo made the following submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The mere fact that D1 and Mr Liu regularly met in Beijing and in the café of the hotel where D1 was residing in would only have led the Claimant to the inference that he was residing in the PRC <span class="font-italic">at the times</span> when they met; it would not have reasonably led the Claimant to the inference that D1, who was an international businessman, had fully moved to the PRC since February 2020 and was <span class="font-italic">solely </span>residing there.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even though D1 and Mr Liu regularly met, it would have been impractical to require Mr Liu – or even any other one of the Claimant’s representatives – to directly ask D1 for his room number, because this would either give D1 advanced notice that the Claimant intended to effect service on D1 (and thus risk D1 moving so as to avoid being served) or it would have required the Claimant to deceive D1 as to the purpose for enquiring about D1’s hotel room number. The Claimant submitted that such deception should not be the standard of behaviour that should be expected of applicants for substituted service. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I agreed with Mr Teo’s submissions as summarised at [60] above. I also agreed with Mr Teo that the fact that D1 and Mr Liu were in constant communication did not mean that it was incumbent on Mr Liu to directly ask D1 for his address to be served. That would be an outcome that would not make any sense (as few defendants would willingly accept to be served) and, indeed, was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a requirement before substituted service could be ordered. This was evident from the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For instance, under para 65(2) of the SupCt PD 2021, at least two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service was filed. If these initial attempts to serve personally at a defendant’s last known address failed because there was no response at the address or because a resident at the address informed the applicant’s process server that the defendant did not reside there, neither the ROC 2021 nor the SupCt PD 2021 required the applicant to prove that the applicant had attempted to ask the defendant for his address to be served.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the initial attempts to serve personally at a defendant’s last known address failed because the defendant was momentarily and coincidentally not at the address during the attempts to serve personally, the ROC 2021 and SupCt PD 2021 did not require the applicant to prove that he had attempted to ask the defendant for a time when the defendant will be available at the address to be served.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If an applicant sought to serve by email, under para 65(6) of the SupCt PD 2021, the applicant had to show “that the email account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that <span class="font-italic">it is currently active</span>” [emphasis added]. To prove that the email account was “currently active”, it was common for applicants to rely on evidence that the applicant had been in <span class="font-italic">recent </span>communication with the party to be served by that specific email. Yet, if the standard of behaviour suggested by D1 were to be accepted, the fact that the applicant and the party to be served had been in recent communication by email should, rather than lead to the conclusion that the order for substituted service by email<span class="font-italic"> </span>should be made, <span class="font-italic">instead</span> lead to the conclusion that the applicant should ask the party to be served where and when he can be served personally. That does not make sense and would be a position that would run contrary to the express requirement under para 65(6) of the SupCt PD 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The foregoing positions were not novel, as the <span class="font-italic">same</span> procedures existed under paras 33(2) and 33(6) of the SupCt PD 2013 (to be read with the ROC 2014). Therefore, it was simply not a requirement that the Claimant had to <span class="font-italic">directly ask</span> D1 what his room number in the China World Hotel was, or whether he was residing in the PRC on a non-temporary basis, such that he could be served there. Had that been the case, I agreed with the Claimant that it would have risked D1 leaving and moving to a different address to delay being served. This was a real possibility in this case, bearing in mind that the objective evidence showed that D1 <span class="font-italic">himself</span> had at least one other address in Beijing in Hanwei Plaza (see [55(a)] above). Thus, I was unable to agree with D1 that the mere fact that he had been regularly meeting Mr Liu in Beijing meant that the Claimant knew or should have known D1’s address in Beijing or that he was solely residing in Beijing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Delivery of mooncakes to China World Hotel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 D1 also relied on the fact that the Claimant had been delivering mooncakes to the China World Hotel for D1 annually. The Claimant’s evidence was that the mooncakes were arranged by the Claimant to be delivered <span class="font-italic">by a courier</span> to the <span class="font-italic">concierge </span>of the China World Hotel. The hotel made its own arrangements to deliver the mooncakes to D1’s room. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The affidavits filed by the parties clearly showed that the Claimant <span class="font-italic">did not</span> know the room number of D1 in the China World Hotel. The Claimant <span class="font-italic">fully disclosed in SUM 2727 </span>that<span class="font-italic"> </span>it knew that, when D1 stayed in the PRC, D1 would stay in the China World Hotel (see [52] above). Therefore, the mere fact that the Claimant had been sending mooncakes to D1 annually at the China World Hotel address did not assist D1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Caselaw relied upon by D1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I next turn to the caselaw relied upon by D1. As aforementioned at [51] above, D1 relied on <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>to submit that the Claimant should have attempted to serve D1 in the PRC first before resorting to substituted service. However, as aforementioned at [56] above, one of the <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>exceptions to service out applied in this case. Furthermore, <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> could be distinguished from the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span>, the first respondent was a Singapore citizen whose <span class="font-italic">registered address on his NRIC was in the United Arab Emirates </span>(“UAE”) (<span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> at [4]). The second respondent was the first respondent’s wife who was a Singapore permanent resident. When the appellants attempted to serve the writ of summons personally on the respondents, the attempts were made at a flat in Singapore (the “Flat”) which did not even belong to the respondents or their family members, but instead belonged to the respondents’ <span class="font-italic">friend </span>(<span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> at [13]), and where the respondents would only stay at whenever they were in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> at [6]). When the attempts of personal service were made, there was no response on the first attempt when the process server knocked on the door of the Flat (<span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> at [7]). On the second attempt, the respondents’ friend informed that the respondents <span class="font-italic">did not reside at the Flat </span>(<span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> at [8]). All these facts would have clearly led the appellants in <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>to the conclusion that the respondents in that case did <span class="font-italic">not</span> reside in Singapore, and that they resided in the UAE. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the foregoing circumstances, Andrew Ang J (as His Honour then was) held in <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> that the order for substituted service of the writ <span class="font-italic">within Singapore </span>was not permitted, and that leave for service out of jurisdiction had to be obtained first before resorting to substituted service. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>was clearly correct on the facts of that case – when it is clear from the circumstances of the case that a defendant was situated out of Singapore, substituted service, which was the exception rather than the rule under O 62 r 5 of the ROC 2014 (and O 7 r 7 of the ROC 2021), should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be the first port of call. Otherwise, substituted service would be exploited to circumvent the default requirements of service out of jurisdiction. The present facts were far removed from the facts of <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span>. Consequently, <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> could be distinguished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 D1 also relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Burgundy Global Exploration Corp v Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 381 (“<span class="font-italic">Burgundy</span>”) to submit that substituted service should not be effected within one jurisdiction as a shortcut to serve documents on a defendant who resided in another jurisdiction. However, <span class="font-italic">Burgundy</span> could also be distinguished. In that case, one of the issues before the court was whether leave should be granted to serve examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) documents on the directors of a Philippines company out of jurisdiction. In that case, the company directors were resident in the Philippines and were not party to the main Suit (which was between the Philippines company and another company that was listed on the New York Stock Exchange). The further question which the court had to consider was whether the documents could be served on the company directors by substituted service on the company’s lawyers in Singapore. D1 relied on the Court of Appeal’s observation that “upholding this novel mode of substituted service could pave the way for parties to use this as a shortcut to serve documents on foreign persons who hold senior positions in a company by serving the documents on the company’s lawyers instead” (<span class="font-italic">Burgundy </span>at [115]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 However, once again, close attention to the specific facts of <span class="font-italic">Burgundy</span> had to be paid. In that case, it was unequivocally the case that the company directors were resident in the Philippines (see <span class="font-italic">Burgundy </span>at [5] to [6]). Even the company itself was based in the Philippines. There was no evidence to suggest that the company directors were constantly moving from country to country. In those circumstances, it was clear that service must be effected on the company directors out of jurisdiction in the Philippines. Furthermore, it bears noting that the Court of Appeal’s observations on substituted service were made <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, as the Court of Appeal stated that they “need not decide this point as [they] set aside the order for substituted service of the EJD Orders on the ground that leave for service out of jurisdiction had not been obtained.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The key point in both <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>and <span class="font-italic">Burgundy</span> was that, in those cases, substituted service <span class="font-italic">within Singapore</span> was being used to circumvent the requirement to seek permission to serve the defendants <span class="font-italic">out of jurisdiction</span>, even though those defendants were unequivocally resident abroad. This was not the case here, because the Substituted Service Order provided for both substituted service within and <span class="font-italic">out</span> of Singapore, and the circumstances as they were known to the Claimant showed that D1 was constantly moving between Singapore and the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 D1 also cited various English cases for the proposition that substituted service was the exception rather than the norm, especially when there was a bilateral convention between the originating jurisdiction and the foreign country where service was to be effected. These cases which D1 cited were <span class="font-italic">Cecil and others v Bayat and others</span> [2011] 1 WLR 3086, <span class="font-italic">Knauf UK GmbH v British Gypsum Ltd and another</span> [2002] 1 WLR 907, and <span class="font-italic">Marashen Ltd v Kenvett Ltd (Ivanchenko, third party)</span> [2018] 1 WLR 288. None of these cases dealt with the situation in this case where one of the <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> exceptions to service out applied. Consequently, I found that these cases did not assist D1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 To summarise, I found that the facts would have led the Claimant to the conclusion that D1 was constantly moving between Singapore and the PRC such that it was impossible to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC. This was one of the <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>exceptions to service out. Furthermore, the fact that it was impossible to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC meant that it was impractical to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC. Therefore, I found that the Substituted Service Order was validly made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-Issue 2: Did the Substituted Service Order provide an impermissible “shortcut” to circumvent O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Next, D1 submitted that the Substituted Service Order provided an impermissible “shortcut” to circumvent O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021, which was the provision which set out the methods of service out of jurisdiction (see [36] above). According to D1, this was because O 60 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021 did not provide that O 7 r 7 – the provision on substituted service – applied to service of a notice of registration out of Singapore; instead, O 60 r 7(2) stated that O 8 rr 2, 3, 7 and 8 applied in relation to service of a notice of registration out of Singapore. This thus raised the question of whether substituted service out of jurisdiction of a notice of registration could be ordered under O 60 r 7(2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I first considered the methods of substituted service out of Singapore provided under the Substituted Service Order (that is, by registered post and email on Sidley Austin HK; see [10(a)] above). In my judgment, a careful study of the statutory provisions and the caselaw as I have outlined above showed that O 60 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021 <span class="font-italic">did </span>permit a notice of registration to be served on a judgment debtor by way of substituted service out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The only substantive difference between the provisions on service under the ROC 2014 and the ROC 2021 was that, under the ROC 2021, the provision on the methods of service out of jurisdiction (O 8 r 2(1), ROC 2021) did<span class="font-italic"> not</span> expressly state that the provision on substituted service (O 7 r 7, ROC 2021) “shall apply” in relation to service out of jurisdiction. Therefore, O 8 r 2(1) was <span class="font-italic">silent</span> on whether a defendant could be served out of jurisdiction by way of substituted service. On the other hand, under the ROC 2014, the provision on the methods of service out of jurisdiction (O 11 r 3(1), ROC 2014) <span class="font-italic">did</span> expressly state that the provision on substituted service (O 62 r 5, ROC 2014) “shall apply”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 When faced with this, Lee J had clearly held in <span class="font-italic">Janesh </span>that O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021 permitted substituted service out of jurisdiction (see [38] above). As such, substituted service out of jurisdiction was<span class="font-italic"> </span>permitted <span class="font-italic">under O 8 r 2(1) </span>of the ROC 2021. When asked about this at the hearing before me, counsel for D1 did <span class="font-italic">not </span>dispute Lee J’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Janesh </span>nor even the position that substituted service out of jurisdiction was permitted under the ROC 2021. Therefore, because O 8 r 2(1) permitted substituted service out of jurisdiction, and O 60 r 7(2) provided that O 8 r 2 applied to the service of a notice of registration out of jurisdiction, it followed that O 60 r 7(2) allowed a notice of registration to be served by substituted service out of jurisdiction. This meant that the methods of substituted service out of Singapore provided under the Substituted Service Order did not provide an impermissible shortcut to circumvent O 8 r 2(1) of ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for the methods of substituted service within Singapore<span class="font-italic"> </span>provided under the Substituted Service Order – by registered post to the Balmoral Hills Address and the Gallop Road Address (see [10(b)] above) – these would have been ordered under O 7 r 7 of the ROC 2021, since they concerned substituted service within Singapore<span class="font-italic">.</span> These methods were not impermissible because one of the <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> exceptions to service out applied in this case. Therefore, I found that the Substituted Service Order did not provide an impermissible “shortcut” to circumvent O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-Issue 3: Was there a lack of full and frank disclosure of all material facts in SUM 2727?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I now turn to the final submission made by D1 to seek to set aside the Substituted Service Order, which was that the Claimant did not make full and frank disclosure of all material facts that it knew or would have known had it made the proper enquiries when it made the substituted service application in SUM 2727.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The crux of D1’s submission here is that the Claimant did not disclose the following three facts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) D1 had been solely resident in the PRC since February 2020;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Liu was regularly meeting D1, including at the Aria Café in the China World Hotel, and the Claimant had been delivering mooncakes to the China World Hotel for D1; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the methods of substituted service under the Substituted Service Order did not comply with the means provided in O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The pertinent facts that the Claimant disclosed in its supporting affidavit in SUM 2727 have been extracted at [52] above. The Claimant submitted that it did not breach its duty of full and frank disclosure, as it had made it clear to the court that D1 may be located in the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 SUM 2727 was an application “without notice” (which was known as an “<span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>application under the ROC 2014), as it did not need to be served on anyone (O 1 r 3(1), ROC 2021). It was trite that, in any application without notice, the applicant had a duty to give full and frank disclosure of all material facts known to him and those facts which he would have known had he made proper inquiries. “Material facts” were those that were material for the court to know in dealing with the application, and the extent of the inquiries depended on the facts and circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah)</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 786 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex</span>”) at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It was equally well established that a mere failure to provide full and frank disclosure of all material facts did not warrant the setting aside of the order made in the application without notice. In the context of an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application for an interim injunction, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span>that, once material non-disclosure was established, the court has a discretion to either: (a) discharge the interim injunction without looking into the merits, which would be appropriate where the omissions were deliberate with a view to misrepresent; (b) continue the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> injunction; or (c) grant a fresh injunction if all the facts were now before it (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span>at [25] and [33]). The duty to give full and frank disclosure was not so strict that even a minor breach would be a basis to set aside an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> injunction (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span>at [27]). Where there was suppression, instead of innocent omission, of the material facts, it must be a special case for the court to exercise its discretion not to discharge the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> injunction (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span>at [35]). While <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee</span><span class="font-italic"> Impex </span>was a case concerning an injunction, there was “no reason in principle why there should be a difference in approach between an application for leave to serve out of jurisdiction … and one for an injunction” (<span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 453 at [58] per Sundaresh Menon JC (as His Honour then was)). The foregoing principles should thus equally apply to an application without notice for substituted service.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Regarding the first fact at [78(a)] above, besides bare assertions on affidavit, D1 had not proved why the Claimant knew or would have known that D1 had been solely resident in the PRC. Instead, as I had already found, the evidence supported the Claimant’s assertions that, at the time SUM 2727 was made, it did not know D1’s exact whereabouts and for how long D1 would remain in the PRC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It also followed that the second fact at [78(b)] above was not a material fact that needed to be disclosed. This was because the fact that D1 and Mr Liu had been meeting in Beijing did not mean that Mr Liu knew that D1 was fully resident in the PRC when SUM 2727 was filed, or D1’s room number in the China World Hotel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 More importantly, the fact that D1 and Mr Liu had been meeting in Beijing did not go toward the <span class="font-italic">tests </span>which the parties themselves applied to determine if substituted service should be ordered, which was whether it was<span class="font-italic"> impractical </span>to serve D1 personally, and whether the proposed method of substituted service would be effective in bringing the Registration Papers to D1’s notice. Consider, hypothetically, that the Claimant did<span class="font-italic"> </span>disclose the fact that D1 and Mr Liu had been regularly meeting in Beijing, including in the Aria Café. This fact would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have changed the court’s analysis as to whether substituted service should be ordered, because the fact remained that (a) based on the key facts as outlined at [53] above, D1 appeared to be maintaining dual residence in Singapore and the PRC, (b) the Claimant did not know D1’s room number in the China World Hotel and could not be expected to ask D1 this, and (c) there was also no evidence that D1 had informed any of the Claimant’s representatives, including Mr Liu, that he had moved to the PRC. This hypothetical counterfactual example amply showed that the fact that D1 and Mr Liu regularly met in Beijing was <span class="font-italic">not</span> material to the determination of the issue in SUM 2727. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Even if this were a material fact, it was clear that the omission to disclose this fact in SUM 2727 was a minor breach that did not justify setting aside the Substituted Service Order. This was because there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Claimant suppressed<span class="font-italic"> </span>this fact in its supporting affidavit in SUM 2727 in an effort to mislead the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Finally, D1’s reliance on the third fact at [78(c)] above was a non-starter, because the methods of substituted service under the Substituted Service Order were<span class="font-italic"> </span>permissible under O 8 r 2(1) of the ROC 2021, as I have analysed at [37] to [39] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As such, I found that the Claimant did not breach its duty of full and frank disclosure when it made the application for substituted service in SUM 2727. Accordingly, despite the best efforts of D1’s counsel, I agreed with the Claimant that there was no basis to set aside the Substituted Service Order. The Substituted Service Order was not legally defective. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In conclusion, I summarise my findings on the Substituted Service Order as such:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Claimant did not have to first attempt to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally in the PRC because one of the <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> exceptions to service out applied in this case: the evidence as they were known when SUM 2727 was made led the Claimant to the clear inference that D1 was constantly moving between Singapore and the PRC such that it was impossible to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally. For the same reason, it was impractical for the Claimant to serve the Notice of Registration on D1 personally, so the Substituted Service Order was validly ordered.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The methods of substituted service out of Singapore provided under the Substituted Service Order did <span class="font-italic">not</span> provide an impermissible “shortcut” to circumvent O 8 r 2(1) of ROC 2021, because O 8 r 2(1) itself permitted substituted service out of jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The methods of substituted service within Singapore provided under the Substituted Service Order did <span class="font-italic">not</span> provide an impermissible “shortcut” to circumvent O 8 r 2(1) of ROC 2021, because one of the <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> exceptions to service out applied in this case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Claimant did not breach its duty to give full and frank disclosure of all material facts in SUM 2727.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Consequently, there was no basis to set aside the Substituted Service Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Was the Notice of Registration validly served in accordance with PRC law?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 D1’s next submission was that, even if the substituted service order were not set aside, the Registration Order should be set aside because D1 was not validly served with the Notice of Registration in accordance with the laws of the PRC. D1 submitted that this was because O 8 r 2(6) of the ROC 2021 provided that “[n]othing is to be done under this Rule that is contrary to the laws of the foreign country.” According to D1’s expert witness on PRC law, Mr Zhongda Wu (“Mr Wu”), “proper service of judicial documents issued by a Court of Singapore to [the D1] who reside[d] in Beijing, China, [could] only be carried out” in the manner provided for under the Sino-Singapore Treaty, as summarised at [57] above. D1 submitted that, because the Substituted Service Order did not effect service in accordance with the means under the Sino-Singapore Treaty, the Notice of Registration was not served in accordance with the laws of the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 On the other hand, the Claimant’s expert witness on PRC law, Mr Xin Zhengyu (“Mr Xin”), explained that the PRC Civil Procedure Law, bilateral treaties, and international conventions of the PRC “only regulate[d] the situation where the party requesting for judicial assistance [sought] to serve judicial documents in the territory of the requested party, and [did] not involve the situation where the litigant [was] in the territory of the requested party but the service process [was] not carried out in the territory of the requested party.”

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In determining whether a method of service was contrary to the laws of the relevant foreign country, an important distinction was to be drawn between a manner of service <span class="font-italic">not specifically provided</span> <span class="font-italic">for</span> by foreign law and service which was <span class="font-italic">positively contrary</span> to foreign law. The former would not be contrary to the law of the foreign jurisdiction at all (<span class="font-italic">Humpuss </span>at [86]). Accordingly, in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>, Steven Chong J (as His Honour then was) found that the fact that there were no laws governing the service of foreign originating processes on Indonesian individuals or legal entities in Indonesia was fatal to the defendant’s case that service of the foreign process had to be carried out by the Indonesian court bailiff. As a result, service of the writ by private means at the defendants’ registered address in Indonesia was permissible (<span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> at [71]–[72]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Petroval</span> at [26], Tay Yong Kwang J (as His Honour then was) observed that the pertinent question in that case was whether Swiss law <span class="font-italic">prohibited</span> service “outside [Switzerland] on Swiss residents”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The methods of service under the Substituted Service Order were for service on a party’s counsel in Hong Kong (by registered post and email) and for service on a party’s address outside of the PRC (in Singapore by registered post). Therefore, the pertinent question in this case was whether PRC law <span class="font-italic">prohibited</span> service on a party’s counsel situated in Hong Kong and on a party’s foreign residential address. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the present case, the critical fact that was fatal to D1’s submission was that <span class="font-italic">no</span> provision of PRC law prohibited service on a party’s counsel in Hong Kong or on a party’s address overseas. When asked about this at the hearing before me, counsel for D1 conceded this fact. As such, applying <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> and <span class="font-italic">Petroval</span>, the methods of service employed by the Substituted Service Order were not contrary to PRC law. Accordingly, I found no basis to set aside the Notice of Registration and the Registration Order, and I dismissed the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Are there other reasons to justify not setting aside the Registration Order?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 As I have rejected the foregoing two bases to set aside the Registration Order, there was no need for me to make any findings on the Claimant’s alternative submission that I should exercise my discretion not to set aside the Registration Order on the basis that no substantial prejudice had been caused to D1 (see [17] above). Nevertheless, for completeness, I observed that, even if I had found that the Substituted Service Order should be set aside or that the Notice of Registration was not validly served in accordance with PRC law, I would have exercised my discretion not to set aside the Registration Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It was clear from the use of the word “may” in s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of REFJA (see [41] above) that the court had a discretion whether to set aside an order for registration, even if the requirement under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) was satisfied.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The principal purpose of the requirement to serve a notice of registration on a judgment debtor personally was to ensure that the “judgment debtor will not be deprived of his property without proper notice and reasonable opportunity to defend” (see the Report of the Law Reform Committee on Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (June 2005) at [84]). Therefore, central to the exercise of the court’s discretion in s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of REFJA was the question of whether a defendant had been prejudiced by being deprived of a reasonable opportunity to raise any proper grounds to set aside the registration of a foreign judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Madihill Development Sdn Bhd and another v Sinesinga Sdn Bhd</span><span class="font-italic"> (transferee to part of the assets of United Merchant Finance Bhd)</span> [2012] 1 SLR 169 (“<span class="font-italic">Madihill</span>”), the High Court considered the question of whether the registration of a Malaysian judgment under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RECJA”) should be set aside because, at the time the judgment was registered, there was a pending appeal before the Malaysian Court of Appeal, and s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of RECJA provided that a judgment cannot be registered if there is a pending appeal against the judgment. However, by the time the setting aside application was heard before the High Court of Singapore, there was no longer any pending appeal. Quentin Loh J (as His Honour then was) held in <span class="font-italic">Madihill</span> at [28] that, in the circumstances of that case, there was:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">no utility or practical consideration</span> that require[d] the setting aside of the registration <span class="font-italic">just for </span><span class="font-italic">[the judgment creditor] to apply once more to register the Malaysian judgment</span>. Such overemphasis on technicalities no longer has any place in modern civil procedure. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 While <span class="font-italic">Madihill</span> concerned a setting aside application under RECJA rather than s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of REFJA, both statutes concerned the registration of foreign judgments. Loh J’s holding that there was no “utility or practical consideration” in setting aside the registration of the Malaysian judgment, despite it being <span class="font-italic">undisputed</span> in that case<span class="font-italic"> </span>that there <span class="font-italic">was </span>a technical defect in the registration of the Malaysian judgment at the time of the registration (due to the pending appeal), was consistent with the general principle that, where there was <span class="font-italic">no </span><span class="font-italic">undue prejudice</span> occasioned to the judgment debtor by the registration of a foreign judgment despite a technical fault or defect, a court should be slow to set aside the registration of the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In this case, it was undisputed that D1 did receive notice<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Notice of Registration. It was for this reason that D1 filed this application within the stipulated 21-day timeline. As such, I could see no purpose for setting aside the Registration Order now and requiring the Claimant to attempt to serve D1 personally in the PRC first, when this process could take months and there was <span class="font-italic">no guarantee</span> that D1 would willingly accept service in the PRC and not, instead, move to a different address. In fact, it bears highlighting that D1’s lease with the China World Hotel was due to expire on 1 April 2023, so the fact that service in the PRC under the Sino-Singapore Treaty could take months could well mean that, by the time service was attempted on D1 in his room in the China World Hotel, D1 might not even be residing there anymore. D1 did not provide any undertaking that he would be residing in the same hotel room or even that he would continue to reside in the PRC until he had been served by the Claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In this regard, D1 submitted that he had not shown any past pattern or present intention to evade service of the Notice of Registration. This submission did not make sense: if D1 was so ready to accept service, there would be no reason for D1 to seek to set aside the Registration Order now<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the sole reason that he should be served again <span class="font-italic">after a few months</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in the PRC, even though he <span class="font-italic">presently already ha</span><span class="font-italic">d </span>notice of the Registration Order and Notice of Registration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 D1 sought to rely on <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> at [49] to submit that prejudice is immaterial. First and foremost, <span class="font-italic">Consistel </span>did not concern the exercise of discretion under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of REFJA. Second, what Ang J had held in <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49] was that the issues of whether:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the respondents were in contact with [the respondents’ friend] who resided at their last known residential address, that they clearly had notice of the Writ and that the first respondent was a Singapore citizen … were only relevant, if at all, <span class="font-italic">to determine how</span><span class="font-italic"> substituted service should be effected</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Therefore, a close study of <span class="font-italic">Consistel</span> showed that the court did <span class="font-italic">not </span>make a broad finding that prejudice was immaterial. Rather, Ang J had held in that case that the issues raised by the plaintiff went towards the question of the <span class="font-italic">effectiveness</span> of the methods of substituted service. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As such, not only was there no substantial prejudice, but there was no prejudice occasioned to D1 at all by any failure to serve D1 in the PRC prior to the substituted service. Accordingly, I would not have set aside the Registration Order even if I had agreed with D1 on the first two issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Accordingly, I dismissed the present application. Finally, I record my gratitude to the parties’ counsel for their submissions.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Desmond Chong<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Danny Ong, Jason Teo, and Lee Jin Loong (Setia Law LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vithiya Rajendra, Daryl Wong, and Ang Guo Qiang (WongPartnership LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Second defendant absent and unrepresented. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
