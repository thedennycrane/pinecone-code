<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present action arose out of an agreement for
                    the sale and purchase of 3,218,458 ordinary shares (“the S&amp;P
                    Agreement”) in Golden Oriental Pte Ltd (“the Company”).
                    These shares (“the Shares”) were sold by the defendant to the
                    plaintiff pursuant to a Charge dated 9 March 2007 (“the
                    Charge”) granted by Mr Guo Ze Ming (“Guo”), the former
                    founder, director and majority shareholder of the Company, in favour of the
                    defendant and several other shareholders. In brief, the plaintiff in this action
                    sought to be released from her obligation to complete the sale and purchase and
                    also for the refund of her deposit of $500,000, on the principal ground that the
                    Shares that were sold to her were still encumbered by a subsequent charge in
                    favour of United Overseas Bank Limited (“the UOB charge”) and the
                    sale was therefore in breach of a condition precedent of the S&amp;P Agreement
                    which required the Shares to be free from all encumbrances. This dispute has
                    raised an interesting question of law whether the sale of the Shares by the
                    defendant pursuant to a <em>contractual</em> as opposed to
                    a <em>statutory</em> power of sale had overreached the UOB
                    charge, such that the plaintiff took the Shares free from the UOB charge and
                    UOB’s interest in the Shares was transferred to the actual proceeds of the
                    sale.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       To protect their investment, the Investors
                    obtained an undertaking that Guo and the Company would use their best endeavours
                    to procure a listing of the Company’s shares (“the undertaking to
                    list”) by 31 December 2008 (“the deadline”), and
                    in the event that the listing was not achieved by then, the Investors were
                    entitled to exercise a put option requiring Guo and/or the Company to buy the
                    sale shares back from the Investors at an agreed “put” price
                    calculated at their respective contributions plus a premium of
                20%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       To further secure the performance of the
                    Company’s and Guo’s obligations under the First Investment
                    Agreement, Guo executed the Charge on 9 March 2007 in favour of the
                    Investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Charge was granted by Guo in favour of the
                    Investors (including the defendant) by way of a fixed charge free from any
                    security interest, all his present and future rights, title and interest in all
                    his shares in the Company. Under clause 8, the Investors were entitled to
                    enforce the Charge upon the Company and/or Guo’s default under the First
                    Investment Agreement to secure payment and discharge of the Company or
                    Guo’s indebtedness towards the Investors. A power of sale was specifically

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, on 14 December 2007, the
                    defendant and two others entered into another sale and purchase agreement with
                    Guo and the Company (“the Second Investment Agreement”), under
                    which the defendant invested an additional sum of $1.2 million in return for 150
                    of the Company’s ordinary shares. Similar to the First Investment
                    Agreement, there was an undertaking to list under clause 5.1 of the Second
                    Investment Agreement, failing which the defendant was entitled to exercise a put
                    option requiring Guo and/or the Company to buy the defendant’s shares back
                    at the price of $1.2 million, being the defendant’s contribution, plus a

                    subscription agreement with Guo and the Company (“the Third Investment

<p class="Judg-1">The Third Investment Agreement also contained the undertaking to list

                    Investors’ shares back at the put prices, calculated as their respective
                    contributions plus a premium of 8%, in the event that the put option was
                    exercised upon a failure to list by the deadline. By then, the defendant had
                    obtained a total of 580 shares in the Company through the three abovementioned
                    agreements (collectively “the Investment
                Agreements”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Separately, through a resolution passed on 28
                    March 2008, each ordinary share in the Company was divided into 1,000
                    shares, and, as a result, the 580 shares that the defendant had obtained
                    through the three Investment Agreements became 580,000 ordinary

                    Asia, who were appointed as the escrow agent. However, due to an oversight by
                    the Investors, this was in fact not done by Guo. On 5 November 2008, after they
                    had found out about this lapse, the defendant’s solicitors wrote to Guo,
                    giving him until 11 November 2008 to remedy the situation and deposit
                    the share certificates and the share transfer forms with the escrow agent, but

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As it turned out, the Company failed to
                    achieve the listing by the deadline, and on 23 January 2009, the
                    defendant exercised his put options under the respective Investment Agreements
                    and notified the Company and/or Guo accordingly. Neither the Company nor Guo
                    complied with the put options. As a result of the non-compliance, the defendant
                    together with two of the Investors namely Ms Goh and Ms Chong
                    (collectively “the Creditors”), through their solicitors, declared
                    on 12 February 2009 that an event of default had occurred under the
                    Investment Agreements and demanded payment of the following sums due:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$1.7 million plus a premium of 20%;

                        8%.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">These figures were arrived at based on the following calculations of

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons 228 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Creditors decided to take steps to realise
                    their security under the Charge. However, as Guo had failed to deposit the share
                    certificates and the share transfer forms with the escrow agent (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), they realised that they needed the
                    Court’s assistance in order to enforce the Charge. It was under these
                    circumstances that the Creditors commenced Originating Summons No 228 of 2009
                    (“OS 228”) on 25 February 2009 and sought a court order, pursuant
                    to the Charge, allowing them to transfer and register Guo’s shares in
                    their names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At that time, Guo was the owner of 4,951,475
                    ordinary shares in the Company. Although the Charge was granted over <em>all</em> of Guo’s shares in the Company (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), the Creditors sought to have only
                    4,208,752 of his shares transferred into their names. That was because one of
                    the Investors, Mr Wong (whom the Charge was also granted in favour of) did
                    not join them in bringing OS 228 against Guo and the Company. Therefore,
                    having taken into account Mr Wong’s contribution, the Creditors
                    sought to transfer (in proportion to their respective contributions under the
                    First Investment Agreement: see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above)
                    the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">3,218,458 shares to the defendant (1.3 / 2 x

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">742,721 shares to Ms Goh (0.3 / 2 x

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After OS 228 was filed, UOB was granted
                    leave to intervene after they asserted that Guo had granted them an equitable
                    charge on 24 January 2009 over 2.5 million of Guo’s shares in
                    the Company. At the hearing, UOB objected to OS 228 on the ground that the
                    reliefs sought by the Creditors were tantamount to foreclosure and the
                    appropriate order should, instead, be a sale of Guo’s shares subject to a
                    proper valuation of those shares. In doing so, UOB also asserted that the
                    defendant owed them a duty to ensure a proper valuation of the shares. The
                    Company was represented at the hearing but (eventually) did not object to the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After hearing submissions from UOB and the
                    Creditors, on 21 May 2009, Lee Seiu Kin J (“Lee J”)
                    ordered (“the Court Order”), <em>inter

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The S&amp;P Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff, like the defendant, also became
                    a shareholder of the Company due to its listing potential. She had started
                    investing in the Company in May 2007 when she purchased shares of the
                    Company from Guo. However, unlike the defendant, the plaintiff took an active
                    part in the business and affairs of the Company. In fact, the plaintiff, at the
                    request of the directors of the Company, supported the Company through various
                    loans, which were extended personally and through companies that she controlled,
                    because she held the view that the Company was a good long term
                    investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     By March 2009, the plaintiff felt that the
                    management of the Company was becoming too unwieldy given the number of
                    shareholders involved. At a shareholders’ meeting on 10 March 2009, the
                    plaintiff offered to purchase all the shares owned by the other <em>local</em> shareholders at $1.80 per share. Just a day ago,
                    the plaintiff had separately approached the defendant to purchase the
                    defendant’s shares in the Company, including the 3,218,458 shares which
                    the defendant was seeking to register in his name by way of OS 228 (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Four days later, on 13 March 2009, the
                    defendant accepted the plaintiff’s offer to buy the shares and entered
                    into the S&amp;P Agreement to sell the 3,218,458 shares charged by Guo, to
                    the plaintiff for a total consideration of $3,384,000. Pursuant to the terms of
                    the S&amp;P Agreement, the plaintiff duly paid the deposit of $500,000 to
                    the defendant. For completeness, I should add that the plaintiff was, at all
                    material times, fully aware of the UOB charge when she entered into the S&amp;P
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The material terms of the S&amp;P Agreement

<p class="Judg-1">It is immediately apparent from these terms that
                    the completion of the S&amp;P Agreement specifically contemplated the defendant
                    obtaining an order in OS 228 for the transfer and registration of the
                    Shares in his name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading up to the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Immediately after the defendant had obtained
                    the Court Order in OS 228, the plaintiff as director (she was appointed as
                    director of the Company on 10 March 2009) issued a notice later in the
                    evening of 21 May 2009 for an extraordinary general meeting
                    (“EGM”) to pass various resolutions which included, <em>inter alia</em>, a resolution to allot up to 6,000,000 shares
                    to herself as part payment of her loans to the Company. The resolutions were not
                    carried at the EGM held on 6 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the meantime, the defendant encountered
                    enormous difficulties with the Company in relation to the issuance of new share
                    certificates as earlier ordered by Lee J on 21 May 2009.
                    Eventually on or about 29 June 2009, the defendant filed a further
                    application in OS 228 for an order for the Registrar of the Supreme Court
                    to issue the new share certificates instead. The order was duly granted by
                    Lee J on 30 June 2009. With 3,218,458 of Guo’s shares now
                    registered in the defendant’s name, the stage was set for completion under
                    the S&amp;P Agreement (at least so the defendant thought). Therefore, on
                    6 July 2009, the defendant informed the plaintiff that he was ready,
                    willing and able to transfer the Shares to her, and proposed for completion to
                    take place on 8 July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, there came a further twist to this
                    saga. ComLaw LLC, who had previously represented the Company in OS 228,
                    filed a winding up petition against the Company on behalf of Rainbow Offshore
                    Supplies Pte Ltd (“Rainbow Offshore”) on 24 June 2009. This
                    petition was filed on the basis that Rainbow Offshore had extended a loan of RMB
                    12 million to the Company. It is not disputed that Rainbow Offshore was, at all
                    material times, controlled by the plaintiff. Although the defendant initially
                    opposed the winding up petition in order to investigate the alleged loan, he
                    eventually decided against it. Consequently, on 14 August 2009, the Company
                    was ordered to be wound up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     By various letters dated 8 July,
                    13 July and 20 July 2009, the plaintiff claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, that she was not obliged to complete the
                    S&amp;P Agreement because the UOB charge amounted to an encumbrance and
                    that the commencement of the winding up petition against the Company had
                    frustrated the S&amp;P Agreement. Thereafter, on 20 July 2009, the
                    plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendant to recover the
                    $500,000 deposit paid under the S&amp;P Agreement. In response, the
                    defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiff for specific performance of the
                    S&amp;P Agreement and for payment of the balance sum of $2,884,000
                    ($3,384,000 less $500,000) due under the S&amp;P Agreement, or for damages
                    arising out of the plaintiff’s breach to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     When the trial commenced before me, the
                    plaintiff raised the following issues as arising from the pleadings for
                    determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the S&amp;P Agreement was
                        entered into pursuant to the power of sale under the Charge, and whether the
                        defendant could convey the legal title of the Shares to the plaintiff
                        pursuant to that power of sale (collectively “the Power of Sale
                        Issues”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the defendant’s sale of the Shares to the plaintiff
                        overreached the UOB Charge such that the plaintiff took the Shares free from
                        the UOB Charge (“the Overreaching Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the defendant was in breach of
                        an implied term of the S&amp;P Agreement not to take steps to diminish or
                        destroy the value of the Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the S&amp;P Agreement was frustrated by the
                        winding up of the Company (“the Frustration
                    Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether the Court Order was procured by fraud on the part of the defendant
                        (“the Fraud Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_f"></a>(f)     Whether the Company’s objection to the
                        defendant’s application in OS 228 for the transfer and
                        registration of the Shares constituted a non-fulfilment of a condition
                        precedent of the S&amp;P Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     After the close of the defendant’s case
                    and in light of the evidence adduced at the trial, counsel for the plaintiff,
                    Mr Alvin Tan (“Mr Tan”), quite sensibly, decided not to
                    pursue issues (c) and (f) above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The nature of the defendant’s security interest in the
                Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before I address the remaining live issues, it
                    would be useful for me to clarify the nature of the defendant’s security
                    interest in the Shares, which had been labelled “Security Charge”.
                    The immediate question for consideration was whether the security interest was a
                    charge or an equitable mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On this point, it was recently observed by
                    Judith Prakash J in <em>Power Knight Pte Ltd v Natural Fuel
                        Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation)</em>
                [2010] 3 SLR 82 (at [23]–[24]), after citing <em>Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</em> (Louise Gullifer
                    ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2008), that the difference between an
                    equitable mortgage and charge may depend on the availability of self-help
                    remedies:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    One of the distinctions between a charge and an
                            equitable mortgage is that the chargee is not entitled to avail himself
                            of the self-help remedies of sale, possession or appointment of a
                            receiver (though he may apply to the court for one of these remedies):
                                <em>Goode</em>, para 1-51 (n 184),
                                <em>Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage</em>
                            (Wayne Clark ed) (LexisNexis Butterworths, 12th Ed, 2006)
                                [“<em>Fisher and
                            Lightwood</em>”], paras 6.1 and 6.3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Given that the parties intended that Power Knight
                            should have all the remedies available to a mortgagee, I am inclined to
                            regard Power Knight's security interest as an equitable
                        mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notwithstanding Prakash J’s observation, self-help
                    remedies such as the power of sale and the power to appoint a receiver are now
                    also commonly provided for in charge instruments. As such, as aptly observed in
                        <em>Fisher and Lightwood</em> at para 6.3 and
                        <em>Cousins on the Law of Mortgages</em> (Edward
                    Cousins ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2001) (“<em>Cousins</em>”) at para 1-13, the remaining distinction
                    between a mortgage and a charge appears to be, in principle, that a mortgagee
                    has the right to foreclosure and to go into possession whereas a chargee does
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, despite the label, both parties were
                    content to proceed on the basis that the defendant’s security interest in
                    the Shares was that of an <em>equitable mortgage</em>. For
                    good measure, counsel for the defendant, Mr Pradeep Pillai
                    (“Mr Pillai”), cited two authorities for the proposition that
                    the deposit of share certificates accompanied by blank transfer forms does give
                    rise to an equitable mortgage over the relevant shares. Both these authorities,
                    although dating back some time, still remain good law. The first decision was
                        <em>Harrold v Plenty</em>
                    [1901] 2 Ch 314 in which Cozens-Hardy J stated
                    at 316:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only material allegation in the statement of claim is that in March,
                        1897, the defendant deposited with Harrold the certificate of ten ordinary
                        shares in a limited company as security for the repayment to Harrold of the
                        sum of 150l., then owing to him from the defendant, with interest thereon at
                        the rate of 6l. per cent. per annum. <em>Now, it is plain
                            that a pledgee is in a very different position from an ordinary
                            mortgagee. He has only a special property in the thing pledged. He may
                            obtain a sale, but he cannot obtain a foreclosure. I do not think that
                            this is properly a case of pledge</em>. A share is a chose in
                        action. The certificate is merely evidence of title, and whatever may be the
                        result of the deposit of a bearer bond, such as that which Sir George Jessel
                        dealt with in <em>Carter v. Wake</em>, I think I cannot
                        treat the plaintiff as a mere pledgee. <em>The deposit of the
                            certificate by way of security for the debt, which is admitted, seems to
                            me to amount to an equitable mortgage, or, in other words, to an
                            agreement to execute a transfer of the shares by way of
                            mortgage</em>. The result is that the plaintiff is entitled to a
                        judgment substantially in the form which would be given if, instead of the
                        certificate of shares, the document had been a title-deed of real estate or
                        a policy of assurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in <em>Stubbs v Slater</em> [1910]
                    1 Ch 632 the court came to the same conclusion that a transaction
                    under which shares were handed over with a share transfer form executed in blank
                    to secure a debt was a mortgage that gave the mortgagee the right of foreclosure
                    (at 638–639):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If one asks how they were entitled to sell it is necessary to go back a
                        step. <em>The plaintiff handed over to the brokers one
                            certificate for the 390 shares together with a transfer executed by the
                            plaintiff in blank, in which the numbers of the shares were specified,
                            but the name of the purchaser and the consideration were, of course, not
                            specified. It was the ordinary well-known transfer in blank</em>.
                        Now what is the effect of that? I am astonished that there should be any
                        doubt about it. So long ago as 1899 Stirling J. in <em>London and Midland Bank v Mitchell</em> dealt with a case of
                        precisely this nature and indicated what was the legal effect of it. That
                        was a case in which certain shares together with a blank transfer had been
                        deposited with a bank to secure a debt, and it was held that the bank had
                        not lost their right against the shares although their simple contract
                        remedy against the client was lost by reason of the Statute of Limitations.
                            <em>The Court there pointed out that the whole
                            transaction was a mortgage as to which the bank were entitled to the
                            ordinary remedy of foreclosure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As already mentioned at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, clause 3.3 of the S&amp;P Agreement
                    required Guo to deposit the share certificates and blank transfer forms with the
                    escrow agent. In my view, Guo’s omission to deposit the share certificates
                    and blank transfer forms did not alter the agreement between the parties or the
                    nature of the defendant’s security interest in the Shares. In this regard,
                    the plaintiff has not suggested otherwise. Accordingly, I find that the security
                    interest created by the Charge in favour of the defendant was that of an
                    equitable mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Frustration Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of section 259 of the Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the present case, although the S&amp;P
                    Agreement was entered into prior to the commencement of the winding up of the
                    Company, the completion of the sale was scheduled to take place <em>after</em> the commencement of the winding up. Cursorily, the
                    sale of the Shares may therefore appear to be rendered void by s 259 of the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”),
                    which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Avoidance of dispositions of property,
                        etc</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>259</b>. Any disposition of the property of the
                        company, including things in action, and any transfer of shares or
                        alteration in the status of the members of the company made after the
                        commencement of the winding up by the Court shall unless the Court otherwise
                        orders be void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Pillai, however, drew my attention to
                    the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <em>Jordanlane
                        Pty Ltd v Kimberley Jane Elizabeth Kitching Andrew</em> [2008]
                    VSC 426 wherein the rationale for s 468 of the Corporations Act 2001
                    (Cth) (“Corporations Act”) (the Australian equivalent of
                    s 259 of the Companies Act) was lucidly explained. The primary purpose
                    behind s 468 of the Corporations Act is to prevent a shareholder from
                    evading liability as a contributory by transferring shares to some impecunious
                    person after the commencement of winding up. The Court went on to observe that
                    such a purpose can be sufficiently served by avoiding the transfer of the shares
                    only as far as <em>the company</em> is concerned.
                    Accordingly, a purchaser of the shares, such as the plaintiff, cannot avoid
                    completion in respect of agreements which were entered into prior to the
                    commencement of winding up, even if the company should subsequently be wound
                    up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Tan quite rightly did not seek to rely
                    on s 259 of the Companies Act to avoid completion of the S&amp;P
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Winding up of the Company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff submitted that the S&amp;P
                    Agreement was frustrated by the winding up of the Company on 14 August
                    2009, since the subject matter of the S&amp;P Agreement, <em>ie</em> the Shares, were no longer in existence as a result of the
                    winding up order. No authority was cited in support by Mr Tan other than
                    his reliance on s 7 of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Sale of Goods Act”) which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Goods perishing before sale but after agreement
                            to sell</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7</b>. Where there is an agreement to sell
                        specific goods and subsequently the goods, without any fault on the
                        part of the seller or buyer, perish before the risk passes to the
                        buyer, the agreement is avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     However, notwithstanding his reliance on
                    s 7 of the Sale of Goods Act, and purportedly <em>by way of
                        analogy</em> at that, Mr Tan was unable to identify any authority
                    that “shares” fell within the rubric of “goods”
                    under the Sale of Goods Act. The short answer to the plaintiff’s
                    submission is that the Sale of Goods Act does not apply to shares. This much is
                    clear from the definition of “goods” itself in s 61(1) of the
                    Sale of Goods Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“goods” includes all personal chattels other than
                        things in action and money; and in particular “goods”
                        includes emblements, industrial growing crops, and things attached to or
                        forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under
                        the contract of sale and includes an undivided share in goods</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is thus apparent on the face of s 7 that the definition of
                    “goods” under the Sale of Goods Act specifically excludes choses
                    in action, and there is ample authority to show that shares are merely choses in
                    action and are therefore, by definition, excluded from the Sale of Goods
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Further, the definition of goods under
                    s 61(1) of the Sale of Goods Act is practically identical to the definition
                    of goods under s 61(1) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c 54)
                    (“the UK Act”). <em>Benjamin’s Sale of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he statutory exclusion of things (or choses) in action means that
                        shares and other securities, debts, bills of exchange and other negotiable
                        instruments… and other incorporeal property are not capable of being
                        ‘goods’ for the purposes of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To put the issue beyond any doubt, English case law is clear that the
                    UK Act does not apply to shares because they are things (or choses) in action,
                    and this can easily be ascertained from the following two decisions, of which
                    the first is the House of Lords decision of <em>Commissioners of
                        Inland Revenue v Crossman</em> [1937] AC 26, in which Lord
                    Roche explained at 72:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By a sale I mean and understand a transaction which passes the property in
                        the thing sold. It must always be borne in mind that the Finance Act of 1894
                        is dealing with all descriptions of property and not expressly with shares,
                        and I regard the word "sold" in s. 7, sub-s. 5, of this Act as having the
                        same meaning as the word "sale" in the Sale of Goods Act, 1893: see s.
                        1, subs.3, of that Act. Shares with many other kinds of property are,
                        of course, not within the ambit of the Sale of Goods Act; but I am of
                        opinion that for the purposes of the Finance Act, 1894, for shares to be
                        sold the property in them, by which I mean the legal property, must
                        pass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other decision is <em>British &amp; Commonwealth
                        Holdings Plc v Quadrex Holdings Inc</em> [1995] CLC 1169 by
                    the English Court of Appeal (at 1226):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have no doubt that the method proposed by Samuel Montagu is appropriate
                        in the case of a commodity for which there is an available market. It is
                        akin to the rule in s. 50(3) and s. 51(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979;
                        although the Act does not apply to a chose in action such as shares in a
                        company, it merely reflects the common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Tan did not attempt to make any submission as to why the
                    position in Singapore should be any different from that in
                England.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Pillai, on the other hand, helpfully
                    referred me to a series of Australian and New Zealand authorities which have
                    consistently held that the insolvency of a company does not frustrate agreements
                    for the sale and purchase of shares in the company. The frustration defence was
                    raised and rejected in <em>Ezishop.Net Ltd (in Liq) v Veremu Pty
                        Ltd</em> [2003] NSWSC 156; 45 ACSR 199 where the
                    Supreme Court of New South Wales held (at [66]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In exercising the judgment the court is required to make as to whether
                        insolvency and liquidation has brought about the frustration of the
                        agreement there are a number of matters to be taken into account. First, on
                        the evidence as to the circumstances in which the agreement was made, I am
                        satisfied that the prospect of loss of their investment by reason of
                        insolvency and liquidation was within the contemplation of the defendants
                        when the agreement was made. Second, I am satisfied that the obligations of
                        the parties to the agreement are not affected by the event complained of,
                        nor has it been shown that the event in any relevant way has altered the
                        situation of the parties, radically or otherwise. Third, <em>it is plain that the event complained of does not result in the
                            impossibility of performance of the agreement in that the shares (and
                            the rights and entitlements attaching to them) have been neither
                            destroyed nor changed. It is not enough to demonstrate that the event
                            may have had a detrimental effect upon the value of the
                            shares</em>. According to Lord Radcliffe, it is not hardship or
                        inconvenience or material loss itself which calls the principles of
                        frustration into play.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Similarly the same defence was also raised and
                    rejected by the High Court of New Zealand in <em>Koutsojiannis v
                        Brown</em> [1981–1983] 1 NZCLC 98,081. I only need
                    quote from the headnote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The doctrine of frustration does not apply to a contract for the purchase
                        of shares which is unable to be performed because of the company being wound
                        up. There was in this case no intervening event or change of circumstances
                        which were so fundamental as to strike at the root of the agreement for the
                        sale of the shares. The matter must be considered in the light of the
                        circumstances pertaining at the time when the contract was entered into. The
                        failure of the company was simply an ordinary business risk which anyone
                        buying shares in a company must take as regards the future of the company
                        concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Tan, when confronted with the force
                    and weight of the above authorities, conceded that he was unable to distinguish
                    them from the present case. Accordingly, the legal position is abundantly clear
                    that the winding up of the Company did not frustrate the S&amp;P Agreement.
                    There is therefore no need for me to even consider the defendant’s
                    alternative argument that the frustration, if established, was in any event
                    self-induced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Fraud Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On or about 22 June 2010, just prior to
                    the commencement of the trial, the plaintiff amended the Statement of Claim to
                    rely on an additional ground of fraud to prevent the defendant from enforcing
                    the S&amp;P Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As can be seen from the terms of the S&amp;P
                    Agreement at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, it was a condition
                    precedent for the defendant to procure an order of court for the Shares to be
                    transferred and registered in the name of the defendant. This was accomplished
                    by the defendant by way of the Court Order in OS 228. However, the
                    plaintiff alleged that the defendant was not entitled to rely on the Court Order
                    because it was procured by way of fraud. It is perhaps relevant to highlight the
                    fact that there was no appeal against the Court Order and no step has been taken
                    to set it aside. As such, it is questionable whether the plaintiff ought to be
                    allowed to even raise this point at this juncture. Nonetheless, I shall consider
                    the merits or lack thereof of the plaintiff’s <em>fraud</em> argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     According to Mr Tan, the defendant had,
                    in OS 228, “actively misrepresented” to the court that there
                    was no sale of the Shares when he had in fact entered into the S&amp;P Agreement
                    with the plaintiff. To establish this, Mr Tan relied on two statements made
                    by the defendant in OS 228. The first of the two statements can be found in
                    the defendant’s affidavit filed on 12 May 2009, in which he referred
                    to UOB’s claim as being “premature”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.1.3    At the same paragraph, UOB asserts that the
                            [Creditors] owe a duty to UOB to ensure that there is a proper valuation
                            of the Subject Shares at the time those shares are disposed of in light
                            of UOB’s second charge over the Charged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.1.4    Quite apart from the fact that UOB’s
                            aforesaid argument is premature, the [Creditors’] principal
                            position is that there is no duty owed to the UOB as UOB do not hold an
                            equitable charge over the same shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other statement can be found in the defendant’s written
                    submissions, where he had stated that the application in OS 228 was not to
                    sanction any sale of the Shares, but was simply to have the Shares registered in
                    his name. Mr Tan attempted to persuade this court that these two statements
                    were “active misrepresentations” amounting to fraud. I simply
                    could not agree with this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Taking the plaintiff’s case at its
                    highest, all that the plaintiff can say is that the defendant <em>did not disclose</em> to the court that the defendant had entered
                    into the S&amp;P Agreement to sell the Shares to the plaintiff after OS 228
                    was filed. For such an omission to amount to fraud, in my view, Mr Tan had
                    to show, first, that there was a <em>duty</em> on the
                    defendant to disclose that information to the court in OS 228, and the
                    question of whether there was such a duty to disclose would, in turn, depend on
                    whether that information was relevant and material to the issues in
                    OS 228.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In OS 228, the defendant had sought to
                    transfer and register the Shares in his name pursuant to the Charge, of which
                    clause 3.4 expressly provides for the Shares to be transferred to and registered
                    in the defendant’s name upon an event of default at Guo’s cost and
                    expense:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Guo] hereby acknowledges and agrees that the [Investors] may at any time
                        (with or without [Guo’s] assistance) arrange <em>for
                            the Shares to be transferred to and registered in the name of the
                            [Investors] or their nominee(s) at the cost and expense of
                            [Guo]</em>, including but not limited to any stamp duty or legal
                        fees payable in relation to the transfers of the Shares in the event that
                        [Guo] fail to perform the relevant obligations of this [Charge] and the
                        [First Investment Agreement].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The effect of this clause was to allow the Investors, who were
                    equitable mortgagees, to perfect their security and become <em>legal</em> mortgagees over the Shares. Ideally, the defendant would
                    have been in a position to transfer the Shares to himself had Guo complied with
                    the obligation to deposit the share certificates and blank transfer forms with
                    the escrow agent (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). However, it
                    was precisely because of Guo’s failure to do so that the defendant had no
                    choice but to commence OS 228 in order to perfect his security; and it was
                    on this basis that the court had granted the Court Order in
                OS 228.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As such, I fail to see why it would be
                    material for the court in OS 228 to be informed of the pending sale when
                    such information had no bearing whatsoever to the issue as to whether the
                    defendant was entitled to transfer and register the shares in his name under the
                    Charge. In this connection, Mr Tan submitted that there were two <em>possible</em> advantages to be gained by the defendant by not
                    disclosing the sale. It was alleged that there would be no need for the
                    defendant to value the Shares as averred by UOB. It was also suggested that the
                    defendant would be able to retain any surplus from the sale of the Shares
                    without having to account to UOB as the subsequent equitable chargee. It is
                    immediately apparent that neither of these two <em>supposed</em> reasons has any direct bearing on the plaintiff. They
                    both concerned, at best, UOB. In my view, neither reason has any merit
                    whatsoever. First, the Court Order did not dispense with the need for valuation
                    particularly since the application was not for sanction of the sale. Therefore
                    if the Shares were sold below valuation, that is a matter to be taken up by UOB
                    against the defendant. Secondly, as the Court Order was not for sanction of the
                    sale of the Shares, there can be no question that the defendant was somehow
                    excused from having to account to UOB or any other party as regards any surplus
                    proceeds from the sale. Thirdly, it is indeed curious that it was the plaintiff
                    who raised this objection instead of UOB. Interestingly, UOB, the party whom the
                    plaintiff had alleged was effectively “defrauded” by the Court
                    Order, instead of making any similar accusation against the defendant, had in
                    fact reminded the defendant to “exercise their right of sale as chargees
                    in line with their duties as chargees in law”. Finally, when Mr Tan
                    was invited to explain why the Court would not have granted the Court Order if
                    the pending sale had been disclosed, he was unable to provide any satisfactory
                    explanation. In the circumstances, I find that there is no conceivable reason
                    why the Court Order would not have been granted in OS 228 if the court had
                    been apprised of the defendant’s pending sale of the Shares to the
                    plaintiff. The plaintiff’s argument on fraud is therefore plainly
                    misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Power of Sale Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Tan raised two arguments with respect
                    to the defendant’s exercise of his power of sale: first, he submitted that
                    because the defendant’s exercise of his power of sale under the Charge was
                    defective, the defendant’s sale of the Shares under the S&amp;P Agreement
                    was therefore <em>ultra vires</em>; and second, even if the
                    defendant had properly exercised his power of sale under the Charge, being an
                    equitable mortgagee, he could not convey the legal title other than by way of a
                    court-sanctioned sale under s 30(2) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property
                    Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”), which provides that
                    the court may “direct a sale of the mortgaged property, on such terms as
                    it thinks fit”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the S&amp;P Agreement was entered into pursuant to the power
                of sale under the Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The plaintiff sought to show that the
                    defendant, in exercising his power of sale, had failed to comply with the
                    requirements under the Charge in two respects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First, the plaintiff claimed that the 5-day
                    notice required to be given under clause 8.2 of the Charge was not given by the
                    defendant to Guo, and hence the sale was defective. Such a submission is, in my
                    judgment, based on a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of such notices.
                    It is trite that such notices are intended to protect the interest of the
                    mortgagor (see <em>Singapore Finance Ltd v Ben’s Electrical
                        Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [1986] SGHC 55). It cannot be
                    seriously disputed that Guo had to all intents and purposes abandoned any
                    intention to either contest the enforcement of the Charge or the sale of the
                    Shares under the S&amp;P Agreement. This is self-evident from Guo’s
                    complete failure to respond to any of the defendant’s letters in relation
                    to the S&amp;P Agreement or the Charge. In fact, Guo did not even bother to
                    enter an appearance in OS 228, after having been served. In any event,
                    notice of the defendant’s intention to exercise all his rights under the
                    Charge was in fact given to Guo through the defendant’s solicitors’
                    letter dated 12 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Secondly, the plaintiff submitted that clause
                    8.3 of the Charge contemplated a joint exercise of the power of sale by
                        <em>all</em> the Investors. Since the
                    S&amp;P Agreement was only concluded with the defendant, the sale could not
                    have been an exercise of the power of sale under the Charge. The inspiration for
                    this submission was based on the wording in clause 8.3 which provides that
                    “all moneys received pursuant to the exercise of the power of sale
                    described in clause 8.2 shall be apportioned amongst the Chargees
                    proportionately.” On a plain reading, clause 8.3 merely required that the
                    proceeds from the sale of <em>all</em> of Guo’s
                    mortgaged shares are to be apportioned proportionately among the Investors as
                    mortgagees. However, the question of apportionment does not arise in the present
                    case because, by virtue of the Court Order granted in OS 228, Guo's shares
                    had already been apportioned among the Creditors and the defendant was selling
                    only <em>his</em> proportion of the shares, <em>ie</em> 3,218,458 out of the total 4,208,752 shares mortgaged
                    by Guo under the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the foregoing reasons, I find that the
                    defendant’s sale of the Shares under the S&amp;P Agreement was a valid
                    exercise of the power of sale granted to him under the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendant could convey the legal title to the
                plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On this point, Mr Tan relied on two
                    passages from leading textbooks in support of the proposition that if an
                    equitable mortgage was not made by deed, then the <em>only</em> way that an equitable mortgagee can sell the legal interest
                    of the mortgaged property is by applying to court for a sale under s 30(2)
                    of the CLPA. It would then follow that as the defendant had not obtained a
                    court-sanctioned sale, he could not sell or convey the legal interest in the
                    Shares to the plaintiff. The first passage is found in <em>Fisher
                        and Lightwood</em> at para 30.43:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of an equitable mortgage not made by deed, there is no
                        statutory power of sale. If the mortgagee wishes to sell, he must therefore
                        apply to the court, which will be able to vest in him a legal term of years,
                        so he can sell as if he were a legal mortgagee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other passage is from <em>Cousins</em> at
                    para 16-121:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of other equitable mortgages not made by deed, there is no
                        statutory power of sale out of court. However, by virtue of section 91(2) of
                        the [1925 Act], the court itself has the power to order a judicial sale on
                        the application of the mortgagee or of any interested person and may vest a
                        legal term of years in the mortgagee so that he can sell as if he were a
                        legal mortgagee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     This submission, to my mind, was a complete
                    non-starter. First, it is certainly correct that if the mortgage was not made by
                    deed, then the mortgagee has no <em>statutory</em> power of
                    sale. This much is clear from s 24(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the CLPA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Power incident to estate or interest of
                            mortgagee</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>24</b>. —(1) A mortgagee,
                            <em>where the mortgage is made by deed, shall have the
                            following powers</em>, to the like extent as if they had been in
                        terms conferred by the mortgage deed, but not further:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) a power, when the mortgage money has become due, to sell, or to
                            concur with any other person in selling, the mortgaged property, or any
                            part thereof, either subject to prior charges, or not, and either
                            together or in lots, by public auction or by private contract, subject
                            to such conditions respecting title, or evidence of title, or other
                            matter, as the mortgagee thinks fit, with power to vary any contract for
                            sale, and to buy in at an auction, or to rescind any contract for sale,
                            and to resell, without being answerable for any loss occasioned
                            thereby;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, what these two passages really meant, in my judgment, was
                    that, in a situation where the mortgage was not made by deed, an equitable
                    mortgagee who has no <em>other</em> power or mechanism to
                    convey the legal title out of court would simply have no choice but to apply to
                    court to sell or convey the legal title. Examples of such mechanisms that allow
                    the transfer of the legal title out of court can be found in mortgage
                    instruments and include: the granting of a power of attorney to the equitable
                    mortgagee to convey the legal interest (<em>Re White Rose
                        Cottage</em> [1965] 1 Ch 940), or a declaration by the
                    mortgagor that he holds the legal interest on trust for the mortgagee (<em>London and County Banking Co v
                    Goddard </em>[1897] 1 Ch 642).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In any event, the defendant had already become
                    the legal mortgagee as a result of the Court Order in OS 228 (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above); and as the legal mortgagee having
                    legal title to the Shares, he was therefore entitled to convey the legal
                    interest to the plaintiff without the need for a further court-sanctioned
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Overreaching Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I now come to the final issue which, in my
                    view, was really the central issue of the present dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The defendant claimed that because the S&amp;P
                    Agreement was entered into pursuant to a valid exercise of a mortgagee’s
                    power of sale, the sale of the Shares had therefore overreached the UOB charge
                    and, as a result, the plaintiff took the Shares free from all encumbrances. The
                    plaintiff countered that the overreaching effect only applies to <em>statutory</em> sales by mortgagees as provided for in the
                    CLPA, and since the Charge and the S&amp;P Agreement were not executed by way of
                    deed, there was non-compliance with ss 24(1) and 26(1) of the CLPA
                    with the corresponding result that the UOB charge was <em>not</em> overreached as claimed by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The overreaching effect of a mortgagee
                    exercising his statutory power of sale is expressed in s 26(1) of the
                    CLPA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Conveyance receipt, etc., on sale</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>26</b>. —(1) A mortgagee exercising the
                        power of sale conferred by this Act may by deed convey the property sold,
                        for such estate and interest therein as is the subject of the mortgage,
                            <em>freed from all estates, interests and rights to which
                            the mortgage has priority, but subject to all estates, interests and
                            rights which have priority to the mortgage</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff submitted that since neither the
                    Charge nor the S&amp;P Agreement was executed by way of a deed as required
                    by s 24(1)(<em>a</em>) and s 26(1) of the CLPA
                    respectively, the sale under the S&amp;P Agreement could not have had any
                    overreaching effect. This submission was premised on the proposition that
                    overreaching is a creature of statute; and if that is correct, then there may be
                    merit in concluding that an overreaching effect can only be achieved by the
                    exercise of a statutory power of sale. In such an event, non-compliance with
                    s 26(1) of the CLPA would certainly be fatal to the defendant’s case.
                    It is therefore essential to determine whether the same overreaching effect
                    applies in general law independent of the CLPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Section 26(1) of the CLPA has been
                    considered in at least three Singapore High Court decisions: see <em>DBS Finance Ltd v Prime Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1990]
                    2 SLR(R) 740, <em>Indian Overseas Bank v Cheng Lai
                        Geok</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 574 (“<em>Indian Overseas Bank</em>”) and <em>Win
                        Supreme Investment (S) Pte Ltd v Joharah bte Abdul Wahab (Sjarikat
                        Bekerjasama Perumahan Kebangsaan Singapura, third party)</em>
                    [1996] 3 SLR(R) 583 (“<em>Win Supreme
                        Investment</em>”). From these decisions, it is clear that an
                    exercise of a mortgagee’s statutory power of sale does overreach
                    subsequent encumbrances such that a purchaser takes the property free from those
                    encumbrances. The position, however, is not entirely clear where the exercise of
                    the power of sale is not statutory but pursuant to a contractual
                right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff initially sought to rely on both
                        <em>Indian Overseas Bank</em> and <em>Win Supreme Investment</em> to demonstrate that there can be no
                    overreaching effect other than through the operation of s 26(1) of the
                    CLPA. However when the two decisions are closely examined, it is clear that
                    neither of them support the plaintiff’s submission. In <em>Win Supreme Investment</em>, Chao Hick Tin J held
                    (at [21]–[22] and [25]) that the sale by the mortgagee pursuant to
                    s 26(1) of the CLPA did overreach the rights of the mortgagor and of any
                    other person who obtained their rights from the mortgagor and subsequent to the
                    mortgage, which included a lessee of the mortgagor (the lease was entered in
                    breach of the mortgage). Likewise in <em>Indian Overseas
                        Bank</em>, after stating that s 26(1) of the CLPA also applied to
                    registered land, Goh Phai Cheng JC held (at [36]) that the defendant
                    purchaser had obtained good title of the property free of the four caveats that
                    were lodged after the mortgage was created. Indeed, there was simply no
                    suggestion in either <em>Win Supreme Investment</em> or
                        <em>Indian Overseas Bank</em> that the overreaching
                    effect can <em>only</em> be achieved by the exercise of the
                    statutory power of sale under s 26(1) of the CLPA. As, to my knowledge,
                    there is no direct Singapore authority covering this precise point, it is
                    essential to trace the historical origin of s 26(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The CLPA is derived from the Conveyancing and
                    Law of Property Ordinance (Ordinance 6 of 1886) of the Straits Settlements,
                    which in turn was based on the English Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1881
                    (44 &amp; 45 Vict, c 41) (“the 1881 Act”), which in turn
                    superseded Lord Cranworth’s Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict, c 145). A
                    brief history of the statutory power of sale in England was succinctly provided
                    by Briggs J in <em>Horsham Properties Group Ltd v
                        Clark</em> [2009] 1 WLR 1255 (at 1260):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">None the less, <em>from the early 19th century it became
                            common for the parties to legal mortgages to insert an express power of
                            sale, until it was rendered unnecessary to do so by the creation of a
                            statutory power of sale in Lord Cranworth's Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict,
                            c 145), repeated in section 19(1) of the Conveyancing Act 1881 (44
                            &amp; 45 Vict, c 41) and now to be found in section 101(1)(i) of the
                            LPA</em>. The exercise of that power overreaches any interest of
                        the mortgagor: see section 2(1)(iii) of the LPA. I shall refer to it as
                        the statutory power of sale. It becomes exercisable only when the mortgage
                        money has become due, subject (like everything else in section 101) to any
                        contrary intention in the mortgage deed: see section 101(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In this connection, it is pertinent to
                    highlight that there was no express mention of overreaching in the very first
                    enactment of the mortgagee’s statutory power of sale in Lord
                    Cranworth’s Act 1860, of which the 15th section reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Person exercising the Power of Sale hereby conferred shall have Power
                        by Deed to convey or assign to and vest in the Purchaser the Property sold,
                        for all the Estate and Interest therein, which the Person who created the
                        Charge had Power to dispose of, except that in the Case of Copyhold
                        Hereditaments the beneficial Interest only shall be conveyed to and vested
                        in the Purchaser by such Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Subsequently, the overreaching provision first made its appearance in
                    s 21(1) of the 1881 Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.—(1) A mortgagee exercising the power of sale conferred by this
                        Act shall have power, by deed, to convey the property sold, for such estate
                        and interest therein as is the subject of the mortgage, <em>freed from all estates, interests, and rights to which the mortgage has
                            priority</em>, but subject to all estates, interests, and rights
                        which have priority to the mortgage; except that, in the case of copyhold or
                        customary land, the legal right to admittance shall not pass by a deed under
                        this section, unless the deed is sufficient otherwise by law, or is
                        sufficient by custom, in that behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This overreaching provision was subsequently preserved in
                    s 104(1) of the Law of Property 1925 Act (15 Geo 5 c 20) (which is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> with s 26(1) of the CLPA: see <em>Win
                        Supreme</em> at [21]). This therefore raised the interesting
                    question whether overreaching was created through the 1881 Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Charles Harpum wrote in his seminal article,
                    “Overreaching, Trustees’ Powers and the Reform of the 1925
                    Legislation” [1990] CLJ 277, that overreaching had a common law
                    origin. Reasoning from the provisions of the 1925 Act, he concluded that
                    overreaching is a necessary concomitant of a power of disposition, and that only
                    a transaction made by a person within the dispositive powers conferred upon him
                    will overreach equitable interests in the property. However, it is also clear
                    that Harpum’s analysis was based primarily on an examination of <em>dispositions of land by trustees</em> and it was on that
                    footing that he surmised that overreaching (at least in cases of dispositions of
                    land by trustees) <em>must have a common law basis</em>
                    (at 277-278):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A number of misconceptions exist about overreaching. The first is that
                        overreaching is something that occurs only in relation to land. It is
                        undoubtedly true that the expression “overreaching” gained
                        currency during the 19th century and appears to have been used in connection
                        with dispositions of land. That association has been firmly cemented by the
                        provisions of the Law of Property Act 1925, s.2, which set out the
                        circumstances in which a conveyance of a legal estate in land will overreach
                        any equitable interest or power affecting the land. <em>But
                            overreaching must take place in relation to other forms of property. A
                            trustee who sells trust investments must necessarily hold the proceeds
                            of sale on the same trusts as the original investment</em>. It
                        must also follow from this that the basis of overreaching does not lie in
                        the statutory provisions of section 2 of the Law of Property Act. <em>It must have a common law basis if it applies to personalty,
                            and there are clear accounts of the effects of overreaching that
                            pre-date the 1925 property legislation</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, it is still not entirely clear, even from Harpum’s
                    article, whether a <em>mortgagee</em> has the same power to
                    effect an overreaching conveyance under general law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In an attempt to persuade this court that a
                    common law mortgagee <em>does</em> have the power to effect
                    an overreaching conveyance, Mr Pillai referred me to John Baalman’s
                    commentary, <em>The Singapore Torrens System</em> (The
                    Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) at p 137:</p>

<b>Effect of Sale</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the mortgagee has only a charge on the land, he is
                        enabled by s. 57 (2) [of the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956] to pass to a
                        purchaser the mortgagor’s estate. <em>The result is
                            much the same as that of a sale by a common law mortgagee. It
                            extinguishes all subsequent encumbrances to which the land may have been
                            subject</em>. At common law—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The effect of a sale under the power is to destroy the equity
                            to redeem, and this means that the rights of the mortgagor and all
                            subsequent encumbrances are defeated, and their only remedy is against
                            the purchase money in the hands of the vendor according to their
                            priorities.”</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It can be observed from the above passage that Baalman had cited two
                    authorities for the proposition that overreaching applied at common law:
                        <em>Directors of South Eastern Railway Company v
                        Jortin</em> (1857) 6 HL Cas 425; 10 ER 1360
                        (“<em>Jortin’s Case</em>”) and the
                    Supreme Court of Victoria decision in <em>R v Registrar of Title;
                        Ex parte Watson</em> [1952] VLR 470 (“<em>Watson’s Case</em>”), both of which were also
                    relied upon by Mr Pillai in the present case. However, as Herring LJ in
                        <em>Watson’s Case</em> also cited <em>Jortin’s Case</em> for the same proposition, it is
                    perhaps useful to begin by examining the judgment in <em>Jortin’s Case</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The issue in <em>Jortin’s
                        Case</em> was whether the sale by the Exchequer Bill Commissioners
                    (the “Commissioners”) to the purchasers was valid to give them
                    good title, free from the respondent’s mortgage. The House of Lords held
                    that the sale validly overreached the respondent’s mortgage and the
                    respondent could only look to the Commissioners if there was a surplus from the
                    proceeds of sale. However, it can also be seen from the judgment of Lord
                    Cranworth LC that the court had come to that conclusion by direct reference to
                    the statutory provisions of the Advances for Public Works Act 1842 (5 and 6
                    Vict, c 9). The relevant provisions, which provided the overreaching
                    effect, can be found in the judgment at 1363–1364:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 5 and 6 Vict. c. 9, gave (sect. 19) power to the Commissioners, on
                        sale of any property under the previous statutes, to retain, after payment
                        of costs, etc., “all the principal monies for the time being
                        remaining due or owing, or secured by virtue of such mortgage, etc.,
                        notwithstanding the whole of such principal money, or any instalments
                        thereof, may not, according to the terms of such mortgage, have become
                        actually due and payable, together with all interest (if any) for the time
                        being accrued due,” etc. <em>The 20th section enacted,
                            that when the Commissioners have sold, etc. “the same public
                            works, interest, property or effects shall, in respect to, and to the
                            extent of, the interest or estate so sold or otherwise disposed of, be
                            held freed and discharged from all claim and demand of the persons,
                            parties, bodies politic, corporate or collegiate, or companies, by whom
                            the same were conveyed to the said Commissioners or to their secretary,
                            and of all persons or bodies claiming under them</em>, and in all
                        respects as if such persons, etc. making such conveyance or transfer, and
                        all persons, etc. claiming under them, were in all respects, to such extent
                        as aforesaid, foreclosed from all equity or right of redemption of or in
                        respect of the premises so sold or disposed of; provided that nothing herein
                        contained shall be taken to prejudice the rights, etc. of any persons in
                        respect of any surplus which may be produced, in consequence of” the
                        Commissioners entering into possession of or selling the mortgaged
                        property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Cranworth LC did pause, however, to add in <em>obiter</em> that the position in general law appeared to be no
                    different, because the Commissioners were, in any event, also bound <em>by equity</em> to hold any surplus on trust for those who
                    were entitled to it (at 1365–1366):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[T]he other mortgagees will still have all which they
                            contracted for; that is, a right to be paid their interest before
                            anything is paid to the commissioners in discharge of their principal.
                            This right, however, is one which they can enforce only against the
                            Commissioners who have in their hands the proceeds of the
                            sale</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I incline to think that this would have been so if
                            there had been no express enactment upon the subject</em>. But all
                        doubt is removed, if any existed, by the 20th section of the 5 Vict. sess.
                        2, c. 9, which enacts, that whenever the Commissioners sell under their
                        powers, the purchaser shall hold free from all claim on the part of the
                        bodies corporate under whom the Commissioners derived their title, and of
                        all persons claiming under such bodies corporate, as if they had been
                        foreclosed; that is, the Commissioners are to be treated by purchasers as
                        absolute owners, so far as regarded the interests of those whose rights were
                        subsequent to the right in respect of which the sale was made, for those are
                        the persons to whom alone foreclosure could apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is hardly necessary to add, that this decision in no way affects the
                        rights of the Respondent on the money produced by the sale. The
                        Commissioners, unless there have been some special circumstances affecting
                        the case, <em>are bound, not only on general principles of
                            equity, but also by the express provision of the clause in the last Act
                            to which I have referred, to pay over and distribute any surplus money
                            in their hands</em>, after satisfying their arrears of interest,
                        to and among the persons justly entitled to it. With that question, however,
                        the present Appellants have no concern. They are purchasers under a power of
                        sale, the exercise of which gave them a good title against the harbour
                        trustees, and all deriving title under them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Indeed, the position in general law relating
                    to any surplus of the proceeds of sale supports the Lord Chancellor’s
                    view. In the decision of <em>Banner v Berridge</em>
                    (1880-81) LR 18 Ch D 254, Kay J held that a first
                    mortgagee, after exercising his power of sale, holds any surplus as a
                    constructive trustee for the second mortgagee (although, on the facts, the
                    plaintiff there was time-barred from claiming a constructive trust) (at 260,
                    269–270). Similarly, in <em>West London Commercial Bank v
                        Reliance Permanent Building Society</em>
                    (1885) LR 29 Ch D 954, the English Court of Appeal held
                    that the first mortgagee, who had notice of the second mortgage, was liable, at
                    general law, to make good to the second mortgagee the surplus that had already
                    been paid to the mortgagor (at 962):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is conceded that if he exercises his power of sale
                            as mortgagee, whether under the terms of the mortgage deed or by
                            statute, he is answerable for the money he receives if he pays it to the
                            wrong person, that is to say, if he passes over the second mortgagee and
                            pays it to the mortgagor who has no right to receive it</em>.
                        Ought we, then, to make any distinction between such a case and the present?
                        Here the first mortgagees, though they did not concur with the mortgagor in
                        putting up the property for sale, did concur with him in the conveyance.
                        Having done so with the knowledge that part of the purchase-money was going
                        to be applied in violation of a right of which they had had notice, they
                        are, in my opinion, just as liable as if they had received the whole of the
                        money. Not being able to give a good receipt for the whole of the money,
                        they must be held liable for that portion of it for which they could not
                        give a good receipt, for it was in their power to refuse to concur in the
                        sale unless the whole of the purchase-money was properly applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Accordingly, if the law imposes a duty on a
                    mortgagee, who has realised his security by way of sale, to hold any surplus of
                    the proceeds on constructive trust for a subsequent mortgagee, it would follow,
                    in my judgment, that overreaching is simply <em>a necessary
                        incident of this duty</em> under general law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>Watson’s
                        Case</em>, the issue that arose for determination was whether the
                    common law rule in <em>Otter v Lord Vaux</em> (1856)
                    6 De GM &amp; G 638; 43 ER 1381 also applied to a statutory
                    sale by a mortgagee under the Transfer of Land Act 1928 (No 3791) (Vic)
                    (“Transfer of Land Act”). The rule in <em>Otter v
                        Lord Vaux</em> was that a mortgagor could not by purchasing from a
                    mortgagee exercising a power of sale defeat a subsequent mortgagee’s
                    interest in the property. This entailed a discussion of the power of sale
                    conferred upon mortgagees by the Transfer of Land Act, in which Herring CJ
                    touched on the effect of a mortgagee exercising his power of sale at general law
                    (at 476):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The effect of a sale under the power is to destroy the equity to redeem,
                        and this means that <em>the rights of the mortgagor and all
                            subsequent encumbrancers are thereupon defeated, and their only remedy
                            is against the purchase moneys in the hands of the vendor according to
                            their priority</em>—<em>South Eastern Railway
                            Coy. v. Jortin</em> (1857), 6 H.L.C. 425, at
                        p. 435. The destruction of the equity to redeem takes place as soon as
                        there is a binding contract of sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, as the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of
                        <em>Watson’s Case</em> was that the rule in
                        <em>Otter v Lord Vaux</em> applied to statutory sales
                    under the Transfer of Land Act, Herring CJ’s comment on overreaching
                    does not really add much to <em>Jortin’s Case</em>,
                    although it does lend credence, in my view, to what appears from the cases, to
                    be the prevailing judicial view that overreaching also applies in general
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     That prevailing view recently became
                    established when the precise issue whether overreaching applies independent of
                    statute arose for determination in the decision of the Supreme Court of
                    Queensland in <em>St George Bank Limited v Perpetual Nominees
                        Limited</em> [2010] QSC 57 (“<em>St
                        George Bank</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff of the same
                    name loaned money (for the purchase and refurbishment of the Sheraton Mirage
                    Hotel Gold Coast) through a facility secured by first registered mortgages and a
                    first registered fixed and floating charge. Perpetual Securities
                    (“Perpetual”) and LJK Securities (“LJK”) held second
                    and third ranking mortgages and fixed floating charges respectively. Following
                    the default of the borrower, St George contracted to sell the land as well as
                    the assets and undertaking of the hotel (“SP Hotel”), assuring the
                    purchaser, Pearls Australasia Mirage 1 Pty Ltd, (“Pearls”) that
                    the subsequent charges would be released. However, after St George exercised its
                    power of sale, Perpetual and LJK refused to release their charges. The question
                    that arose for determination can be found at [16] of Wilson J’s
                    judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The respective priorities of St George, Perpetual and LJK are not in
                        issue. The question for determination is whether, upon St George’s
                        power of sale being exercisable under its mortgages and charges, and upon
                        completion of the contracts, Pearls will take the property and undertaking
                        of SP Hotel free of any of the interest of Perpetual and LJK under their
                        respective securities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As for the mortgages held over <em>land</em>, there was no dispute because it was clear, under
                    s 79 of the Land Title Act 1994 (Qld) (for registered land), s 83 of
                    the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) (for unregistered land), and s 350 of the
                    Land Act 1994 (Qld) (for Land Act land), that lower ranking mortgages will be
                    overreached when a mortgagee exercised its power of sale. This position is
                    identical to that of England and Singapore. However, unlike Singapore and
                    England (where the CLPA and the 1925 Act apply to <em>both</em> real and personal property), there is no statutory
                    provision governing the sale of <em>personal</em> property
                    by a mortgagee in the state of Queensland. Thus, in relation to the assets and
                    undertaking of SP Hotel, it was necessary for the court “to consider the
                    position [of overreaching] under the general law, apart from statute”
                        (<em>St George Bank</em> at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Due to the absence of any clear authority,
                    Wilson J began her analysis by tracing the mortgagee’s power of sale
                    back to Lord Cranworth’s Act 1860 and examined the decision of <em>Jortin’s Case</em>. Relying on a statement by
                    Lord Cranworth LC, Wilson J took the position that overreaching
                    also applied to mortgages in general law, independent of any statute.
                    Wilson J did so by first characterising the Lord Chancellor’s
                    statement as a “general observation”, and she then reasoned that
                    this “general observation” was entirely consistent with a
                    mortgagee’s duty in general law to hold surplus proceeds on trust for
                    subsequent mortgagees (at [47]–[49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    While the decision
                            in <em>Jortin’s Case</em> turned on the
                            priority agreement and the application of particular statutes, <em>it is significant that the Lord Chancellor made this
                                general observation in the introductory part of his
                                speech</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Now when a mortgage[e] sells under a power, that sale defeats
                            the rights of all subsequent incumbrancers, whose remedy then is only
                            against the money in the hands of the vendors...”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    
              <em>What his Lordship said was
                                consistent with a mortgagee who exercises its power of sale holding
                                the surplus proceeds on trust for subsequent mortgagees according to
                                their priorities, and ultimately for the mortgagor</em>.
                            Disputes about priorities and the amounts owing to those with an
                            interest in the proceeds could be determined by equity, by way of orders
                            for accounts and inquires.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    
              <em>In this way the subsequent
                                mortgagee’s interest in the property was
                                “over-reached”: the exercise of the power of sale
                                defeated the subsequent mortgagees’ interest in the property,
                                at the same time giving them a beneficial interest in the surplus
                                proceeds of sale</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having decided that overreaching applied to mortgages in general law,
                    Wilson J went on to hold that, in principle, the same should apply to
                        <em>charges</em> (at [50]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    In principle, the sequelae of the exercise of power
                            of sale by an equitable chargee are no different from those of the
                            exercise of power of sale by equitable mortgagee. So long as the charge
                            gives the chargee the necessary powers or conveyancing mechanisms, the
                            chargee may convey the legal interest in the charged property, free of
                            the interests of subsequent chargees in that property. Upon its doing so
                            the subsequent chargees (an take) [sic] interest in the surplus proceeds
                            of sale (if any).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Although it appeared, in my view, that there
                    is some ambiguity as to whether the Lord Chancellor’s statement (<em>Jortin’s Case</em> at 1366) can be taken to be a
                    “general observation”, I would nonetheless agree with Wilson
                    J’s finding (having arrived at the same conclusion at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above) that the concept of overreaching is
                    entirely consistent with the duty of a mortgagee exercising his power of sale to
                    hold the surplus proceeds on trust for a subsequent mortgagee. Overreaching is
                    therefore a consequence of the exercise of the power of sale by the mortgagee
                    which destroys the equity of redemption and thereby defeats the claims of the
                    mortgagor and the subsequent mortgagees. Their remedy lies against the surplus
                    proceeds arising from such a sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The recent decision in <em>St
                        George Bank</em> was derived from my own research. As it appeared to me to
                    be a case on point, I invited written submissions from both parties, after the
                    close of submissions, to address me on its relevance to the dispute before me.
                    Mr Tan sought to distinguish <em>St George</em> on the
                    basis that the statutory regime in the state of Queensland was different from
                    that in Singapore, principally on two grounds: first, the CLPA applied to both
                    real and personal property whereas the Queensland Property Law Act 1974 (Qld)
                    only applied to real property; and second, the notice provisions in these two
                    statutes were worded differently. These differences, however, were immaterial
                    because Wilson J’s holding in <em>St George</em> was that overreaching was not a creature of
                    statute and applied to personal property at general law, which directly answers
                    the issue raised before me. Accordingly, I find that the defendant’s sale
                    of the Shares to the plaintiff had overreached UOB’s charge such that the
                    plaintiff took the Shares free from the UOB charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Additional observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     During the course of the trial, it was the
                    defendant’s evidence that, subsequent to granting the Charge, Guo had also
                    granted two other charges, on 12 and 20 December 2007
                    respectively, in favour of several investors including the defendant, under the
                    Second and Third Investment Agreements. Although this strictly has no immediate
                    bearing on the issues that are before me, it may affect UOB’s priority of
                    entitlement to the surplus of the proceeds because those two charges appear to
                    rank ahead in time of UOB’s charge. However, no documentary evidence of
                    these other charges was adduced before me, and even if there were such charges,
                    this is strictly an issue between those chargees and UOB. I therefore make no
                    finding on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     There was also a separate question as to the
                    exact amount that was secured by the Charge. Mr Pillai had informed me that
                    the calculation of Guo’s indebtedness to the defendant under the First
                    Investment Agreement was a complicated exercise and was unable to provide me
                    with the exact sum that was due to the defendant. However, as this is strictly a
                    matter between the defendant and subsequent chargees, including UOB, I need not
                    make a finding on the defendant’s exact entitlement to the proceeds
                    arising out of the S&amp;P Agreement. It would suffice for me to say that the
                    defendant is under a duty to account for any surplus to the subsequent
                    mortgagees/chargees after Guo’s debts to the defendant that are secured by
                    the Charge have been fully discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It bears mentioning that it was the plaintiff
                    who had approached the defendant to purchase the Shares mortgaged by Guo. The
                    plaintiff clearly wanted to take over control of the Company. This was
                    consistent with both her own investments in the Company and the loans which she
                    had extended to the Company. However, shortly after the S&amp;P Agreement was
                    entered into, she realised that the Company was not such an attractive
                    investment opportunity after all. Thereafter, she became determined to find all
                    possible avenues to extricate herself from the S&amp;P Agreement. Unfortunately
                    for the plaintiff, the fact that the Company was no longer a viable investment
                    does not provide a legitimate excuse not to perform her clear and binding
                    obligation to complete the sale and purchase of the Shares under the S&amp;P
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     By reason of the above findings, I make the
                    following orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The plaintiff’s claim is hereby dismissed

<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">I declare that the S&amp;P Agreement is
                                    subsisting and binding upon the plaintiff;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">The plaintiff is to pay the sum of
                                    $2,884,000 to the defendant against the transfer of the Shares;
                                    and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">Interest at 5.33% per annum on the sum

                                    counterclaim was filed) to the date of judgment.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">As the plaintiff’s claim and the
                            defendant’s counterclaim are related and have common issues, I
                            will only allow one set of costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the
                            defendant to be taxed on a standard basis if not agreed.</div>
