<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Building and Construction Industry Security
                    of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) was enacted to
                    solve a common problem in the construction industry of contractors going unpaid
                    for work done or materials supplied. “A fast and low cost adjudication
                    system to resolve payment disputes” (<em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (16 November 2004) vol 78
                    at col 1113) was introduced to facilitate efficient recovery of payments,
                    thereby enhancing cash flow which was once described as the lifeblood of the
                    construction industry (see <em>W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v
                        Osko Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 380 at [18]). It is therefore somewhat
                    ironic that the Act has been bedevilled by litigation which has sought to open
                    up fissures, fault-lines and crevices in its edifice. At first blush, the issues
                    canvassed would appear uncontroversial, settled by the language of the Act. But
                    closer examination leads to a different conclusion. The present application is
                    an apt illustration. It cannot be gainsaid that the proliferation of such
                    litigation is the very antithesis of the <em>raison
                        d’etre</em> of the Act – speedy and cost-efficient
                    recovery of progress payments. The time is perhaps ripe to re-assess the Act,
                    iron out its wrinkles and creases, so that its language and purpose achieve
                    better alignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Section 10(1) of the Act states that “[a]
                    claimant may serve one payment claim in respect of a progress payment”.
                    The default position under the Act, pursuant to s 10(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act read with reg 5(1) of the Building and
                    Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations (Cap 30B, Rg 1, 2006
                    Rev Ed) (”the Regulations”), is that a claimant may serve a
                    payment claim on the respondent at a <em>maximum</em>
                    frequency of once a month, although there is nothing in the Act or the
                    Regulations to stop the claimant from serving its claims less regularly. For the
                    avoidance of doubt, I shall use the phrase “payment claim period”
                    to describe the period that the claimant is permitted under the contract or reg
                    5(1) (where the contract is silent) to serve a payment claim in respect of a
                    progress payment. It is important to note that this concept of a payment claim
                    period is distinct from the period of work covered by a payment claim, which I
                    will refer to as the “reference period”. It is perfectly possible
                    that the payment claim period and the reference period for any progress payment
                    will not coincide. It is also important to note that the entitlement to progress
                    payment is conceptually different from the payment claim period. The entitlement
                    may accrue on such date or event as the parties may contractually prescribe. It
                    is not uncommon for progress payments to accrue monthly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It was in this context that I had to decide
                    whether s 10(1) of the Act, read with the other relevant provisions of the Act
                    and the Regulations, means that a claimant is only allowed to serve one payment
                    claim in a payment claim period or whether it means one payment claim <em>per reference period</em> in a payment claim period. Casting
                    the question in another way: does the Act permit a claimant to serve in the same
                    payment claim period multiple payment claims, each for different reference
                    periods? Answering the question affirmatively would have an important
                    implication – it would allow a claimant to “bank” and
                    thereafter serve in the same payment claim period payment claims for different
                    reference periods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       This is the central question in the present
                    application, an application by the Plaintiff to set aside an adjudication
                    determination dated 16 February 2015 (“the Determination”) in
                    favour of the Defendant. The central question was also in the cross-hairs of the
                    dispute before the Adjudicator. The Adjudicator answered the question in the
                    affirmative. I disagreed and set aside the Determination with costs to the
                    Plaintiff on 20 July 2015. My view was founded on a construction of the terms of
                    the contract between the parties, as well as the provisions of the Act and the
                    Regulations. I should add that, after vigorously defending the
                    Adjudicator’s conclusion on the central question, counsel for the
                    Defendant conceded the point when parties appeared before me for further
                    arguments on 20 August 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Other issues were also canvassed before me. I
                    shall address those issues in this judgment as well. Unless otherwise indicated,
                    references to sections, regulations and clauses in this judgment shall be
                    references to sections in the Act, regulations in the Regulations and clauses in
                    the contract between the parties, respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It is helpful to recount the material background
                    facts as they are important to understanding how the central question arose. By
                    a contract contained in a Letter of Acceptance dated 4 September 2014
                    (“the Contract”), the Defendant was awarded the sub-contract for
                    the supply of labour, materials, plant and equipment for the civil and
                    structural works, and wet trade finishes for a project at Singapore Polytechnic
                    (“the Project”). The contract sum was $385,030.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Unfortunately the relationship between the
                    Plaintiff and the Defendant simmered with antagonism from the outset, rapidly
                    becoming fractious and unhealthy. Allegations of poor workmanship and delays
                    festered open and deep wounds of discontent. The acrimony culminated in the
                    Plaintiff alleging that the Defendant had repudiated the Contract by abandoning
                    the Project on or about 30 December 2014. Unsurprisingly, the Defendant
                    challenged the allegation with force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Three payment claims issued by the Defendant
                    were at the heart of the present application – Payment Claim 3 dated 5
                    December 2014 (“PC3”), Payment Claim 3 (revised) dated 26 December
                    2014 (“PC3R”), and Payment Claim 4 dated 31 December 2014
                    (“PC4”). It was common ground that PC3R was issued to replace PC3.
                    This was done at the behest of the Plaintiff who had insisted on compliance with
                    a certain format for payment claims. PC3 and PC3R were for work done up to end
                    November 2014, and PC4 was for work done up to end December 2014. They therefore
                    covered different reference periods. Adjudication Application No SOP AA029 of
                    2015 (“the Application”) was eventually presented on PC4 for
                    reasons which will become evident as we navigate the facts
                further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The circumstances surrounding the issuance of
                    PC4 were a matter of significant controversy. They form the pith and marrow of
                    the Defendant’s further arguments. I will come to those arguments later.
                    Returning to the facts, in substance, the Defendant alleged that the practice
                    between the parties was for payment claims to be issued on any day in the month
                    following completion of the work. This was evidenced by Payment Claim 1 dated 7
                    October 2014 for work in September 2014, Payment Claim 2 dated 7 November 2014
                    for work in October 2014, and PC3 for work in November 2014. However, in
                    December 2014, following the issuance of PC3R, the Plaintiff’s new general
                    manager allegedly notified the Defendant’s general manager Mr Yeow Ngui
                    Siong (“Mr Yeow”) that the Contract required all payment claims to
                    be served <em>not by but on</em> the 30th of the
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Yeow alleged that he understood the
                    Plaintiff’s general manager as saying that PC3R was invalid because it had
                    been submitted on 26 December 2014 instead of 30 December 2014. This prompted
                    the Defendant to issue PC4 on 30 December 2014. Two points must be made here.
                    First, the Defendant did not withdraw PC3R when it issued PC4. In fact, the
                    Defendant’s unequivocal position before the Adjudicator and me was that
                    PC3R was valid and remained in force at all times. This failure, as I will
                    explain later, proved to be the Defendant’s undoing on the central
                    question. Secondly, PC4 covered a different reference period from PC3R –
                    it was for work up to December 2014 whilst the latter, as mentioned earlier, was
                    for work up to November 2014. This was the bedrock of the Adjudicator’s
                    conclusion that PC3R and PC4 were both valid payment claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Plaintiff denied the circumstances
                    surrounding the issuance of PC4 as painted by the Defendant. In the main, it was
                    unnecessary for me to decide the controversy as the turning point in my view was
                    the Defendant’s failure to withdraw PC3R when issuing PC4. The subsequent
                    events were, however, relevant to the Defendant’s further arguments
                    – the Defendant raised the issue of approbation and reprobation there. I
                    will now sketch the subsequent events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 6 January 2015, the Plaintiff issued
                    Payment Response 3 to PC3R. The Plaintiff asserted therein that PC3R was invalid
                    and/or served out of time. However, the Plaintiff did not stop there. The
                    Plaintiff went on to deal substantively with the merits of the claim in PC3R. On
                    9 January 2015, the Defendant addressed Payment Response 3 in what appears to be
                    a response under s 12(4)(<em>a</em>). There was also a
                    general denial that PC3R was invalid. Payment Response 3 was replaced by Payment
                    Response 3R on 13 January 2015, in which the Plaintiff re-emphasised the
                    invalidity of PC3R.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 9 January 2015, by way of a letter of the
                    same date, the Plaintiff responded to PC4 (“the 9 January
                    letter”). No effort was made in the 9 January letter to address the
                    merits of the claim, unlike Payment Response 3. Instead, a jurisdictional
                    challenge was mounted on the basis that the Contract did not permit the
                    Defendant to serve two or more payment claims in the same payment claim period.
                    PC4 was therefore alleged to be invalid as it was served second in time to PC3R
                    in the same payment claim period, <em>ie</em>, the payment
                    claim period for the December 2014 progress payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Accordingly, as at 13 January 2015, the
                    Defendant was faced with a challenge to the validity of both PC3R and PC4,
                    albeit on different grounds. The Defendant resolved, or so it thought, the
                    problem by electing to rely on PC4. On 16 January 2015, the Defendant wrote to
                    the Plaintiff to assert that: (a) PC4 was served on 30 December 2014 because of
                    the alleged representation by the Plaintiff’s general manager to Mr Yeow
                    (see <em>supra</em> at [9]); and, (b) the Defendant would
                    therefore be proceeding with an adjudication application on PC4. On 16 January
                    2015, the Defendant issued notice under s 13(2) of its intention to apply for
                    adjudication on PC4. By a letter dated 20 January 2015, the Plaintiff replied
                    challenging the validity of PC4 on the basis that PC3R had not been withdrawn.
                    Notwithstanding this, on 23 January 2015, the Defendant proceeded to present the
                    Application on PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The issues before me in the first round of
                    hearings mirrored part of the issues before the Adjudicator. They were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was PC4 valid notwithstanding that
                        it was served second in time to PC3R in the same payment claim period,
                        because it covered a different reference period from PC3R (“Issue
                        1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was
                        the Determination null and void because the Defendant failed to annex to the
                        Application an exact copy of PC4 (“Issue
                2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 20 July 2015, I ruled in favour of the
                    Plaintiff on Issue 1 and against the Plaintiff on Issue 2. As Issue 1 went to
                    jurisdiction, I set aside the Determination. On 24 July 2015, the Defendant
                    requested further arguments on a ground that had not been previously advanced
                    before me or the Adjudicator – that the Plaintiff could not rely on PC3R
                    to invalidate PC4. As the argument went, doing so would allow the Plaintiff to
                    approbate and reprobate on the validity of PC3R. Such conduct had allegedly
                    caused the Defendant to lose the opportunity to file an adjudication application
                    on PC3R. This argument (which I shall refer to as “Issue 3”)
                    raised two sub-issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, could the doctrine of
                        approbation and reprobation confer jurisdiction on the Adjudicator under the
                        Act when but for the same, jurisdiction did not exist (“Issue
                        3(a)”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, was there approbation and reprobation on the facts (“Issue
                        3(b)”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After hearing parties, I dismissed the further
                    arguments on 20 August 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff’s submission on Issue 1
                    tracked the jurisdictional challenge to PC4 in the 9 January letter. The
                    submission rested on the following planks:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 21(a) provided for monthly
                        progress payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Section 10(1) permitted service of only one payment claim in respect
                        of a progress payment, as did the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Section 10(1) did not permit multiple payment
                        claims to be served in the same payment claim period even if they covered
                        different reference periods.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     PC4 was null and void as it was issued after PC3R in the
                        same payment claim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Adjudicator had no jurisdiction to hear the
                        Application as it was presented on an invalid payment claim,
                    PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_f"></a>(f)     Consequently,
                        the Determination ought to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As to Issue 2, the Plaintiff’s argument
                    was straightforward – the payment claim that accompanied an adjudication
                    application ought to be an exact copy, as opposed to simply a copy, of the
                    payment claim that was served in respect of a progress payment. In the present
                    case, an exact copy had not been annexed to the Application for three reasons,
                    which I will address in this judgment (<em>infra</em> at
                    [88]-[105]). Accordingly, the Defendant had breached s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) read with reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>). The
                    Adjudicator was therefore duty bound to reject the Application under s
                        16(2)(<em>a</em>) as it was not in accordance with s
                        13(3)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As to Issue 3, the Plaintiff’s
                    submission rested entirely on the argument that its conduct could not lead to
                    the conclusion that it had approbated or reprobated on the validity of
                    PC3R.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As against this, in relation to Issue 1, the
                    Defendant contended that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 21(<em>a</em>) permitted service of multiple payment claims in the same
                        payment claim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Alternatively, s 10(1) and the framework of the Act permitted service
                        of multiple payment claims for different reference periods in the same
                        payment claim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     As PC4 and PC3R covered different reference periods, the former was a
                        valid payment claim under s 10(1) and cl 21(<em>a</em>) notwithstanding it was served in the same payment claim
                        period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Accordingly, the Adjudicator had jurisdiction to hear the
                        Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As to Issue 2, the arguments were
                    two-fold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no requirement under the
                        Act for the payment claim that accompanies an adjudication application to be
                        an exact copy of the payment claim which had been served.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The payment claim that accompanied the
                        Application was in substance the same as PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As to Issue 3, in essence, the submission was
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     The alleged representation by the
                        Plaintiff’s general manager to Mr Yeow in December 2014 (<em>supra</em> at [9]) caused the Defendant to issue
                    PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Plaintiff’s subsequent challenge to the validity of PC3R was a
                        representation that the Plaintiff accepted its
                    invalidity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     This
                        induced the Defendant into believing that PC3R would not be relied on to
                        invalidate PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Defendant consequently elected to present the Application on
                        PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     By
                        thereafter using PC3R to invalidate PC4, the Plaintiff was approbating and
                        reprobating on the validity of the former.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Plaintiff’s conduct was motivated by
                        bad faith and designed to ensure that the Defendant lost the opportunity of
                        presenting an application on PC3R.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Was PC4 invalid by reason of PC3R?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statutory framework under the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is apposite to set out first the statutory
                    regime governing the service of payment claims. The starting point must be s 10,
                    which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Payment claims</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.—(1) A claimant may serve one payment claim in
                        respect of a progress payment on —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    one or more
                                other persons who, under the contract concerned, is or may be liable
                                to make the payment; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    such other

                                the contract for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A payment claim shall be served —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    at such time as
                                specified in or determined in accordance with the terms of the
                                contract; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    where the

                                prescribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A payment claim —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    shall state the
                                claimed amount, calculated by reference to the period to which the
                                payment claim relates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    shall be made in

                                accompanied by such documents, as may be prescribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent the claimant from including,
                        in a payment claim in which a respondent is named, an amount that was the
                        subject of a previous payment claim served in relation to the same contract
                        which has not been paid by the respondent if, and only if, the
                        first-mentioned payment claim is served within 6 years after the
                        construction work to which the amount in the second-mentioned payment claim
                        relates was last carried out, or the goods or services to which the amount
                        in the second-mentioned payment claim relates were last supplied, as the
                        case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Where there is a lacuna in the agreement
                    between the parties on the timing and frequency of service of a payment claim in
                    respect of a progress payment, s 10(2)(<em>b</em>) points
                    to the default setting in reg 5(1). Regulation 5(1) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Payment claims</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.—(1) Where a contract does not contain any provision specifying
                        the time at which a payment claim shall be served or by which such time may
                        be determined, then a payment claim made under the contract shall be served
                        by the last day of each month following the month in which the contract is
                        made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 10 and reg 5(1) were considered by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili
                        Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction
                        Engineering) and another appeal</em> [2013] 1 SLR 401
                        (“<em>Chua Say Eng</em>”). The Court of
                    Appeal held (at [89]) that ss 10(1) and (2), and reg 5(1) did not compel the
                    claimant to serve payment claims on a monthly basis for work done in the
                    preceding month. The claimant could decide not to serve payment claims at
                    monthly intervals. The Court of Appeal also held that the cumulative effect of s
                    10(1) read with reg 5(1) was to restrict the claimant to a maximum of one
                    payment claim a month in respect of a progress payment (at [90]). However, the
                    seed of doubt that the Defendant planted and which resonated with the
                    Adjudicator was whether the Court of Appeal had closed the door to service of
                    multiple payment claims <em>for different reference
                        periods</em> in the same payment claim period. Framing the question in
                    another way, what did the Court of Appeal mean when it said the claimant was
                    limited, under s 10(1) read with reg 5(1), to one payment claim in respect of a
                    progress payment in a month? Did the Court of Appeal mean one payment claim
                        <em>a month</em>, or one payment claim for <em>a reference period</em> a month, in respect of a monthly
                    progress payment? This is the question at the core of the investigation on Issue
                    1. It should be noted that the payment claim under consideration in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> was monthly as prescribed in reg
                    5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     If the latter is the correct interpretation, s
                    10(1) ought to be read as one payment claim <em>for a reference
                        period</em> in the same payment claim period. This interpretation
                    would not invalidate PC4 as it covered a different reference period from
                    PC3R.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The impact of accepting this interpretation
                    could have significant ramifications for a respondent facing payment claims. It
                    could open the door to service of multiple payment claims for different
                    reference periods in the same payment claim period. A claimant could
                    “bank” multiple payment claims for different reference periods and
                    serve them all, within a short span of time or at the same time, in the same
                    payment claim period. If this were to happen, the respondent could be left
                    scrambling to timeously file complete and comprehensive payment responses to the
                    deluge of payment claims. The starkness of the problem becomes more apparent
                    when one bears in mind that in reality, more often than not, progress payments
                    and therefore payment claims are monthly either because of the terms of the
                    contract or reg 5(1). A deluge of payment claims in a month could severely
                    debilitate the respondent. Indeed, as noted earlier (<em>supra</em> at [26]), the remarks of the Court of Appeal in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> were made in the context of monthly payment
                    claims under reg 5(1). A respondent faced with multiple payment claims in a
                    month would run the serious risk of slipping up on its payment responses –
                    by not filing one, filing one late or being less than comprehensive in the
                    payment response that is filed. This could be disastrous given the importance
                    given to the payment response by the Act. A claimant could actually game the
                    purpose of the Act, and in that process the respondent, by
                    “banking” its payment claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I found these considerations to militate
                    against reading s 10(1) as permitting service of multiple payment claims for
                    different reference periods in the same payment claim period. As a result, I
                    disagreed with the Adjudicator. Before I canvass my reasons, it would be germane
                    to set out the analysis of the Adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Adjudicator’s Analysis on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In summary, the Adjudicator’s analysis
                    was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>The Act conferred
                            a right to “progress payment” based on an event or a date
                            covering a period of work, ie, the reference
                    period.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Therefore, a payment claim was served with regard to
                            a reference period.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>While Chua Say Eng decided that there
                            could be only one payment claim served in respect of a progress payment,
                            it did not decide that there could not be more than one payment claim
                            for different reference periods in the same payment claim period (a
                            month, in that case).</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>What was prohibited was not service of
                            multiple payment claims in respect of a payment claim period per se but
                            service of multiple payment claims for the same reference period in a
                            payment claim period.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_e"></a>(e)     
            <em>To allow multiple payment claims for
                            the same reference period would cause prejudice and confusion as regards
                            the service of payment responses – the respondent would be
                            confused as to which payment claim he had to
                    address.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_f"></a>(f)     
            <em>However, such confusion and prejudice would not
                            exist where the payment claims were for different reference

                            issue – it provided that a claimant could not serve more than one

                            period in a payment claim period, and not one payment claim in a payment

            <em>As PC3R and PC4 covered claims for

                        5(1).</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I will now set out my reasons for disagreeing
                    with the Adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My reasons on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Preamble</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     A payment claim that is served in compliance
                    with s 10(1) is the bedrock upon which the adjudication process under the Act
                    gravitates. It is the trigger and, if triggered improperly, would cause the
                    process to fail. Get the payment claim wrong and an adjudication determination
                    of that claim is liable to be set aside for want of jurisdiction on the part of
                    the adjudicator. The starting point of the analysis must therefore be s
                    10(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     To repeat, s 10(1) states that there may be
                    served “one payment claim in respect of a progress payment”. It
                    would seem that s 10(1) cannot be contracted out of – the parties cannot
                    contractually agree on service of multiple payment claims in respect of a
                    progress payment. The terms of the contract are relevant only to the extent of
                    regulating the frequency and time for service of a payment claim. This is set
                    out in s 10(2)(<em>a</em>). Where the contract is silent in
                    this regard, a default setting is stipulated in reg 5(1) read with s
                        10(2)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Like s 10(1), cl 21(a) restricts the
                    Defendant to one payment claim. Progress payments are monthly with payment
                    claims to be served by the 30th of the month. It therefore has remarkable
                    similarity to s 10(1) read with reg 5(1) save that the date for service of
                    the payment claim has been adjusted to the 30th of the month (instead of the
                    last day of each month following the month in which the contract was made, per
                    reg 5(1)). Sub-clauses 21(a), (b) and (c), which are salient, provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>21. Progress Payment</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a. Payment shall be monthly progress payments. The Sub-Contractor shall
                        submit claims with measurement records (if applicable) of Sub-Contract Works
                        done and or delivery orders duly endorsed by the Contractor’s
                        authorized site staff. The cut-off date for the progress claim shall be on
                            30<sup>th</sup> of each month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b. Payment certificate or/and payment response shall be maximum 10 days
                        from sub-contractor’s progress claim submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c. Payment shall be 20 days upon receipt of original tax invoice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Given the similarity of cl 21(a), and s 10(1)
                    and reg 5(1), the correct interpretation of s 10(1) and reg 5(1) would answer
                    the central question in Issue 1. As the correct interpretation of s 10(1)
                    and reg 5(1) was a key issue in <em>Chua Say Eng</em>, the
                    question that naturally arises is: did <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em> decide Issue 1? I now consider whether it did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did Chua Say Eng decide Issue 1? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I am of the view that <em>Chua
                        Say Eng</em> did decide the central question in Issue 1. The Court of
                    Appeal shut the door to service of multiple payment claims in the same payment
                    claim period, regardless of whether the claims are for different reference
                    periods or otherwise (where reg 5(1) applied, that payment claim period would be
                    monthly). I do not share the Adjudicator’s conclusion that <em>Chua Say Eng</em> had left the door open.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The following <em>dicta</em> in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> (at [90])
                    makes the point clear:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, there is nothing in the language of reg 5(1) of the SOPR to
                        compel a claimant to make monthly payment claims for work done in the
                        previous month, whether or not he wants to do so. The Act is intended to
                        facilitate the payment of progress payments at monthly intervals. If a
                        claimant chooses not to make a payment claim at monthly intervals, because,
                        for example, he is not experiencing any cash flow problems or because it is
                        not convenient for him to do so, there is no reason to compel him to do
                        otherwise. If a claimant decides to serve payment claims at longer than
                        monthly intervals, e,g, quarterly payment claims, it would also benefit the
                        respondent, who need not pay monthly claims. In our view, the mandatory
                        language of reg 5(1) of the SOPR in relation to service of the payment
                        claim, when read with s 10(1) of the Act, serves to impose a maximum
                        frequency of one payment claim per month. It bars the claimant from making
                        more than one monthly claim in respect of a progress payment. Imposing such
                        a maximum frequency for making payment claims is fair and reasonable to both
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Two points emerge from this passage. First,
                    though the Act facilitates monthly progress payment, reg 5(1) does not compel
                    the claimant to make monthly payment claims. The claimant can therefore hold
                    over his payment claims. Secondly, reading reg 5(1) with s 10(1), the claimant
                    is restricted to a maximum frequency of one payment claim per progress payment
                    per month, regardless of whether it holds over the payment claims or not. That
                    reg 5(1) must be read with s 10(1) was made clear by the Court of Appeal (see
                    [88] of <em>Chua Say Eng</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is axiomatic that if payment claims are
                    held over, the spectre of multiple payment claims for different reference
                    periods being collectively served in the same payment claim period would arise.
                    In observing that the language of compulsion in reg 5(1) was not in relation to
                    the making of a payment claim but its service, the Court of Appeal in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> was in fact contemplating a scenario where
                    payment claims were held over. The Court of Appeal’s conclusion that a
                    claimant who holds over is limited to only one monthly payment claim in respect
                    of a progress payment must be seen in this context. In fact, I would suggest
                    that the Court of Appeal went so far as to offer a solution as to how such a
                    scenario should be resolved. It was pointed out that s 10(3) might be resorted
                    to where payment claims were held over – a claimant must state the
                    reference period for a payment claim (see [89] of <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em>). The Court of Appeal was expressing, in my opinion, the view
                    that where the claimant holds over, the payment claim ought to specify a longer
                    reference period reflecting the enlarged period of work covered by the claim. It
                    was for this reason that I had remarked at the outset of this judgment that the
                    reference period and the payment claim period may not necessarily coincide.
                    Therefore, instead of multiple payment claims, the Court of Appeal was of the
                    view that there should be one payment claim covering a longer reference
                    period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There are two further pointers in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> to this conclusion. First, there is the
                    reference in [91] and [92] to repeat payment claims under s 10(4). The
                    Court of Appeal agreed with the observation of the Assistant Registrar at first
                    instance that “s 10(4) was meant to widen the scope of s 10(1) by
                    providing the option of including in a payment claim unpaid amounts made in
                    earlier claims” (at [91]), subject to those claims not having been
                    adjudicated upon on the merits. The Court of Appeal appeared to incline towards
                    the view that the proper treatment for repeat claims was to consolidate them
                    under an overarching payment claim, as envisaged by s 10(4), rather than have
                    multiple repeat payment claims. Such multiple repeat claims must by definition
                    cover different reference periods. If this was the more appropriate approach for
                    repeat payment claims, in the Court of Appeal’s view, it is difficult to
                    see why different treatment ought to apply to fresh claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Secondly, I refer to the example cited in [94]
                    of <em>Chua Say Eng</em>. The scenario sketched was of a
                    claimant who held over payment claims for two calendar months. The Court of
                    Appeal envisaged only one payment claim, when a claim was eventually
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     These paragraphs point to the conclusion that
                        <em>Chua Say Eng</em> had answered the central question
                    in Issue 1 in the negative. In summary, the scheme of the statutory provisions
                    governing the submission of payment claims in light of the holding in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> on Issue 1 is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     there is to be only one payment
                        claim served in respect of a progress payment – s
                    10(1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     multiple
                        payment claims for different reference periods in the same payment claim
                        period are impermissible;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     the time for and frequency of service of a payment claim
                        is first and foremost a matter of contract – s 10(2)(<em>a</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     where the contract is silent, the default setting is one
                        payment claim per month served on the last day following the month in which
                        the contract was made – reg 5(1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_e"></a>(e)     reg 5(1) read with s 10(1) imposes a maximum
                        frequency of one payment claim a month; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_f"></a>(f)     where payment claims are held over, one payment
                        claim ought to be served stipulating the enlarged reference period – s
                            10(3)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     If I am incorrect in the conclusion I have
                    drawn from <em>Chua Say Eng</em> on Issue 1, I remain
                    nevertheless of the view that the central question in Issue 1 ought to be
                    answered in the negative. A careful review of the relevant provisions of the
                    NSWA and the parliamentary debates which led to their enactment, and a line of
                    case authorities from New South Wales which have considered the same point,
                    inexorably lead me to conclude that service of multiple claims for different
                    reference periods in the same payment claim period is impermissible. It is to
                    the New South Wales position that I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The NSWA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The NSWA has a similar structure and purpose
                    to the Act. The Act was modelled on similar legislation from other jurisdictions
                    including the NSWA. There are, however, important differences. As noted by this
                    court in <em>Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v A Pacific
                        Construction &amp; Development Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 776
                        (“<em>Australian Timber</em>”) (at [55]),
                    the provisions of the Act are a “… product not of unthinking
                    duplication, but considered adaptation instead” resulting in linguistic
                    variations in the Act. Therefore, it behoves me to bear this in mind when
                    examining the relevance of Australian decisions on the NSWA to the Act. With
                    this cautionary note in mind, I turn to the provisions of the NSWA that are
                    salient to Issue 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     My review suggests that there is no material
                    difference between the salient provisions of the NSWA and the Act. For ease of
                    reference, I have at Annex 1 of this judgment set out a tabulation comparing the
                    salient provisions of the NSWA and the Act. I make five broad
                    observations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First, “progress payment” is
                    defined in very similar language in both statutes save that the NSWA has an
                    expanded definition to make clear that a final payment under a construction
                    contract is also a “progress payment”. This is not a material
                    difference as it was decided by this court in <em>Tiong Seng
                        Contractors (Pte) Ltd v Chuan Lim Construction Ltd</em> [2007] 4
                    SLR(R) 364 (“<em>Tiong Seng
                    Contractors</em>”) (at [27]) (approved in <em>Chua
                        Say Eng</em> (at [95])) that a final payment would be regarded as a
                    “progress payment” under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Secondly, the accrual of the right to a
                    progress payment arises in the same circumstances in both statutes. Section 8(1)
                    of the NSWA is similar to s 5 save that it stipulates that the right to a
                    progress payment accrues on and from each “reference date” (this
                    language is absent from s 5). However, there is in fact no operational
                    difference between the two statutes. “Reference date” as defined
                    in ss 8(2)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) of the NSWA tracks the language of ss 10(2)(<em>a</em>) and 10(2)(<em>b</em>) read with reg
                    5(1). Therefore, the right to progress payment under the NSWA and the Act arises
                    in the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Thirdly, the right to serve a payment claim
                    under the NSWA and the Act also arises in the same circumstances.
                    “Payment claim” under the NSWA is defined with reference to s 13
                    of the NSWA. Section 13(5) of the NSWA is in particular salient. It states that
                    a claimant cannot serve more than one payment claim “in respect of each
                    reference date under the construction contract”. This is fundamentally
                    similar to s 10(1) read with s 10(2) and reg 5(1). Under s 8(1) of the NSWA,
                    entitlement to a progress payment arises on a reference date, which is defined
                    in s 8(2) of the NSWA in language which is very similar to s 10(2) and reg
                    5(1). This in turn triggers a right to serve one payment claim for the
                    corresponding progress payment, the time for service of which is to be
                    determined in accordance with the terms of the contract – ss
                        8(2)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>)
                    of the NSWA. Again, the language tracks ss 10(2)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) read with reg
                5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Fourthly, s 13(2) of the NSWA, like s 10(3),
                    requires the payment claim to identify the amount and period of construction
                    work covered by the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Fifth, s 13(6) of the NSWA, like s 10(4),
                    permits repeat payment claims to be included in a payment claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The observations I have made suggest quite
                    clearly that insofar as the right to progress payment and the entitlement to
                    serve a corresponding payment claim are concerned, the provisions of the NSWA
                    and the Act are <em>in pari materia</em>. This makes the
                    Australian decisions on these provisions of the NSWA relevant to the
                    interpretation of the corresponding provisions in the Act. It would also make
                    the Hansard on the NSWA pertinent in construing the intent behind provisions of
                    the Act. I should footnote here that the Hansard on the Act sheds little light
                    in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Hansard on the NSWA and some Australian decisions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I first start with the Hansard on the NSWA. It
                    would seem that “reference date” in s 8 was amended and s 13(5) of
                    the NSWA introduced to prevent abuse by claimants. M Morris Iemma, New South
                    Wales’ Minister of Public Works and Services, when speaking at the second
                    reading of the amendment bill on 12 November 2002 had this to say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The changes are not only designed to prevent abuses of the intent of the
                        legislation by respondents. <u>We recognise the potential
                            for claimants to abuse also the intent of the legislation. Consequently,
                            the bill restricts claimants to one payment claim under the Act in
                            respect of each reference date.</u> Reference dates will be
                        either dates specified in the construction contract for making progress
                        claims or, if not stated, the last day of each month of the year. …
                        [emphasis added in underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Minister’s remarks would suggest
                    that the restriction to one payment claim in respect of each reference date was
                    to prevent claimants from abusing the purpose of the NSWA. It is certainly
                    arguable that the “banking” of payment claims falls within what is
                    regarded as abuse. As I have mentioned above at [28], a claimant can ambush a
                    respondent by serving multiple payment claims over a compressed period of time
                    thereby making the respondent scramble to submit a payment response to each of
                    them. This deluge, coupled with the tight timelines for submission of a payment
                    response, could have the unfortunate consequence of the respondent submitting an
                    inadequate payment response or not submitting one at all. Given the deleterious
                    effect of such an omission, the argument for frowning upon such activity is
                    certainly there. Statutes such as the NSWA exist to facilitate the cash flow of
                    contactors, and not to empower them to game a respondent into conceding payment
                    for an unmeritorious claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The facts in the decision of the Supreme Court
                    of New South Wales in <em>Hill as Trustee for the Ashmore
                        Superannuation Benefit Fund v Halo Architectural Design Services Pty
                        Ltd</em> [2013] NSWSC 865 (“<em>Hill v
                        Halo</em>”) aptly illustrate the point. Briefly, between 8
                    November 2012 and 7 December 2012, the claimant served ten payment claims on ten
                    different dates, each for work done in ten separate months, <em>ie</em>, different reference periods. All the claims bar four were
                    settled. An adjudication application was brought in respect of the four
                    unsettled payment claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The key issue before the court was: did s 8
                    read with s 13 of the NSWA prohibit multiple payment claims for different
                    reference periods being served with regard to a reference date, <em>ie</em>, “banking” of payment claims? The court
                    concluded that this was not permissible. The court was of the view that
                    “on and from” each reference date in s 8(1) of the NSWA meant that
                    the progress payment to which a claimant was entitled was one in respect of all
                    construction work done up to that date. The court reasoned that service of a
                    payment claim “in respect of” each reference date in s 13(5) of
                    the NSWA ought to have the same meaning as “on and from” in s 8(1)
                    of the NSWA, <em>ie</em>, the payment claim ought to be for
                    all work done up to that reference date. Accordingly, service of multiple
                    payment claims for different reference periods in respect of the same reference
                    date was not permissible. The court observed that the provisions of the NSWA
                    which concern the submission of an adjudication application contemplate only one
                    payment claim per application. This it was felt lent support to the
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I should observe that given the similarity
                    between ss 8 and 13(5) of the NSWA of the one part and ss 10(1) and (2) of the
                    Act and reg 5(1) of the other, <em>Hill v Halo</em> would
                    seem to be an authority on point to Issue 1. While I accept that s 10 does not
                    have the language “on and from each reference date” found in s
                    8(1) of the NSWA, the operative question before the court was whether s 13(5)
                    read with s 8 of the NSWA only allowed one payment claim to be served in respect
                    of a progress payment. The operative question and the central question are the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I next turn to <em>Rail
                        Corporation of NSW v Nebax Constructions</em> [2012] NSWSC 6
                        (“<em>Rail Corporation</em>”), which was
                    referred to in <em>Hill v Halo</em>, similarly a decision
                    of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The facts are again instructive. The
                    claimant purported to make one payment claim. However, enclosed in that claim
                    were five invoices. Five adjudication applications were presented on each
                    invoice. One of the issues before the court was whether the payment claim was in
                    compliance with s 13(5) of the NSWA, as there were multiple payment claims in
                    relation to a reference date. The court found that there was in fact one payment
                    claim segregated into separate portions of work. Accordingly, the specific point
                    on s 13(5) of the NSWA did not fall for consideration. However, the court said
                    that s 13(5) of the NSWA prevented the service of more than one payment claim
                    per reference date. It would therefore not be incorrect to infer that if the
                    court had found on the facts that multiple payment claims had been served, the
                    conclusion would have been different, <em>ie</em>, that s
                    13(5) of the NSWA had not been complied with. <em>Hill v
                        Halo</em> read <em>Rail Corporation</em> as
                    involving one overarching claim (see [36] of <em>Hill v
                        Halo</em>). This would only fortify the inference I have drawn from
                    the judgment in <em>Rail Corporation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Two subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court
                    of New South Wales considered the same issue as in <em>Hill v
                        Halo</em> –
                    <em>Kitchen Xchange v Formacon Building Services</em>
                    [2014] NSWSC 1602 (“<em>Kitchen
                    Xchange</em>”) and <em>Southern Han Breakfast Point
                        Pty Limited v Lewence Construction Pty Ltd</em> [2015] NSWSC 502
                        (“<em>Southern Han</em>”). I begin with
                        <em>Kitchen Xchange</em> where the facts bear a
                    remarkable similarity to the present facts. The claimant served a payment claim
                    on 4 June 2014. That claim was withdrawn. On 12 June 2014, a second payment
                    claim was served. A payment schedule, which is the equivalent under the NSWA of
                    a payment response, was served by the respondent to the second payment claim.
                    However, on 23 June 2014, the claimant served a third payment claim. The third
                    payment claim included an additional item of claim. An adjudication application
                    was presented on the third payment claim. An issue arose on whether there was
                    compliance with s 13(5) of the NSWA. The court found that the second and
                    third payment claims were served in respect of the same reference date. The
                    court made the following observations (at [21]-[29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>section 13(5) of
                            the NSWA was intended to have a prohibitory
                    effect;</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>a payment claim which was not in compliance with the
                            section would not attract the statutory regime under the NSWA and could
                            not put into motion the procedure for recovery of the progress
                            payments;</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>any other approach would nullify the
                            purpose of the statutory prohibition; and</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>section 13(5) was
                            intended to prohibit the vice of repetitive claims on the same reference
                            date.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Accordingly, in the absence of evidence that
                    the second payment claim had been withdrawn, the third payment claim was held in
                        <em>Kitchen Xchange</em> to have breached s 13(5) of
                    the NSWA and therefore invalid. The adjudication determination was consequently
                    set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     While I recognise that emphasis was placed in
                        <em>Kitchen Xchange</em> on the words of prohibition in
                    s 13(5) of the NSWA – “cannot serve more than one payment
                    claim” – which are absent in s 10(1), that does not in any way
                    affect the relevance of the authority. In my view, it cannot reasonably be
                    argued that the perhaps less strident words of s 10(1) are malleable to a
                    construction that more than one payment claim may be served in the same payment
                    claim period. There is no scope for interpreting “may serve one payment
                    claim” in s 10(1) as permitting service of more than one payment
                    claim, without mutilating the statutory language. Indeed, to construe s 10(1) in
                    that way would be to go against the grain of the holding in <em>Chua Say Eng</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Finally, I turn to <em>Southern
                        Han</em> where <em>Hill v Halo</em> was cited
                    without disapproval. The court reiterated that s 13(5) of the NSWA was meant to
                    safeguard against abuse by a claimant. After citing the portion of Hansard
                    referred to earlier (<em>supra</em> at [52]), the court had
                    this to say (at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is apparent from this passage that the requirement of a reference date
                        and the requirement that only one claim can be made in respect of each
                        reference date was intended to be an important mechanism by which abuses of
                        the right to make a payment are to be preserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     This is a reiteration of the purpose of s
                    13(5) of the NSWA – that it was introduced to safeguard against abuse by
                    claimants of the legislative intent and purpose of the NSWA. I see no reason why
                    s 10(1) should not be regarded in the same vein as s 13(5) of the NSWA given
                    their common underpinnings. In this regard, it is difficult to understand how
                    the Adjudicator could have concluded that s 13(5) of the NSWA supported his
                    conclusion. The section in fact points to a contrary conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Information kits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Information kits issued by the regulatory
                    authorities in Singapore and New South Wales on the Act and the NSWA are useful
                    (to an extent) in construing the provisions of the Act (see <em>Tiong Seng Contractors</em> (at [18]), and also <em>Chua Say Eng</em> (at [87])). While traditionally not a part of the
                    material that is usually relied upon for the construction of statutes, they
                    nonetheless provide a useful insight into the industry’s perception of how
                    the provisions of the Act and the NSWA operate or ought to
                operate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The New South Wales Government Information Kit
                    on the NSWA is instructive. At Information Sheet 2, the following is
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Can I resubmit a claim”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Only one claim can be made under the act for each
                            reference date.</u> The reference date is either the date stated
                        in the contract for making the claims or, if there is no date, it is the
                        last day of each month.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The position in the information kit echoes the approach that
                        resonates in the Australian decisions discussed above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The statement is even more unequivocal in the
                    information kit issued by the Building and Construction Authority. Paragraph 2.3
                    is apposite. It provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A claimant is entitled to serve a payment claim within the period (payment
                        claim date) stated in the contract or mutually agreed in writing. If there
                        is no period provided in the contract, a payment claim may be made at such
                        intervals as the claimant so elects. <u>However, a claimant
                            must not make more than 1 payment claim within each month following the
                            month in which the contract is made</u>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Only one claim for a particular amount of work done or goods/services
                        supplied can be made under the Act for each claim date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It would appear that the BCA information kit
                    takes a similar position to the information kit issued by its New South Wales
                    counterpart and, as I have already stated, in a manner consistent with <em>Chua Say Eng</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Position in New Zealand and the United Kingdom</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The New Zealand equivalent of the Act is the
                    Construction Contracts Act 2002 (No 46 of 2002) (NZ) (the “CCA”).
                    The NSWA served as a useful model for the CCA (see the New Zealand Law
                    Commission study paper titled “Protecting Construction Contractors: An
                    Advisory Report to the Ministry of Commerce” (November 1999) at para 32).
                    There is similarity between the statutory language of the CCA and the NSWA,
                    though there are material differences. Of relevance for present purposes is
                    s 20(1) of the CCA which permits the submission of only one payment claim
                    per progress payment. This is akin to s 13(5) of the NSWA and s 10(1).
                    Unfortunately, there is a dearth of case authority from New Zealand on s 20(1)
                    of the CCA. However, given that its parentage is the NSWA, there is sound reason
                    to believe that a similar position to New South Wales will be taken in New
                    Zealand. For completeness, I set out s 20 of the CCA below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The UK equivalent to the Act is the Housing
                    Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (c 53) (UK)
                    (“HGCR”). Though the purpose of the HGCR is similar to the Act and
                    the NSWA, the language adopted is quite different. Having said that, the threat
                    posed to a respondent by multiple payment claims was highlighted in <em>Caledonian Modular Ltd v Mar City Development Ltd</em> [2015]
                    EWHC 1855 (TCC) (at [48]) in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48 <u>Such a sequence would make a mockery of the notice
                            provisions under the Act and the Scheme. It would encourage a contractor
                            to make fresh claims every few days in the hope that, at some stage, the
                            employer or his agent will take his eye off the ball and fail to serve a
                            valid payless notice, thus entitling the contractor to a wholly
                            undeserved windfall.</u> The whole purpose of the Act and the
                        Scheme is to create an atmosphere in which the parties to a construction
                        contract are <em>not</em> always at loggerheads. I
                        consider that the claimant's approach would achieve the opposite result.
                        [emphasis added in underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     These words are salutary of the threat that
                    permitting service of multiple payment claims in the same payment claim period
                    poses. It is a threat we must heed and guard against.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Act contemplates only one payment claim </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As noted above at [60], s 10(1) is unequivocal
                    – only one payment claim may be served in each payment claim period. The
                    use of “may” is permissive rather than compulsive in relation to
                    the making of a payment claim. However, there is nothing in the language of s
                    10(1) that opens the door to more than one payment claim in a payment claim
                    period. Consistent with this, ss 10(2), (3) and (4) each contemplate only one
                    payment claim, as does reg 5(1). The sections in the Act on payment response,
                    the adjudication application and the adjudication response, like their sister
                    provisions in the NSWA, also contemplate only one payment claim. Indeed, the
                    entire adjudication process is predicated on one payment claim being the subject
                    matter of adjudication. To allow multiple payment claims for different reference
                    periods to be served in the same payment claim period is to shoehorn unwarranted
                    language into the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Indeed, there is no necessity to resort to
                    contorting and mutilating the language and tenor of the Act to allow for service
                    of multiple claims for different reference periods in the same payment claim
                    period. As noted in <em>Chua Say Eng</em>, s 10(3)
                    specifically caters for a claimant who holds over. Such a claimant is therefore
                    not disenfranchised. I make one further comment. Section 10(4) of the Act states
                    quite clearly that unsatisfied and unadjudicated (on the merits) repeat payment
                    claims may be “re-served” on a consolidated basis under an
                    overarching payment claim. The intent appears to be to consolidate all the
                    claims under one roof, presumably with a view to avoiding the need for multiple
                    payment responses and adjudication applications. This is an approach I would
                    encourage. If repeat payment claims are given a statutory nudge in this
                    direction by this option, that begs the question why a different approach ought
                    to be encouraged for fresh payment claims, particularly in light of s 10(3).
                    There is no conceivable reason for the adoption of one approach for repeat
                    payment claims and another for fresh claims which have been held over. The end
                    objective is one of streamlining the adjudication process by consolidating the
                    claims under one roof, resulting in a consolidated payment response, and a
                    consolidated adjudication. This avoids or at the very least reduces the
                    confusion as to which payment claim needs to be responded to. Also, this
                    ameliorates if not eliminates the risk of not addressing a payment claim either
                    in whole or in part because of a misjudgement as to which is a valid payment
                    claim. Consistency of treatment for both repeat and fresh claims must surely be
                    a desirable outcome. As noted above at [39]­-[40], I believe the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> intended this
                result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Some remarks on Clause 21</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As an opening observation, I note that the
                    Adjudicator did not touch on the terms of the Contract. This is unfortunate. It
                    is evident from a review of cl 21(a) that the parties contemplated only one
                    payment claim in each payment claim period, to be served no later than the 30th
                    of the month. That payment claim was to be met in turn by a payment response
                    within ten days (cl 21(b)) and payment within twenty days (see cl 21(c)).
                    Therefore, the Defendant’s contractual expectation was to receive monthly
                    progress payments upon service of monthly payment claims by the 30th of any
                    given month. Parties had agreed on one payment claim per month. There is no room
                    in cl 21 to burrow in the words “per reference period” to qualify
                    the monthly payment claim. In fact, the Defendant did not advance the argument
                    that the contractual intention of the parties was in fact that. Therefore, if
                    the parties had agreed to only one payment claim in each payment claim period,
                    it is difficult to understand why that bargain was not given effect to by the
                    Adjudicator. As long as cl 21(a) was not inconsistent with s 10(1), it ought to
                    have been given effect to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In fact, the parties might have contractually
                    provided for one payment claim per month to prevent the sort of abuse or
                    confusion “banking” of payment claims could cause. A respondent
                    faced with the possibility of being served with multiple payment claims for
                    different reference periods in the same payment claim period might want to
                    contractually avert that risk of being inundated. Clause 21 or clauses of that
                    ilk could be the result of a desire to eliminate that risk. The Adjudicator
                    ought to have recognised this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Could the Defendant have saved PC4?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Could the Defendant have saved PC4 by
                    withdrawing PC3R when it served PC4? The adjunct questions that arise are: (a)
                    could PC3R have been withdrawn in the first place and if so, could such
                    withdrawal have been unilateral; and, (b) could such withdrawal be implied by
                    the service of PC4? Though these questions do not specifically arise for
                    consideration in light of my conclusion on the correct interpretation of s
                    10(1), they do merit consideration. I am of the view that these questions ought
                    to be answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The argument that withdrawal can be unilateral
                    and implied by the service of a subsequent payment claim in the same payment
                    claim period was made in <em>Kitchen Xchange</em>. The
                    court declined to address the argument instead finding on the evidence that
                    there was nothing to indicate that an earlier payment claim was withdrawn by the
                    service of a subsequent payment claim (see <em>Kitchen
                        Xchange</em> at [27]). I am, however, prepared to be more robust. I
                    see no reason why, as a matter of principle, a payment claim cannot be withdrawn
                    unilaterally and why such withdrawal cannot be implied from the circumstances. I
                    will explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It must be remembered that while the Act
                    creates a statutory right to progress payments, it does not compel a claimant to
                    make a payment claim if its cash flow demands do not dictate that it does so
                    – see <em>Chua Say Eng</em> at [90]. The option of
                    triggering the right to payment of a progress payment by serving a payment claim
                    is the claimant’s. Indeed, the entitlement to progress payment and the due
                    date for the payment are first and foremost a matter of contract – see the
                    definition of “progress payment” in s 2 and the manner in which
                    the due date for payment is ascertained in s 8. The same is true as to the
                    timing and frequency of service of a payment claim – see s 10(2). One is
                    therefore in substance dealing with a contractual right to payment, which upon
                    service of a payment claim, is elevated to a statutory right under the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Seen in this light, I see no reason why the
                    beneficiary of the right – the claimant –­ cannot
                    withdraw it if it so choses. The DNA of the right is contractual and therefore
                    amenable to being waived or not asserted, or indeed withdrawn. Ultimately, it is
                    the claimant’s entitlement to pursue its right to payment as it sees fit,
                    subject of course to the strictures of the Act. While it is true that service of
                    a payment claim does trigger the adjudication process under the Act, there is no
                    compulsion to take that process forward and, indeed right to the very end by
                    filing and pursuing an adjudication application to determination. If a claimant
                    can elect not to take a payment claim forward, it surely can choose to withdraw
                    the same. In my view therefore, the Defendant could have withdrawn PC3R
                    unilaterally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Can a claimant substitute a payment claim with
                    another? I would again say “yes” provided service of the second
                    payment claim is made within the same payment claim period. A payment claim
                    which falls outside that payment claim period would not necessarily be invalid.
                    I would suggest that a payment claim served in such circumstances ought to be
                    regarded as a payment claim served in respect of the next payment claim period
                    provided there is nothing in the contract that prohibits this. Indeed, <em>Chua Say Eng</em> at [94] appeared to make the same point
                    (see also <em>LH Aluminium Industries Pte Ltd v Newcon Builders
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2015] 1 SLR 648 (“<em>LH
                        Aluminium</em>”) at [46] which says much the
                same).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Can the withdrawal be implied from the
                    circumstances? This is a more difficult question given the need for certainty as
                    to whether there is a payment claim that requires a payment response. In
                    principle, I again do not see why the withdrawal cannot be implied from the
                    circumstances. If a payment claim can be expressly withdrawn, why can’t it
                    be impliedly withdrawn in the right circumstances? Further, if a claimant can be
                    estopped from asserting that a payment claim has been served (see the discussion
                        <em>infra</em> at [109]), I do not see why its conduct
                    cannot in an appropriate situation be regarded as an implied withdrawal of a
                    payment claim. The claimant would surely be estopped from asserting that the
                    first payment claim retains sustenance, and by the same token, obliged to accept
                    that the second payment claim is the salient one. Granted that where estoppel
                    applies, it is the respondent rather than the claimant who is asserting the
                    argument. However, if the circumstances are clear that there has been a
                    withdrawal and substitution, I do not see why there should be a difference. The
                    same factual matrix could give rise to both. The investigation is ultimately
                    factual – whether a payment claim has been served triggering the
                    adjudication process. However, given the serious consequences that befall a
                    respondent who fails to respond to a payment claim, the circumstances must be
                    abundantly clear that the earlier payment claim has been withdrawn by service of
                    a subsequent payment claim in the same payment claim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As will become apparent from the discussion
                    under Issue 3(b) herein, the present facts do not warrant the conclusion that
                    PC3R was withdrawn by service of PC4. Indeed, the Defendant’s further
                    arguments go against the grain of that conclusion. The argument assumes that an
                    adjudication application could have been presented on PC3R notwithstanding PC4,
                    if the Plaintiff had not allegedly misrepresented its position on the validity
                    of PC3R.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     There is an easy solution to pierce the mist
                    of controversy – greater contractual precision through better drafting.
                    The contract could simply deem that a second payment claim in time served in the
                    same payment claim period would substitute the earlier payment. Alternatively,
                    the contract could deem the second payment claim as having been served in the
                    next payment claim period, <em>ie</em>, it is held over to
                    the next progress payment, assuming of course that it covers a different
                    reference period from the earlier payment claim. Such clauses could help obviate
                    inadvertent non-compliance with s 10(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Concluding remarks on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     For these reasons, my conclusion is that a
                    claimant may serve only one payment claim in a payment claim period. I am of the
                    view that service of multiple payment claims for different reference periods
                    served in a single payment claim period is not in accordance with s 10(1). The
                    salient provisions of the Act, the decision in <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em>, and equivalent provisions of the NSWA as interpreted by the
                    Australian decisions discussed earlier all clearly point to this conclusion. The
                    conclusion is the same regardless of whether the payment claim period is as
                    specified in reg 5(1) or a different period under the contract <em>per</em> s 10(2)(<em>a</em>).
                    Section 10(1) is the operative provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     On the present facts, the Defendant was
                    entitled to serve only one payment claim a month, under s 10(1) read with cl
                    21(a). PC3R would have been the relevant claim for the payment claim period for
                    the progress payment in December 2014. PC4, having come after PC3R in the same
                    month (the payment claim period here), would not have been a valid payment claim
                    under s 10(1) read with cl 21(a). The vitality of a payment claim is essential
                    to the sustenance of the adjudication determination as the adjudication
                    application is presented on its back. Given that PC4 was invalidated by PC3R,
                    the Determination ought to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In the final analysis, the common thread that
                    emerges is one of safeguard against abuse by claimants. The Act facilitates the
                    cash flow of the construction industry by creating a statutory right of payment
                    for claimants through an expeditious process that requires strict adherence to
                    timelines (see the importance of strict adherence to timelines notwithstanding
                    the <em>de minimis</em> principle in the Court of Appeal
                    decision in <em>Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource
                        Interior Pte Ltd</em> [2015] SGCA 42 (“<em>Citiwall</em>”) (at [27]-[30]) for responses, notices, and
                    adjudication applications and responses). It creates a fast-track segue to
                    dispute resolution in the courts or arbitration by offering cash-starved
                    claimants temporary relief, leaving the substantive disputes to be resolved in
                    the usual way on another occasion (see <em>Citiwall</em> at
                    [28]). The New Zealand Court of Appeal decision in <em>Salem Ltd
                        v Top End Homes Ltd</em> [2005] NZCA 406 (at [22]) rightly observed
                    that the intention of legislation such as the Act is to “pay first and
                    argue later”. That, however, is not an invitation to abuse. A balance has
                    to be struck between the interest of the claimant and the respondent. As noted
                    in <em>Kitchen Xchange</em> and the Hansard on the NSWA,
                    there is a need to safeguard against abuse by claimants. Claimants who decide,
                    for whatever reason, to hold over their payment claims are obviously not in
                    pressing need of the relief under the Act. Allowing such claimants to
                    “bank” their claims is not in keeping with the legislative intent
                    of the Act and indeed, can lead to abuse. A safeguard is therefore necessary,
                    and in my view exists in s 10(1). The observations of the court in <em>Kitchen Xchange</em> on the vice of multiple claims at [29]
                    are particularly germane:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The vice of submission of repetitive payment claims is obvious… It
                        is clearly deleterious to a respondent to be forced to reply individually
                        often at the expense of time, labour and money, to repetitive payment claims
                        which all relate to the same reference date. On the other hand, should the
                        respondent take the view that it has done enough, it is courting the risk
                        that a particular document will be held and thus, sufficient to initiate the
                        process of recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The observations of Lee Seiu Kin J in
                        <em>LH Aluminium</em> (at [46]) as regards repeat
                    claims are equally pertinent to the risk posed by multiple claims which are not
                    repeat claims:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46 In my view, s 10 of the Act is equivocal as to whether a repeat claim
                        is permitted and it is a matter of judicial policy in interpreting the Act
                        so as to achieve its objectives. On the one hand, as Woo J pointed out in
                        [68] of <em>JFC Builders</em> ([30] <em>supra</em>), permitting repeat claims opens the Act to abuse by
                        rendering the deadline nugatory as a claimant could merely issue and serve a
                        repeat claim. On my part, I do not think this is a real problem in view of
                        the holding in <em>Terence Lee</em> ([28] <em>supra</em>) at [94] that a payment claim served just
                        after the deadline for that month could be construed as a payment claim
                        within the deadline for the following month. <u>In my view,
                            the more serious concern is that this paves the way for a claimant to
                            ambush the respondent by repeatedly serving the same payment claim month
                            after month.</u> The present case is a good example of sustained
                        repeat claims. The first payment claim was served on 22 June 2013 and this
                        was repeated four times over the next five months. <u>The
                            danger for a respondent is that the moment he slips up and fails to
                            serve a payment response within the deadline, the claimant could file an
                            adjudication application (although that is not a feature in the present
                            case).</u> Because s 15(3)(<em>a</em>) of
                        the Act forbids consideration of a late payment response, the claimant would
                        be virtually certain of obtaining an adjudication determination in his
                        favour. <em>JFC Builders</em> is an example of such an
                        ambush: a payment claim was submitted on 15 December 2010 for about $360,000
                        and the respondent made payment of $125,000. The following month, on 24
                        January 2011, the claimant submitted a payment claim for the balance of
                        about $235,000 in respect of the same period in the December payment claim.
                        The respondent failed to provide a payment response in time and the claimant
                        successfully obtained an adjudication determination in its favour. <em>Doo Ree</em> ([38] <em>supra</em>)
                        is yet another example. The claimant had submitted a payment claim on 29
                        November 2008 for the sum of about $254,000. The respondent did not provide
                        a payment response in time and an adjudication application was made.
                        However, the adjudicator held that the claim was premature under s
                            13(3)(<em>a</em>) and dismissed it pursuant to s
                            16(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act. On 30 January 2009,
                        the claimant submitted a second payment claim for the reduced sum of
                        $202,349.41 but in relation to the same works as the earlier claim. The
                        respondent provided a payment response in which the claim was refuted on the
                        basis that this was a repeat of the earlier payment claim. The claimant did
                        not make an adjudication application in this instance, but two months later,
                        on 31 March 2009, filed a payment claim for the same sum of $202,349.41. The
                        respondent did not provide a payment response to this claim and the claimant
                        filed an adjudication application. [emphasis added in underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     These are observations I align myself with
                    completely. Indeed, they apply with greater force in the present context of
                    fresh payment claims filed in the same payment claim period. At the heart is the
                    risk of abuse by the claimant. Disputes such as the present will result if the
                    door is not firmly shut on service of multiple payment claims in the same
                    payment claim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Finally, a footnote to Issue 1. Clause 21(a)
                    bears similarity to clauses in several standard form contracts that are in use
                    in Singapore. A schedule of these clauses is annexed hereto as Annex 2. The
                    differences between cl 21(a) and these clauses, insofar as they relate to Issue
                    1, do not appear material. While an argument was made that the views expressed
                    above on cl 21(a) read with s 10(1) may apply to those clauses as
                    well, I declined to take a firm view on this without more careful consideration
                    of those clauses in the full context of the agreements in which they were
                    found.</p>

                    if PC4 was held to be a valid payment claim. The arrow that the Plaintiff shot
                    was that the Application was filed in breach of s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) read with reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>). In the
                    main, the submission was that the Application did not annex <em>a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Plaintiff’s submission was that s
                        13(3)(<em>c</em>) directed an adjudication application
                    to be accompanied by such documents as might be prescribed. As reg
                        7(2)(<em>e</em>) prescribed a copy of the payment
                    claim, the failure to annex an exact copy of the payment claim was fatal. Given
                    that the Defendant allegedly did not annex an exact copy of PC4 to the
                    Application, the Adjudicator was duty bound to reject the same pursuant to s
                        16(2)(<em>a</em>). Section 16(2)(<em>a</em>) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) An adjudicator shall reject —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) any adjudication application that is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The Plaintiff levied three complaints as
                    regards the copy of PC4 that was annexed to the Application
                    (“APC4”), arguing that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Defendant had included
                        additional pages and information in APC4;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Defendant had switched the order of several
                        pages found in PC4; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Defendant had altered or modified the contents of
                        certain pages in PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I disagreed with the Plaintiff’s
                    submission on three grounds. First, I took the view that it was sufficient that
                    the copy of the payment claim that was to accompany the Application need only be
                    a copy, and not an exact copy, of the payment claim. In other words, it was not
                    important whether an exact copy had been annexed to the Application. However, it
                    was important whether there has been any change to the claim or the basis of the
                    claim in the accompanying payment claim. Secondly, the alleged deviations in
                    APC4 were so trivial that they must surely be subject to the <em>de minimis</em> principle. Thirdly, non-compliance with s
                        13(3)(<em>c</em>) read with reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>) would not result in the invalidity of the
                    application, in light of the legislative purpose of the Act. I should add that
                    the Adjudicator also disagreed with the Plaintiff on this
                submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It is axiomatic that the service of a payment
                    claim initiates the adjudication process under the Act. It is important that it
                    contains sufficient detail to enable the respondent to know the case it needs to
                    meet and to decide the course of action it wishes to take. The Act and the
                    Regulations therefore prescribe the details that need to be included in the
                    payment claim – see s 10(3) and reg 5(2). However, notably, while
                    prescribing the details that need to be contained in a payment claim, the Act
                    and the Regulations stop short of stipulating a format for the same. This is
                    deliberate in my view for one obvious reason. The Act was enacted to facilitate
                    recovery of progress payments through a simplified and expeditious process for
                    recovery of progress payments. A formalistic and pedantic approach would go
                    against that grain. Contractors and sub-contractors could flounder if a rigid
                    format for payment claims was insisted upon. Indeed, as noted in <em>Australian Timber</em> (at [56]-[61]), the Australian
                    authorities have adopted a test to determine compliance with the formal
                    conditions prescribed for the contents of a payment claim that are not overly
                    demanding of the claimants. It is important to use an objective lens to
                    ascertain whether the statutory criteria has been complied with, always bearing
                    in mind that the “<em>actors in the construction industry
                        often operate on tight deadlines and do not always communicate ideally in a
                        formal manner</em>” (<em>Australian
                        Timber</em> at [63]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Indeed, it was recognised in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> (at [75]) that a payment claim need not be
                    cast in formal tones or legalese provided it contained the information that was
                    prescribed by the Act and the Regulations. It could be voluminous or might
                    contain confusing elements such as an informal or unbusiness-like tone. It did
                    not have to state that it was a payment claim to qualify as one under the Act
                    – see <em>Australian Timber</em> at [19]. The
                    position in New Zealand is also illuminating. Section 20(2) of the CCA is very
                    similar in tenor to s 10(3) and reg 5(2). The New Zealand cases, while
                    acknowledging that s 20(2) of the CCA is cast in mandatory language, have
                    said that technical quibbles that the section has not been complied with would
                    be given short shrift – see <em>eg</em>, <em>George Developments Ltd v Canam Construction Ltd</em> [2006]
                    1 NZLR 177 (“<em>George Developments</em>”)
                    (see <em>infra</em> at [98]). Adopting the same approach
                    for the Act would in my view undoubtedly facilitate its object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Seeing as how there is an absence of
                    formalities as regards a payment claim, it is difficult to see why an
                    application that is not accompanied by an exact copy of the payment claim will
                    be regarded as invalid. Regulation 7(2)(<em>e</em>) does
                    not say that an exact copy is required and I see no reason why it should be read
                    in that manner. It is relevant to remember why the payment claim has to
                    accompany the adjudication application. The payment claim and the payment
                    response frame the issues in the claim before the adjudicator and hence his
                    jurisdiction – see in particular ss 17(3)(<em>c</em>)
                    and (<em>d</em>). It is material whether the adjudicator
                    has before him the claim that initiated the adjudication process under the Act
                    and which the respondent has met in its payment response. It is, however, not
                    material whether that payment claim is an exact reproduction. If the Plaintiff
                    is right, by simply adding or substituting to a payment claim a page or two of
                    the documents in support would invalidate the adjudication application even if
                    there is no alteration to the claim. The difficulty presented by the
                    Plaintiff’s submission is evident from just this one
                example.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     There is another reason that militates against
                    the Plaintiff’s submission – the informality of the payment claim.
                    That the payment claim may be informal in itself suggests that the claimant may
                    wish to buttress it with additional information when submitting the adjudication
                    application. The Act applies to an industry that quite often operates with a
                    degree of informality. Indeed s 13(3)(<em>d</em>)
                    recognises this by allowing additional material in support of the adjudication
                    application to accompany the same. If such material is incorporated into the
                    payment claim, the payment claim that accompanies the adjudication application
                    will surely not be an exact copy. Ought it then to be set aside? Surely
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I am again fortified in my view by the
                    approach taken in New Zealand to technical non-compliance with s 20(2) of the
                    CCA. In <em>George Developments</em>, it was felt that
                    substantive compliance ought to be the test, and technical quibbles and glitches
                    ought to be given short shrift. The following passage is helpful (at
                    [42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[42] As is noted in Smellie Progress Payments and
                        Adjudication (2003) at 31, “Although [the s 20(2)] requirements are
                        mandatory, <u>technical quibbles that they have not been
                            complied with will probably receive scant attention”</u>.
                        The learned author notes the New South Wales case of <em>Hawkins Construction v Mac’s Industrial Pipework</em>
                        [2001] NSWSC 815 where Windeyer J considered the validity of a payment claim
                        under legislation equivalent to the New Zealand Act and said at paragraph
                        8:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“8 [Counsel] contended that the payment claims served on the
                            plaintiff … were ineffective because they did not comply with
                            section 13(2)(a) and (c) of the Act. The arguments were that they
                            contained the incorrect contract number and abbreviated the name of the
                            Act under which the claim was made … As to the first, while the
                            contract number may have been wrong in some cases, the claims did
                            identify the work done. The second argument was that because the payment
                            claims abbreviated the name of the Act, they did not fulfil a statutory
                            requirement to name the Act. This argument might have had some weight in
                            1800. In 2001, an argument based on the absence of the word
                            “and” and the letters “USTRY” has no merit.
                            It should not have been put.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[43] We acknowledge that the approach of this appellant was not as
                        pedantic as those confronting Windeyer J, but <u>the
                            general observation that technical quibbles should not be allowed to
                            vitiate a payment claim that substantively complies with the
                            requirements of the Act is critical and needs to be weighed alongside
                            the “technocratic” interpretation advanced by
                            George.</u></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The same approach was taken in the decision in
                        <em>Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd</em> [2008] FCA
                    1248 (in relation to s 14 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of
                    Payment Act 2002 (No 15 of 2002) (Vic)), where the Federal Court of Australia
                    eschewed an overly demanding and unduly technical approach to the issue of
                    compliance (at [11]). In the same vein, the mandatory language of s
                        13(3)(<em>c</em>) and reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>) ought not to be read as requiring an exact copy of the
                    payment claim. To conclude otherwise would be to allow technical quibbles of
                    non-compliance to prevail over the object of the Act. The test ought to be
                    whether there has been compliance with the statutory requirements as assessed
                    through an objective lens applying a not overly demanding and technical standard
                        (<em>Australian Timber</em> at [61] and [63]). In the
                    round, it must not be forgotten why the payment claim has to be annexed to the
                    application – so that the payment claim that was served is placed before
                    the adjudicator. As the payment claim and the payment response frame the issues
                    before the adjudicator, he should therefore have the correct documents before
                    him. Having the correct documents does not mean an exact copy of those
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I would hasten to add that what I have said
                    ought not to be construed as leaving the door open to replacing, altering or
                    modifying the contents of a payment claim in terms of the information that is
                    prescribed in s 10(3) and reg 5(2). That would place before the adjudicator a
                    different set of documents from those which had framed the issues between the
                    parties. This joinder of issues is fundamental to the adjudication process as it
                    defines the adjudicator’s jurisdiction. Even in such circumstances, it may
                    not necessarily follow that non-compliance will invariably result in invalidity
                    of the adjudication provided the correct documents are eventually before and
                    considered by the adjudicator (see the discussion <em>infra</em> at [105]). I, however, express no firm view on this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I now turn to the three complaints of the
                    Plaintiff. I shall take the first and second collectively as the explanation
                    offered by the Defendant for both is the same. The Defendant acknowledged the
                    complaints but submitted that it had included additional drawings in support of
                    the claim, and re-arranged certain documents – all drawings – to
                    give the Adjudicator better clarity and context to the claim. In response, the
                    Plaintiff conceded that the Defendant was entitled to include supporting
                    documents and information in the Application in light of s 13(3)(<em>e</em>). However, the Plaintiff submitted that it was quite
                    another matter to pass APC4 off as PC4. I found the submission startling. If
                    additional documents could be introduced when filing the Application, how does
                    it matter if they were introduced as part of PC4 or independently annexed to the
                    Application? Indeed, annexing them to PC4 would give it its full colour thereby
                    benefiting the Adjudicator. The complaint seemed to me to smack of the technical
                    quibbles that the New Zealand cases unequivocally say ought to be frowned
                    upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Nothing specifically was submitted on why
                    re-arrangement of the drawings was impermissible, probably because nothing of
                    substance could have been said. It is difficult to comprehend how re-arrangement
                    of pages could mean that PC4 has changed in any material manner. It did seem
                    that the complaint bordered on the frivolous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I turn to the third and last of the
                    Plaintiff’s complaints – that there had been alteration or
                    modification to certain pages of PC4. Instinctively, this did raise warning
                    signs of non-compliance of a fundamental nature. However, closer examination
                    suggested that it was also without substance. The Defendant explained that the
                    differences between PC4 and APC4 arose primarily from a failure to retain in its
                    files a copy of PC4. I accepted the explanation as it appeared credible on its
                    face and there was nothing to controvert it. Indeed, the Plaintiff did not
                    challenge the explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In any event, the deviations complained of
                    were of such a minor variety that they would be subject to the <em>de minimis</em> principle. In the final analysis, the
                    Plaintiff’s complaints were best described in Shakespearean language as
                    “much ado about nothing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Finally, even if there was non-compliance
                    with reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>), that would not render the
                    Application null and void. It is important to examine whether
                        s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) read with reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>) was so important a provision that non-compliance
                    would defeat the legislative purpose of the Act. This was the test laid down in
                        <em>Chua Say Eng</em> (at [67]) and followed in
                        <em>Australian Timber</em> (at [30]). I am of the view
                        s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) did not carry such importance.
                    In <em>Australian Timber</em>, this court considered
                    whether non-compliance with s 10(3)(<em>a</em>) and
                    reg 5(2) rendered a payment claim invalid. The court held it did not. Regulation
                    5(2) stipulates the information that needs to be set out in the payment claim.
                    It would seem that not annexing an exact copy of the payment claim is less
                    egregious than not complying with reg 5(2). I am therefore of the view that even
                    if there was non-compliance with reg 7(2)(<em>e</em>),
                    the Application was not null and void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3(a): Further arguments of approbation and
                reprobation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In its request for further arguments dated
                    24 July 2015, the Defendant shifted ground. The Defendant's counsel accepted
                    that service of multiple payment claims for different reference periods in the
                    same payment claim period was not consistent with s 10(1) and cl 21(a). However,
                    the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff had approbated and reprobated on the
                    validity of PC3R. The submission had two inter-related prongs. First, the
                    Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had acted in bad faith by misrepresenting
                    the invalidity of PC3R throughout the period when the Defendant could have
                    presented an adjudication application on the same. This induced the Defendant to
                    present the Application on PC4. Secondly, by the time the Plaintiff had made its
                    position clear on PC4 – identified by the Defendant as the
                    Plaintiff’s letter dated 20 January 2014 – time for filing an
                    adjudication application on PC3R had lapsed. The Plaintiff ought to be therefore
                    barred from using PC3R to invalidate PC4 as the Plaintiff’s shift of
                    ground had prejudiced the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I had significant difficulties with the
                    arguments both on the facts and in law. I should observe that the arguments
                    appeared to lift off from an earlier argument of estoppel based on an alleged
                    representation in December 2014 by the Plaintiff’s general manager that
                    all payment claims must be submitted on the 30th of the month, and which the
                    Defendant purportedly relied on in serving PC4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The doctrine of approbation and reprobation
                    precludes a party who has exercised a right from exercising another right which
                    is alternative to and inconsistent with the right that has been exercised
                    – see <em>Treasure Valley Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy and
                        another (Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, intervener)</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R)
                    358 (at [31]). It has its roots in the common law doctrine of election. In
                    principle, I see no reason why the doctrine ought not to apply to payment claims
                    under the Act for the same reason why estoppel has been recognised as being
                    applicable. Both doctrines have a common seed – the disapproval of
                    inconsistent behaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    
          <em>Chua Say Eng</em>
                    recognised (at [33], [73] and [74]) that estoppel might operate in the context
                    of payment claims. The same point was made in <em>Australian
                        Timber</em> (at [30]) following <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em>. The example sketched in <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em> illustrates the role that estoppel might play. The situation
                    was one where the payment claim satisfies all the requirements under the Act,
                    but is expressly stated not to be a payment claim. The Court of Appeal held that
                    the claimant would be estopped then from asserting that it had served a payment
                    claim under the Act. Similarly, where a party elects to rely on a payment claim
                    for the purpose of the Act, there really should be no reason why that election
                    should not be binding. Such a party should not be allowed to resile from the
                    election by relying on an inconsistent position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    There is an easy answer why this must be so.
                    The Act recognises that, subject to its provisions, the entitlement to progress
                    payment, and the right to serve a payment claim, are contractual. The statutory
                    right to payment under the Act is triggered by the terms of the contract. Having
                    a contractual underpinning means that principles that frown on inconsistent
                    conduct such as estoppel and the doctrine of approbation and reprobation would
                    apply to the question of whether the right to payment has been triggered. A
                    claimant, faced with two inconstant courses of conduct and having elected one,
                    must be treated as bound to that election. However, the difficulty the Defendant
                    faced with its argument was that it ran straight into the wall that is s
                    10(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The language of s 10(1) is unequivocal and
                    mandatory – only one payment claim may be served in respect of a progress
                    payment. It would surely be incorrect to conclude that the doctrine of
                    approbation and reprobation could allow two or more payment claims in the same
                    payment claim period to be presented notwithstanding the limitation in s 10(1).
                    This would be to disfigure the language of the section, and in the process
                    undermine its purpose. In fact, I believe that the position has been settled by
                        <em>Chua Say Eng</em> and the subsequent decisions of
                    this court in <em>JFC Builders Pte Ltd v LionCity Construction Co
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 1 SLR 1157, <em>Admin Construction
                        Pte Ltd v Vivaldi (s) Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 609 and <em>LH Aluminium</em>, following <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em>. It was held there that estoppel does not prevent a party
                    from raising a jurisdictional challenge in a setting aside application even if
                    it had not been raised before the adjudicator. If a failure to raise a
                    jurisdictional challenge before an adjudicator does not operate as an estoppel,
                    I do not see how the doctrine of approbation and reprobation can do any better
                    to confer jurisdiction. At the nub of the analysis is whether the requirements
                    of the Act necessary to confer jurisdiction on the adjudicator have been
                    satisfied. The inequitable conduct of one party cannot in and of itself result
                    in the re-writing of the statutory language so that jurisdiction can be
                    conferred. As a matter of first principle, I have significant difficulty in
                    understanding how inconsistent conduct by a party can confer jurisdiction on an
                    adjudicator in the face of contrary statutory language.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3(b): Was there in fact approbation and reprobation?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    My conclusion on the applicability of the
                    doctrine of approbation and reprobation was sufficient to dispose of the
                    Defendant’s further arguments. However, as much was made by the Defendant
                    of the Plaintiff’s conduct, I will address the same for completeness. For
                    a start, as noted earlier, the circumstances surrounding the issuance of PC4
                    were a matter of significant controversy. It would have been impossible to have
                    resolved it on the basis of affidavit evidence alone. In the course of
                    arguments, I invited the Defendant's counsel to apply for leave to cross-examine
                    deponents of the relevant affidavits on this issue. The invitation was, however,
                    not accepted. Nonetheless, even if I were to take the Defendant’s
                    allegation at face value and at its highest, all that was alleged was that the
                    Plaintiff’s general manager had said was that the payment claims under the
                    Contract had to be issued on the 30th of the month. The Plaintiff’s
                    general manager did not represent that there could be two payment claims in the
                    same payment claim period, even if they were for different reference periods. As
                    noted earlier, cl 21(a) contemplated only one payment claim per month (even if
                    the payment claims were for different reference periods). That being the case,
                    even if the Defendant had been told, following the service of PC3R, to submit a
                    fresh payment claim on the 30th of the month, a reasonable interpretation of
                    that would be for PC3R to be substituted with a payment claim served on 30
                    December 2014. It certainly could not have been understood as an invitation to
                    serve two payment claims for the progress payment for December 2014. Fatally,
                    the Defendant did not withdraw PC3R when it served PC4. The difficulties did not
                    stop there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff
                    represented in Payment Response 3 that PC3R was invalid because it had been
                    served out of time. I am not sure that there was a representation that PC4 would
                    be regarded as valid to begin with, let alone one of fact. The Plaintiff was, as
                    it was entitled to, mounting a jurisdictional challenge on the validity of the
                    PC3R. In doing so, it was stating its position on the validity of PC3R based on
                    a construction of cl 21(a) and the Act. At the same time, in the 9 January
                    letter, the Plaintiff also challenged the validity of PC4 on the basis that it
                    had been served after PC3R in the same payment claim period. Again, this could
                    not on any basis be characterised as a representation, let alone one of fact.
                    Further, it would have been apparent that the real challenge from the Plaintiff
                    was to PC3R. Payment Response 3, unlike the 9 January letter, also delved into
                    the merits of the claim. That ought to have indicated to the Plaintiff where the
                    real contest lay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The Defendant was therefore left in a
                    position of having to decide which of its payment claims, PC3R or PC4, it wished
                    to proceed with to adjudication. It made that election on 17 January 2015 by
                    serving a notice on PC4 under s 13(2). It should be noted that as a
                    precursor to that notice, by an email dated 16 January 2015, the Defendant wrote
                    to the Plaintiff to notify that it would be proceeding on PC4 because of the
                    alleged representation of the Plaintiff’s general manager in December
                    2014. This email was not in evidence. Even if it was, it would have made no
                    difference because the Plaintiff had made its position quite clear that PC4 was
                    being challenged as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Having made the election on 17 January 2015,
                    the Defendant had to stand or fall by the same. The adjudication process under
                    the Act had been initiated. The fact that the Plaintiff wrote on 20 January 2015
                    reiterating that PC4 was invalid as PC3R had not been withdrawn did not advance
                    the Defendant’s cause at all. The Defendant’s argument that this
                    came after the time for applying for adjudication on PC3R had expired forgets
                    two facts. First, this letter did nothing more than reiterate the position in
                    the 9 January letter. Secondly, the Defendant had elected to proceed with PC4 on
                    17 January 2015 in full knowledge of the challenge that was being made to the
                    same in the 9 January letter. There was simply no basis for the Defendant to
                    argue that it was led into believing that PC4 would not be challenged. The
                    Defendant chose its own path knowing full well that it was fraught with the
                    danger and pitfalls of a jurisdictional challenge. Unfortunately it did not
                    choose wisely. The facts do not provide any sustenance for the Defendant’s
                    further arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In conclusion, I found that the evidence did
                    not suggest that the Plaintiff approbated and reprobated on the validity of
                    PC3R. In fact, they point to the contrary conclusion. Even if they did, such
                    conduct could not in my view result in jurisdiction being conferred on the
                    Adjudicator to hear the Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    For the above reasons, I allowed the present
                    application with costs fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements for the first
                    round of hearings and $2,500 inclusive of disbursements for the hearing
