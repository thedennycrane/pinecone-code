That corresponds to s 101(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA. An order with respect to a breach of the MCST’s duty under s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA to maintain common property, is an order under s 101(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and within the exception to s 101(3).

Thus, the STB recognised that the MCST’s liability in respect of the leak is inextricably linked to whether the MCST was in breach of its duty to maintain the pipe (under s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA); and that the MCST’s liability, if any, must flow from that statutory duty imposed on the MCST or any cause of action the SP had against the MCST.

The appellate court held that a breach of s 62(1) of the NSW Act by an owners corporation (the equivalent of an MCST) does not give rise to an action for damages for breach of statutory duty (see [198]–[222] per Tobias AJA, with whom Barrett JA (at [1]) and Preston CJ (at [227]) agreed). The NSW Act made provision for the resolution of disputes by an adjudicator, who could make orders regarding “an exercise of, or a failure to exercise, a function conferred or imposed by or under this Act”, but such orders could not include the payment of damages (see <span class="font-italic">Thoo</span> at [210]–[211]). That parallels the position under ss 101(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and s 101(3) of the BMSMA. But the NSW Act has no equivalent of s 88 of the BMSMA giving the court the power to award damages in such a case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Prior to the introduction of s 88 of the BMSMA on 1 April 2005, the position in Singapore was like that in New South Wales (per <span class="font-italic">Thoo</span>): no breach of statutory duty action was available in relation to the duty to maintain common property. In <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 586 v Menezes Ignatius Augustine</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 201 (“<span class="font-italic">Menezes</span>”), the High Court rejected a claim for breach of statutory duty in relation to s 31(1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1985 Rev Ed) (“LT(S)A”), the equivalent of s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA. Section 45(1) of the LT(S)A provided for criminal liability in the event that provisions including s 31(1) were breached, and s 45(2) allowed applications to court for an order to compel the MCST to perform the duty in question; but there was no reference to any entitlement to apply to recover damages (like there now is under s 88 of the BMSMA). The High Court held that a breach of s 31(1) of the LT(S)A did not give rise to civil liability such that an SP could recover damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">Keller Piano </span><span class="font-italic">Co (Pte) Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title No 1298 </span>DC/S 3109/1989 (27 August 1993), which concerned a leaking pipe, the District Court followed <span class="font-italic">Menezes</span> in holding that no cause of action for breach of statutory duty was available. The court, however, found the MCST liable in negligence (a decision which was overturned by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title No 1298</span><span class="font-italic"> v Keller Piano Co (Pte) Ltd</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 615, but thereafter restored by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Keller Piano Co (Pte) Ltd</span> v<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title No 1298</span> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 965).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Section 88 of the BMSMA now entitles an SP to apply to the court to recover damages from the MCST, in the event of any breaches of the provisions in Part V of the BMSMA (which includes s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). The court may make such order as the court thinks fit, which <span class="font-italic">could</span> include ordering the MCST to pay damages. Whether damages <span class="font-italic">would</span> be ordered, would depend on the circumstances of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, damages for breach of s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA cannot be ordered by an STB.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What is the nature of an MCST’s duty to maintain common property?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Sections 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA, provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29.—(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be the duty of a management corporation —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair (including, where reasonably necessary, renew or replace the whole or part thereof) —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the common property;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) each door, window and other permanent cover over openings in walls where a side of the door, window or cover is part of the common property; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) any movable property vested in the management corporation;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The New South Wales equivalent of s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA, is ss 62(1)–(2) of the NSW Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">62.

That duty is not one to use reasonable care to maintain and keep in good repair the common property, nor one to use best endeavours to do so, nor one to take reasonable steps to do so, but a strict duty to maintain and keep in repair.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5 It follows that as soon as something in the common property is no longer operating effectively or at all, or has fallen into disrepair, there has been a breach of the s 62 duty [cf <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span> [177]] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The court went on to hold that “[a]s the duty is a strict one, it matters not whether the problem could have been rectified more rapidly” (at [14]); that it matters not when the owners corporation was first given notice of the problem (at [19]); and that “[t]he strict nature of the owners corporation’s duty makes whether or not it took all reasonable steps irrelevant, if ultimately it failed at any time to meet the strict requirements of the s 62 duty” (at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Although <span class="font-italic">Seiwa</span> cited <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span><span class="font-italic"> v Strata Plan 10308</span> [2005] NSWCA 246 (“<span class="font-italic">Ridis</span>”), the two decisions stand in some contrast as to what the duty to maintain common property entails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span>, a glass pane in the front door of a building shattered and injured the plaintiff. He claimed that the owners corporation had breached its duty of care as an occupier of the common property, and its statutory duties under s 62 of the NSW Act. His claim was dismissed at first instance, and that decision was upheld (by a majority) on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Seiwa</span>, the court held that it was irrelevant whether the owners corporation had acted reasonably; but in <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span>, it mattered to all three appellate judges whether the owners corporation had acted reasonably.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Hodgson JA held that an owners corporation, acting <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span>, should have a system in place for monitoring the maintenance and state of repair of the common property, but inspections of that kind would not have brought home to the owners corporation the risk concerning the glass (at [5]–[7] and [11]). In the circumstances, he concluded that the owners corporation had not breached s 62 of the NSW Act, although the glass in the front door had shattered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 McColl JA held that an owners corporation is merely the agent for lot proprietors insofar as its obligations to repair, renew and replace the common property are concerned; as such, it makes no sense for the legislature to have imposed upon the sum of occupiers a statutory obligation more onerous than that imposed at common law (at [186]). Accordingly, an owners corporation would discharge its duty of maintenance and repair if it acted reasonably (at [187]). Her Honour likewise concluded that there had not been a breach of s 62 of the NSW Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Tobias JA was in the minority – he considered the owners corporation to have fallen short of what was required of it under s 62 of the NSW Act. Even so, he did not consider s 62 of the NSW Act to create a situation of strict liability (such that the mere fact that the glass shattered meant that the owners corporation had breached its duty to maintain and repair common property, and was liable to the injured plaintiff). Instead, he referred to “the standard of care <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span> required of it as an owners corporation with respect to its management and control of the use of the common property” [emphasis added] (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 All three judges in <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span> did not consider the duty to maintain common property to give rise to strict liability, such that the injured plaintiff only needed to show that the glass had shattered (as it had) for the owners corporation to be liable. But that is what would result from applying the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Seiwa</span> at [5].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 With respect, I consider the law on this point in New South Wales to be represented by the decision of the appellate court in <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span>, and not the decision of the first instance court in <span class="font-italic">Seiwa</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In Canada (as in <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span>) it is recognised that the duty to maintain common property does not give rise to strict liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 <span class="font-italic">John Campbell Law Corp v Strata Plan 1350</span> [2001] BCSC 1342 (“<span class="font-italic">John Campbell</span>”) concerned a blocked sewer pipe. Section 34(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Condominium Act, RSBC 1996, c 64 (Can) (the “Condominium Act”) provided that a strata corporation must “keep in a state of good and serviceable repair and properly maintain common property”; and s 116(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Condominium Act specifically provided that a strata corporation must “maintain and repair, including renewal where reasonably necessary, pipes [<span class="font-italic">etc</span>] existing in the parcel and capable of being used in connection with the enjoyment of more than one strata lot or common property”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Supreme Court of British Columbia in <span class="font-italic">John Campbell </span>stated at [10]: “The central question here is whether a standard of reasonableness should be read into the duties imposed on a strata corporation by the legislation … or whether it imposes strict or absolute liability.” On that, the court concluded at [18]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if a strata corporation such as the defendant has taken all reasonable steps to inspect and maintain its common facilities, consistent with the practice of other such associations generally, they should not be held liable for damages arising as a result of any strict statutory liability nor should they be put in the position of acting as an insurer by default. The defendants have thus discharged the burden they had to inspect and maintain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Canadian legislation uses the phrase “reasonably necessary” to qualify the duty of “renewal”; s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA uses the phrase “reasonably necessary” to qualify the duty to “renew or replace the whole or part thereof [of the common property]”. The concept – “reasonably necessary” – cannot sit with the conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Seiwa</span> as to strict liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I respectfully adopt the reasoning in the Canadian cases such as <span class="font-italic">John Campbell</span>, and that at the appellate level in New South Wales (especially that of McColl JA in <span class="font-italic">Ridis</span>). The duty to maintain common property does not create strict liability: it <span class="font-italic">does</span> matter whether the MCST acted reasonably or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The law in Singapore has moved from SPs having no right to claim damages for breach of the MCST’s duty to maintain common property (per <span class="font-italic">Menezes</span> interpreting the LT(S)A), to SPs now having such a right to make such a claim (under s 88 of the BMSMA). But it would go too far to hold that an MCST is now strictly liable for any loss caused by the condition of common property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Menezes</span>, a breach of s 31(1) of the LT(S)A (the predecessor of s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA) would be a criminal offence by the MCST under s 45 of the LT(S)A. A court should refrain from construing an offence as one of strict liability unless it can be shown that the creation of strict liability will be effective to promote the objects of the statute by encouraging greater vigilance to prevent the commission of the prohibited act: <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Wei Meng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 566 at [17]. That is not the case with s 29 of the BMSMA. In relation to its duty to maintain common property, the MCST is merely the agent for the SPs (<span class="font-italic">Ridis</span> at [186]), the MCST is not an insurer (<span class="font-italic">John Campbell</span> at [18]). The MCST should act with reasonable care, it should not be strictly liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Ngai Seng v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 0581 (Pandan Valley Condominium) and another suit</span> [2019] SGMC 34, certain residents sued their MCST because on a rainy night a tree had fallen onto their parked cars. The claim was brought in negligence, a particular of which was that the MCST had breached its duty under s 29 of the BMSMA. On the evidence, the claim was dismissed. It was (rightly) not suggested that the MCST was strictly liable, such that the mere fact of the tree falling would render the MCST liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In the present case, the MCST did not know, and could not reasonably have known, of the concealed pipe. When the leak occurred, it ascertained the source of the leak, and repaired the pipe. The MCST acted reasonably: there was no breach of s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 If a pipe that is common property leaks, the MCST is only liable for loss caused by the leakage if:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it has breached its duty to maintain common property under s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it is liable on some other cause of action, such as negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Section 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA does not create a situation of strict liability: the mere fact that the leaking pipe is common property does not, without more, render the MCST liable. If the MCST has acted reasonably in the discharge of its duty to maintain common property, it has not breached its statutory duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The STB erred, both in awarding damages for breach of statutory duty (which it had no power to do), and in deciding that the duty to maintain common property gives rise to strict liability.
