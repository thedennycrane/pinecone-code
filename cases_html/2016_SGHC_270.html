The defendants were in breach of their fiduciary duties in failing to explain the documents to the Deceased. And, in any event, the Deceased had a right to demand the reversal of the transfers because the shares were held on trust for him and/or on the basis of his legitimate expectations. The Plaintiff’s final salvo is a claim in minority oppression in respect of CHHMPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendants, while agreeing that the Deceased was the patriarch of the family, assert that the Deceased had approved all the disputed transactions, and that at all material times, he was actively involved and fully aware of the nature of the documents that he signed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The factual issue pivotal to the suit is this: was the Deceased a victim of the defendants’ deception and conspiracy, as the Plaintiff contends, or was this simply a case of the Deceased changing his mind, retrospectively making up false allegations<span class="font-italic"> </span>in order to set aside the transactions, as the defendants contend? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The dispute may be deconstructed using four broad strands.

These are: (a) the appointment of the 3rd Defendant as a director of CHHMPL; (b) the transfer of the 120,000 CHHMPL shares from the Deceased to the 1st Defendant; (c) the transfer of the 26,000 OTSDPL shares from the Deceased to the 1st Defendant; and (d) the validity of the series of resolutions passed to give effect to the issuance of 340,000 new CHHMPL shares in favour of the 1st Defendant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my judgment, an agency relationship does not arise simply because the 1st and 2nd Defendants prepared, translated and explained company documents to the Deceased, or because the Deceased trusted them to manage CHHMPL and OTSDPL. In assisting the Deceased in these ways, the defendants were in no sense acting <span class="font-italic">on behalf of</span> the Deceased vis-à-vis a third party, or in a manner that affected the Deceased’s legal position. I note that the defendants did not sign any document prepared for the Deceased on the Deceased’s behalf. The crux of an agency relationship is the existence of a principal who authorises an agent <span class="font-italic">to act on his/her behalf</span>, such that the agent has the legal power to <span class="font-italic">affect the principal’s legal position as against third parties</span>: see the Court of Appeal’s views in <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1308 at [70], adopting <span class="font-italic">Scott v Davis</span> (2000) 204 CLR 333 at [227]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Plaintiff’s alternative argument centred on the instructions to Wong Partnership is slightly different.

In such cases, the duty is one of loyalty. Such an agent “may not act for his own benefit … without the informed consent of his principal”: <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee</span> at [135] citing Millett J in <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Mothew</span> [1998] Ch 1 at [18]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant assisted in the process of seeking out, consulting, and instructing JP Morgan and Wong Partnership. In particular, the 1st Defendant conducted initial consultations with JP Morgan, and then with Wong Partnership. Furthermore, the 1st Defendant claims that he dutifully followed the Deceased’s express instructions in all the various matters. Because he had acted on the Deceased’s behalf in instructing JP Morgan and Wong Partnership, an incomplete agency thus arose. For reasons which follow, however, I find that he acted with the informed consent of the Deceased. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Validity of the first series of disputed transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The first series of transactions concern documents executed in November and December 2011 to: (a) transfer 120,000 CHHMPL shares to the 1st Defendant; (b) transfer 200,000 CHHMPL shares to the 3rd Defendant (not disputed); (c) appoint the 3rd Defendant as a director of CHHMPL; and (d) transfer 26,000 OTSDPL shares to the 1st Defendant.

In the Defence at para 47(b), it was stated that the 3rd Defendant was appointed as director of CHHMPL “so that [he] could assist the 1st Defendant in the management of CHHMPL”. In the 1st Defendant’s affidavit of evidence in chief, however, he states as follows (para 138):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My late father wanted one of my sons to be appointed as a director of CHHMPL to assist me to run CHHMPL. Between my two sons, it was decided that it would be more appropriate to appoint Benson as a director as Zhi Jie was hearing impaired. However, since the purpose of having another director was a formality only as I would be effectively running the company, and because Benson was still young at that time and would only turn 18 in 2014, my late father decided that Zhi Jie could be appointed as a director until Benson turned 18. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The claim that the 3rd Defendant was “still learning the ropes of managing [CHHMPL]” as recorded in the 18 February 2014 EGM minutes was thus false as the 3rd Defendant was, at the material time, working at his sister’s ice cream shop rather than learning about managing CHHMPL.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It is clear that the defendants now agree that the Deceased did not intend the 3rd Defendant to be the long-term successor to CHHMPL. His appointment was merely a temporary formality. Whilst there is some inconsistency, this is not, in my view, crucial in a determination of the credibility of the 1st Defendant. In this case, the letter of 7 January 2013 had highlighted the 3rd Defendant’s disability and labelled him “unable and not fit to serve as a director”. In these circumstances, the 1st Defendant, as a father, would naturally feel protective at the 18 February 2014 EGM amongst unfriendly relatives. The 3rd Defendant’s disability relates to his hearing only: he took the stand and it was clear that he was only hearing impaired. He was not suffering from any other disability and had graduated from the Institute of Technical Education. There could, in addition, be some sensitivity for a father to refer to a succession preference for a younger son over an elder son on the basis of a hearing impairment alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my judgment, Ms Yui’s evidence regarding the 10 January 2012 meeting is fundamental to understanding the evidence. Ms Yui testified that she had asked the Deceased whether the managing director should be appointed by the Deceased, the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant. She based her answer on the comment made by her firm at para 5.2 of the draft shareholders’ agreement dated 7 January 2012 which stated: “Clients to confirm if it is necessary to provide that the directors shall be appointed by Ong Tuan Seng, Ong Bee Chew and Ong Zhi Jie”. This comment was struck out on the 20 January 2012 version of the draft shareholders’ agreement. She testified: “If we put a comment there, we would have gone through it”.

As for Chew Yong’s shares, these were given to her in order for her to assist Bee Chip. The defendants claim that the Deceased intended to make the 1st Defendant a shareholder and director of OTSDPL so that he could run OTSDPL after the Deceased’s passing. 6,000 shares were given to Chew Yong so that she could mediate between the 1st Defendant and the other brothers in the event of any conflict between them (see [16] above). The Deceased thought this was feasible because Chew Yong’s and the 1st Defendant’s children got along.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On balance, I prefer the defendants’ account of the transfer of the 26,000 OTSDPL shares for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Yui’s evidence confirms that the Deceased intended for the 1st Defendant to have a management role in OTSDPL.

</div> Giving the 1st Defendant some OTSDPL shares would be consistent with the intention to give him an official management role in OTSDPL. The practice of the Deceased’s companies, as shown in CHHMPL, OTSDPL, HES and Golden Bridge, were such that directors held shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 1st Defendant had assisted the Plaintiff throughout with the management of OTSDPL. Ms Yui’s evidence that the Deceased wished the 1st Defendant to manage the company in transition after the Deceased’s passing was logical. Indeed, if the purpose of the 1st Defendant holding shares was only to assist with share investment, the 1st Defendant could and would have assisted the Deceased to so invest. He and his wife were in any event already assisting the Plaintiff with matters relating to OTSDPL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Deceased did not want the hotels to be sold for 30 years. One way of ensuring this would be to put the management of the companies which held the hotels in the hands of someone whom he trusted for this specific task, and Ms Yui testified that the level of trust between the Deceased and the 1st Defendant was extremely high. While there was a lot of unnecessary evidence as to whether Golden Bridge was well run or not, what is clear was that Golden Bridge, partly also arising from the nature of its business, did have loans outstanding. The 1st Defendant’s evidence that the Deceased was worried that Bee Chip and Chew Yong would sell the hotel in preference to their own business interests was plausible. The 1st Defendant, on the other hand, did not have a similar business history or risk profile.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Chew Yong conceded on the stand that her children got along with the 1st Defendant’s children, which the 1st Defendant explained as a reason for her to be chosen as a mediator between Bee Chip and himself. While not a definitive piece of evidence in and of itself, it is consistent with the defendants’ narrative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Arguments were made about the time lag between the transfer of the shares to the 1st Defendant (November 2011) and the opening of the securities account on 13 January 2012.

</div> Arguments were also made about the intention behind transferring OTSDPL shares to Chew Yong at the same time OTSDPL shares were transferred to the 1st Defendant: Chew Yong says that the Deceased told her that it was for the purpose of share investment; the 1st Defendant’s evidence was that Chew Yong was given shares so that she could mediate between him and the other brothers in running OTSDPL. In my view, little will be gained from a detailed examination of these contrary assertions; they are inconclusive. What is clear is that from Chew Yong’s evidence of her conversation with her father, the Deceased clearly knew he had transferred the shares to the 1st Defendant. There is no evidence of any common intention between the Deceased and 1st Defendant that the latter was holding the 26,000 OTSDPL shares for the specific premise of investing in shares for OTSDPL and only for so long as that purpose existed only. From the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 at [110] – [113] and [153], it is clear that the Plaintiff must prove that <span class="font-italic">both</span> the Deceased and the 1st Defendant had a <span class="font-italic">common intention</span> that the beneficial interest in the 26,000 OTSDPL shares should remain with the Deceased. It is <span class="font-italic">not sufficient</span> to prove that the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> for which the 26,000 OTSDPL shares were transferred was not or could not be achieved. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the validity of the first series of disputed transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is clear from the facts of the 10 January 2012 meeting that the Deceased knew what powers he wanted to give to the 1st Defendant’s family under the shareholders’ agreement, and understood the transactions which had taken place prior to 10 January. The Plaintiff’s legal case, which depicted the Deceased as someone old, ill-educated and misled, is wholly out of sync with the evidence. While the Deceased may have worked in the same office as the 1st and 2nd Defendants each morning, he had an active social life. He lived alone, in the same apartment building as Chew Yong and Chong Ho. He ate breakfast with Chew Yong and saw his other children and grandchildren at dinner daily. All the witnesses testified that the Deceased was a sharp businessman with a keen mind. As for the contentions that he did not understand English documents, those would equally apply to the two letters in English from the Deceased on 21 May 2012 and 7 January 2013, both drafted by lawyers, upon which the Plaintiff’s claim is founded. For these reasons, I find that the Plaintiff fails in his claim in relation to the first series of disputed transactions.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Validity of the second series of disputed transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The second series of transactions must be considered with reference to two queries: first, whether the Deceased had agreed to give the 1st Defendant’s family majority control of CHHMPL to ensure that the hotel would not be sold for the next 30 years; and second, whether the resolutions passed leading to the issue of the 340,000 CHHMPL shares to the 1st Defendant are valid. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the Deceased authorise the issue of 340,000 CHHMPL shares?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Plaintiff claims that the Deceased signed the various resolutions mentioned thinking that he was authorising a loan of $340,000 from the 1st Defendant to CHHMPL,

As the defendants point out, none of the documents contained a “$” next to 340,000 and this would have raised questions in the Deceased’s mind as to whether the documents indeed related to a proposed $340,000 loan. Although he did not read English, he was a rather extraordinary serial entrepreneur who had set up many businesses. I find it incredible that he would not recognise a share transfer document. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Ms Yui also testified that she had been clear at the 10 January 2012 meeting that the minority would need to be independently advised, and queried whether the other shareholders would agree to the terms, because the Deceased was a minority shareholder of CHHMPL. His response on was that he was the father (she recalled vividly, “wo si lao pa”) and that his children would comply. This supports the 1st Defendant’s contention that the Deceased later decided, after further conversation with the 1st Defendant, to give the defendants majority control of CHHMPL to follow through with his plan to keep the hotels for 30 years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Further, Ms Yui’s evidence is that at the 9 March 2012 meeting, in contrast to his active participation on 10 January 2012, the Deceased was “very quiet”

</div> It would be completely inconsistent for him to remain silent if, as the Plaintiff contends, the Deceased was truly ignorant about all the 1st Defendant had allegedly been doing behind his back. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Finally, if the Deceased had found out about the serious deception the defendants had practised on him to gain control of CHHMPL after the 9 March 2012 meeting, it is unlikely that he would have waited more than two months, until 21 May 2012, to repudiate these transfers. It not disputed that the Deceased left the meeting together with the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The fact that the Deceased only wrote the letter to the 1st Defendant on 21 May 2012 is more consistent with the defendants’ account that they fell out with the Deceased only in May 2012. Again, after his letter of 21 May 2012 was ignored, there was a long delay on the Deceased’s part before his lawyer’s letter of 7 January 2013 was sent. This was nearly ten months’ after the 9 March 2012 shareholders’ meeting. Chew Yong conceded on the stand that the 2nd Defendant continued assisting the Deceased with his cheques at least until July 2012; from September 2012, the Deceased brought his cheque book home, and thereafter, Chew Yong assisted the Deceased with his cheques from December 2012.

With these findings, I also dismiss any claim that the 1st Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties to the Deceased on the basis that the Deceased was fully aware of the documents that he was signing. While the Plaintiff’s complaint is that the transactions benefitted the 1st Defendant, what is significant is that <span class="font-italic">at the time</span> of the transactions, the Deceased’s sole object was to bring into effect his “legacy”; he was well aware that benefit to the 1st Defendant was a necessary incident of the intended method of implementation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For completeness, I note that there are two peripheral disputes on the facts. Both of these are of little significance in light of the fact that it is clear from the 10 January 2012 meeting that the Deceased fully understood and endorsed the shareholders’ agreement. First, the Plaintiff contends the defendants had lied that the Deceased attended the 30 November 2011 meeting with Wong Partnership.

</div> Mr CS Tan’s evidence was that he did not meet the defendants in October 2011. As the defendants point out, Mr CS Tan could not recall quite a few matters. What is clear, in any event, from Ms Yui’s and Ms Choong’s evidence, is that a shareholders’ agreement was a sensible manner of effecting the Deceased’s wishes for his two companies. Counsel for the Plaintiff spent a great deal of time cross-examining various witnesses on the possibility of setting up a trust rather than signing a shareholders’ agreement. But it is clear from Ms Yui’s evidence that this would have entailed incurring the cost of professional managers, which would have been difficult to explain to an old Chinese businessman such as the Deceased, and indeed, would not be feasible for CHHMPL, given the JTC lease conditions under which the Sungei Kadut property was held.

This power, as acknowledged in art 4 itself, is subject to s 161 of the Companies Act, which allows companies to approve in a general meeting, the directors’ exercise of power to issue shares. From s 161 of the Companies Act, it is clear that specific approval of each share issue is not required and the approval may take the general form that it took in the Ordinary Resolution dated 20 February 2012. It follows then that it is important to consider if the Ordinary Resolution dated 20 February 2012 was validly passed such that the requirement in s 161(1) of the Companies Act is satisfied since non-compliance renders the share issue void under s 161(6) of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78  In this case, the following steps were taken:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an EGM was convened pursuant to a Directors’ Resolution dated 2 February 2012;

The defendants point to the fact that the Deceased’s practice was not to hold meetings, even for significant matters such as the sale of 2 Sungei Kadut to HES Machinery. The Deceased merely made sure that the documents were in order. In my view, given that the Companies Act does not regulate how a private company should hold EGMs, and given that the documents <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> suggest that the EGM was attended by three shareholders, I find that the Ordinary Resolution is not invalid by virtue of the absence of an actual physical meeting. I further observe that under art 61 of CHHMPL’s Articles, the minutes of the 20 February 2012 EGM, signed by the Deceased, are conclusive proof that the Ordinary Resolution was indeed passed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The only other outstanding issue in this regard is that <span class="font-italic">notice</span> was not given to the other shareholders who were entitled to have notice of the EGM. They are entitled to such under art 124 of CHHMPL’s Articles and s 180(1) of the Companies Act. Section 392(1)(b) treats the lack of a notice as a “procedural irregularity” which does not invalidate a meeting “unless the Court is of the opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot be remedied by any order of the Court and by order declares the proceeding to be invalid” (see s 392(2) Companies Act). I am of the view that there is no substantial injustice in this case. First, the resolution was passed by a majority of the shareholders (in terms of shareholdings) and thus, the resolution would have passed regardless. Second, I accept the defendants’ submission that the Deceased’s children and grandchildren all knew about and accepted the Deceased’s practice of making key decisions and signing the requisite documents to give effect to those decisions, without holding actual meetings and complying with the notice requirements.

</div> On the first objection, I note that art 100 of CHHMPL’s Articles states that “a resolution in writing, signed by a majority of the directors present in Singapore shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly convened and held”. Given that a written Directors’ Resolution was signed by three directors, the Deceased, the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant, I treat it as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly convened and held. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84   On the 1st Defendant’s failure to disclose his interest as an interested party and refrain from voting, I find that the 1st Defendant’s interest in the resolution must have been abundantly clear and there was no need to expressly “disclose” his interest. Further, the Plaintiff has provided no authority for the proposition that the fact that the 1st Defendant voted in favour of a Directors’ resolution that he had an interest in would, without anything else, invalidate that resolution. As the defendants point out, the Deceased and the 3rd Defendant would have, in any event, constituted the requisite majority to pass the resolution without the 1st Defendant’s participation.

</div> In my view, the defendants’ position is better supported by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90   It should be noted that the language used by the Plaintiff and the Deceased is the language of gift. For example, Chong Ho’s evidence was that his understanding was that his grandfather had given him the shares that he held in CHHMPL. Similarly, in the letter sent by the Deceased via his lawyers Khor Thiam Beng &amp; Partners on 7 January 2013, it was stated that CHHMPL and OTSDPL was set up “for the benefit of” the Deceased’s children and grandchildren (paras 2(2) and 2(7)). In the Statement of Claim, numerous references are made to the Deceased “giving” or “distributing” shares to his children, with no suggestion that any of his children were holding the shares on trust for him.

Further, there are clear instances where the Deceased’s children have disobeyed him <span class="font-italic">and</span><span class="font-italic"> behaved as owners of their respective shares</span>. Three examples would suffice. First, in 1999, the Deceased wanted to increase CHHMPL’s authorised capital from $2m to $4m and to allot 800,000 new shares to himself and the 1st Defendant. Bee Chip, however, refused to sign the directors’ resolution. As a result, the Deceased decided not to proceed with the increase in capital.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Plaintiff’s written submissions at para 271</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Regarding (a), the fact that the defendants may not have been forthcoming in explaining the financial accounts of CHHMPL, or the fact that the Plaintiff may have doubts over those accounts, clearly does not constitute oppression under either of the s 216 grounds. It cannot be said that the directors are conducting the affairs of the company or exercising their powers in a manner oppressive to the Deceased; nor can it be said that the above constitutes “some act of the company”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The contentions relating to (b) are rather confused. Regarding the appropriation of majority control as an instance of oppressive conduct, this cannot possibly be oppression because the Deceased himself had authorised it. It is clear that acts carried out pursuant to <span class="font-italic">the Deceased’s</span> instructions <span class="font-italic">cannot </span><span class="font-italic">found an oppression action by the Deceased’s Estate</span> against the defendants. Further, the submission that the Deceased had a legally enforceable legitimate expectation that the shares he distributed would be returned to him upon demand has no merit. I have already found at [91] above that there were numerous instances in which his children have disobeyed him: this litigation itself arises from the children’s non-compliance with his wishes. The principle of legitimate expectation, as explained at [95] above, also rests on fairness. The Plaintiff has not shown how or why it was fair to expect the 1st Defendant to return the shares given to him. From the 1st Defendant’s perspective, these shares represented his life’s work and the Deceased’s own legacy which he was, up to that point, charged with effecting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I therefore dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for relief based on s 216 of the Companies Act.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Deceased had planned as his legacy a source of income which was to last for at least the next 30 years. He hoped to benefit his sons and grandsons, and thereafter, to pass the mantle to the third generation. It is clear from his stance on 10 January 2012 (and his declaration, “wo si lao pa”) that he assumed his sons and grandsons would comply. With an asset division so clearly in sight, however, the situation became difficult. On 9 March 2013, Bee Beng, Bee Leng and their sons did not comply with the Deceased’s wishes in respect of CHHMPL. Through subsequent family conversations, it must have become clear to the Deceased that Bee Chip, Chew Yong and Bee Dee would also not comply in respect of OTSDPL. Thus, the Deceased must have realised that his vision of maintaining his legacy by giving substantial control to the 1st Defendant and his family could not be effected without great unhappiness amongst those whom he initially sought to benefit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Deceased then changed his mind and decided to unwind his plans. In so doing, he assumed the 1st Defendant would comply. This was clear from the opening paragraph of his letter of 21 May:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As you are aware, from the very beginning of Chen Hock Heng Machinery Pte Ltd and Ong Tuan Seng Development Pte Ltd have always been our family-run companies. Also as have been in the past and until now, as the Founder and Chairman of both companies I have the ultimate and final say on how both companies should be run and organized and all other importance [sic] decisions concerning the businesses of both companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">But the 1st Defendant, too, decided that he would not comply either. There was and remains no legal obligation on the 1st Defendant’s part to comply. There is also insufficient basis to find minority oppression.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In conclusion, I dismiss Suit 1282 of 2014. I shall hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Goh Phai Cheng, SC (Instructed) and Khor Wee Siong (Khor Law LLC) for the plaintiff in S 1282/2014;<br/>See Tow Soo Ling and Chia Shengyou, Edwin (Colin Ng &amp; Partners LLP) for the defendants in S 1282/2014.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
