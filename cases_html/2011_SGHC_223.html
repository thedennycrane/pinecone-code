<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The advent of new technology has brought about
                    challenges to litigation that (arguably) only technology can resolve. In the
                    midst of considering applications for specific discovery under the “train
                    of inquiry” limb, it should be borne in mind that the genesis of the
                        <em>Peruvian Guano</em> doctrine lies in a simpler
                    time, when photocopiers were not yet invented and computers were not even
                    imagined (and thus a time long before the proliferation of emails and email
                    attachments). The need to ensure that the discovery and inspection process
                    remains <em>proportionate</em> is especially compelling
                    where compound documents (which are electronic storage media such as computer
                    databases and hard disks) are sought to be discovered and inspected under the
                    “train of inquiry” limb; the danger of recovering voluminous
                    electronic documents that are of marginal or no relevance is particularly acute
                    if the <em>Peruvian Guano doctrine</em> is applied bluntly
                    without safeguards (see <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> below), and without due consideration
                    to cautions on the huge corpus of electronic documents potentially discoverable,
                    such as the one aptly made by Senior Master Whitaker in the recent decision of
                        <em>Goodale v Ministry of Justice (Opiate Dependent Prisoners
                        Group Litigation)</em> (2009) EWHC 3834 (QB) at [1] –
                    [2]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…since certainly the beginning of this decade, increasing numbers
                        of public bodies and private businesses, not to mention individuals, have
                        gone over to creating, exchanging and storing their documentation and
                        communicating with each other entirely by electronic means. The end result
                        is that an enormous volume of information is now created, exchanged and
                        stored only electronically. Email communication, word processed documents,
                        spreadsheets and ever increasing numbers of other forms of electronically
                        stored information ("ESI") now often form the entire corpus of the
                        documentation held by companies and individuals who become involved in
                        litigation. So the incidence of paper disclosure is becoming less and less
                        prevalent though in some cases it may still be critical. and the incidence
                        of the disclosure of electronically stored information, or ESI as it is
                        known, is becoming more and more so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is more, the volume of the ESI, even in small organisations is
                        immense, often, as in the case of email, because of the huge quantities of
                        documents created (including wide-scale duplication) and the fact that the
                        documents can exist in many different forms and locations so that they are
                        not readily accessible except at significant cost. It is also commonplace
                        for many individuals to have more than one email account – business,
                        personal, web-mail (for example, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail etc.) When ESI is
                        available, metadata (literally data about data) associated with it can
                        easily be unintentionally altered by the very act of collection, which in
                        some circumstances can have a detrimental effect on the document's
                        evidential integrity. What is more, ESI can be moved about nationally and
                        internationally, indiscriminately and at lightning speed…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background of application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case concerns the plaintiff’s
                    application, made under O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>)
                    and r 11(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed),
                    for specific discovery and inspection of the first defendant’s documents
                    (hereinafter referred to interchangeably as “devices”) which are:
                    (i) a Toshiba laptop used during the first defendant’s employment with the
                    plaintiff (“Toshiba laptop”); (ii) a white Western Digital 250GB
                    hard disk used during the first defendant’s employment with the plaintiff
                    (“hard disk” or “Western Digital hard disk”); and
                    (iii) the first defendant’s iPhone used during his employment with the
                    plaintiff (“iPhone”). It is common ground between parties that
                    these devices are discoverable “documents” under O 24
                    r 5. There is no dispute on possession, custody or power, with regard to
                    the Toshiba laptop, and the hard disk; but the first defendant claims that the
                    iPhone is no longer in his possession, custody or power (and hence not subject
                    to inspection).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is a private limited company
                    incorporated in Singapore, and carries on the business of procuring and
                    supplying stones and tiles for building and construction. The first defendant
                    was appointed a sales director of the plaintiff, and was also made a minority
                    shareholder of the plaintiff (with 10% shareholding). His duties included
                    procuring supplies of stones and tiles on behalf of the plaintiff, and carrying
                    out sales and marketing of the plaintiff’s products and services. The
                    second defendant (not directly involved in the present application), was
                    employed by the plaintiff as a sales executive pursuant to an employment
                    agreement dated 25 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the first defendant, the plaintiff
                    had, through a representative, written a letter on or about 18 January 2011
                    to several of the plaintiff’s customers, informing them that the plaintiff
                    had suspended the first defendant’s duties as a director, and alleging
                    that he had breached several duties owed to the plaintiff by making improper use
                    of information acquired in order to obtain personal gain (the letter of
                    18 January 2011). On the same day, the plaintiff had allegedly prevented
                    the first defendant from returning to the plaintiff’s office premises, and
                    had confiscated the Western Digital hard disk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 19 January 2011, the plaintiff commenced
                    Suit No 33 of 2011/M against the first and second defendants on the following
                    pleaded claims:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     wrongfully disclosing and misusing
                        the plaintiff’s confidential information;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     misusing the plaintiff’s resources and the
                        corporate opportunities obtained by them in their capacity as director and
                        employee of the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     acting with the collateral purpose of setting up a new
                        competing business against the plaintiff’s
                    interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     favouring
                        Xiamen Ouming (one of the plaintiff’s suppliers located in China) and
                        causing the plaintiff to purchase from Xiamen Ouming to the
                        plaintiff’s detriment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     conspiring to defraud, injure and/or cause loss to the
                        plaintiff by unlawful means, and to conceal such fraud from the
                        plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     unlawful interference with the plaintiff’s trade and business;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a>(g)     as against
                        the first defendant, inducing and unlawfully procuring the second defendant
                        to breach her employment contract with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff also obtained an interim
                    injunction on 20 January 2011 (the Order of Court dated 20 January
                    2011 was varied on 4 March 2011), to prohibit the defendants from; carrying
                    on a business which competes with the plaintiff, soliciting the
                    plaintiff’s suppliers, customers and employees, and disclosing certain
                    information concerning certain projects undertaken by the plaintiff. Pursuant to
                    the interim injunction Order, the first defendant was also directed to deliver
                    up items including all laptop computers, desktop computers, hard drives,
                    electronic and other storage materials containing information concerning the
                    various projects undertaken by the plaintiff. The first defendant brought a
                    counterclaim against the plaintiff for the alleged defamatory comments stated in
                    the letter of 18 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the course of submissions, counsel for the
                    first defendant disputed upon the relevancy of the devices sought to be
                    discovered and inspected. It was also asserted, without any elaboration, that
                    the discovery and inspection of the devices was not necessary (see first
                    defendant’s written submissions at [28]). Nevertheless, I have set out (at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> - <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> below) how the
                    train of inquiry is one that will result in the obtaining of evidence that is
                    necessary for the resolution of the pleaded issues. Before I proceed to deal
                    with the question of whether the devices sought are relevant, I will first set
                    out the analytical framework for determining the relevancy of documents sought
                    to be discovered under O 24 r 5 (3)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analytical framework for determining the relevancy of documents
                sought to be discovered under O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>)
                (the “train of inquiry” limb)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Subject to the overriding principle of necessity
                    in O 24 r 7, where the discovery sought must be necessary for
                    disposing fairly of the proceedings or for saving costs (see <em>Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 4 SLR 39 at [37] and [38]),
                    documents which are not in themselves directly relevant, but which are
                    indirectly relevant as it may lead to a train of inquiry resulting in the
                    obtaining of directly relevant evidence, can be discovered under O 24
                        r 5(3)(<em>c</em>). This “train of
                    inquiry” provision is a vestige from the decision of <em>The Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano
                        Co</em> (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62-63, where it was observed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... documents to be produced are not confined to those, which would be
                        evidence either to prove or to disprove any matter in question in the action
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The doctrine seems to me to go farther than that and to go as far as the
                        principle which I am about to lay down. It seems to me that every document
                        relates to the matters in question in the action, which not only would be
                        evidence upon any issue, but also which, it is reasonable to suppose,
                        contains information which may - not which must - either directly or
                        indirectly enable the party [requiring discovery] either to advance his own
                        case or to damage the case of his adversary ... a document can properly be
                        said to contain information which may enable the party [requiring discovery]
                        to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, if it is a
                        document which may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have
                        either of these two consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It bears noting that the <em>Peruvian Guano</em> doctrine was set at a time when computers were
                    unheard of; a blunt application of this doctrine would at times result in the
                    discovery of voluminous documents, not all of which are relevant or material to
                    the issues at trial. It may also be that the time and expense involved in the
                    pursuit of all evidence that may lead to a train of inquiry would outweigh the
                    likely benefits of obtaining evidence that may only be marginally relevant, or
                    evidence that is relevant but immaterial (these scenarios would arguably be
                    caught by the rule of necessity). By the very nature of the “train of
                    inquiry” doctrine, the line between a fishing expedition and a legitimate
                    discovery application, would arguably be the finest in an application made under
                    O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>), amongst the applications
                    available in O 24 r 5. It would therefore be beneficial to set out an
                    analytical framework for determining the relevancy of documents sought to be
                    discovered under O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The document sought to be discovered in
                    O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>) is, in the words of that
                    rule, “a document which may lead the party seeking discovery of it to a
                    train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information which may - adversely
                    affect his own case; adversely affect another party’s case; or support
                    another party’s case”. The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 465 at [35]
                        (“<em>Tan Chin Seng</em>”) held that it
                    was “necessary for the applicant party to show <b><em>in
                        what way</em></b> the requested document may lead to a relevant
                    document”. To this end, an applicant can discharge this burden by
                    showing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, that the train of inquiry is
                        one <b><em>that would result</em></b> in obtaining <b><em>directly relevant evidence</em></b> (directly relevant
                        evidence is information that may - adversely affect his own case; adversely
                        affect another party’s case; or support another party’s case)
                        (“ascertaining the train of inquiry” limb);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the
                        document sought to be discovered is one that <b><em>may</em></b> lead the party to that train of inquiry in (a)
                        above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With regard to the first aspect, that is, to
                    ascertain the train of inquiry to be undertaken, the Court in <em>Dante Yap Go v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG</em>
                    [2007] SGHC 69 observed the following (at [30] –
                    [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A party seeking discovery on the basis of O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>) cannot hope to get an order in his favour unless
                        the train of inquiry will itself lead to the discovery of directly relevant
                        documents…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…there must … be shown a connection between <em>what is discovered</em> and the ultimate end-point, which
                        is <em>the pleadings</em> that in turn control what are
                        pertinent to the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In other words, the train of inquiry <em>must</em> be one that <em>would
                        result</em> in the discovery of documents (or information) that is
                        <em>directly relevant</em> and necessary for the
                    resolution of the pleaded issues. Although what is directly relevant would very
                    much depend on the factual matrix and pleaded issues of the precise case at
                    hand, it should be borne in mind that the Rules itself has provided guidance on
                    what is directly relevant. In this regard, the concept of direct relevancy, for
                    the purposes of 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>), refers to
                    documents or information which may adversely affect the applicant’s own
                    case; adversely affect another party’s case, or support another
                    party’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With regard to the second aspect, the
                    applicant must show that the document sought to be discovered under O 24
                        r 5(3)(<em>c</em>) is one that may lead to that
                    train of inquiry that has been ascertained above. It is not necessary to show
                    that the document sought to be discovered under O 24 r 5(3)(<em>c</em>) <b><em>must</em></b>, or <b><em>will</em></b>, lead to that relevant train of inquiry. As
                    emphasized by the Court in <em>Thyssen Hunnebeck Singapore Pte
                        Ltd v TTJ Civil Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 75
                    at (5):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It will be borne in mind that should it subsequently transpire that no
                        relevant information was in fact found in the documents disclosed, that does
                        not, in itself, mean that the request was a fishing expedition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The words set out in O 24
                        r 5(3)(<em>c</em>) provide that the document
                    sought to be recovered is one which <b><em>may</em></b> lead to a
                    train of inquiry. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Chin
                        Seng</em> (at [14]) referred
                    to such indirectly relevant evidence as having the <b>“</b><b><em>potential</em></b> to set off
                    ‘a train of inquiry’ resulting in the discovery of evidence of
                    direct relevance”. In this regard, a fundamental difference between a
                    fishing expedition and a legitimate application for discovery under O 24
                        r 5(3)(<em>c</em>) would be whether there are
                        <b><em>reasonable grounds</em></b> to find that the document
                    sought to be recovered is one that has the potential to set off this train of
                    inquiry. What constitute reasonable grounds, and whether there are reasonable
                    grounds to find that the document sought to be discovered has the potential to
                    set off the train of inquiry, would be questions of fact to be decided within
                    the precise factual matrix of the specific case at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having set out the analytical framework for
                    determining the relevancy (<em>albeit</em> indirect
                    relevancy) of documents sought to be discovered under O 24
                        r 5(3)(<em>c</em>), I will proceed to deal with
                    the merits of the plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Ascertaining the train of inquiry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I am convinced that the train of inquiry is
                    one that will result in the obtaining of evidence directly relevant and
                    necessary for the resolution of the pleaded issues. The plaintiff’s
                    solicitors drew the Court’s attention to a few emails that allegedly
                    showed the defendants’ breaches of duties. There is no doubt that this is
                    not the proper forum to determine whether the defendants were indeed in breach
                    of their duties owed to the plaintiff, but the pertinent point to take away from
                    these emails is that they reveal that there are many specific undisclosed
                    documentation that would be material for the disposal of the issues at trial. In
                    this regard, a detailed review of these emails would illustrate how this is
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The second defendant forwarded a list of
                    projects (“the Projects Follow up List”) which the plaintiff was
                    involved in to the first defendant by way of an email dated 20 November 2010
                    (see exhibit “TEKJ-4” in Tay Eng Kiat Jackson’s
                    (“Tay”) affidavit dated 18 January 2011). The Projects Follow
                    up List contains a list of projects that the plaintiff had tendered for and
                    submitted quotations for. About a month later, on 14 December 2011, the
                    first defendant forwarded the second defendant’s email together with the
                    Projects Follow up List to one “Zhiqiang”, the General Manager of
                    Xiamen J.M. Stone CO. Ltd and Xiamen Ouming Imp &amp; Ex Co. Pte (collectively
                    known as “Xiamen Ouming”). Xiamen Ouming is an existing supplier
                    of the plaintiff. This email dated 14 December 2011 shall hereinafter be
                    referred to as “the first email of 14 December 2011” (see
                    exhibit “TEKJ-4”). The second defendant’s email to the first
                    defendant dated 20 November 2010 presupposes that there have been
                    instructions given by the latter to the former for the specifications required
                    to compile the Projects Follow up List; yet these instructions remain
                    undisclosed to date. Likewise, the first defendant would not have simply sent
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> email of 14 December 2011 to Xiamen
                    Ouming out of the blue; there necessarily must have been some communication
                    between Zhiqiang and the first defendant regarding the price quotations, the
                    quantity required and the type of materials or finishes required, for the
                    purposes of compiling the Projects Follow up List. These are undisclosed. It is
                    evident that the above mentioned undisclosed documentation would be pertinent in
                    resolving the pleaded issues of whether the defendants did, unlawfully
                    interfered with the plaintiff’s trade and business; misused corporate
                    information and opportunities obtained in their capacity as the
                    plaintiff’s director and employee; misused and disclosed without
                    authorisation the plaintiff’s confidential information; and if so, whether
                    such misuse and disclosure was indeed made for the purposes of setting up a
                    competing business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I move on to another set of emails which would
                    be <em>vital</em> in showing whether the defendants did in
                    fact planned and worked together to set up a competing business. The second
                    defendant sent an email dated 30 November 2010 to the first defendant, proposing
                    several names, allegedly for the purpose of naming the new competing business
                    (see exhibit “TEKJ-6” in Tay’s affidavit dated
                    18 January 2011):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Boss,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Only manage[d] to think of a few names</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Classic Stone</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Stone Culture</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Do not hesitate to contact me if you need further assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As with the above, this email presupposes that
                    there were instructions given by the first defendant to the second defendant.
                    The documentation containing such instructions are undisclosed. The first
                    defendant forwarded the email of 30 November 2010 to Zhiqiang in an email
                    dated 14 December 2010 (hereinafter referred to as “the second email
                    of 14 December 2011”) (see “TEKJ-6”), inviting
                    Zhiqiang’s views on the proposed names:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Zhiqiang,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please find below the new company name we have [<em>sic</em>] thing of. We prefer the one in red. <em>Please let me know if [sic] its is alright and I will check if it is
                            still available</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As can be seen, there would necessarily be
                    further communication between Zhiqiang and the first defendant, in particular,
                    on Zhiqiang’s views on whether the proposed company name is
                    “alright”, as well as the first defendant’s check(s) on
                    whether the name “is still available”. Such further communication
                        <em>goes to the heart</em> of resolving the pleaded
                    issues of whether the defendants had planned to set up a competing business, and
                    whether they have approached the plaintiff’s existing suppliers in
                    furtherance of their plans to set up the new competing business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Furthermore, by an email dated
                    13 December 2010, the second defendant sent a proposed budget list (list of
                    costs and expenses) of the alleged new competing business (see exhibit
                    “TEKJ-7” in Tay’s affidavit dated 18 January 2011). The
                    budget list sets out the proposed expenses of the alleged new business,
                    including the salaries of the first and second defendants, as well as two other
                    unnamed personnel to deal with administration and storage. The said email
                    annexed with the budget list states the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Boss,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like this ok?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Do not hesitate to contact me if you need further assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This clearly presupposes that there was prior
                    communication between the first and second defendant, including the instructions
                    given by the former to the latter to prepare and send the proposed budget list.
                    It is beyond question that such communication, as yet undisclosed, is pertinent
                    is resolving the pleaded issues of whether the first defendant had unlawfully
                    procured the services of the second defendant to breach the latter’s
                    obligations owed under his employment contract with the plaintiff; whether the
                    defendants have misused the plaintiff’s resources and corporate
                    opportunities obtained by them in their capacity as the plaintiff’s
                    director and employee; misused and disclosed without authorisation the
                    plaintiff’s confidential information; and importantly, whether the
                    defendants had acted together to set up a competing business against the
                    plaintiff’s interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In addition to the above, there are two emails
                    which reveal that there are undisclosed documents which are <em>material</em> in proving that the defendants have approached the
                    plaintiff’s suppliers in furtherance of their plans to set up a competing
                    business. The first defendant arranged for a business trip to Turkey to meet ADK
                    Marble in January 2011, one of the plaintiff’s suppliers. The
                    plaintiff alleges that the ulterior motive or the true purpose of the trip was
                    for the defendants to meet up with the ADK Marble for the purposes of discussing
                    the defendants’ new competing business venture. The first defendant sent
                    an email dated 3 January 2011 to one Ms Duygu from ADK Marble to enlist the
                    latter’s assistance to book air tickets for both defendants (see exhibit
                    “TEKJ-8” at page 54 of Tay’s affidavit dated 18 January
                    2011):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Ms Duygu,</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As can be seen from the above, for some
                    important reason(s), the first defendant does not want the plaintiff’s
                    directors (Leslie and Jackson) to know that he is bringing the second defendant
                    along for the trip. He enlisted the assistance of the representative from ADK
                    Marble to conceal this information from the plaintiff, and at the same time,
                    reveals that there are “<em>other stuff</em>”
                    to be discussed with ADK Marble. In view of this reference, it goes without
                    saying that there is subsequent communication between the first defendant and
                    ADK Marble’s representative. Such communication, as well as any
                    documentation prepared <em>in support of</em> this
                    communication (such as the proposed budget expenses or supply agreements) goes
                    to the very heart of resolving the pleaded issues of whether the defendants have
                    approached the plaintiff’s suppliers in furtherance of their plans to set
                    up a competing business; and whether the defendants have worked together to set
                    up a competing business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In addition, it is notable that the first
                    defendant sent an email dated 4 January 2011 to one Yiannis Chatziioannidis
                    of Marble Market from Greece, one of the plaintiff’s suppliers, to ask for
                    assistance in making arrangements for hotel accommodation for two persons, and
                    to ask the latter not to let the plaintiff’s directors know that he is
                    bringing the second defendant along for the business trip to Greece (see exhibit
                    “TEKJ-8” at page 51 of Tay’s affidavit dated 18 January
                    2011):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The first defendant’s attempt to
                        <em>conceal</em> the fact that he is bringing the
                    second defendant to these overseas trips to meet up with the plaintiff’s
                    suppliers, would necessarily bring the <em>true
                        purpose</em> of such trips into question. As such, the <em>business documentation</em> that the first defendant
                        <em>brought alon</em>g for these trips, would be
                    material in proving whether such trips were made for the purpose of approaching
                    the plaintiff’s existing suppliers (such as ADK Marble and Marble Market)
                    in furtherance of the collateral purpose of planning and setting up a competing
                    business against the plaintiff’s interest.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     From the above, it is clear that the train of
                    inquiry is one that will result in the obtaining of evidence that is directly
                    relevant and necessary for the resolution of the pleaded issues, <em>in particular</em>, evidence that include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     Instructions given by the first
                        defendant to the second defendant relating to specifications required to

                        Projects Follow Up List;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     Instructions given by the first defendant to the second

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_f"></a>(f)     Business documentation that the first defendant

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_g"></a>(g)     Subsequent communication (including documents prepared in support of this
                        subsequent communication) between the first defendant and any representative
                        from ADK Marble on the “other stuff” to discuss, as referenced
                        in the first defendant’s email dated 3 January 2011 to Ms Duygu
                        from ADK Marble; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_h"></a>(h)     Business documentation that the first defendant brought along for his
                        overseas trip to Greece to meet Marble Market in January
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the documents sought to be discovered have the potential to
                set off the train of inquiry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The first defendant argued in his written
                    submissions (at [31]) that the plaintiff
                    is merely relying on the fact that the first defendant had owned the documents
                    while he was in the plaintiff’s employment to show the relevance of the
                    documents. On the contrary, it should be clear that there are <em>compelling grounds</em> to find that the documents have the potential
                    to set off the train of inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I will start off with a point concerning the
                    first defendant’s emails to the plaintiff’s suppliers in Turkey and
                    Greece, dated 3 and 4 January 2011 respectively. In my view, given that the
                    first defendant had enlisted the assistance of the plaintiff’s suppliers
                    to conceal the fact that he brought the second defendant to Turkey and Greece in
                    January 2011 to meet the plaintiff’s suppliers, the true purpose of these
                    overseas trips are called into question. It follows that the <em>business documentation</em> that the first defendant brought along
                    for these trips would be pertinent in revealing the true purpose and nature of
                    the trips; in particular, whether these trips were made for legitimate purposes
                    in furtherance of the plaintiff’s business, or whether, as pleaded by the
                    plaintiff, the trips were made in furtherance of the defendants’ plans to
                    set up the competing business. In this regard, it is significant that by the
                    first defendant’s own admission, he had used both the NEC laptop and the
                    Toshiba laptop (it is undisputed that the documents in the NEC laptop was
                    backed-up and transferred to the Toshiba laptop) to reply to work emails when he
                    was <em>away from office</em> (see first defendant’s
                    written submissions at [42]). The
                    necessary inference of this admission is that the first defendant has access to
                    his NEC laptop and Toshiba laptop when he is away from office, including his
                    overseas trips to meet the plaintiff’s suppliers, such as the trips made
                    to Greece and Turkey in January 2011. At this juncture, I should also add that
                    the plaintiff’s solicitors’ submission in the hearing before me that
                    the two laptops were used by the first defendant in his overseas travels were
                    not disputed by the first defendant’s solicitors, and the first defendant
                    had specifically admitted in his own affidavit dated 15 September 2011 (at
                    p 6) that he used the Toshiba laptop during travel. It necessarily follows
                    that there are reasonable grounds to believe that these laptops would contain
                    the business documentation that the first defendant brought along for these
                    trips, which, as highlighted above, are pertinent for resolving the pleaded
                    issue of whether the first defendant had approached the plaintiff’s
                    overseas suppliers in furtherance of the defendants’ plans to set up a
                    competing business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In addition, it would not be unreasonable to
                    assume that an employee who wishes to misuse an employer’s confidential
                    information, and to set up a competing business against his employer’s
                    interest would, more probable than not, keep the relevant documentation in his
                    personal devices (in the present case, the first defendant’s personal
                    Toshiba laptop, the Western Digital Hard disk, and iPhone), so as to <em>avoid detection</em>, or so that if subsequently detected,
                    the employer would not have direct access to the incriminating evidence
                    (“the assumption”). However, I must place significant caveats in
                    this regard. A discovery order can never be made on the basis of this sole
                    assumption alone; this assumption cannot <em>in and of
                        itself</em> be determinative of whether the employee’s personal
                    devices would lead to a train of inquiry of directly relevant evidence, for the
                    assumption is premised upon the presupposition that the employee is indeed
                    liable of setting up a competing business or of misusing the employer’s
                    confidential information; a conclusion which the Court hearing the discovery
                    application has no jurisdiction to make in the first place. As such, this
                    assumption can at most be used only as a <em>supporting factor
                        contextually</em> – ultimately, whether the documents sought to
                    be discovered can lead to the discovery of directly relevant documents would
                    turn upon the precise facts of the case. On the particular facts of the present
                    case, the assumption is reinforced by the fact that there is undisputed evidence
                    that the first defendant had the intention to conceal information from the
                    plaintiff’s directors, Leslie and Jackson. This is evident from the first
                    defendant’s emails to representatives of ADK Marble dated 3 January
                    2011, and of Marble Market dated 4 January 2011 (see above at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Furthermore, there is undisputed evidence that
                    the first defendant has access to work emails from his iPhone, and that he
                    forwards the emails from his iPhone to his personal email account. For example,
                    the email sent by the second defendant to the first defendant dated
                    13 December 2010 was forwarded by the first defendant to his personal yahoo
                    email accounts using his iPhone (see exhibit “TEKJ-7” at p 48
                    of Tay’s affidavit dated 18 January 2011). The first defendant even
                    used his iPhone to forward the email dated 4 January 2011 (sent by the
                    first defendant to Yannis Chatzlioannidis, the representative from Marble
                    Market) to Yannis Chatzlioannidis on the same date (see exhibit
                    “TEKJ-8” at p 48 of Tay’s affidavit dated
                    18 January 2011). Apart from the fact that such evidence shows that the
                    iPhone would lead to the discovery of directly relevant documents; an inference
                    is also drawn, in that, by sending emails and directly relevant evidence (such
                    as the proposed budget list annexed to the email of 13 December 2010) to
                    his <em>personal</em> email accounts, the first defendant
                    would access such directly relevant evidence through his <em>personal</em> devices, such as the Toshiba laptop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Moreover, it is noted that the first
                    defendant’s office email account is accessible through the webmail
                    interface http://webmail.surfacestone.com.sg (see affidavit of Lew Tze Yong
                    dated 15 September 2011 at [6]). As
                    the office email account is accessible from any computer with internet access,
                    this would mean that the first defendant can access the work email from non-work
                    computer sources, including his personal laptops. In fact, given that the office
                    email can be accessed from <em>any computer</em> with
                    internet access, the fact that the first defendant chose to use his Toshiba
                    laptop and NEC laptop to reply to office emails when he is away from office (as
                    admitted at [42] of the first
                    defendant’s written submissions) would go some way in showing a reasonably
                    credible nexus between <em>work related materials</em> and
                    these two laptops.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is also significant that the first
                    defendant failed to dispute on affidavit (and in the hearing before me), the
                    plaintiff’s assertion that the first defendant had used his personal
                    laptop <b><em>in discharge of his duties</em></b> as director and
                    Sales Director of the plaintiff, (stated in Tay’s affidavit dated
                    18 January 2011 at [45]-[48]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant has been using his personal
                        laptop, instead of a computer issued by the Plaintiff, <em>in
                            the discharge of his duties as the Sales Director of the
                            Plaintiff</em>. This arrangement was agreed between the Plaintiff
                        and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I believe that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant <em>uses the same personal laptop in ostensibly carrying out his
                            duties as a director and Sale Director of the Plaintiff, including
                            communicating with the Plaintiff’s suppliers and/or customers by
                            email, and keeping all information and/or records in respect of his
                            dealing on behalf of the Plaintiff</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, I believe that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant’s laptop contains information including but not limited to
                        the email correspondence between the Defendants and the Plaintiff’s
                        customers and/or suppliers and other information, which may, if improperly
                        used, be to the detriment of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff has also asserted (in the
                    supporting affidavit by Tay dated 22 August 2011 at [23] and [27], the written submissions at [22(b)], as well as in the oral
                    submissions in the hearing before me), that the Toshiba laptop, Western Digital
                    Hard disk, and iPhone were used by the first defendant <b><em>in
                        the course of his employment</em></b>. The first defendant has to date,
                    not disputed this on affidavit. This was also not disputed by the first
                    defendant’s solicitors in the hearing before me. Indeed, the first
                    defendant even went as far as to <em>confirm</em> in his
                    own affidavit dated 9 September 2011 at [13] that he did not deny that both the NEC laptop and the
                    Toshiba laptop were used in the course of his employment with the plaintiff. He
                    also admitted that he owned both laptops during the time when he was employed
                    with the plaintiff (at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first defendant, in his affidavit dated
                    9 September 2011 (at [8] –
                    [11] and [14]), denied that the NEC laptop, Toshiba laptop, Western
                    Digital Hard disk, and iPhone contains any “Information” (with a
                    capital “I”). In particular, the first defendant also asserted
                    that (at 14(b) and [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…some of the data contained in the NEC has been transferred to my
                        Toshiba laptop. However, the transferred data does not include the
                        Information falling within the scope of the Injunction….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only reason why the Devices [the Toshiba laptop, Western Digital Hard
                        disk, and iPhone] are not referred to in my List of Documents is because
                        they do not store the Information and <em>as such</em>
                        are irrelevant for the purposes of discovery in this Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Notwithstanding the above, the first defendant
                    has to realise that just because the said devices (allegedly) do not contain the
                    “Information” falling within the scope of the injunction, it does
                    not mean that the devices do not contain the undisclosed documents (referred to
                    above in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above) that are directly
                    relevant to the pleaded issues. As admitted and emphasized by the first
                    defendant’s solicitor himself in the hearing before me,
                    “Information” has been given a specific and narrow definition in
                    the Order of interim injunction dated 4 March 2011 as (“the
                    Order”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…information concerning the <em>Projects</em>
                        relating to (a) the materials and products used or to be used for the
                        Projects (b) the prices quoted for the Projects, (c) the list of suppliers
                        for the Projects, (d) the status/stage of the Projects, (e) the test reports
                        on the materials for the Projects, (f) information contained in the tender
                        documents for the Projects, and (g) the costings of the materials and stocks
                        procured for the Projects (collectively, “<em>the
                            Information</em>”) [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the same Order, the
                    “Information” is limited only to “Projects” listed
                    in page 42 of Tay’s affidavit dated 18 January 2011, and exhibit
                    TEKJ-11 of Tay’s affidavit dated 3 March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As it stands, the first defendant has at most
                    denied that the devices contain the Information falling within the scope of the
                    Order, in his affidavit dated 9 September 2011 (I add here parenthetically
                    that even such denial has been, in my view, countered by the reasons stated (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>, and below at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>). The first defendant has not denied,
                    on affidavit, that the devices sought to be recovered contains directly relevant
                    evidence that goes towards resolving the pleaded issues. The first
                    defendant’s failure to deny is even more significant in view of the fact
                    that the first defendant had the chance to, in his affidavit dated
                    9 September 2011, deny the plaintiff’s clear assertion in Tay’s
                    affidavit of 22 August 2011 at [27]
                    that:</p>

                    to the discovery of evidence relevant to resolving the pleaded issues, and not
                    just to Information falling within the scope of the Order (Tay’s affidavit

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Despite the clear statements above, the first
                    defendant has to date failed to deny on affidavit that the documents sought to
                    be discovered would lead to the discovery of evidence relevant for resolving the
                    pleaded issues. This was so even though the first defendant had the chance to
                    state this denial as it filed a subsequent affidavit dated 16 September
                    2011, but still there was no such denial in that affidavit. Further, the first
                    defendant’s solicitors could have but did not seek leave in the hearing
                    before me for time to file any supplemental affidavit to state the necessary
                    denial. In totality, the first defendant had three chances to state this denial
                    on affidavit (in the affidavit dated 9 September 11, the affidavit dated
                    16 September 2011, and the chance to request to file a supplemental
                    affidavit before me during the hearing on 20 September 2011), but had
                    failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On the contrary, the first defendant had shown
                    by its conduct, with especial regard to the Western Digital Hard disk, that it
                        <em>may</em> contain information relevant for the
                    purposes of the trial. While the plaintiff’s solicitors had only asked the
                    first defendant to deliver up electronic devices to comply with the Order, in a
                    letter dated 1 February 2011, where <em>no
                        mention</em> was made on discovery or the trial, the first
                    defendant’s solicitors had actually made an offer for a joint inspection
                    of the Western Digital Hard disk in a letter dated 8 February 2011.
                    However, the first defendant’s solicitors went a step <b><em>further</em></b> to state in the same letter that the contents of the
                    Hard disk can <em>be listed in an inventory pending
                        trial</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…we reiterate our client’s proposal that, in the event that
                        your clients are not agreeable to the return of the above hard disk and
                        boxes of the name cars, your clients and its representatives meet our client
                        and us at an appointed date, time and location to inspect the contents of
                        the said hard disk together <em>and list them in an inventory
                            pending trial</em> [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In response to the above, the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors stated in its letter dated 15 February 2011
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There would not be any need for both our respective clients to incur the
                        costs of a joint inspection if your client can simply confirm that the hard
                        disk does not contain any of the Information listed in the Order of Court
                        dated 20 January 2011 (“Order of Court”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is obvious that the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors were only asking the first defendant to confirm whether the Hard disk
                    contains the Information falling under the scope of the Order, and nothing was
                    said about discovery or trial. However, not only was it that the first defendant
                        <em>could not</em> give this confirmation, the first
                    defendant had went further (through his solicitors) to re-affirm its offer for a
                    joint inspection, in a letter written by the first defendant’s solicitors
                    dated 18 February. This time round, the first defendant’s solicitors
                    again took the further step of offering to <em>list</em>
                    the contents of the Hard disk can be <em>in an inventory pending
                        trial</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the most reasonable and sensible way to confirm if the hard disk
                        contains any Information would be for your clients’ representative and
                        solicitor together with our client and a solicitor from our firm to inspect
                        the hard disk <em>and list them in an inventory pending
                            trial</em> [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the course of submissions before me, the
                    first defendant’s solicitors argued that the offer to have a joint
                    inspection should not be taken as an admission to relevancy. No submissions were
                    made with regard to the further offer to list the contents of the Hard disk in
                    an inventory pending trial. In addition, no issues of “without
                    prejudice” were raised in the hearing before me. These letters were also
                    annexed in Tay’s supporting affidavit dated 22 August 2011, and no
                    objections were raised with regard to these letters in the first
                    defendant’s affidavits or in the first defendant’s written
                    submissions. In my view, the statements made by the first defendant (through his
                    solicitors) in the letters dated 8 and 18 February 2011 shows that the
                    first defendant himself cannot be sure whether the Hard disk contains the said
                    Information (which are information relevant for the trial, amongst other pleaded
                    issues). Furthermore, by offering to inspect the Hard disk jointly, and by
                        <em>making the further offer to list the contents of the Hard
                        disk in an inventory pending trial</em> (not only once, but <em>twice</em>), the first defendant had represented, by his
                    conduct, that the Hard disk has <em>the potential of containing
                        documents that are relevant for the trial</em>. This representation is
                    reinforced by the fact that the plaintiff had not even made any mention about
                    discovery or trial in its letters; the fact that the first defendant had come up
                    with an offer to list the contents in an inventory pending trial, when the
                    plaintiff itself has said nothing about the trial, shows that it was within the
                    first defendant’s <em>contemplation</em> that the
                    Hard disk may contain relevant documentation. Further, this representation is
                    even more compelling given that the first defendant had the prerogative of
                    simply asserting that the plaintiff has no entitlement to the Hard disk because
                    it contains <em>no relevant evidence at all</em>, either
                    for the Information falling with the scope of the Order, or for the purposes of
                    trial. As the Hard disk is the first defendant’s <b><em>personal</em></b> item, he was in the best position to make this
                    assertion, and had <em>no excuse</em> of not knowing what
                    was inside the Hard disk. Having <em>elected</em> not to
                    make this assertion, but to make an offer for inspection and a further offer of
                    listing the contents in an inventory pending trial, it does not lie in the
                    plaintiff’s mouth to subsequently state that the Hard disk contains no
                    relevant information (which even if accepted, will be given very little weight,
                    if at all).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the reasons above, I find that there are
                    compelling grounds to believe that the documents sought to be discovered has the
                    potential to set off the train of inquiry. I therefore order the discovery and
                    inspection of the first defendant’s Toshiba laptop and Western Digital
                    250GB hard disk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I will not order the discovery and inspection
                    of the first defendant’s iPhone used during his employment with the
                    plaintiff, as there is sufficient evidence to show that the iPhone is no longer
                    in the first defendant’s possession, custody or power. The first
                    defendant’s assertion that he lost his iPhone in sometime around June 2010
                    while on a business trip to Greece, is corroborated by an exhibit of his
                    passport (see TSL-7 at pp 5-6 of the first defendant’s affidavit dated
                    16 September 2011). His assertion that he bought a replacement iPhone soon
                    thereafter is supported by the Change of Equipment/Handset Upgrade Service
                    application form (which shows the iPhone number), at pp 8-10 of exhibit TSL-7 of
                    the first defendant’s affidavit dated 16 September 2011. This
                    replacement iPhone was subsequently lost on or about 21 January 2011 while
                    he was in Malaysia with some friends. His version is corroborated by a statutory
                    declaration from one of his friends, one Yeo Boon Seng, that the first defendant
                    had indeed lost his iPhone whilst they were in Malaysia, as well as the relevant
                    pages of his passport showing that he was in Malaysia at that time (see
                    pp 11-15 and p 7 respectively, in exhibit TSL-7 of the first
                    defendant’s affidavit dated 16 September 2011). Viewing the evidence
                    in totality, there are sufficient grounds to find that the iPhone that the
                    plaintiff sought to discover and inspect is no longer in the first
                    defendant’s possession, custody or power.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discovery of discrete documents within compound documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the course of submissions, counsel for the
                    first defendant argued that the discovery application was a fishing expedition,
                    as it did not identify the <em>class of documents</em>
                    within the devices in which the plaintiff believes that there will be
                    discoverable information (see also the first defendant’s written
                    submissions at [29]). Counsel referred
                    to the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Wright Norman and another
                        v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another appeal</em> [1992]
                    2 SLR(R) 452 (“<em>Wright
                    Norman</em>”) as authority for the position that an
                    applicant’s failure to identify the <em>classes of
                        documents</em> sought would be a fishing expedition. When I sought
                    clarification from counsel on whether he was thus submitting that, as a general
                    rule, all applications for specific discovery under O 24 r 5 must
                    identify the classes of documents sought for, the want of which would <em>automatically</em> render the application a fishing
                    expedition, counsel had confirmed that the answer is in the positive
                    (“the rule”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As a preliminary point, the decision of
                        <em>Wright Norman</em> is not evidently relevant to the
                    present case, as the Court of Appeal had expressly stated in its decision (at
                        [19]) that the application in
                    question before the Court in <em>Wright Norman</em> was
                    (apart from the interrogatories) <em>not</em> for discovery
                    of any particular class of documents, but was an application for a <em>further and better list of documents</em>. More significant
                    is the fact that there is nothing in <em>Wright Norman</em>
                    that supports the rule, neither is there anything in the decision that states
                    that an applicant’s failure to identify the <em>classes of
                        documents</em> sought would necessarily mean that he is engaging in a
                    fishing expedition. Indeed, the application in <em>Wright
                        Norman</em> was dismissed, <em>not because</em>
                    of any omission to classify or categorise the documents sought, but because the
                    Court of Appeal was of the view that the categories of documents sought were too
                    wide and that almost none of the categories had any relevance to the pleaded
                    issues (see <em>Wright Norman</em> at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first and third defendants, therefore, sought discovery of <em>very wide categories of documents, and virtually none of them
                            bear any relevance to the issues raised by the defence</em>.
                        Having regard to the <em>extreme width</em> of these
                        categories of documents sought, we cannot but agree with Chao Hick
                        Tin JC that the aim of the application for such further and better list
                        is no different from that of the application for leave to serve the
                        interrogatories…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Court of Appeal in <em>Wright Norman</em> also found that the applicant had attempted to
                    interrogate upon particulars that were not pleaded; while Norman Wright had set
                    out in his pleadings the 22 steps which a reputable executive search firm (such
                    as the plaintiff in that case) would take to ensure confidentiality; he did not
                    identify in his pleadings which of the 22 steps the plaintiff had failed to
                    take; and had merely alleged that the plaintiff had failed to take one of the 22
                    steps. That was found to be inadequate as many of the steps had no relevance to
                    the pleadings. I should add, at this juncture, that, unlike the case in
                        <em>Wright Norman</em>, it was not submitted before me
                    that the plaintiff’s pleadings are deficient for lack of particulars;
                    there is also no dispute or argument raised by the first defendant that the
                    plaintiff is seeking discovery of facts that have not been particularised. In
                    addition, it has already been shown above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> how the train of inquiry would result
                    in the discovery of documents directly relevant to the pleaded
                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Notwithstanding the first defendant’s
                    flawed reliance on the decision of <em>Wright Norman</em>,
                    the submissions made by counsel for the first defendant highlighted the need to
                    differentiate between <b><em>compound documents</em></b> and
                    discrete documents (“discrete” documents are distinct and
                    individual documents). A compound document is a storage medium that contains
                    several discrete documents; it provides the user with a consolidated point where
                    electronically stored data and information of various formats (such as text,
                    graphics, video and audio files), can be conveniently stored, organised,
                    accessed and modified. Examples of compound documents include a computer hard
                    disk, databases, the internal flash memory of tablet computers (such as iPads)
                    and smart phones (such as iPhones), and recording media like external hard
                    drives, USB flash drives and memory cards. There is no question that compound
                    documents are discoverable “documents” that can be inspected,
                    within the discovery and inspection regime set out in O 24. This was clearly set
                    out by the Court in <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P
                        and another suit</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 343 (“<em>Alliance Management</em>”), where it was observed that
                    (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…it bears noting that Vinelott J in <em>Derby
                            &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon</em> (No 9) [1991] 1 WLR 652
                        ("Derby No 9") concluded that material on a computer database constituted a
                        "document" within O 24. The word "document" covers "anything upon which
                        evidence or information is recorded in a manner intelligible to the senses
                        or capable of being made intelligible by the use of equipment" (see
                        Singapore Civil Procedure 2003 (G P Selvam ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2003)
                        at para 24/1/2). A "document" is defined in s 3(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap
                        97, 1997 Rev Ed) as "any matter expressed or described upon any substance by
                        means of letters, figures or marks or by more than one of those means
                        intended to be used or which may be used for the purpose of recording that
                        matter". Material stored on a computer database is within this definition.

                            Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 91 at [34] reviewed the definition of "document"
                        in the Evidence Act and other statutes and, inter alia, concluded that as
                        with the other statutes considered in that case, the Evidence Act definition
                        of the word "document" was broad enough to encompass information recorded in
                        an electronic medium or recording device such as a hard disk drive installed
                        in a desktop or server computer. Put simply, the concept of "document"
                        embraces the Hard Disk for the purposes of O 24 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In a situation where an applicant seeks
                    specific discovery of a compound document, such as the Toshiba laptop or the
                    Western Digital Hard disk in the present case, the essential document(s) sought
                    to be discovered is not the compound document itself (as it serves only as a
                    storage medium), but the discrete documents found <em>within</em> the compound document. However, the Rules of Court as
                    they stand do not make any express distinction between a compound document and
                    discrete documents. O 24 r 5 provides:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As the concept of “document” for
                    the purposes of O 24 of the ROC includes compound documents (see <em>Alliance Management</em> at [10]), the phrase “any document” in O 24
                    r 5(1), and “the document” in O 24 r 5(3), refers
                    to the compound document sought to be discovered. As such, the literal reading
                    of O 24 r 5 would mean that an applicant for specific discovery only
                    has to specify the compound document (such as the hard disk) sought to be
                    discovered in the supporting affidavit; there is no express requirement in the
                    Rules to specify <em>the classes of</em> documents sought
                    for within the compound document. In my view, just because an application for
                    specific discovery of a compound document was not made with a specific
                    classification or categorisation of the discrete documents sought from within
                    the compound document, it does not <em>necessarily</em>
                    render the application a fishing expedition. The practice of classifying
                    documents in an application for specific discovery is not an end to be achieved,
                    in and of itself; such a practice is meant to ensure that there is <em>sufficient specificity</em> to the application, so as to
                    guide both the parties and the Court to ensure that the discovery is ordered
                    only for documents which are relevant and necessary for the disposal of the
                    cause or matter or for saving costs. As it is, an applicant for specific
                    discovery of discrete or individual documents can elect whether to specify the
                    documents sought for <em>by way of classification</em> or
                    not, since O 24 r 5(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or
                        described in the application <b><em>or</em></b> any
                        class of document so specified or described is, or has at any time
                        been, in his possession, custody or power… [emphasis added in bold
                        italics].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Where specific discovery is sought for
                    compound documents, it <em>may not always</em> be practical
                    for the applicant to specifically set out each and every classification of
                    discrete documents sought for, especially where there are voluminous documents
                    within the compound documents. The benefits of achieving a certain degree of
                    specificity by classifying documents may not always outweigh the costs and time
                    expended in doing so when there are voluminous electronic documents. In this
                    regard, a <em>pragmatic</em> method to achieve a <em>meaningful</em> degree of specificity would be for parties to
                    describe the discrete documents sought to be discovered with reference to
                        <b>keyword search terms</b> (as I have ordered so in
                    the present case, see <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a> below), as well
                    as the custodians and repositories to run these search terms on. Parties would
                    have to accept a necessary degree of risk that some relevant documents would not
                    be caught by the search terms, while some irrelevant documents would be caught
                    by the terms. Once parties or the Court has determined the relevance of the
                    keyword search terms, there would be no further need to review the relevance of
                    the search results; see <em>Robin Duane Littau v Astrata (Asia
                        Pacific) Pte Ltd</em> [2011] SGHC 61 at [32]; while the party’s discovery
                    obligation is fulfilled (subject to all the requirements set out in the Rules of
                    Court) once the search has been carried out with the keyword searches; see
                        <em>Sanae Achar v Sci-Gen Ltd</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 87 at [23].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It should be evident from the discussion above
                    that there is no fixed method to ensure that the description of discrete
                    documents (within the compound document) is made with sufficient specificity, in
                    an application for compound documents. Indeed, just because an application for
                    specific discovery is made with a classification of the documents sought for, it
                    does not mean that that application will not be a fishing expedition. As in the
                    decision of <em>Wright Norman</em>, the application for a
                    further and better list of documents was dismissed as the <em>classification</em> of documents was <em>too
                        wide</em>. In this regard, whether the description of discrete
                    documents within a compound document is made with <em>sufficient
                        specificity</em> depends on the merits of each case. In the present
                    case, I have already set out at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above
                    the <em>specific</em> discrete documents that the plaintiff
                    is seeking for from the devices and I am convinced that the plaintiff’s
                    application is made with sufficient specificity. I should add that there can be
                    no excuse from the first defendant that it was unclear what were the discrete
                    documents sought for, given that the plaintiff’s position with regard to
                    the specific discrete documents at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>
                    above has been set out in the course of submissions before me, as well as at
                    paras [17] –
                    [40] of Tay’s affidavit dated
                    18 January 2011, read with paras [21]-[22] of the
                    plaintiff’s written submissions and para [27] of Tay’s affidavit dated 22 August
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is convenient to add at this juncture an
                    observation. The lack of a distinction between compound documents and discrete
                    documents in the present Rules of Court, correspond with the lack of an express
                    requirement that an applicant must seek discovery of the discrete documents
                    inside the compound documents, either before or at the same time when the
                    applicant seeks specific discovery of the compound document. As a matter of
                        <em>practical necessity</em>, I am of the view that
                    this should be the practice notwithstanding the present lack of such an express
                    requirement. After all, as stated above (at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>), the <em>essential</em>
                    “document” sought to be discovered is not the compound document
                    itself, but the discrete documents within the compound document. (I add here
                    parenthetically, that this is not an issue in the present case as both sides
                    have proceeded on the basis that the devices are sought to be discovered for the
                    purposes of inspecting and searching for relevant discrete files within the
                    devices).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The first defendant’s counsel, had, in
                    addition, submitted that (at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> of the
                    written submissions) the plaintiff cannot be allowed to trawl through the entire
                    devices to fish for evidence. This contention properly belongs to the question
                    of whether an inspection protocol should be implemented, which is dealt with in
                    the succeeding section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The implementation of an inspection protocol for inspection of
                compound documents (including computer databases, electronic media and recording
                devices) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Although the plaintiff acknowledges that an
                    application for inspection of computer databases, electronic media and recording
                    devices should generally include an inspection protocol (see plaintiff’s
                    written submissions at [35]), the
                    plaintiff submits that it should be allowed to inspect the devices in their
                    entirety, as keyword searches are unlikely to effectively capture relevant
                    information, such as drawings (see p 90 – 91 of Tay’s affidavit
                    dated 22 August 2011) and image files (see p 95 of Tay’s affidavit
                    dated 22 August 2011). Plaintiff’s counsel reiterated the same in the
                    course of submissions before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The analysis of whether a protocol <em>is required</em> for the inspection of compound documents
                    (including computer databases, electronic media and recording devices) would be
                    slightly different, depending on whether parties have agreed to
                    “opt-in” to Part IVA of the Supreme Court Electronic Practice
                    Directions, also known as the Practice Direction No 3 of 2009 (“PD
                    3/2009”). Where parties have agreed, either expressly or tacitly by
                    conduct, to apply PD 3/2009 to their discovery and inspection proceedings, the
                    requirement for an inspection protocol is <b><em>mandatory</em></b> for all applications for inspection under O 24
                    r 11(2). This is provided in paragraph 43F of PD 3/2009 which

                        protocol, which may take the form found in Appendix E Part 2, in order to
                        ensure that the party entitled to inspection has access only to electronic
                        documents that are necessary and <b><em>is not allowed to trawl

                        the power to review the adequacy of an inspection protocol and may make such

                            parties agree to for the purpose of conducting general discovery. In the

                            for, <em>inter alia</em>, safeguards against
                            unauthorised trawling (see above, <em>Alliance Management
                                SA v Pendelton Lane P</em>), inspection of electronic
                            documents and provision of copies of discoverable electronic documents
                            (see above, <em>Fermin Aldabe v Standard Chartered
                                Bank</em>). Bearing in mind that the court already has the
                            power to order that parties comply with a protocol, I do not think that
                            the construction of paragraph 43B(3) put forth by the Plaintiff should
                            be adopted. To do so would amount to saying that whereas before PD
                            3/2009 was issued, the court could make an order for parties to comply
                            with a protocol during discovery, it can no longer do so now in a
                            situation where parties cannot agree to adopt one. This tantamounts to
                            elevating PD 3/2009 to a rule-making function with the effect of
                            removing the court’s power to order compliance with a protocol in
                            a situation where there is no pre-existing agreement between parties to
                            adopt one…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    I prefer the construction put forth by the
                            Defendant. PD 3/2009 in effect establishes a procedure whereby parties
                            are required to make attempts to collaborate in good faith by engaging
                            in discussions of electronic discovery issues before an application may
                            be made under paragraph 43B. The opt-in nature of PD 3/2009 allows both
                            parties to agree not to apply these procedures whether expressly or
                            tacitly by conduct. Where one party wishes to make an application under
                            PD 3/2009, he must comply with the procedures set forth therein and he
                            must support his application with an affidavit providing an account of
                            efforts made in good faith collaboration as well as include a draft
                            electronic discovery protocol with his application. This construction
                            does not subtract from the court’s power to order compliance with
                            a protocol when discovery of electronically stored documents is ordered.
                            It also gives effect to the opt-in nature of PD 3/2009: unlike other
                            practice directions which apply to all cases, PD 3/2009 applies either
                            on mutual agreement of parties or when one party opts into the
                            electronic discovery framework by making an application
                            thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Rebuttable Presumption that an Inspection Protocol is necessary
                for inspection of compound documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Following from the holding in <em>Deutsche Bank</em>, it is evident that, as the Court’s
                        <em>powers</em> to order compliance with a protocol is
                        <em>not derived</em> from PD 3/2009, but is <em>independent</em> of it, it follows that the parties’
                    agreement not to adopt PD 3/2009 poses no fetter on this power to order a
                    protocol. The power to order a protocol would come to the fore in situations
                    when <em>compound documents</em> are sought to be <em>inspected</em>. As compound documents would, by their nature
                    as storage media, contain voluminous documents, it is likely that a significant
                    amount of irrelevant documents may be inspected in order to obtain a relatively
                    smaller amount of relevant documents. Further, a review of the compound document
                        <em>in its entirety</em> would, more often than not, be
                    intrusive and prejudicial to the interest of the party giving discovery in
                    protecting his confidential and privileged information. Sufficient safeguards
                    have to be implemented to prevent the requesting party from abusing the
                    discovery and inspection regime to gain collateral advantages that are
                    extraneous to the purposes of the litigation at hand (for example, to obtain
                    commercially valuable and sensitive documents in the compound document, where
                    the requesting party and the producing party are business competitors). In
                    essence, where a compound document is found to be indirectly relevant and hence
                    discoverable, that does not entitle the applicant to an <em>ipso
                        facto</em> right to inspect the <em>whole</em> of
                    the compound document. Barring an <em>exceptional</em>
                    case, it cannot be said that <em>all</em> the discrete
                    documents within the compound document are relevant and necessary to resolve the
                    pleaded issues. As such, it would ordinarily be necessary for the Court to set
                    parameters for the inspection and review of compound documents. To that end, in
                    so far as inspection of compound documents is concerned, there is a <em>rebuttable presumption</em> that an inspection protocol is
                    necessary to govern the process in which the inspection and searches will be
                    carried out. The effect of this presumption is two-fold; first, the <em>practical</em> application of such a presumption would mean
                    that an inspection protocol in the form of Appendix E, Part 2 of PD 3/2009
                        <b><em>will be implemented for all</em></b> inspection of
                    compound documents unless otherwise ordered by the Court (this necessarily
                    includes the processes following from inspection, such as forensic examination
                    of the compound document); second, the burden is on the party seeking inspection
                    of the compound document to convince the Court why an inspection protocol in the
                    form of Appendix E, Part 2 of PD 3/2009, should not be ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The <em>juridical</em>
                    basis of this presumption is grounded upon the three principles which are
                    indisputably integral to our law of Discovery: that of relevancy, necessity and
                    proportionality. The implementation of a protocol is meant to ensure, <em>as far as is practicable</em>, that the inspection and review
                    of the compound document is carried out to the extent where only discrete
                    documents (within the compound document) that are relevant and necessary for
                    disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs are searched,
                    reviewed, and obtained; the applicant is not <em>entitled</em> to anything beyond that extent. The protocol would also
                    ensure that the scope of inspection is <em>proportionate</em> to the time expended and the costs involved in
                    inspecting the documents; this is especially important given that the default
                    position for costs as set out in paragraph 43I of PD 3/2009 mandates that the
                    costs of inspection shall generally be borne by the party giving discovery.
                    Indeed, the Court in <em>Alliance Management</em> was alive
                    to the need to ensure that discovery is proportionate, where it was observed
                    that (at [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a distinction between the court's power to order
                        discovery of information contained in the Hard Disk and its discretion to
                        order production for the purposes of inspection. This crucial distinction
                        was captured succinctly by Vinelott J [in <em>Derby
                            &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon</em> (No 9) [1991] 1 WLR 652] at
                        652:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… the discretion to order production for inspection and copying
                            would not be exercised so as to give unrestricted access to the other
                            party's computer, and inspection would be ordered only to the extent
                            that the party seeking it could satisfy the court that it was necessary
                            for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, it is clear from the passage quoted above that the burden is on the
                        requesting party to establish that inspection of the documents is necessary
                        for disposing fairly the cause or matter, or for saving costs. Second, and
                        this follows from the first proposition, the inquiry in respect of the
                        production of the documents for inspection is a far more intricate one
                        involving judicial balancing of the competing interests of the parties; ie,
                        the requesting party's right to reasonable access to documents that are
                        necessary to conduct his case without unduly burdening the other party in
                        terms of time and expense and to prevent unauthorised "trawling" through the
                        database. A protocol has to be put in place to ensure that the requesting
                        party only has access to inspect documents that are found to be necessary
                        for the conduct of his case and is not allowed to trawl through the entire
                        database on the guise of an inspection order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Although the holding in <em>Alliance Management</em> that a protocol should be implemented was
                    made on the facts of that case, the basis on which the Court came to that
                    decision, which is that of ensuring that the inspection is proportionate, would
                    arguably apply to the general situation whenever inspection is sought of a
                    compound document. At this juncture, it is profitable to explore the position
                    taken in other jurisdictions concerning the extent to which inspection of
                    compound documents are allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A survey across different jurisdictions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The USA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The need to impose safeguards to limit the
                    scope of inspection of compound documents, in maintaining proportionate
                    discovery, is evident in other jurisdictions. The judicial attitude in <em>Alliance Management</em> is aligned with that expressed in
                    the US decisions, where a consistent approach has been adopted in implementing
                    some protocols and limitations when compound documents are sought to be
                    inspected. This is seen in the case of <em>In Re Ford Motor
                        Company</em>, 345 F. 3d 1315 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir.
                    2003), where the US Court of Appeals (Eleventh Circuit) set aside the inspection
                    order granted by the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the
                    inspection order was granted to the plaintiff to inspect Ford Motor’s
                        <em>databases</em> to search for technical information
                    of seatbelt buckles in vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor) on, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>the ground that there
                        were no (as there should have been) protocols imposed</em> to restrict
                    the scope of inspection. Having accepted Ford Motor’s argument that the
                    plaintiff should not be granted “<em>free
                        access</em> to the databases regardless of relevance, privilege or
                    confidentiality”, the Court of Appeals held, in setting aside the
                    inspection order (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…in its order, the district court granted [the plaintiff]
                        unlimited, direct access to Ford’s databases. <b><em>The
                            district court established no protocols for the search</em></b>. The
                        court did not even designate search terms to restrict the search. Without
                        constraints, the order grants [the plaintiff] access to information that
                        would not and should not otherwise be discoverable…[emphasis added in
                        bold italics].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In the recent decision of <em>Lorentz v Sunshine Health Products., Inc</em>., 2010 WL 1856265 (S.D.
                    Fla. May 10, 2010), the Court found that a request to inspect a computer hard
                    drive and a database in their entirety was “per se overboard and unduly
                    burdensome <em>when balanced against</em> the need [for
                    inspection]”. The Court emphasized upon the need to implement a <b><em>protocol</em></b> to obtain data in a measured manner (at
                        [2]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a showing can be made that a particular hard drive should be inspected
                        for relevant data by an expert computer technician, <em>with

                            non-responsive data</em>, then the Court can grant such relief
                        [the request for inspection] if the showing was compelling enough.</p>

                    Proctor &amp; Gamble (“P&amp;G”) sued its competitors for
                    spreading defamatory rumours about its products and obtained an order to inspect
                    one of the defendant’s computer databases for documents that would contain
                    potentially defamatory information; the Court decided (at Part D) that <b><em>limitations</em></b> would have to be placed on the <b><em>scope</em></b> of inspection, to prevent P&amp;G from obtaining
                    “general commercial or competitive information”, or a volume of
                    documentation that “would be so extensive as to render the search
                    unwieldy for any purpose legitimately within the current framework of the
                    litigation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In another recent decision, <em>Covad Communications Company v Revonet, Inc</em>., 258 F.R.D. 5
                    (D.D.C. 2009), the plaintiff employer sued an agent company (“the
                    agent”) on the allegation that it expropriated information that belonged
                    to the employer. The employer obtained the Court’s sanction to inspect the
                    agent’s computer database and servers to search for commercial information
                    that allegedly belonged to the employer which was allegedly forwarded to
                    third-party customers. When the parties failed to reach an agreement on the
                    implementation of an <em>inspection protocol</em> of the
                    database and computer servers (as the agent refused to accept the protocol
                    proposed by the employer, which had included the requirement to do a forensic
                    imaging of the database and servers), the Court exercised its discretion
                        <em>to impose one</em>, in the interest to save the
                    time and costs required for inspection. In particular, the Court was of the view
                    that the inspection protocol, which required the taking of a forensic imaging of
                    the agent’s database and servers, would ensure that the inspection is
                    carried out more expeditiously and is less intrusive to the agent’s daily
                    business operations; the Court further implemented in the protocol limitations
                    to the inspection and searches to reduce undue burden on the defendant
                    agent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The expense associated with taking a forensic image is small compared with
                        the cost of the forensic search itself and provides both parties and the
                        Court with the best possible present depository of the crucial information
                        in the database. The process [of forensic imaging] is obviously not as time
                        consuming as the forensic search itself and lessens some of the cost of
                        forensic searching since the search can be done off-site rather than on the
                        premises housing the severs or computers. Any interference with business
                        operations will be insignificant because I will require the searching to be
                        done over a weekend…Creating a forensic image is no more burdensome
                        than using the server for everyday business activities and may ultimately
                        benefit [the defendant agent] by creating a forensic record of its data
                        before it uploads its data onto new servers…For those reasons, [the
                        defendant agent] shall permit [the computer expert] to make forensic images
                        of [the database and servers]…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The searches will be done on copies of the forensic images, so the servers
                        themselves will not be affected after the initial copies are made. The
                        search will be conducted on the weekend and concerns about confidentiality
                        can be easily alleviated through a protective order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…while the issues at stake in this commercial controversy may be of
                        no interest to anyone but these litigants, they still have a right to its
                            <em>speedy and just conclusion</em>, which, in my
                        view, will be advanced by the forensic imaging.</p>

                    regime, and applies not only to inspection, but also to “standard
                    disclosure”, which is the English modified version of our general
                    discovery rule in O 24 r 1. Paragraph 2 of Practice Direction Part 31A
                    of the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR Pt 31A”) provides:</p>

                        It may, for example, be reasonable to decide not to search for documents
                        coming into existence before some particular date, or to limit the search to
                        documents in some particular place or places, or to documents falling into

                        be made will depend on the circumstances of the case including, in

                        those systems. For example, it may be reasonable to decide not to search for
                        documents coming into existence before a particular date, or to limit the
                        search to documents in a particular place or places, or to documents falling

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23. In some cases a staged approach may be appropriate, with disclosure

                    party has the right or duty to withhold inspection (Rule 31.3, CPR). Where the
                    applicant is of the view that the standard disclosure is inadequate, an
                    application for specific disclosure and specific inspection can be made,

                    CPR, and paragraph 5.1 to 5.5, PD Pt 31A). The producing party can state its
                    objection to the inspection on the ground that to do so would be <em>disproportionate to the issues in the case</em> (Rule
                    31.3(2), CPR):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In perhaps one of the most well-known judicial
                    observations made on the principle of proportionality, it was said in <em>Digicel (St Lucia) Ltd v Cable and Wireless plc</em>
                    [2008] EWHC 2522 (ch), [2008] All ER (D) 226 (Ch) (“<em>Digicel</em>”) that (per Justice Morgan at [46]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…it must be remembered that what is generally required by an order
                        for standard disclosure is a “reasonable search” for relevant
                        documents. Thus, the rules do not require that no stone should be left
                        unturned. This may mean that a relevant document, even “a smoking
                        gun” is not found. This attitude is justified by considerations of
                        proportionality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Courts have taken a robust attitude in
                    ensuring that the scope of the search remains reasonable and proportionate. In
                    clarifying that the task of ensuring the scope of the search is reasonable
                    remains within the province of the Court, notwithstanding a solicitor’s
                    informed decision that the search was indeed so, it was observed that (<em>Digicel</em> at [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is right that the decision as to what is a reasonable search rests in
                        the first instance with the solicitor in charge of the disclosure exercise.
                        However, the Practice Direction makes clear that some parts at least of the
                        process ought to be discussed with the opposing solicitor with a view to
                        achieving agreement so as to eliminate, or at any rate reduce, the risk of
                        later dispute. If a solicitor, whose decision as to what is a reasonable
                        search is later challenged on a specific disclosure application, the Court
                        may well be influenced, in the solicitor's favour, if it sees that the
                        solicitor was very fully informed as to the issues arising in the case, and
                        had made a fully considered decision applying all the factors in Rule 31.7
                        and paragraph 2A.4 of the Practice Direction. However, even if the Court
                        can, in a proper case, be favourably influenced by the diligence and
                        conscientiousness of an individual solicitor, in my judgment, the task of
                        deciding what is required by a reasonable search is a task given to the
                        Court by the wording of the Rules. This task can be carried out by the Court
                        either in advance of the search being done or with hindsight, where a search
                        has been carried out and its extent is challenged by the other party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The well-known “smoking gun”
                    reference made in <em>Digicel</em> (at [46]), is to some extent inspired by (as
                    credited by Justice Morgan himself at [46] of <em>Digicel</em>) the illuminating
                    but not wholly uncontroversial observations made by Lord Justice Jacob in
                        <em>Nichia Corporation v Argos Limited</em> [2007] EWCA
                    Civ 741 at [50] –
                    [51] (“<em>Nichia
                        Corporation</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is more to be said about the change to standard disclosure and
                        indeed to the express introduction of proportionality into the rules of
                        procedure. "Perfect justice" in one sense involves a tribunal examining
                        every conceivable aspect of a dispute. All relevant witness and all relevant
                        documents need to be considered. And each party must be given a full
                        opportunity of considering everything and challenging anything it wishes. No
                        stone, however small, should remain unturned. Even the adversarial system at
                        its most expensive in this country has not gone that far. For instance we do
                        not include the evidence of a potentially material witness if neither side
                        calls him or her. Nor do we allow pre-trial oral disclosure from all
                        potential witnesses as is (or at least was) commonly the practice in the
                        US.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But a system which sought such "perfect justice" in every case would
                        actually defeat justice. The cost and time involved would make it impossible
                        to decide all but the most vastly funded cases. The cost of nearly every
                        case would be greater than what it is about. Life is too short to
                        investigate everything in that way. So a compromise is made: one makes do
                        with a lesser procedure even though it may result in the justice being
                        rougher. Putting it another way, better justice is achieved by risking a
                        little bit of injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Such a robust judicial attitude in ensuring
                    that the discovery is proportionate, and the scope of search remains reasonable,
                    has transposed into a cautious attitude in granting inspection and searches of
                        <em>compound</em> documents; as can be seen in the
                    decision of <em>Fiddes v Channel 4 TV Corporation and
                        another</em> [2010] EWCA Civ 516, where the Court of Appeal dismissed
                    an application to inspect the defendant’s IT system’s backup tapes
                    in search for relevant emails and email attachments, on the ground that the
                    costs and burden of the search and inspection would be disproportionate to the
                    likely benefits, especially where the issues can be resolved on the
                    contemporaneous (hardcopy) documents (at [19], endorsing the observations of the High Court at [20] –
                    [21]) :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is a matter of great concern that the costs of this libel
                        action should have reached the figures that they have. By reference to that
                        figure, Mr Sherborne for the appellant is able to say that a sum of the
                        order of £10,000 is hardly significant. Indeed, as I observed in the
                        course of submissions, it may well be that the cost of this application
                        exceed that figure, but that is not the right approach. On that basis, there
                        would be little ground for attempting to limit costs in libel actions at
                        all... On any view, the total cost of this action illustrate the general
                        public concern as to the cost of libel actions. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In this case, it is a matter of speculation whether the search that he
                        requests I order would produce anything relevant, and if it did, whether it
                        would help the Claimant's case or undermine it. <em>There
                            will undoubtedly be cases where retrieving and searching back up tapes
                            will be a proportionate exercise in a libel action. But in this case, it
                            seems to me, that the issues in the action will be most likely to be
                            resolved on the contemporaneous documents</em> that have been

                    documents) covered by the search, limiting the search only to files that have a
                    direct bearing on the material issues in dispute, allowing searches of backup
                    tapes from particular points in time only, and disallowing the application to
                    restore the first defendant’s entire email database.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In one of earlier decisions before the
                    standard disclosure regime was introduced into the CPR, and when the principle
                    of proportionality was <em>not expressly stated</em> in the
                    Rules, Vinelott J was already acutely aware of the need to limit inspection of
                    compound documents to the extent where it is necessary to do so, in <em>Derby &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon (No 9)</em> [1991] 1 W.L.R. 652,
                    when, in considering the extent of inspection allowed of a computer database, it
                    was observed that (at p 652, 659 – 659):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the defendants were not entitled to unrestricted access to [the]
                        computer database (so far as the information recorded on it is relevant to
                        the issues in the action and does not fall within the scope of any privilege
                        from production). The court has a discretion as to the extent to which
                        inspection and copying of documents disclosed on discovery is to be
                        permitted …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Even when the relevant material is on-line and capable of being
                        shown on screen or print out, some means will have to be found of screening
                        out irrelevant or privileged material. The party seeking discovery cannot be
                        allowed simply to seat himself at his opponent's computer console and be
                        provided with all necessary access keys…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the court has a discretion whether to order production and
                        inspection and that the burden is on the party seeking inspection to satisfy
                        the court that it is necessary for disposing fairly of the case or cause or
                        matter or for saving costs. At that point the court will have to consider,
                        if necessary in the light of expert evidence, what information is or can be
                        made available, how far it is necessary for there to be inspection or
                        copying of the original document (the database) or whether the provision of
                        printouts or hard copy is sufficient, and what safeguards should be
                        incorporated to avoid damage to the database and to minimise interference
                        with everyday use if inspection is ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Canada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Sedona Canada Principles (<em>the Sedona Principles</em>), which consolidates a number of
                    principles and best practices on electronic discovery, was released
                    in January 2008 amidst a “growing recognition throughout Canada that
                    electronically stored information poses new problems and complications for
                    litigants, their counsel, and the judiciary” (see Foreword of <em>the Sedona Principles</em>). As with the US and England,
                    there is an overriding emphasis on the principle of proportionality, which
                    applies to “any proceedings” undertaken in the whole discovery
                    process. As Principle 2 provides (arguably the <em>first</em> principle of the <em>Sedona
                        Principles</em> given that Principle 1 relates to the technical
                    aspects of what is discoverable):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any proceeding, the parties should ensure that steps taken in the
                        discovery process are proportionate, taking into account (i) the nature and
                        scope of the litigation, including the importance and complexity of the
                        issues, interest and amounts at stake; (ii) the relevance of the available
                        electronically stored information; (iii) its importance to the court’s
                        adjudication in a given case; and (iv) the costs, burden and delay that may
                        be imposed on the parties to deal with electronically stored
                        information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Describing this Principle as a “rule of
                    proportionality”, the commentary to this Principle (see p 11 of <em>the Sedona Principles</em>) makes the following
                    caution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The widespread use of computers and the internet has created vast amounts
                        of electronically stored information, making the cost and burden of
                        discovery exponentially greater than it was in the “paper”
                        world…Litigants should take a practical and efficient approach to
                        electronic discovery, and should ensure that the burden of discovery remains
                        proportionate to the issues, interests, and money at stake. Without a
                        measured approach, overwhelming electronic discovery costs may prevent the
                        fair resolution of litigation disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Sedona Principles
                        (2<sup>nd</sup> ed) reminds the Courts and parties, that in
                    determining the proportionate extent of discovery and inspection to be given, a
                        <em>broader</em> perspective of “costs”
                    should be adopted, in order to have a fuller understanding of the burdens
                    involved in the whole discovery and inspection process (Comment 2b.):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Costs [of discovery and inspection] cannot be calculated solely in terms
                        of the expense of computer technicians to retrieve the data[,] but must
                        factor in other litigation costs, including the interruption and disruption
                        of routine business processes and the costs of reviewing the information.
                        Moreover, burdens on information technology personnel and the resources
                        required to review documents for relevance, privilege, confidentiality and
                        privacy should be considered in any calculus of whether to allow discovery
                        [and inspection], and if so, under what terms….Evaluating the need to
                        produce electronically stored information often requires that a balance be
                        struck between the burdens and need for electronically stored information,
                        taking into account the technological feasibility and realistic costs
                        involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The <em>Sedona
                        Principles</em> have greatly influenced the rules of electronic
                    discovery across the provinces in Canada. For example, an independent set of
                    rules dedicated to e-discovery based on <em>the Sedona
                        Principles</em> were created in the Nova Scotia jurisdiction, under
                    Rule 16 of the Nova Scotia Annotated Civil Procedure Rules. The principle of
                    proportionality advocated in the Sedona Principles is aligned with the Ontario
                    E-Discovery Guidelines released by the Ontario Bar Association’s Discovery
                    Task Force in 2005, a document that aims to be a “best practices”
                    manual to address the discovery of electronic documents. The Guidelines provides
                    that the scope of <em>search</em> must be reasonable, at at
                    p 10:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The scope of the searches required for relevant electronic data and
                        documents must be reasonable. It is neither reasonable nor feasible to
                        require that litigants immediately or always canvass all potential sources
                        of electronic documents in the course of locating, preserving and producing
                        them in the recovery process. Some sources may contain largely duplicate
                        documents or redundant information and data. Others may contain few if any
                        relevant documents, together with massive amounts of data that is not
                        relevant to the litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Indeed, Ontario has a robust procedural regime
                    in ensuring that the scope of inspection of documents remains proportionate.
                    Rule 29.1 of Ontario’s Rules of Civil Procedure requires parties to agree
                    upon a discovery plan; the Model Discovery Plan released by the Ontario
                    e-Discovery implementation committee provides a section (at paragraph 9) for
                    parties to confer and agree upon the parameters of any search required to be
                    done, based on categories such as the geographical location of the
                    electronically stored information, the custodian, the specific compound document
                    (the data storage system), the file type, date range, and search terms to be
                    agreed by parties. Parties can state at paragraph 9.1 the parameters which they
                    were unable to agree upon, and place it before the Court for directions. In
                    addition, Part V of the Ontario annotated e-Discovery checklist requires parties
                    to decide upon the reviewing software required to undertake the search; the
                    suggested software includes culling software to filter out irrelevant documents,
                    de-duplication software to reduce time and costs of the search, and litigation
                    case management software tools to code and segregate records as relevant,
                    irrelevant or privileged. Paragraph 6 and 7 of Part V requires parties to review
                    the documents for relevance and privilege, as well to redact, where appropriate,
                    privileged or confidential documents. Furthermore, parties are required to use
                    the Proportionality Chart (Document Production), a standard form that parties
                    are required to fill in, which includes a description on the relative importance
                    and complexity of the legal issues involved, and the relief sought (the Model
                    Discovery Plan, annotated e-Discovery checklist, and Proportionality Chart can

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In line with such best practices and
                    procedural regime to keep discovery and inspection proportionate, the Canadian
                    Courts have shown a consistently reserved approach towards allowing the
                    inspection of compound documents in their entirety. In Ontario, in the case of
                    Dulong v Consumer Packaging Inc., (2000) O.J. 161 (Q.L.), (January 21, 2000,
                    Ontario Master), an application to inspect the defendant’s entire computer
                    database to search for relevant emails was dismissed by the Court on the ground
                    that “having regard to the extent of the defendant’s business
                    operations, [the inspection and search would] be such a massive undertaking as
                    to be oppressive”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In a landmark decision by the Alberta Court of
                    Appeal, in <em>Innovative Health Group Inc. v Calgary Health
                        Region</em>, 2008 ABCA 219, the Court, in setting aside the case
                    management judge’s decision to have the plaintiff’s computer hard
                    drives to be produced for inspection in its entirety, held that it will take an
                    exceptional case for a compound document (such as a hard drive) to be produced
                    for inspection <em>in specie</em>; and further held that
                    even if a compound document was produced for inspection, there must be
                    sufficient safeguards imposed to limit the scope of inspection allowed to
                    prevent the disclosure of irrelevant material (at [33], [38], [39] and [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A computer hard drive is a computer disc, with a large storage capacity,
                        upon which information is stored. It is, however, a mixed storage facility
                        that contains such things as program files, metadata, and enabling software
                        that allows the computer to run and to interpret the encoded data. By its
                        very nature, therefore, a computer hard drive will inevitably contain a good
                        deal of stored data that is neither relevant nor material to the lawsuit.
                        Moreover, due to the ubiquitous nature of computers in modern society, the
                        hard drive will often have a great deal of information or data stored upon
                        it that is not only irrelevant and immaterial to the lawsuit, but
                        information that is private or confidential and ought not to be produced. It
                        follows that it will be an exceptional case when a computer hard drive is
                        producible in specie.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A computer hard drive, being a mixed storage facility, like a diary, is
                        not producible <em>in specie</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I acknowledge there may be cases where it is appropriate for a judge to
                        order production of an entire hard drive for inspection…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…in circumstances where … the court deems it appropriate to
                        order production of a hard drive, <em>measures should be
                            taken to protect disclosure of irrelevant and immaterial information
                            which the producing party objects to produce</em>. Although
                        litigation confidentiality exists, many times that will not be sufficient to
                        protect personal, confidential and private material. A judge should always
                        hear representations as to how information that is neither material nor
                        relevant can be protected from exposure, and frame any production order in
                        the least intrusive manner. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The same cautious attitude towards producing
                    compound documents for inspection in its entirety is observed in the province of
                    British Columbia. In <em>Park v Mullen</em>, 2005 BCSC
                    1813, the defendant’s application to inspect the plaintiff’s
                    personal computers and laptops in their entirety was dismissed by the Supreme
                    Court of British Columbia as the burden of such inspection outweighs its likely
                    benefits, in view that the documents sought from the devices “would have
                    little, if any, probative value” (see paragraph [24]). In <em>Baldwin Janzen
                        Insurance Services (2004) Ltd. v Janzen</em>, 2006 BCSC 554, the
                    plaintiff’s application for the defendant’s hard disk drives to be
                    produced in their entirety for the production of mirror image copies for
                    forensic analysis was dismissed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, as the
                    Court was of the view that, since there was little evidence that such a process
                    would result in the finding of relevant material, and in view of the high costs
                    of such a process; the production of the hard disk drives in their entirety was
                    not justified (at [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not appropriate to order the production of the mirror image HDD
                        [(hard disk drives)] simply because it exists and because there is
                        interesting technology that one might apply to it.... Nor is it sufficient
                        that the plaintiff is willing to pay what would likely be a great deal of
                        money to have its expert search the HDD, with the cost of the search to be
                        assessed as a disbursement at the end of the case. Without some indication
                        that the application of the interesting technology might result in relevant
                        and previously undisclosed documents … the avoidance of unnecessary
                        and onerous expense militate against allowing such a search merely because
                        it can be done.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In the clearest signal that the Australian
                    jurisdiction is endorsing the principle of proportionality in limiting the scope
                    of discovery, the Federal Court of Australia released Practice Note CM 5 on 1
                    August 2011 (“CM 5”), where it provides that (at para [3]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In determining whether to make any order for discovery, the Court will
                        have regard to the issues in the case and the order in which they are likely
                        to be resolved, the resources and circumstances of the parties, the likely
                        benefit of discovery and the likely cost of discovery and whether that cost

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Under CM 5, parties are required to satisfy
                    the court on whether the discovery is necessary to facilitate the just
                    resolution of the proceedings, and if so, for what purpose is the discovery
                    necessary, and whether the stated purpose can be achieved by a less expensive
                    means of discovery. At paragraph 2.1 of Practice Note CM 6, parties are required
                    to have regard to limiting the scope of discovery as far as practicable in order
                    to minimise the time and costs associated with the identification, analysis and

                    a forensic software tool, to search and identify the databases and tapes for any
                    unauthorised sound recordings. The Federal Court of Australia emphasized upon an
                    acute problem with compound documents – as the relevant discrete files,
                    irrelevant discrete files, and privileged and confidential discrete files, all
                    of them within the compound document, cannot be readily segregated, there is a
                    huge risk that a huge amount of irrelevant and privileged discrete files will be
                    recovered along with relevant discrete files (see [62] and [67]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence … persuades me that if his techniques, including the
                        application of EnCase, are used, some relevant material is likely to be
                        recovered but such recovery will include a great deal of extraneous and
                        irrelevant material, some of which may be privileged or subject to
                        confidentiality obligations and cannot be readily segregated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of electronic records such as hard drives, CD ROMs or backup
                        tapes[,] the evidence does not indicate that there is any possibility of
                        segregation or "masking out" of information for protection, confidentiality,
                        privacy or non-disclosure as in the case of hard copy material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In addition, the Federal Court was concerned
                    with ensuring that the producing party had a proper opportunity to do a
                    privilege review (at [67]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the usual discovery process the first stage is that respondents make
                        what they contend is appropriate discovery on oath and claim privilege or
                        confidentiality in so doing where this is appropriate. This is usually done
                        with legal advice and often after consulting other persons as to whether
                        they seek to claim of privilege or confidentiality. Where an applicant then
                        claims that full discovery has not been made or that particular or further
                        discovery is necessary an application can be made to the Court. ... If the
                        procedure envisaged by the applicants is adopted without any modification,
                        whereby all documents extracted … are discovered and made available
                        for inspection, this important process with its protections will be
                        by-passed because there will be no opportunity to make such claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Notably, the process of privilege review is
                    provided for in our own inspection protocol in paragraph 3(b) of Appendix E,
                    Part 2 of the PD 3/2009. Even though the Australian Federal Court does not have
                    the same, the Court saw it fit to impose a protocol to govern the inspection
                    process (at [68]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the appropriate discovery process in this case should be along the
                        following lines. First, if an undertaking is given as to strict
                        non-disclosure and confidentiality by [the applicant], or some other person
                        performing the exercise referred to in his evidence, then access could be
                        given to all the preserved records to search using the EnCase program
                        directed to obtaining all material which can be extracted using that method.
                        Second, [the applicant] or the person carrying out this exercise, which can
                        be done under the supervision of the University, should make a copy of the
                        information so extracted and this should be given to the respondents and
                        their legal representatives. Third, having regard to that information the
                        respondents should have the opportunity to seek legal advice and consult
                        with third parties to see if they have any claims for privilege or
                        confidentiality... Fourth, after such discovery is given the applicants
                        should be afforded an opportunity to inspect the documents so
                        discovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As is evident from the discussion above, the
                    different common law jurisdictions of the USA, England, Canada and Australia are
                    converging upon a common meeting point; that of awarding greater emphasis to the
                    principle of proportionality. Amongst the many specific applications of this
                    principle, the cases and rules discussed above have shown that there is a clear
                    and undeniable international trend to restrict inspection of compound documents.
                    The Courts of various jurisdictions are observed to be reluctant to allow
                    inspection of compound documents in their entirety, and would not hesitate to
                    impose safeguards to ensure that the scope of inspection remains proportionate
                    and reasonable. The position in Singapore would be similar. Indeed, even if our
                    Order 24 and PD 3/2009 does not <em>expressly</em> endorse
                    the principle of proportionality (unlike in the US and England as provided in
                    their Rules, Canada in their best practices guides, and Australia in the
                    practice notes), that does not mean that the principle of proportionality is
                    applied with any less vigour in our jurisdiction’s electronic discovery
                    regime (see <em>Alliance Management</em>, <em>Sane Achar v Sci-Gen Ltd</em> [2011] SGHC 87 at
                        [23]; <em>Robin Duane
                        Littau v Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd</em> [2011] SGHC 61
                    at [17]). In this regard, the
                    application of the presumption stated at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above would be a clear indication that our jurisdiction
                    too, does give due credence to the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The implementation of an inspection protocol</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is important to emphasize that, in
                    implementing an inspection protocol, Appendix E, Part 2 of PD 3/2009 would only
                    be a <b><em>default</em></b> starting position which can be
                    customized to suit the precise needs of the specific case at hand, upon
                    parties’ agreement or the Court’s directions. As emphasized in
                        <em>Nichia Corporation</em> at [53], the principle of proportionality
                    requires that the procedure to be adopted be tailored to the size of the
                    dispute. For instance, in some cases, the inspection may be handled
                    expeditiously with the use of special software such as de-duplicating software,
                    data sampling software, or predictive coding software. In other cases, a more
                    basic protocol would suffice, to ensure that the costs of using the
                    technological tools for inspection remain proportionate to the amounts at stake
                    in the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Although the applicant’s burden to
                    convince the Court that a protocol is <em>not</em> required
                    will not be discharged easily, there may be instances where a protocol is not
                    clearly required; for example, where it is undisputed that the compound document
                    contains only a <em>handful</em> of electronic documents
                    (as the compound document is newly purchased, for example). In such cases, it
                    would actually be more costly and time consuming to impose a protocol. A
                    significant caveat to this however, can be found in <em>Deutsche
                        Bank</em> at [25], where the
                    Court gave a reminder of instances where forensic examination of a compound
                    document is required (and hence a protocol is necessary) even where the
                    documents in the compound document are not voluminous. Another example where a
                    protocol may not be required is when parties expressly agree that a protocol is
                    not required. However, this again requires a caveat. The parties’ express
                    agreement not to implement a protocol is subject to the Court’s oversight;
                    the Court will be inclined to order a protocol notwithstanding the
                    parties’ agreement not to have one, if the inspection of the whole
                    compound document <em>without a protocol</em> would impede
                    the expeditious disposal of the matter. It goes without saying, that the
                    presumption that a protocol is necessary, will not be rebutted by a <em>mere assertion</em> that the proposed protocol (usually the
                    one in Appendix E, Part 2), is <em>unworkable</em>. In
                        <em>Louis Vuitton Malletier. S.A. v Akanoc Solutions,
                        Inc</em>., 2009 WL 1312898 (N.D. Cal. May 12, 2009) Docket #124, it
                    was observed that a party’s mere assertion that the proposed inspection
                    protocol is technically unworkable, without any supporting evidence, such as an
                    affidavit (or in California, a “declaration”) from a computer
                    expert, is insufficient to persuade the court that a protocol should not be
                    implemented (at p 3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the current (and ongoing) stumbling block to this discovery is
                        that defendants continue to insist that producing the ordered material is
                        impossible. Defence counsel says that he spoke to various forensic experts
                        who reportedly told him that they did not know of a way to conduct a server
                        search that “distinguishes between private information and publically
                            [<em>sic</em>] available contents stored on
                        Defendants’ Internet servers”…Defendant, however, has
                        not provided this court with any expert declarations to aid in the
                        determination of this motion, and defence counsel’s hearsay
                        pronouncements about the opinions of unnamed individuals ring
                        hollow…[the] defendants simply maintain (without proof) that any
                        proposed inspection will be unworkable…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In the present case, the parties have not
                    agreed to opt in to PD 3/2009. The plaintiff submits that the protocol in
                    Appendix E, Part 2 should not be imposed, and that it should be allowed to
                    inspect the devices in their entirety, as keyword searches (as imposed by the
                    protocol) are unlikely to effectively capture relevant information pertaining to
                    the plaintiff’s claim, such as drawings and image files. In the absence of
                    any technical evidence from a computer expert to support this mere assertion, I
                    am not convinced that the plaintiff has sufficient grounds to rebut the
                    presumption that a protocol is necessary in the present case. There is no excuse
                    for not adducing at the very least an affidavit from a computer expert to
                    support the plaintiff’s assertion, in view that the plaintiff has already
                    adduced an affidavit dated 15 September 2011 by Mr Lew Tze Yeong, someone with
                    expertise in computer forensics to give evidence on some other technical matter
                    (in particular, to give an interim report on the forensic investigation results
                    done on the plaintiff’s desktop computer which was formerly used by the
                    first defendant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The fact that there are difficulties in
                    capturing some relevant material with the use of keyword searches, such as image
                    files and drawings, does not mean that the need to ensure that the inspection
                    remains proportionate disappears. Neither does it justify the abandonment of the
                    whole protocol. It only means that the protocol in Appendix E, Part 2 should be
                    modified to reduce the chances of missing out on relevant evidence in the form
                    of drawings and image files. For image files with typewritten words, such as the
                    blueprint image at p 95 of Tay’s affidavit dated 22 August 2011, where the
                    words “SENTOSA COVE. BT30-1 MATERIAL LAYOUT PLAN” are typewritten
                    right below the image, parties can consider the use of Optical Character
                    Recognition technology (“OCR”) to translate the scanned images,
                    including the typewritten words, into an encoded text, before conducting the
                    search with keyword search terms (such as “SENTOSA COVE”) to
                    identify the typewritten words found within these image files. For image files
                    with handwritten words, and drawings with handwritten words (such as the ones at
                    pp 90 – 91 of Tay’s affidavit dated 22 August 2011), parties can
                    conduct the necessary search and inspection by way of a phased approach. For
                    example, in the first phase, the plaintiff can identify a class of documents
                    containing such drawings by keyword searches; the identification can be made
                    with the use of several categories, such as the file name, the file format
                    (image files formats such as FPEG, BMP, TIFF etc), and the metadata (such as the
                    date range in which the drawings were created, and/or modified). The search
                    index can be calibrated with the use of one or a combination these categories.
                    In the second phase, where the search results are produced from the preliminary
                    search with the use of keyword searches (and a search engine) framed in
                    accordance with one or a combination of such categories, the plaintiff can
                    conduct a manual search of this specific set of search results with the presence
                    of the first defendant or his solicitors. With regard to the rest of the
                    discrete electronic documents, including emails and email attachments, there are
                    no objections (as there should not be) to the use of keyword search terms to
                    recover relevant and necessary discrete files.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In my view, Surface Stone’s attempt to
                    inspect and review compound documents manually, (instead of having a protocol in
                    the form Appendix E, Part 2) to search for relevant and necessary discrete
                    documents, is akin to an attempt to <em>sift through</em> a
                    sand-pile with one’s <em>bare hands</em> in search
                    for some precious gems that lay buried within (there are strong grounds to
                    believe that such “gems” lay within the sand-pile, but parties are
                        <em>unclear where exactly within</em> the sand-pile are
                    those gems located). In the midst of sifting through, one’s hopes may be
                    raised every now and then as one touches some stone-like object, only to find
                    out that they are holding on to dull rocks when the sand uncovers. To save time
                    and reduce costs, technology in the form of search engines and keyword search
                    terms act as a filtering mechanism to sieve out the sand (and dull stones) from
                    the gems necessary for trial. As the search index is calibrated, and the keyword
                    search terms defined and modified with further precision to ensure that utmost
                    relevance is achieved as far as is practicable, the filtering mechanism would in
                    turn become more accurate such that more gems and less stones are obtained. In
                    this regard, a protocol in the form of Appendix E, Part 2, would be taken as
                        <em>necessary</em> for <em>all</em> inspection of compound documents, unless it is shown to be
                    otherwise by the applicant (see <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     For the above reasons, the application for
                    discovery and inspection of the Toshiba laptop and the Western Digital hard disk
                    is allowed. The application for discovery and inspection of the iPhone is
                    dismissed. The inspection protocol in Appendix E, Part 2 of PD 3/2009 shall
                    apply. Parties are to meet and discuss on (i) the appointment of a joint
                    computer expert and (ii) the keyword search terms and phrases to be used in the
                    search. Parties shall attend before me within a week from this decision, (with
                    liberty to apply for an extension of time if required), to provide an update
                    (and if necessary, to resolve any disagreement) on (i) and (ii), as well as to
                    propose any modifications to the inspection protocol if necessary. I will hear
                    parties’ submissions on costs on a later date.</p>
