<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application for summary judgment
                    pursuant to O 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Rules”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendants in this action, Tan Boon Hwa
                    (“Tan”) and Norieta B Galuga (“Norieta”)
                    (collectively, “the Vendors”), are the owners of a Housing
                    Development Board (“HDB”) flat known as Block 195 Kim Keat Avenue
                    #11-342 Singapore 310195 (“the Property”). The Vendors granted the
                    plaintiffs, Wong Chee Siong and Koo Chooi Ling (collectively, “the
                    Purchasers”), an option to purchase the Property for the price of
                    $402,000 (“the Option”). In consideration of the Option, the
                    Purchasers paid the Vendors an option fee of $1,000 (“the Option
                    Fee”). The Option was dated 29 June 2009 and it was to be exercised
                    by the Purchasers on or before 13 July 2009. The Option was in the standard
                    form for the sale and purchase of HDB flats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On or about 9 July 2009, the Purchasers
                    exercised the Option by paying the Vendors a sum of $2,000 and signing the
                    acceptance form that was enclosed with the Option. According to clause 5.2
                    of the Option, the Option and the acceptance form signed by the Purchasers
                    formed a binding contract for the sale and purchase of the Property. The signing
                    was witnessed by one Chin Hwa Huat of C&amp;H Realty Pte Ltd. A valid and
                    binding agreement had therefore been made between the Vendors and the Purchasers
                    for the sale and purchase of the Property. This fact was not in dispute between
                    the parties. For convenience, the agreement between the parties for the sale and
                    purchase of the Property will be referred to as “the
                    Agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On or about 13 October 2009, the parties
                    attended the first appointment with the HDB. The completion date for the sale
                    was initially fixed at 26 November 2009. The sale was not completed as the
                    Vendors failed to settle arrears in the sum of $42,685.67 owing to the HDB for
                    upgrading costs and late payment charges. On or about 7 January 2010, the
                    Vendors informed the Purchasers that they were unable to proceed with the sale
                    as they could not settle the arrears due to their financial situation. They
                    offered to compensate the Purchasers instead. The Purchasers rejected this offer
                    and demanded that the sale be completed. The sale, however, was never
                    completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 10 February 2010, the Purchasers filed
                    the present action to seek an order for specific performance of the Agreement,
                    with all the necessary accounts and inquiries, or, in the alternative, damages
                    for breach of the Agreement. The application before me was filed by the
                    Purchasers for summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules for the
                    above-mentioned remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The main submissions of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Purchasers seek specific performance of the
                    Vendors’ obligations under the Agreement on the grounds that the Property
                    has an intrinsic value which cannot be compensated by the usual remedy of
                    damages. They aver that none of the usual reasons for denying specific
                    performance, such as the general reluctance of the court to grant specific
                    performance involving contracts for employment or personal service, are
                    applicable. Further, although the Purchasers acknowledge that specific
                    performance may be denied where severe hardship would be caused to the Vendors,
                    they rely on para 27-031 of <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2008)
                        (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) which
                    states that “... “mere pecuniary difficulties” would
                    “afford no excuse””. The Purchasers thus seek specific
                    performance with the necessary inquiries into the exact sums due and owing to
                    the HDB and other Government agencies. During the hearing before me, counsel for
                    the Purchasers, Mr Lim Tiang Yao, made it clear that the primary remedy
                    that the Purchasers are seeking is specific performance, rather than
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Vendors argued that there exist, in this
                    action, triable issues that render the action unsuitable for summary judgment.
                    Four main supporting arguments were proffered in this regard:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the bargain reached between
                        the Vendors and the Purchasers was unequal and unfair. In this connection,
                        the Vendors stated on affidavit that they would be forced to give up their
                        home and would not have the financial resources to find another home as the
                        sale of the Property would leave them out of pocket. It was pointed out that
                        the Purchasers, on the other hand, were seeking a convenient home near the
                        school in which they wished to enrol their child. The Purchasers should have
                        tried to mitigate their loss by sourcing for alternative
                        accommodation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the court could decide not to order specific performance if such a
                        remedy would involve great hardship to one of the parties, even in the
                        absence of impropriety on the part of the party seeking the remedy.
                            <em>A fortiori</em>, specific performance should
                        not be ordered where it would cause prejudice to third parties. In this
                        regard, the Vendors raised the fact that they are living with elderly
                        parents and have a school-going son, and that these people would be
                        adversely affected if their home were to be taken away from
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the
                        Purchasers did not come to court with clean hands, as they do not reside at
                        the address stated in the writ of summons filed on 10 February 2010 for
                        the present action. In fact, the Purchasers did not state any address at all
                        when filing their affidavits in this action. The court was urged to infer
                        from this that the Purchasers were deliberately concealing the fact that
                        they are resident out of jurisdiction, and to penalise the Purchasers for
                        breaching the requirements prescribed by O 6 r 2(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Vendors relied on the equitable maxim
                        which states that equity does nothing in vain to urge the court not to make
                        an order that is impossible to perform. The Vendors referred to a letter
                        from the HDB dated 11 March 2010 which confirmed that unless a sum in
                        excess of $40,000 was paid in cash by the Vendors, and arrears to other
                        agencies were cleared, the sale and purchase would not be approved. The
                        Vendors further stated that any order made by this court could not be
                        enforced against the HDB. A related argument made by the Vendors was that
                        this court could not make an order for specific performance to compel the
                        Vendors to pay a sum of money. Any order compelling the conveyance of the
                        Property would be futile as the HDB would still refuse to grant approval for
                        the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant Terms of Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It may be useful to first set out the relevant
                    terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Clause 9.3 of the Option states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Flat is sold subject to –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the Housing and Development Act (Cap. 129) and any

                        to help the Buyer obtain the HDB’s approval for the purchase of the

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    neither party will have any other claim
                                against the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Clause 15.2 of the Option states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the HDB’s approval for the sale and purchase of the Flat is
                        withheld, refused, revoked or not obtained before the Completion Date and it
                        is due to the Seller’s or Buyer’s default in complying with the
                        HDB’s terms of resale or requirements, the other party will be
                        entitled to enforce the terms of this Option for specific performance,
                        damages and/or any other remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The terms and conditions of a sale/purchase of
                    a HDB resale flat as prescribed by the HDB (“the HDB Terms”) are,
                    as would be apparent, incorporated into the Agreement via clause 9.3(b) of
                    the Option (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). Clause 3.3
                    of the HDB Terms (as printed from the HDB website) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">HDB’s approval for resale is granted subject

<p class="Judg-1">Clause 12.1 of the HDB Terms states:</p>

                    of the sale of the Property is contained in the letter dated 11 March 2010,
                    which was mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_7-p2_d">[7(d)]</a>
                    above, addressed to the Vendors. The relevant paragraphs are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer to the resale of your flat in which the first appointment was on
                        13/10/2009.</p>

                            you owe HDB the sum of $42,685.67 being arrears for upgrading costs and
                            late payment charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    To date, you have not settled the charges since the

                    the HDB dated 23 June 2010, which stated that approval in principle had

                                as there is no instruction from the solicitors of both the sellers

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Read together, the HDB’s position seems
                    to be that approval will be granted as long as the arrears to the HDB and
                    various agencies are paid by the Vendors upfront and in cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there are triable issues in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As stated, the Vendors’ position was
                    that there were triable issues that rendered the present action unsuitable for
                    summary judgment. When pressed during the hearing, counsel for the Vendors,
                    Ms. Gan Kam Yuin, conceded that the Vendors were not denying that there was
                    valid agreement between the parties (<em>viz</em>, the
                    Agreement), or that the Vendors were in breach of that agreement. Rather, the
                    Vendor’s position was that the exact nature and extent of the hardship
                    caused to the Vendors, as well as the inequality and unfairness of the bargain
                    could only be fully understood through witness testimony at trial. In reply,
                    Mr. Lim for the Purchasers argued that the matters raised by the Vendors
                    were sufficiently ventilated through the affidavits filed for the summary
                    judgment application, and there was no need for a full trial of the
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     With reference to <em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 14/0/2, the mechanism of summary judgment
                    enables the plaintiff to obtain judgment without proceeding to trial on the
                    ground that he believes that his opponent has no defence to the claim.
                    Paragraph 14/2/10 goes on to state that a defendant may show cause against
                    a plaintiff’s application by a preliminary or technical objection
                        (<em>eg</em>, that a statement of claim or supporting
                    affidavit is defective for not containing all the necessary evidence in support
                    of a claim) or on the merits by showing that he has a good defence to the claim.
                    None of these situations apply in the present case as the issue of liability has
                    been conceded. There is no real substantial question to be tried, and the
                    primary issue left for determination is what the appropriate remedy to address
                    the inequity as between the parties should be. Accordingly, this matter is
                    amenable to the summary judgment procedure, and it would be a waste of judicial
                    time and resources were it to proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Specific performance in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific performance where the sale of a HDB flat is
                concerned</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There is a long line of common law authority
                    that specific performance is the default and appropriate remedy for a contract
                    for the sale and purchase of land. Gareth Jones &amp; William Goodhart,
                        <em>Specific Performance</em> (Butterworths,
                    2nd Ed, 1996) (“<em>Specific
                    Performance</em>”) states (at p 128):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As long ago as 1804 Sir William Grant MR said that a court of
                        equity will always decree specific performance of a contract for land; it is
                        'as much of course in this Court to decree a specific performance, as it is
                        to give damages at Law'. Damages are only deemed to be an adequate remedy if
                        the defendant has an equitable defence to the plaintiff's claim. Land is
                        deemed to have a special and peculiar value for the purchaser, and no
                        enquiry is made as to the value of the land or as to the possibility that a
                        substantially similar piece of land may be obtained elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage can also be found verbatim in a previous version of the
                    afore-mentioned treatise. The passage from that version was cited and endorsed
                    in the decision of Chao Hick Tin JC in <em>Excelsior Hotel
                        Pte Ltd v Hiap Bee (Singapore) Pte Ltd (OCBC Finance (Singapore) Ltd,
                        interveners)</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 322 at [9] and [10]. <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 7 (LexisNexis,
                    2009 Reissue) summarises the position succinctly (at para 80.595):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contract for the sale of real property readily attracts the remedy of
                        specific performance as each piece of real property is considered unique and
                        substitute performance is not considered adequate. Specific performance is a
                        primary remedy for breach of obligations in a contract for the sale of land.
                        Both the vendor and the purchaser are generally entitled to specific
                        performance, the purchaser for the property to be specifically conveyed and
                        the vendor to require acceptance of title and the payment of the agreed
                        price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In my view, this position holds true even if
                    the property in question is not a piece of land <em>per
                        se</em>, but a HDB flat. In <em>Specific
                        Performance</em>, it is stated that (at p 32):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… damages are said to be impossible to assess if the contract is
                        for the sale of, or for the disposition of, an interest in, land. Land is
                            <em>unique</em>; it has a ‘<em>peculiar and special value</em>’. Consequently, no enquiry
                        is ever made whether damages would be an adequate remedy and would make the
                        injured party whole. This is so even if the land is bought for resale or is
                        one of hundreds of apparently alike apartments in a large commercial
                        development. It is perhaps not surprising that specific performance should
                        be granted to a purchaser of land as a matter of course even in these
                        situations; a court does not enquire why a party enters into a contract, and
                        no apartment is quite like its neighbour ... [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This principle was acknowledged in <em>Coastland
                        Properties Pte Ltd v Lin Geok Choo</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 890 at
                    [2], although Choo Han Teck JC concluded in that case that damages could
                    still be an adequate remedy in some circumstances. There is also clear authority
                    that specific performance of a sale of a HDB flat can be ordered (see <em>Govindaraju and another v Ganasen and another</em> [1994]
                    3 SLR(R) 815).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the present case, the Purchasers have
                    stated on affidavit that they had purchased the Property with the intention of
                    residing there. The Property was conveniently situated near Pei Chun Primary
                    School and near the Purchasers’ places of work. The Property clearly has
                    an intrinsic value to the Purchasers that goes beyond its monetary worth, and
                    this is a value that would be difficult to quantify. As such, specific
                    performance would <em>prima facie</em> seem to be a remedy
                    appropriate to this case. Yet, a court in exercising its equitable jurisdiction
                    must consider all relevant factors of the case and the circumstances of the
                    parties involved in order to achieve an equitable outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific performance where third party consent is necessary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The next issue that has to be addressed is the
                    impact that the HDB’s position has on the appropriate remedy to be
                    awarded. ICF Spry, <em>The Principles of Equitable
                        Remedies</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8nd Ed, 2010) (“<em>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</em>”) at
                    pp 128–129, is instructive in this regard:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clearly established that the courts will not require that to be done
                        which cannot be done…These principles may be illustrated by cases
                        where performance will be possible only if the consent of a third person is
                        obtained. Here an absolute order of specific performance might involve
                        requiring the defendant to do something that in truth he cannot do. If a
                        contractual obligation is itself conditional on the obtaining of consent,
                        any order of specific performance should likewise be conditional, since
                        until the consent has been obtained “that obligation has not yet
                        arisen”, though it may be found as a question of construction that
                        the defendant has also undertaken to take steps to obtain the consent, which
                        in a proper case he may be compelled to do. A different analysis is
                        appropriate where the contractual obligation in question is absolute and not
                        conditional, so that there will be a breach of contact if it is not
                        performed even although, for example, the failure to perform has arisen only
                        because a necessary consent has not been obtained. But here also if at the
                        hearing a substantial doubt arises as to the obtaining of the consent it may
                        be appropriate that any order of specific performance should be drawn in
                        such a way that the direction to the defendant to perform the term in
                        question does not apply if the necessary consent is refused and the
                        performance is impossible. Indeed, whether the obligation of the defendant
                        is absolute or conditional, if it sufficiently clear that the appropriate
                        consent will not be able to be obtained no order of specific performance at
                        all is made, and the parties are left to their other remedies
                        ….</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the above passage that a careful study of the terms
                    of the Agreement is crucial in understanding the exact nature of the
                    parties’ obligations <em>vis-à-vis</em> the consent
                    that must be obtained from the third party, which in this case is the
                    HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Reading clauses 9.3 and 13.5 of the
                    Option alongside clauses 3.3 and 12.1 of the HDB Terms, I take the view
                    that, as part of the Agreement, the Vendors had contracted to do all that they
                    reasonably could do to obtain the HDB’s approval, including settling all
                    arrears that were outstanding. There was a clear course of action that the
                    Vendors could take to obtain HDB’s consent, and they were contractually
                    obligated to do so. Accordingly, it would be inequitable and unjust to deny
                    specific performance, as the Vendors had breached an obligation that they had
                    specifically contracted to fulfil. The fact that fulfilling this obligation
                    would be difficult for them due to their financial situation is a separate
                    consideration that will be addressed later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Furthermore, it is my view that the
                    Vendors’ alleged inability to pay the outstanding arrears upfront does not
                    constitute an insuperable event of impossibility that would militate against any
                    order for specific performance. First, as counsel for the Purchasers
                    highlighted, although the Vendors had deposed on affidavit as to the yearly
                    income of Tan, they have not produced bank statements or any other evidence that
                    they are unable to afford the lump sum payment. Second, even if it is indeed the
                    case that they are unable to afford the lump sum payment, the Vendors can always
                    seek the court’s assistance. This court is prepared to order that the
                    Purchasers pay part of the purchase price into court first, so that the money
                    may then be used to settle the arrears in order to secure the HDB’s
                    approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     That is not to say the Vendors are obliged to
                    successfully procure the HDB’s consent, nor is the court fettering or
                    influencing the discretionary power of the HDB in any way. Clause 15.1 of
                    the Option envisages a situation where the HDB’s consent is refused
                    through no fault of either the buyer or the seller. In such a scenario, parties
                    are returned to their original positions, as if no transaction had ever taken
                    place. Accordingly, it must be the case that the Vendors are contractually
                    obligated to do what they can in accordance with the specified criteria set out
                    in the HDB Terms to enable the HDB to consent to the resale. Once that is
                    complete, if the HDB nonetheless decides to reject the application for approval,
                    the parties’ obligations then come to an end in a manner in accordance
                    with clause 15.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The same principles and analysis were applied
                    by the High Court of Australia in <em>Dougan v Ley</em>
                    (1946) 71 CLR 142. In that case, the defendant owned a taxi and held a
                    registration and license for it. He then orally agreed to sell the taxi and the
                    benefit of the registration and license to the plaintiff for a certain sum. The
                    plaintiff paid a deposit and wanted to complete the agreement. The defendant
                    refused. The trial judge declared that the agreement should be specifically
                    performed and decreed that the defendant should do all things and execute all
                    documents which were proper and necessary in order to enable the plaintiff to
                    present a proper application to the Commissioner for Road Transport and Tramways
                    for the granting of a transfer of the registration and license of the taxi. The
                    trial judge further decreed that in the event that such an application was
                    granted, the plaintiff should pay the balance of the purchase money due to them
                    and the defendant should thereupon deliver the taxi. The appellate court
                    affirmed the decision of the trial judge. In so doing, Rich J held (at
                    pp 147-148):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The respondents are required to join with the appellant in the application
                        to the Commissioner and to sign the usual and proper documents for obtaining
                        the transfer of registration and the issue of the licence. The court is not
                        called upon to superintend a series of acts and the order in question does
                        not purport to control the Commissioner’s discretion. In the event of
                        refusal the obligation is at an end.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     From the foregoing analysis, it is my view
                    that specific performance can be ordered despite the HDB’s position that
                    the arrears have to be paid. Any order of specific performance would
                    concomitantly entail an order that the Vendors settle the outstanding arrears
                    due and owing to the HDB and other Government or Government-related
                    agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unfairness and hardship to the Vendors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Vendors submitted that any order for
                    specific performance would cause undue hardship to their family, given their
                    financial situation. They also argued that enforcement of the bargain would be
                    unfair to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In general, the concept of hardship is wider
                    than that of unfairness and specific performance may be refused on the grounds
                    of hardship even if there had not been any impropriety on the part of the person
                    seeking specific performance. In the present case however, although Ms. Gan
                    took great pains to distinguish between the unfairness of the bargain and the
                    resulting hardship to the Vendors, the arguments in fact merged as her point was
                    that the bargain was unfair <em>because</em> it led to
                    hardship to the Vendors. I shall therefore deal with both issues
                    together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The principles set out in <em>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</em> at pp 198–199
                    are instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It must not be forgotten that if damages are inadequate an applicant is
                        prima facie entitled to specific performance of a valid and enforceable
                        contract. Specific performance is not refused merely because inconvenience
                        or even hardship to the defendant would be caused thereby. But if the
                        hardship suffered by the defendant, if specific enforcement took place,
                        would be so much greater than the detriment that would be suffered by the
                        plaintiff if he were confined to remedies in damages that it would be
                        oppressive and unjust to grant relief, specific enforcement is denied. In
                        these regards there must be a balancing of interests of the parties; and
                        indeed the court takes into account other matters as well, such as the
                        manner in which the grant of relief would affect third persons or any
                        advantage that the plaintiff may have taken of the defendant at the time of
                        entry into the material agreement, in order to determine what course is most
                        just in all the circumstances ....</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Specific
                        Performance</em>, the following passage at p 117 is also of
                    relevance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In exceptional circumstances, the courts may refuse to order specific
                        performance of a contract on the ground that its enforcement would cause
                        great hardship to the defendant, even though the conduct of the plaintiff
                        has not contributed to the circumstances which cause the hardship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned authors go on to opine at pp 119–120
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contract which was fair when it was made may be enforced even though
                        subsequent events turn it into a bad bargain...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since hardship is not itself a ground for setting aside a contract, a
                        court would not normally refuse specific performance if the consequence
                        would be an order of damages which would cause a similar degree of hardship
                        to the defendant. For this reason, in most of the reported cases in which
                        specific performance has been refused on the ground of hardship to the
                        defendant, the loss which the defendant would have incurred as a result of
                        having to complete the contract was likely or certain to be considerably
                        larger than the damages payable to the plaintiff for breach of contract
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, the Vendors had
                    contracted to sell the Property in the hope of realising some liquidity in order
                    to ease their cash-flow problems. Had they known the eventual amount accruing to
                    them from the proceeds of sale would be reduced or even eliminated by the
                    various amounts due and owing to the HDB and other Government agencies, they in
                    all likelihood would not have chosen to sell the Property. Even so, I do not
                    think that this qualifies as undue hardship on the part of the Vendors. The
                    amount owing to in arrears to the HDB is a pre-existing debt, and one which
                    would eventually have to be settled. It is by no means a hardship created by the
                    Agreement, entered into voluntarily by the Vendors, or any award of specific
                    performance thereof. While I am sympathetic to the impact this may have on the
                    elderly parents and son of the Vendors, the option of renting a property is
                    always available to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The alternative to specific performance would
                    be an award of damages; such an award of damages would also cause hardship to
                    the Vendors, and if their financial situation is such as they would have this
                    court believe, they would almost certainly not be able to comply with such an
                        award.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span><em>Chitty on Contracts</em> at para 27-008 states that
                    specific performance can be ordered “quite simply because the defendant
                    may not be “good for the money””. In such a situation,
                    denying specific performance to the Purchasers would leave them without any real
                    relief. I should also add wherever possible, the Court should act to promote
                    commercial certainty and assist in ensuring that parties are held to the bargain
                    that they have made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The lack of disclosure precluding specific performance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In relation to the Purchasers’ lack of
                    disclosure of their Malaysian address, the Vendors rely on the equitable maxim
                    that he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 9(2) (LexisNexis,
                    2003) states at para 110.016 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The maxim has been relaxed over time and is no longer strictly enforced.
                        The question is whether in all the circumstances it would be a travesty of
                        justice to assist the plaintiff given his blameworthy participation or role
                        in the transaction. The whole circumstances must be taken into account
                        having regard to the relief sought, for the relative blameworthiness only
                        emerges after a complete and exhaustive scrutiny and relief which is less
                        drastic need not be defeated by conduct which is less opprobrious. It has
                        been said that ‘the conduct complained of must have an immediate and
                        necessary relation to the equity sued for’ and ‘it must be a
                        depravity in the legal as well as moral sense'.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Purchasers tried to file an affidavit
                    dated 12 July 2010, after the conclusion of the hearing, to explain why
                    they had not revealed their true address earlier. I did not allow this affidavit
                    to be admitted into evidence as the hearing had already been concluded, but
                    having reviewed the evidence in totality, I was of the view that this omission
                    was not material and should not have any impact on my decision. The
                    Purchasers’ conduct, in my opinion, has not been so egregious as to
                    warrant a denial of an equitable remedy in light of all the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Having reviewed the evidence, I grant summary
                    judgment in favour of the Purchasers and order that the contract between the
                    Vendor and the Purchaser be specifically performed. Furthermore, the Vendor is
                    to do all that he reasonably can to comply with the Agreement, including payment
                    of the outstanding arrears. In this connection, I grant liberty to the Vendor to
                    apply to the court should they require certain sums of money to be paid into
                    court by the Purchaser to assist in the payment of these arrears from the sale
                    proceeds of the Property. I also make the consequential order that the Vendor is
                    to ascertain from the HDB and other Government and Government-related agencies
                    the amount of arrears due and owing by them so that these debts can be repaid. I
                    accordingly grant an Order in terms of Prayer 1(a) on terms set out in this
                    judgment, Prayer 1(b)(ii) with late interest to be calculated from
                    27 November 2009 to the date of completion or possession by the Purchasers
                    of the Property, whichever is earlier, Prayers 1(b)(iii) and 1(b)(v), as
                    well as Prayer 1(e), subject to terms set out in this
                judgment.</p>
