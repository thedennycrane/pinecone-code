</div> In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs suggested that the defendant was using the second plaintiff as a “neutral person” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, someone other than the first plaintiff and himself) for the investment that he was making in Debao together with the first plaintiff. The plaintiffs pointed to the fact that the first plaintiff and the defendant had invested together in the shares of another company called Heatec Jietong Holding Ltd in 2009 in the name of the first plaintiff’s brother whom the defendant regarded as someone “neutral”.

An email dated 3 March 2014 from the first plaintiff to the defendant demanding payment of the compromised sum of $197,000 in respect of the Club loans also made no mention of the Debao loan.

</div> One would have expected the plaintiffs to have demanded payment of the Debao loan once the value of the Debao shares started plummeting, yet they did not do so. The plaintiffs were facing difficulties getting the defendant to pay the Club loans. There was no reason why they did not also chase the defendant for payment of the Debao loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I rejected the plaintiffs’ explanation that they did not keep records of the Debao loan or chase for payment because the Debao shares were held in the second plaintiff’s account with CDP. First, the fact that the shares were held in the second plaintiff’s account with CDP did not explain why the plaintiffs did not keep any record of the Debao loan and the alleged repayments. There was no segregation in the second plaintiff’s account between the plaintiffs’ investment and the defendant’s alleged investment. Second, as stated earlier, the value of the Debao shares started falling soon after its listing. The shares were no longer sufficient security for the loan. One would have expected the plaintiffs to have been concerned enough to seek payment of the Debao loan from the defendant. After all, the amount outstanding on the Debao loan far exceeded the amount outstanding on the Club loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my judgment, the absence of records of the Debao loan and the alleged part-payments, the fact that the plaintiffs did not even inform the defendant of the interest and dividend payments and the fact that the plaintiffs did not chase the defendant for payment of the Debao loan, spoke volumes especially when viewed against the plaintiffs’ conduct in respect of the Club loans. Against the weight of all these evidence, Keith’s evidence was in my view not determinative on the issue concerning the Debao loan. I concluded that, looking at the totality of the evidence, the plaintiffs had failed to prove the Debao loan. I therefore dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim in respect of the Debao loan.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As the claim in respect of the Debao loan was dismissed, it followed that the claim for the declaration that the second plaintiff held the Debao shares in trust for the defendant was also dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In brief, I agreed with the defendant that the plaintiffs were not entitled to pursue their claim for breach of fiduciary duties because the breaches alleged in their opening statement were not pleaded. The alleged breaches were factual assertions which ought to have been specifically pleaded in the statement of claim (O 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”)). In any event, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs suffered any loss as a result of these alleged breaches that were distinct from their claims in respect of the Club loans or the Debao loan.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The claim in respect of the Club loans involved more issues than the claim for the Debao loan. In my view, the plaintiffs were entitled to some costs. Both parties agreed that the plaintiffs should be entitled to 75% of their costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, the sum recovered did not exceed the District Court limit of $250,000 (s 2 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed). Therefore, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any more costs than if the action had been brought in a District Court, unless there was sufficient reason for bringing the action in the High Court: s 39 of the State Courts Act; O59 r 27(5) of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In this case, it was entirely within the plaintiffs’ knowledge whether the Debao loan existed. Having found against them on this point, I was not persuaded that there was a sufficient reason for them to have brought this action in the High Court. I therefore ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiffs costs fixed at $60,000 – being the fractional costs fixed on the District Court scale – plus 75% of the plaintiffs’ reasonable disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Judgment was entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $146,000 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ of summons to the date of judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The claims in respect of the Debao loan and the claim based on breach of fiduciary duties were dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Costs was awarded to the plaintiffs fixed at $60,000 plus 75% of reasonable disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Faizal Shah Bin Mohamed Haniffa and Say Chin Phang, Sean (Keystone Law Corporation) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Ranvir Kumar Singh (Unilegal LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
