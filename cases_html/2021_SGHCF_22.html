In Summons No 65 of 2021 (“SUM 65”), the husband sought to adduce further evidence on appeal in order to show that his income had been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and that he had made financial contributions to a property in the wife’s sole name at Grandeur Park Residences (the “Grandeur Park property”).

While I accept that the husband’s income has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I also accept the wife’s submission that the husband’s salary – even taking into account the impact on his salary brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic – is still not insubstantial. Insofar as the husband seeks to persuade me that his income earning capacity is <span class="font-italic">severely</span> affected, I am unable to accept his submission. This is quite different from the situation in <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“<span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span>”), for example, where the Court of Appeal found at [21] that the respondent’s age coupled with his physical disabilities (arthritic limbs and vision problems) meant that he had “little or almost no prospect of a higher earning capacity”. The respondent in that case also had no tertiary education.  The Court of Appeal noted that the respondent’s monthly income of approximately $600 to $800 could “hardly be considered a steady source of revenue”. In the present case, notwithstanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evidence before me indicates that the husband still has a relatively comfortable and steady source of income. On his own account, he worked hard to achieve “his successful education as an Engineering degree holder of the National University of Singapore and successful career in the aviation sector”.

However, although the DJ proceeded to identify the <span class="font-italic">main</span> assets of the parties (see [11] of the GD), she did not identify <span class="font-italic">all</span> the assets, some of which were of substantial value and disputed by parties. The DJ also did not value any of the assets. It is not clear from the GD what assets were in the matrimonial pool and what the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets was. With respect, this is unsatisfactory, especially given the divergence in the parties’ positions as to the assets and size of the matrimonial pool (see [8]–[9] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 It is also not clear from the GD why the DJ did not apply the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> structured approach. This approach would have involved the court first arriving at “a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets”: <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [22]. Second, the court would consider the parties’ indirect contributions and ascribe a second ratio which represents the contributions of each party to the family’s well-being relative to the other. Thirdly, the court derives an average percentage contribution for each party, at which point further adjustments may be made to account for other considerations: see <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [27]. As far as I can tell from the GD, none of this was done. I am not certain why this was so, as both parties in this case actually adopted the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> approach in their submissions before the DJ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Before me, counsel were again agreed that the structured approach espoused by the CA in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> should be followed. I have no doubt that the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> approach is applicable in the present case, given that parties were in a “Dual-Income Marriage”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for the most part, both spouses were working during the marriage and it was not a situation where one spouse was the sole income earner while the other played the role of homemaker (see the CA decision in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 at [42]–[43]). As such, the analysis which follows will apply the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appellant’s Case and Respondent’s Case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At the hearing on 3 May 2021, in addition to allowing the husband’s application to adduce further evidence, I asked parties to file a joint summary.

However, this formula was in respect of pre-marriage properties which were <span class="font-italic">not</span> the matrimonial home.

</div> Insofar as part of this Amount was used to pay (a), it will have been dealt with in the analysis of the Flora Drive property above at [28]. As mentioned earlier, given its status as the matrimonial home, the full net value of the Flora Drive property should be included into the pool of matrimonial assets. Insofar as part of this Amount was used to pay (b), it will be dealt with in the analysis of the husband’s insurance policies at [38] below. Given my finding that the wife has not shown the DPS to have a quantifiable net value, any question of excluding its value from the pool of matrimonial assets is moot (since no value was included into the pool in the first place). To sum up, therefore, on the evidence available, I see no basis for excluding the sum of $54,473.14 from the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Nor can I find any basis for the contention that a negative value should be accorded to the balance in the husband’s ordinary account. In respect of the remaining $300,094.12 in his ordinary account as at 23 July 2019, the husband’s argument appears to be that this entire sum should be excluded from the pool as they were accumulated pre-marriage, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, this entire sum originated <span class="font-italic">solely</span> from the $354,567.26 transferred into his ordinary account in February 2008. To succeed in his argument, the husband must show that the mortgage payments for the matrimonial home and other disbursements from his ordinary account would <span class="font-italic">first</span> come from his CPF savings accumulated <span class="font-italic">during</span> the marriage, and only in the event of a shortfall would such payments <span class="font-italic">then</span> come from his CPF savings accumulated before marriage. Again, there is no basis for such a finding. Instead, I find that once the proceeds of $354,567.26 from the sale of the husband’s former matrimonial property was transferred into his ordinary account and commingled with existing and subsequent ordinary account moneys (which were matrimonial assets), they were no longer separately identifiable (see the decision of Debbie Ong J in <span class="font-italic">UYP v UYQ</span> [2020] 3 SLR 683 at [14]). Put another way, since the proceeds transferred into the husband’s ordinary account have been commingled with other moneys in the ordinary account which were matrimonial assets, it is not possible to ascertain with certainty which moneys were used in each transaction where moneys were disbursed from his ordinary account (see Choo Han Teck J in <span class="font-italic">VJR v VJS and </span><span class="font-italic">another matter</span> [2021] SGHCF 10 at [24]). In any event, I find that the husband had the intention to use the proceeds for the family by way of paying down the mortgage on the matrimonial home. I therefore do not deduct any portion of the $300,094.12 in the husband’s ordinary account from the matrimonial pool.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In sum, I add the value of $508,913.35 (comprising $300,094.12 in the husband’s ordinary account, $186,000.09 in his special account and $22,819.14 in his medisave account) into the pool of matrimonial assets. I derive this value by deducting the sum mentioned at [32] ($96,453.78) from the value of the husband’s CPF savings as at 23 July 2019 ($605,367.13) (see [31] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(4) Husband’s insurance policies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I also add the value of $26,294.23 into the matrimonial pool.

</div> A closer look at the statements would indicate that there were no statements in those months because the transactions for those months were consolidated in the statements of February, March, June, August, November 2017 and January 2018. Likewise, the husband also contended in the court below that an adverse inference must be drawn because <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the end of the 15 February 2017 statement reflected a TCR and TDR of $236,129.90 and $208,470.90 respectively.

In the Joint Summary, he took the position that an adverse inference ought to be drawn because the bank statements reflected large deposits into this account between 22 to 23 February 2017 and a withdrawal of $30,000 on 7 March 2017, which he claimed could not have been “meant for her home payment” as the withdrawal was made after the cheque of $30,050 was issued on 4 March 2017 (see in this regard [52] above).

With regard to the large deposits into Account -001, I do not think that the husband has established a case of concealment or dissipation, particularly when these deposits appear to correspond with withdrawals from the wife’s other bank accounts (see [52] above). In any event, I accept the wife’s explanation that the movement of funds at the material time between February and March 2017 was to facilitate her purchase of the Grandeur Park property. I am unable to see why the wife’s withdrawal of $30,000 on 7 March 2017 could not have been “meant for her home payment”. As the wife pointed out, stamp duties and legal fees were still due after that date. The husband’s rebuttal that the stamp duties and legal fees were paid from her UOB account and not Account -001 does not go very far because the wife was not saying that the withdrawal of $30,000 from Account -001 went directly towards the payments. Rather, I understand her submission in respect of her bank accounts to be that she was combining her savings from various accounts to prepare for the purchase of the Grandeur Park property.

On one hand, he claimed to have “enquired with the Club Representative in Singapore and they were not able to provide him with a tangible value of the time share he had”. Again, it does not appear that he provided any evidence of these communications. On the other hand, he submitted that the “Wife could have made an enquiry herself in the open market to find out the value of the time share” – which begs the question as to why he himself could not have made such enquiries. To add to the string of contradictions, he further claimed that he “was not able to provide any value of the time share because [its] value … is dynamic and varies according to the demand of such commodities at the time of sale”.

Practically, this means that, in ascertaining the ratio of indirect contributions, the court should not focus unduly on the minutiae of family life. Instead, the court should direct its attention to broad factual indicators when determining the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions. These would include factors such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Dealing first with indirect financial contributions, I note that the wife does not dispute the husband’s account that he paid for most of the household bills.

</div> because his job as an airline captain meant that he was away from Singapore half the time. This submission appeared to be an afterthought and was in any event wholly unsupported by any authority for such an approach. If anything, I consider the husband’s frequent absences to be of some relevance to his indirect non-financial contributions, namely the extent to which he could have contributed in the domestic sphere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Taking the circumstances in the round, I find the ratio of indirect contributions (both financial and non-financial) to be 60:40 in favour of the husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As for the husband’s submission that a negative value should be ascribed to the wife’s indirect non-financial contributions, the husband has not met the high threshold required for such a finding.  For such a finding to be made, there must be evidence that the wife’s conduct was undisputed and extreme: <span class="font-italic">per </span>the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim </span>[2015] 2 SLR 195 at [25]). In that case, the wife was found to have “embarked on a premeditated course of action to inflict harm on the Husband by poisoning him over a period of time” (at [54]). The Court of Appeal held that her conduct was undisputed and extreme, and that a negative value ought to be ascribed to it, which the court gave effect to by applying a 7% discount to the 35% which the wife had been awarded of the matrimonial assets (at [57]–[58]). In the present case, the factors highlighted by the husband, such as the wife’s purported lack of concern for his parents or her purported refusal to start a family,

This is about 2.5% of the total pool of matrimonial assets valued at $2,236,766.70. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 At the same time, having found that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the husband for his lack of full and frank disclosure (see [66] above), I give effect to it by adjusting the average ratio by 5% in favour of the wife. Doing so would be just and equitable in the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having regard to all the circumstances, I conclude that a just and equitable division is 67.5:32.5 in favour of the husband. This amounts to $1,509,817.52 (being 0.675 x $2,236,766.70) for the husband and $726,949.18 (being 0.325 x $2,236,766.70) for the wife. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Apportionment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I turn now to the apportionment of the matrimonial assets. Given that I have valued the wife’s assets at $564,729.96 (see [67] above), the difference between the wife’s assets and her entitlement upon division is $162,219.22 (being $726,949.18 - $564,729.96). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In the circumstances, I reverse the DJ’s order that the wife shall be entitled to $200,000.00 of the husband’s CPF moneys in his ordinary account, and order instead that the wife shall be entitled to $162,219.22 of the husband’s CPF moneys in his ordinary account. I do not find it necessary to make any changes to the DJ’s other orders on the division of matrimonial assets. I am of the view that this outcome is fair and just in all the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the wife</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The wife argued that the DJ’s decision on lump sum maintenance of $60,000, being $1,000 a month for five years should be upheld, whereas the husband’s primary argument is that she should get no maintenance at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) noted in <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1172 (“<span class="font-italic">TNC</span>”) (at [66]), an order of maintenance under s 113 of the Women’s Charter supplements the order for the division of matrimonial assets:   maintenance is based on need (see also <span class="font-italic">BUX v BUY</span> [2019] SGHCF 4 at [55]).  In <span class="font-italic">TNC</span> (at [68]), Ong JC decided not to award the wife any maintenance – but this was in view of the fact that the wife had been awarded the “massive” sum of $10.7 million in the division of matrimonial assets. On appeal, the Court of Appeal left Ong JC’s orders on maintenance undisturbed (see <span class="font-italic">TND v TNC and another appeal</span> [2017] SGCA 34 at [104]). In <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span>, the Court of Appeal rescinded the order for lump sum maintenance for the wife after awarding her 50% of the matrimonial assets, which amounted to $1.6 million.  Conversely, in <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon v Lee Siew Lin</span> [2014] 1 SLR 629, the Court of Appeal decided that the lump sum maintenance awarded to the wife should be increased as it had held on appeal that her share of the total pool of matrimonial assets should be reduced from 26.29% to 15% (from a sum of $760,964.89 to a sum of $434,231.19) (see also <span class="font-italic">Lee Siew Lin v Oh Choon</span> [2013] SGHC 25 at [26]). As the Court of Appeal noted in its judgment (at [21]), “courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when they assess the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered”; and in that case, having reduced the proportion of matrimonial assets to be given to the wife, it was “only fair” that they revised upwards the amount of maintenance awarded to her. The court therefore increased the wife’s lump sum maintenance from the $5,000 awarded by the judge below to a sum of $72,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Based on the findings I have arrived at in this case, the wife will receive 32.5% of the matrimonial assets, with a total value of $726,949.18.  Considering the share of matrimonial assets awarded to the wife and having regard to the factors enumerated in s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter, I see no reason to reverse or adjust the DJ’s order for lump sum maintenance of $60,000. <span class="font-italic">Inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, I note that although the wife has shown herself to be capable of improving her career prospects and earning capacity over time, her current salary and her share of the matrimonial assets are far from what I would describe as “massive” or even particularly bountiful; and bearing in mind her ongoing financial commitments, $60,000 appears to me to be a fair sum to award her in lump sum maintenance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For the reasons stated above, my decision is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appeal is allowed only to the extent that I reverse the DJ’s order that the wife shall be entitled to $200,000 of the husband’s CPF moneys in his ordinary account and order instead that the wife shall be entitled to $162,219.22 of the husband’s CPF moneys in his ordinary account. The DJ’s other orders on the division of matrimonial assets are to remain. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The DJ’s order that the husband is to pay a lump sum maintenance of $60,000 to the wife in two equal instalments is to remain.  The husband is to pay the first instalment of $30,000 within 1 month from today (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> by 18 August 2021) and the second instalment of $30,000 within 6 months therefrom (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> by 16 February 2022).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As neither party has been entirely successful in the appeal, I find that the fairest order to make as to costs should be that each party bear his or her own costs of SUM 65 and DCA 111. I so order accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As to the mode of payment of the maintenance instalments, I leave it to parties to work out the administrative arrangements for payment. Parties have liberty to apply to me only in respect of the timing of the instalment payments.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Soon Yien and Kong Shin Ying Brenda (BR Law Corporation) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leong Kit Ying Melissa (Bayfront Law LLC) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
