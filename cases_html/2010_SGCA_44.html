        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These two appeals, Civil Appeal No 24 of
                    2010 (“CA 24”) and Civil Appeal No 27 of 2010
                    (“CA 27”), are brought by Chin Siew Seng
                    (“Chin”) against the decision of the trial judge in <em>Seaspan Agencies Pte Ltd v Chin Siew Seng (Ho Syn Ngan Joanne and
                        another, third parties) and another suit</em> [2010] SGHC 38
                    (“the Judgment”). CA 27 arises out of Suit No 373 of
                    2008 (“S 373”), in which the trial judge found Chin liable
                    for breach of his director’s duties that were owed to the first respondent
                    in CA 27, Seaspan Agencies Pte Ltd (“Seaspan Agencies”).
                    CA 24 is an appeal against the dismissal of Chin’s claim in
                    Suit 859 of 2008 (“S 859”) against the respondent in
                    CA 24, Quah Hun Kok Francis (“Quah”), for a reasonable price
                    to be assessed for the shares in Seaspan Agencies which Chin had transferred to
                    Quah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In 1991, Chin, Quah, and two other individuals
                    incorporated two companies: Seaspan Chartering Pte Ltd (“Seaspan
                    Chartering”) and Seaspan Agencies. Although both companies had common
                    shareholders/directors, the companies were managed separately by different
                    individuals and were involved in entirely distinct shipping-related
                    services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Seaspan Agencies, which was primarily managed by
                    Quah (who was also the majority shareholder), was involved in the ship-agency
                    business and acted as agents for ship-owners or charterers. It provided services
                    to their vessels and crew by, for example, arranging port entry and space,
                    supply of fuel, food and water, and was paid a fee for its services on the basis
                    of each vessel handled. The other directors, Chin, a Tan Keng Seng
                    (“Tan”), and a Bonfurt Sim Mong Seng (“Sim”), did
                    not participate in the management of Seaspan Agencies. Seaspan Chartering, which
                    was managed by Chin, Tan and Sim, was in the ship-brokering business. It
                    arranged fixtures between ship-owners/charterers and cargo owners for the
                    shipment of cargo. For each successful fixture, the ship-owner/charterer would
                    pay Seaspan Chartering a broker’s commission based on the total freight
                    payable for the cargo. Quah was a non-active director who only carried out
                    post-fixture operations for Seaspan Chartering and, in return, received
                    consultancy fees<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in 2002, a split occurred between the
                    shareholders/directors of the two companies. As a result, Quah resigned as a
                    director of Seaspan Chartering and sold his shares in Seaspan Chartering to Chin
                    and the other shareholders/directors. In turn, the other shareholders/directors
                    resigned as directors from Seaspan Agencies and sold their shares in Seaspan
                    Agencies to Quah, who continued to manage Seaspan Agencies. Chin, however,
                    remained as a non-active director and minority shareholder of Seaspan
                    Agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, in late 2003, Seaspan Chartering
                    ceased to conduct business. Chin, who continued to be a minority shareholder and
                    non-active director of Seaspan Agencies, decided, with Quah’s consent, to
                    transfer his ship-brokering business to Seaspan Agencies and brought with him
                    two former employees of Seaspan Chartering, Joanne Ho Syn Ngan
                    (“Ho”) and Theresa Leong Mui Ling (“Leong”). Ho was
                    appointed a director of Seaspan Agencies whereas Leong was employed as the
                    accounts and administrative manager. Prior to this, Seaspan Agencies had never
                    been involved in the ship-brokering business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Although both the ship-agency and ship-brokering
                    businesses were thereafter carried out through Seaspan Agencies, they were, in
                    effect, managed separately as before, see above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>. Quah alone managed the ship-agency business while Chin and
                    Ho managed the ship-brokering side. Chin and Ho relied on their own personal
                    contacts to solicit for ship-brokering business, with Chin focusing on palm oil
                    shipments and Ho handling chemical shipments. Although Quah initially assisted
                    in some operational aspects of the ship-brokering business, he eventually
                    relinquished even those duties to Leong by late 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Leong was the only person involved in
                    both the ship-agency and ship-brokering businesses by handling operational work
                    for both sides. Towards the end of 2004, the paid-up capital of Seaspan Agencies
                    was increased to $100,000. Quah sold a portion of his shares to Chin, Ho and
                    Leong. This resulted in Quah, Chin and Ho each holding 32,000 shares in Seaspan
                    Agencies with Leong holding the remaining 4,000 shares as an incentive. Quah,
                    Chin and Ho were paid equal salaries and received equal director’s
                    fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime in 2005, Quah noticed that a number of
                    “address commissions” were paid by Seaspan Agencies to
                    ship-owners/charterers as a form of “goodwill discount” for
                    successful fixtures on the ship-brokering side. These “address
                    commissions” could sometimes amount up to 2.5% of the freight cost (or
                    50% of the gross commission that Seaspan Agencies would receive as
                    ship-brokers). In 2005, Seaspan Agencies suffered cash flow problems as business
                    faltered. Cracks began to surface in the relationship between Quah and Chin.
                    When Chin’s ship-brokering business picked up around mid-2005, Quah
                    realised that the amounts for the “address commissions” paid out
                    were even higher than usual, some amounting to 3.75% of the freight cost (or 75%
                    of the gross commission that Seaspan Agencies would receive). When asked to
                    explain the increase, Chin was not forthcoming and the relationship between the
                    two further deteriorated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Not long after, on 11 October 2005,
                    Chin told Quah that he was resigning as a director of Seaspan Agencies. In
                    addition, Chin informed Quah that he would be incorporating a new company to
                    continue his ship-brokering business and that Ho and Leong would also be leaving
                    Seaspan Agencies to join him in his new company. The next day, on
                    12 October 2005, Quah typed out four letters and passed them to Chin
                    by hand. Three of the letters were addressed to Chin. In the first letter, Quah
                    informed Chin that an independent auditor would be appointed to examine the
                    company accounts and Chin was prohibited from withdrawing any funds from Seaspan
                    Agencies unless approval, with proper documentation, was given by all three
                    directors. The second letter was essentially a recapitulation of the first
                    letter. In the third letter, Quah informed Chin that Seaspan Agencies would not
                    recognise any payments made to any third party unless there was confirmation
                    from the third party that such payments had actually been received. The fourth
                    letter was copied to Ho and faxed on 13 October 2005 to the company
                    secretary of Seaspan Agencies. In that letter, Quah instructed the company
                    secretary to remove Chin and Ho’s names as directors and shareholders of
                    Seaspan Agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Chin replied to Quah on
                    13 October 2005 stating that he “[did] not agree and [did] not
                    accept the content [<em>sic</em>] of [Quah’s]
                    letter” and that “all matters pertaining to the
                    running/administering of [Seaspan Agencies would] be discussed and agreed upon
                    by all shareholders” at a meeting to be held later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Separately, Chin wrote another letter, instructing the company secretary to
                    refrain from acting on Quah’s earlier letter pending further notice. Chin
                    also incorporated a new company named Seaspan Singapore Pte Ltd (“Seaspan
                    Singapore”) on the same day. However, he continued to conduct his
                    ship-brokering business out of the premises of Seaspan Agencies at International
                    Plaza (“the old premises”) even as he sought new office space for
                    Seaspan Singapore. Ho joined Seaspan Singapore on 19 October 2005 as a
                    director and also took up 6,000 of the 20,000 paid-up shares in Seaspan
                    Singapore. Leong also came on board as an accounts and administrative manager.
                    However, she continued to remain as an employee of Seaspan Agencies and provided
                    her services to Seaspan Agencies as before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Despite having joined Seaspan Singapore as
                    directors, both Chin and Ho remained as directors of Seaspan Agencies and
                    authorised signatories its bank accounts. In fact, Chin and Ho continued to sign
                    cheques for payments arising out of Quah’s ship-agency business because a
                    minimum of two signatures were required to operate the account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The trial judge erroneously
                    found that Chin continued to sign payment vouchers and cheques to pay for
                    address commissions relating to his ship-brokering transactions until
                    9 February 2006 (the Judgment at [9]). The documentary evidence adduced,
                    however, showed that the last cheque signed by Chin for the payment of address
                    commissions was dated 31 October 2005 for the sum of $38,113.14.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    Further, Chin and Ho both drew their last monthly salaries from Seaspan Agencies
                    in October 2005. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the end of October 2005, Chin instructed
                    Leong to draw up a trial balance of Seaspan Agencies’ accounts as at
                    12 October 2005. The trial balance reflected the net profit of Seaspan
                    Agencies for the period of 1 January to 12 October 2005 as
                    $44,076.39. On 11 November 2005, Quah, Chin and Ho were paid a sum of
                    $14,104.44 each (being 32% of $44,076.39) while Leong received $1,763.06 (being
                    4% of $44,076.39). Although the payments were described as “DIRECTORS
                    FEES” and “TAXI CLAIM” in the payment vouchers,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    it was acknowledged by the respondents that the payments were in fact the
                    distribution of the cash surplus to all the shareholders based on their
                    respective shareholdings. In addition, Leong was also rewarded with a bonus of
                    $2,800 for her services in the year 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Around the same time, the office lease of
                    Seaspan Agencies was about to expire. Quah, realising that Chin, Ho and
                    Leong’s eventual departure would mean that he no longer required as much
                    office space as before, decided not to renew the lease. After securing an office
                    tenancy at Cecil Street (“the new premises”) for Seaspan
                    Singapore, Chin offered to sublet the new premises to Seaspan Agencies for a
                    monthly rent of $1,200. This was accepted by Quah. Seaspan Agencies then moved
                    into the new premises together with Seaspan Singapore at the end of November
                    2005 and the two companies continued to share office premises until March 2006.
                    A sign with only the name “Seaspan Singapore” was affixed at the
                    entrance to the new premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It also ought to be mentioned that in November
                    2005, Quah and Chin met to discuss the sale of Chin, Ho and Leong’s shares
                    in Seaspan Agencies to Quah. Based on the Chin’s own assessment of the
                    value of Seaspan Agencies and Quah’s financial circumstances, Chin
                    proposed, on behalf of Ho, Leong and himself, to sell their shares to Quah at a
                    price of $30,000. However, Quah was non-committal about purchasing the shares.
                    Subsequently, on 23 January 2006, Chin’s solicitors drafted a deed
                    for the sale of the shares and sent it to Quah. One of the terms of the draft
                    deed was that Seaspan Agencies consented to Seaspan Singapore’s use of the
                    word “Seaspan” in its name. Again, Quah refused to agree to a sale
                    on those terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In early February 2006, Chin was informed that
                    Ho and Leong had both agreed to sell their shares in Seaspan Agencies to Quah.
                    Following this, although there was no further discussion on the price of the
                    shares or terms of the sale with Quah, Chin proceeded to transfer his shares to
                    Quah on 9 February 2006. The transfer deed expressly stated that
                    Chin’s 32,000 shares were transferred to Quah in consideration of
                        $14,118.40.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Both Ho and Leong also transferred their
                    shares to Quah. On the same day, Chin and Ho signed a resolution to withdraw as
                    authorised signatories of Seaspan Agencies’ checking accounts and
                    officially tendered their written resignations as directors. The resignation
                    letters were backdated to 12 October 2005 to reflect the date on which Chin
                    had first indicated that he was resigning. There is no evidence of Quah raising
                    any objections to these arrangements. After that, Chin requested Seaspan
                    Agencies to move out from the new premises. It eventually did so sometime in
                    March 2006 (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In May 2006, Quah appointed an auditor to
                    examine the accounts of Seaspan Agencies. Through the audit, it was discovered
                    that a number of address commissions that were paid out in relation to
                    Chin’s transactions between 24 June 2005 and 30 November 2005
                    were not paid to the named ship-owners/charterers in those transactions. In
                    October 2006, Seaspan Agencies commenced legal proceedings in DC Suit
                    No 3927 of 2006 against Seaspan Singapore, claiming that payments arising
                    out of contracts concluded in the name of Seaspan Agencies were wrongly diverted
                    into Seaspan Singapore’s account. However, that action had to be
                    discontinued because Seaspan Singapore was subsequently voluntarily wound up
                    after Chin and Ho decided to separate because of differences (Ho had earlier
                    resigned as a director of Seaspan Singapore on
                        17 July 2006).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Almost two years later, on 27 May 2008,
                    Seaspan Agencies instituted S 373 against Chin for breach of his duties as
                    a director of Seaspan Agencies by allegedly (a) diverting to Seaspan
                    Singapore the ship-brokering commissions earned in respect of contracts entered
                    into by Seaspan Agencies or Seaspan Singapore for the period when Chin was a
                    director of Seaspan Agencies; and (b) procuring the payment of commissions
                    by Seaspan Agencies to another party without the knowledge of the other
                    directors at the material time. Seaspan Agencies also claimed for certain
                    payouts made by Seaspan Agencies when Chin was still a director, which included
                    the cash surplus payments made to Quah, Chin, Ho and Leong on 11 November
                    2005 (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In response, Chin joined Ho and
                    Leong as the first and second third parties in the proceedings, claiming that if
                    he were to be found liable, the two of them should also be liable for any loss
                    caused to Seaspan Agencies by the alleged breaches and/or payouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 18 November 2008, Chin commenced
                    S 859 against Quah, claiming for a reasonable price for the shares that he
                    had transferred to Quah on 9 February 2006 (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). In S 859, Chin was not merely claiming the
                    price of $14,118.40 as stated in the transfer deed (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). Rather, he was asking for the shares to be valued
                        <em>after</em> taking into account the damages awarded
                    to Seaspan Agencies in S 373, should he be found liable in that action.
                    Chin conceded that this was really a tactical claim to prevent Quah from
                    enjoying an “undeserved windfall”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> because if
                    Seaspan Agencies was successful in its claim against Chin in S 373, then
                    Quah, being the sole shareholder of Seaspan Agencies, would become entitled to
                        <em>all</em> the profits arising from the
                    ship-brokering business for the period between 11 October 2005 and
                    9 February 2006 even though it was Chin who had done all the
                work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The two suits were heard by the trial judge,
                    one following immediately after the other, with S 373 heard first. During
                    the trial for S 373, Quah admitted that, like Chin and Ho, he had received
                    a sum of $14,104.44 on 11 November 2005 (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above) and he was no longer pursuing Seaspan
                    Agencies’ claim against Chin for the cash surplus payouts. In turn, Chin
                    withdrew his claim against Leong, allowing her to drop out of the picture. It
                    also surfaced at the trial that Chin had been paying address commissions to a
                    commodities broker named Martin Charles Fernandez (“Martin”). Chin
                    had known Martin since the mid-1980s when Martin was still working with the
                    Federal Land Development Authority (“Felda”) in Malaysia.
                    According to Chin, in an attempt to grow his ship-brokering business, he had
                    entered into a confidential written agreement with Martin on 22 September
                    2003 whereby he would pay Martin commissions for referrals that resulted in
                    concluded fixtures. Chin claimed that it was pursuant to this agreement and
                    Martin’s referrals that he was able to obtain fixtures for Seaspan
                    Agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Prior to the commencement of the trial of
                    S 373, Chin conceded that he had remained as a director of Seaspan Agencies
                    up to 9 February 2006 and therefore owed Seaspan Agencies a duty not to
                    place himself in a position where his loyalties conflicted. However, in his
                    defence, Chin claimed that Seaspan Singapore was entitled to the commissions on
                    the basis that there was an agreement between him and Quah reached on
                    11 October 2005 whereby the two of them agreed that the ship-agency and
                    ship-brokering businesses would part ways on the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     any fixtures concluded by Chin on or
                        before 11 October 2005 would belong to Seaspan Agencies while any
                        fixtures concluded by Chin after that date would belong to his new company,
                        Seaspan Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     the cash surplus of Seaspan Agencies as at 12 October 2005 would
                        be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to their respective
                        shareholdings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     the directors of Seaspan Agencies would be paid their respective
                        remuneration for the month of October 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Chin added
                    that he had remained as a director of Seaspan Agencies only because, at that
                    time, there was still operational work to be done for the shipments that had yet
                    to be completed. Chin also claimed that Quah was simply in no position to follow
                    up on those shipments because Quah had never dealt with Chin’s clients.
                    Quah, however, denied having made any agreement with Chin. He claimed that the
                    distribution of the cash surplus of Seaspan Agencies was done without his
                    knowledge and that he had accepted the payment of $14,104.44 only after finding
                    out that Chin and Ho had each received an equivalent amount. Quah also alleged
                    that Chin had refused to resign as director, despite being told to do so, in
                    order to continue withdrawing funds from the accounts of Seaspan Agencies to pay
                    his own salary for October 2005 and the address commissions. On this point,
                    the trial judge rejected Chin’s contention that there was such an
                    agreement on three grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     she was of the opinion that such
                        an important agreement would have been documented;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     she found Chin to be a less credible
                        witness on the witness stand as compared to Quah; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c_3"></a>(c)     she found that there was no reason
                        for Quah to agree to an arrangement “which would be wholly beneficial
                        to Chin and of no benefit to Quah” (the Judgment
                        at [11]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Having determined that there was no express
                    agreement between Chin and Quah, the trial judge proceeded to consider whether
                    Quah’s knowledge that Chin was conducting ship-brokering business through
                    Seaspan Singapore amounted to informal assent on the part of Seaspan Agencies to
                    release Chin from his breach of his duty not to place himself in a position of
                    conflict of interest. On this point, the trial judge conceded that although Quah
                    may have had some knowledge that Chin was carrying on business through Seaspan
                    Singapore as Seaspan Singapore and Seaspan Agencies shared the new premises, he
                    could not have known the extent of Chin’s breach. Accordingly, the trial
                    judge found Chin liable to compensate Seaspan Agencies for losses suffered as a
                    result of the diversion of brokering commissions from Seaspan Agencies to
                    Seaspan Singapore, up to 9 February 2006, and for damages to be assessed
                    (the Judgment at [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The second issue was whether Chin was in
                    breach of his director’s duties by paying out address commissions to
                    Martin without disclosing his identity to the other directors, namely Quah and
                    Ho. According to Chin, Martin would verbally provide him with contact details of
                    cargo owners looking to ship cargo and he would use that information to contact
                    the cargo owners to arrange fixtures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> For every successful fixture, Chin would pay
                    cash to Martin or deposit money into Martin’s Singapore bank
                        account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The trial judge
                    found that although it was not uncommon in the industry for commissions to be
                    paid in exchange for referrals, it was unlawful for Chin to have concealed the
                    “private deal with a third party which required him to use [Seaspan
                    Agencies’] funds to pay the third party” (the Judgment at [42]). As
                    a result, the trial judge held that Chin was liable to compensate Seaspan
                    Agencies for the payments that had been made to Martin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>, Chin joined Ho to the action in S 373, asserting that
                    she ought to be equally liable for the loss caused to Seaspan Agencies if he
                    were found to be in breach of his duties. The trial judge found that the fact
                    that Ho had joined Chin at Seaspan Singapore as a director and shareholder meant
                    that she must have known of Chin’s efforts to divert commissions away from
                    Seaspan Agencies to Seaspan Singapore. Accordingly, Ho was also found liable for
                    diverting commissions to Seaspan Singapore but only with respect to the
                    transactions which she had been responsible for (the Judgment at [45]). As for
                    the payment of address commissions to Martin, the trial judge found that
                    although Ho had been the co-signatory of the cheques made out to Martin, Ho had
                    been deceived by Chin and was in fact ignorant about the nature of the payments
                    (the Judgment at [46]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After finding in favour of Seaspan Agencies in
                    S 373, the trial judge then rejected Chin’s claim in S 859 as
                    frivolous on the ground that Chin had no basis for asking the court to rewrite
                    the terms of the deed and substitute the price of $14,118.40 with a
                    “reasonable price” (the Judgment at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The credibility of the witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In our view, the trial judge placed far too
                    much emphasis and reliance on her impressions about the credibility of the
                    witnesses. We recently pointed out in <em>Ng Chee Chuan v Ng Ai
                        Tee (administratrix of the estate of Yap Yoon Moi, deceased)</em>
                    [2009] 2 SLR(R) 918 that a court should be slow to place too much
                    reliance on the perceived credibility of witnesses when there are undisputed
                    facts and/or objective evidence from which the court can draw the appropriate
                    inferences (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While it is no doubt necessary to ascertain the credibility of witnesses
                        in most cases where the oral evidence of the parties conflict, it is not
                        always appropriate to rely primarily on credibility (determined on the basis
                        of inconsistent testimony) as a basis for drawing factual inferences,
                        especially where the events in question have taken place many years ago and
                        there are undisputed objective facts. Imperfect memories and uncertain
                        recollections should not necessarily be treated as impinging on the
                        credibility of a witness. These are but afflictions which the passage of
                        time will, in varying degrees, bring to bear on all individuals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The trial judge, having favoured Quah as the
                    more credible witness on the witness stand (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above), appeared to have charitably overlooked the many
                    inconsistencies in his evidence. For instance, although Quah was plainly evasive
                    when questioned about his part in the distribution of the cash surplus (the
                    Judgment at [12]), the trial judge generously concluded that he was not
                    forthright because he knew that the payments had been falsely classified in the
                    payment vouchers as directors’ fees and taxi claims. With respect, we
                    disagree with the trial judge’s approach and the inferences on credibility
                    she had drawn. Given that, in the present case, there is sufficient undisputed
                    evidence in the form of contemporaneous documents and the subsequent conduct of
                    the parties, the trial judge ought not to have relied as heavily on the
                    perceived credibility of the witnesses. With that observation, we will now
                    proceed to deal first with the issues arising in CA 27, which is
                    Chin’s appeal against the trial judge’s decision in
                    S 373.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Seaspan Singapore’s receipt of ship-brokering
                commissions for fixtures concluded by Chin and Ho during the period between
                11 October 2005 and 9 February 2006 was with the knowledge and assent of
                Seaspan Agencies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, the trial judge found in S 373 that there was no
                    express agreement between Quah and Chin that Seaspan Singapore would be entitled
                    to receive the ship-brokering commissions for the fixtures concluded by Chin
                    between 11 October 2005 and 9 February 2006; accordingly, both Chin
                    and Ho were in breach of their duties to Seaspan Agencies. This conclusion
                    appears to disregard, in its entirety, the documentary evidence and subsequent
                    conduct of the parties (Quah’s, in particular), which, in our judgment,
                    points unequivocally to some kind of arrangement or settlement between the then
                    shareholders of Seaspan Agencies to sever the ship-brokering and ship-agency
                    businesses sometime in October 2005, freeing Chin to start his own business
                    and permitting Ho to join Chin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, we found it disingenuous of Quah to now
                    complain that Chin had wrongfully diverted commissions and business
                    opportunities to Seaspan Singapore when at no point in time during the period in
                    which Chin was carrying out of the ship-brokering business under his new company
                    did Quah object to his doing so. Taking the three letters above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> that Quah had sent to Chin on 12 October
                    2005 as the starting point for our analysis, we note that although Quah had
                    adamantly maintained that Chin was prohibited from withdrawing funds from
                    Seaspan Agencies without the approval of all three directors, there was no
                    similar opposition to Chin’s intention to resign and to transfer the
                    ship-brokering business to his new company. Further, we find it odd that, during
                    the entire four-month period Chin was carrying on business under Seaspan
                    Singapore while still a director of Seaspan Agencies, Quah appears not to have
                    protested about this despite being aware that Chin was conducting business under
                    Seaspan Singapore and that there was no longer any ship-brokering business
                    coming into Seaspan Agencies after 13 October 2005. Certainly, there
                    is no documentary evidence of any objections being raised. Quah also knew
                    perfectly well that Chin was still signing cheques on behalf of Seaspan
                    Agencies; yet he did nothing to remove Chin as a signatory after he had sent the
                    letters dated 12 October 2005. Even more astonishingly, when the lease
                    for the old premises expired, Quah, without any qualms, moved into the new
                    premises which had Seaspan Singapore’s name prominently displayed at its
                    entrance. In light of these facts, we doubt that Quah then found Chin’s
                    conduct as reprehensible as he now makes it out to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Besides the curious absence of objections on
                    Quah’s part, there is also the undisputed subsequent conduct of the
                    parties. In our judgment, the parties’ conduct was entirely consistent
                    with the existence of an agreement that the businesses would be split in October
                    2005 and that Chin was free to pursue his own ship-brokering business
                    thereafter. Indeed, it was undisputed that the last monthly salaries for Chin
                    and Ho were drawn in the month of October 2005 and that Leong was also paid a
                    bonus for the year 2005 although it was still only October. Crucially, Quah
                    personally approved the Central Provident Fund contributions for
                    October 2005 for all four of them and signed the payment
                        voucher.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> More tellingly, the cash surplus of the
                    company was distributed to all the shareholders according to their respective
                    shareholdings after Leong had drawn up the trial balance for Seaspan Agencies as
                    at 12 October 2005. This, to us, was a clear and unambiguous act by the
                    then shareholders to sever the independently managed ship-agency and
                    ship-brokering businesses. In reality, Seaspan Agencies had merely been a
                    vehicle of convenience for the operations of the respective businesses. Before
                    Chin, Ho and Leong joined Seaspan Agencies in 2003, it had no ship-brokering
                    business to speak of. Subsequently, although they were under the same company,
                    Quah played no part in the management and the acquiring of revenue for the
                    ship-brokering business while Chin and Ho were wholly uninvolved in the
                    ship-agency business. The evidence also suggested that a split was imminent
                    sometime in early-2005. The relationship between Quah and Chin had by then
                    deteriorated because of a number of unresolved issues such as the address
                    commission payments by Chin and the lack of revenue coming into Seaspan
                    Agencies. This eventually culminated in their agreement to part ways in
                    October 2005. Based on our finding that there was such an agreement, we
                    accept that Chin and Ho had remained as directors until 9 February 2006
                    only for the parties’ mutual convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the result, we hold that all the directors
                    and shareholders of Seaspan Agencies knew and consented to Seaspan
                    Singapore’s receipt of ship-brokering commissions for the period between
                    11 October 2005 and 9 February 2006 for its exclusive account. Chin
                    and Ho were not, in the prevailing circumstances, in breach of their duties to
                    Seaspan Agencies with respect to the claim for the diversion of ship-brokering
                    commissions and business opportunities during that period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Chin is liable to account to Seaspan Agencies for the address
                commissions allegedly paid to Martin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On this issue, the trial judge had found that
                    Chin was in breach of his duty to Seaspan Agencies and was liable to compensate
                    Seaspan Agencies for the address commissions paid to Martin (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). We are of the view that that this
                    issue had to be viewed contextually. First, there was no evidence led that the
                    address commissions paid out to Martin were higher than the market rate. Indeed,
                    the trial judge herself commented that Chin would have been lauded for bringing
                    in additional revenue which benefited the company had he disclosed the
                    arrangement he had entered into with Martin (the Judgment at [42]). The company
                    ledger showed that for the year 2005, Chin successfully concluded a total of 24
                    transactions by October,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> a
                    substantial improvement in business compared to the previous year during which
                    Chin only secured six fixtures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Considering the considerable
                    increase in ship-brokering business arising from Chin’s efforts, it was
                    Seaspan Agencies who appeared to have been the main beneficiary of the agreement
                    between Chin and Martin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Nevertheless, we find that the circumstances
                    in which Chin paid Martin the address commissions were questionable, to say the
                    least. Not a single document was produced to show that the address commissions
                    were actually paid to and or received by Martin. In light of this, we agree with
                    the trial judge that Chin was in breach of his duty as director and is liable to
                    account to Seaspan Agencies for the address commissions allegedly paid to
                    Martin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, Chin is only liable to pay Seaspan
                    Agencies the sum of $113,120.62, being 32% of the $353,501.95 awarded by the
                    trial judge (the Judgment at [50]).This reflects Quah’s shareholding in
                    Seaspan Agencies at the time the payments were made to Martin. To award Seaspan
                    Agencies the whole of the alleged commissions paid would not be correct. This is
                    because Quah had used Seaspan Agencies’ right to sue Chin only after he
                    had obtained all the shares from Chin, Ho and Leong; Quah had quite plainly
                    wanted to secure all the profits from Chin’s ship-brokering business and
                    the address commissions personally for himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Although Quah asserted that he had already
                    paid Chin $14,118.40 as consideration for his shares and adduced a few payment
                    vouchers in an attempt to establish such payment, there was no credible evidence
                    to substantiate his claims. First, the payment vouchers simply reflected
                    withdrawals of cash advances from Seaspan Agencies in the form of cash cheques.
                    Second, even the figures on the payment vouchers did not add up to the figure of
                    $14,118.40: there were vouchers for the sums of $7,000, $3,000 and $1,000. Quah
                    weakly asserted that the remainder of $4,118.80 was paid to Chin on
                    8 February 2006 but had no document to show that such payment was in fact
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Chin claimed that, although he had executed
                    the transfer of his shares to Quah, he was never paid any money for the shares.
                    He explained that he had simply transferred the shares to Quah to sever their
                    relationship and did not see the need to discuss a price or ask for payment
                    because he felt that Quah was in no position to pay, given that Quah already had
                    difficulty repaying the cash loans that he owed to Seaspan Agencies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It was undisputed that as at
                    12 October 2005, Quah still owed Seaspan Agencies a debt of around $140,000
                    in personal loans and advances and that he was the only director who owed
                    Seaspan Agencies any money. Given that Quah still owed Seaspan Agencies such a
                    substantial amount of money in personal loans and advances which he was at that
                    time unable to repay, it was unlikely that there was any residual value left in
                    Seaspan Agencies after its entire cash surplus had been distributed on
                    11 November 2005. Under such circumstances, we accept that Chin no longer
                    saw any value in his shares in Seaspan Agencies, and was willing to transfer his
                    shares to Quah without consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Chin has any basis for claiming a reasonable price for the
                shares he transferred to Quah</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Having arrived at our conclusion that Chin was
                    willing to forego his shares in Seaspan Agencies without consideration, it must
                    follow that there is no merit in Chin’s appeal in CA 24 and we
                    therefore dismiss it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In summary, for CA 27, we allow the
                    appeal in part and find that both Chin and Ho are not liable for the
                    ship-brokering commissions that were received by Seaspan Singapore. Chin,
                    however, is liable to Seaspan Agencies for the sum of $113,120.62 for the
                    address commissions paid out to Martin (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). As for CA 24, the appeal is
                dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In so far as the costs of the present appeals
                    and the proceedings below are concerned, each party is to bear its own costs.
                    Here, we take into account the fact that the respondents have only recovered a
                    fraction of their original claim. The usual consequential orders will
                    apply.</p>
