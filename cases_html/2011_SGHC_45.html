        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned an application for leave
                    under Order 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”) by UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the
                    plaintiff”) to apply for a quashing order and a mandatory order
                    (“the application”) against Jurong Town Corporation
                    (“JTC”). The application arose out of JTC’s refusal to renew
                    the plaintiff’s lease or to grant the plaintiff a fresh lease of the
                    premises rented by the plaintiff at Benoi Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing arguments from both parties and
                    from the Attorney-General (“the AG”), I dismissed the application.
                    The plaintiff has appealed against my dismissal (in Civil Appeal No. 238 of
                    2010) and I now set out the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff was the lessee of land located at
                    3 Benoi Road, Singapore 629877 (“the Premises”). The plaintiff
                    used the Premises as a shipyard for its shipbuilding business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       JTC was the lessor of the Premises. JTC is a
                    statutory board incorporated under the Jurong Town Corporation Act
                    (Cap 150, 1998 Rev Ed) (“the JTC Act”). JTC held the
                    Premises under a lease from the State (“the Head
                Lease”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s application to renew the Lease</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff’s lease of the Premises
                    (“the Lease”) was due to expire on 31 December 2010. On 6 and
                    22 August 2008, the plaintiff applied to JTC to renew the Lease
                    (“the Renewal Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In his affidavit filed in support of the
                    application, Leung Yat Tung (“Leung”), the plaintiff’s
                    managing-director deposed that the Economic Development Board
                    (“EDB”) was involved in the plaintiff’s decision to make the
                    Renewal Application. Leung stated that the plaintiff had initially intended to
                    assign the Lease to a company known as Kim Hock Corporation Pte Ltd. Leung
                    explained that the plaintiff decided to assign the Lease because it had heard
                    from “market talk” and JTC’s officers that JTC planned to
                    redevelop waterfront sites, including the Premises, and that leases affected by
                    such plans would not be renewed. Leung claimed that he was contacted by one
                    Sidat Senanayake (“Senanayake”), an EDB officer, in late February
                    2005. Leung stated that Senanayake persuaded the plaintiff to call off its
                    assignment of the Lease by representing, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that JTC had reconsidered its redevelopment plans.
                    Senanayake eventually wrote to Leung on 26 May 2005 to inform him that JTC
                    was agreeable to considering a conditional extension of the Lease, subject to
                    EDB’s support. Leung further detailed his interactions with EDB between
                    February 2005 and November 2009 in his affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I should mention that JTC’s consideration
                    of the Renewal Application was delayed because of a waterfront
                study.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The alleged involvement of Keppel Singmarine Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Leung claimed that Hoe Eng Hock
                    (“Hoe”), the executive director of Keppel Singmarine Ltd
                    (“Keppel Singmarine”), approached him to propose that the
                    plaintiff share the Premises with Keppel Singmarine. Leung asserted that Hoe
                    told him that the Lease would not be renewed if the plaintiff did not agree to
                    Hoe’s proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Hoe denied Leung’s allegations in an
                    affidavit filed in other proceedings between the plaintiff and JTC (see
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> below). Hoe claimed that he only
                    offered to sublet a part of the Premises for a short period of approximately 12
                    months to ameliorate any space congestion that Keppel Singmarine might
                    face.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">JTC’s rejection of the Renewal Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     JTC eventually informed the plaintiff, in a
                    letter dated 20 November 2009, that it would not be renewing the Lease
                    (“the First Rejection Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff wrote several letters to JTC and
                    EDB between November 2009 and June 2010 even though JTC had indicated in the
                    First Rejection Letter that its rejection of the Renewal Application was
                    final.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 19 May 2010, JTC wrote to the
                    plaintiff to advise that EDB and JTC had jointly evaluated the plaintiff’s
                    business plans and had concluded that they were unable to support the Renewal
                    Application (“the Second Rejection Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s meeting with JTC and EDB on 16 June
                2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Following the Second Rejection Letter, the
                    plaintiff wrote to the chairmen of JTC and EDB. JTC responded that both JTC and
                    EDB would arrange to meet with the plaintiff to clarify their
                policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff met with representatives of JTC
                    and EDB on 16 June 2010, (“the 16 June 2010 Meeting”).
                    Leung claimed that one Tang Wai Yee (“Tang”), a JTC officer,
                    explained that waterfront land was scarce and so JTC had to allocate such land
                    to companies with the best business plans. Leung also alleged that Tang informed
                    him that JTC required a minimum amount of investment from companies applying for
                    leases of waterfront land and that the plaintiff’s proposed investment of
                    $20.6m was too low.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s proposal to take over a lease of 17 Pandan
                Road</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 4 June 2010, the plaintiff wrote to
                    JTC with a proposal that the plaintiff take over the current lease of land
                    located at 17 Pandan Road (“the 17 Pandan Road Lease”) if JTC
                    agreed to extend the 17 Pandan Road Lease. JTC did not reply to this
                    letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Leung deposed that he raised the
                    plaintiff’s request for a renewal of the 17 Pandan Road Lease at the
                    16 June 2010 Meeting. Leung claimed that Tang responded that it would
                    “look funny” if JTC were to reject the Renewal Application but
                    approve the plaintiff’s application for the 17 Pandan Road Lease. Leung
                    also claimed that when he asked Tang if the plaintiff had been
                    “blackmarked [<em>sic</em>] permanently” by
                    JTC, Tang responded that she could not answer Leung.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     JTC filed an affidavit in response to
                    Leung’s claims regarding the 17 Pandan Road Lease. JTC’s Deputy
                    Director of the Aerospace, Marine and Cleantech Cluster, Loh Yew Pong
                    (“Loh”), deposed that he was present at the 16 June 2010 Meeting
                    but could not confirm if Leung’s recounting of the comments made by Tang
                    was verbatim. Loh explained nevertheless that those comments should be
                    understood in context. The plaintiff did not submit any application for the 17
                    Pandan Road Lease. Loh explained that JTC was “rightfully curious”
                    as to how the plaintiff’s business plan in relation to the Lease, which
                    was rejected by JTC, would impress JTC in relation to another plot of land. As
                    for the response to the plaintiff’s question on whether it was
                    “blackmarked”, Loh explained that Tang’s response, if in
                    fact it was given, was a prudent answer because the meaning of
                    “blackmarked” was unclear.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit No 502 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 21 July 2010, the plaintiff commenced
                    proceedings against JTC in Suit No 502 of 2010 (“Suit 502”). The
                    plaintiff claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, the following
                    reliefs in Suit 502:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that JTC’s
                        refusal to renew the Lease was and is wrongful;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     a declaration that JTC is estopped from refusing
                        to renew the Lease or refusing to grant a new lease;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     an order that JTC renew the Lease or
                        grant a new lease; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     further, or in the alternative, that the plaintiff be
                        awarded equitable compensation and/or damages to be
                assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the hearing before this court, counsel for
                    JTC (Dhillon Dinesh) informed the court that Suit 502 had been fixed for an
                    expedited hearing between 16 and 25 February 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It would be useful to highlight an affidavit
                    that Loh filed in Suit 502 in response to the plaintiff’s application for
                    an interlocutory injunction (“the LYP Injunction Affidavit”). Loh
                    had stated in the LYP Injunction Affidavit that JTC required that applicants for
                    waterfront land commit to investing at least $100m as fixed asset investment to
                    ensure maximisation of land usage. As will be seen below, the plaintiff relied
                    on this statement in the LYP Injunction Affidavit to explain to this court its
                    delay in making the application and also as support for its substantive
                    application for judicial review. I should add that Loh had explained in his
                    affidavit filed in these proceedings that his statement in the LYP Injunction
                    Affidavit was made in the context of an attempt on his part to explain the loss
                    that JTC would suffer if an interlocutory injunction was granted. Loh explained
                    that JTC would actually consider a “basket of factors” when
                    assessing an application for a lease, and not just the applicant’s
                    proposed fixed asset investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The amounts that the plaintiff’s neighbours had committed to
                investing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     According to Leung, the plaintiff discovered
                    in early October 2010 that its neighbours had obtained a renewal of their leases
                    even though they had committed to invest at values that were lower than the
                    amount that the plaintiff proposed. Leung deposed that he discovered that Cosco
                    Marine Engineering (S) Pte Ltd (“Cosco”), which was granted an
                    extension of its lease for a period of 30 years, had committed to investing only
                    $5m over three years without providing a detailed business plan for its future
                    operations. Another neighbour, Asia-Pacific Shipyard Pte Ltd
                    (“Asia-Pacific Shipyard”), which was granted an extension of its
                    lease for a period of 20 years, had committed to investing only $6m over a
                    period of five years without a specific business plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     JTC responded to Leung’s allegations by
                    Loh’s affidavit. Loh deposed that Leung’s recounting of the details
                    of the leases of Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard in Leung’s affidavit was
                    incorrect and that he did not understand how Leung was in a position to judge
                    their businesses or business plans since he was not privy to the two
                    companies’ submissions to JTC. Loh also stressed that Cosco and
                    Asia-Pacific Shipyard had obtained leases of different plots of land and that
                    JTC considered every application on its own merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons No. 1133 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 2 November 2010, the plaintiff filed
                    the application praying, <em>inter alia</em>, for the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     leave to apply for a quashing order
                        to remove into the High Court and quash JTC’s decision to reject the
                        Renewal Application and to refuse to grant a new lease of the
                        Premises;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     leave
                        to apply for a mandatory order to oblige JTC to reconsider the Renewal
                        Application or the plaintiff’s application for a grant of a new lease
                        of the Premises; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     an order that JTC’s decision rejecting the Renewal Application
                        or the plaintiff’s application for a grant of a new lease of the
                        Premises be stayed until the determination of the plaintiff’s
                        application for a quashing order and a mandatory order or until further
                        order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiff’s arguments in support of
                    the application were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     Under O 53, r 1(6) of the
                        Rules, an application for leave to make an application for a quashing order
                        must be made within three months after the date of the proceedings. The
                        plaintiff was informed of JTC’s decision not to renew the Lease on
                        19 May 2010 in the Second Rejection Letter. Therefore, the three month
                        period prescribed in O 53, r 1(6) of the Rules would have expired
                        on 18 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff should not be denied leave because of the
                        delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     JTC’s decisions were susceptible to judicial
                    review.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        plaintiff had sufficient interest to apply for prerogative orders because it
                        was the party directly affected by JTC’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     The material before the court had met
                        the threshold of a <em>prima facie</em> case of
                        reasonable suspicion. In particular, the plaintiff raised the following
                        arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_e-p3_i"></a>(i)       JTC exercised its
                            discretionary power to lease waterfront land irrationally, unreasonably
                            and/or in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_e-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       JTC breached the rules of natural justice
                            and/or failed to give effect to the plaintiff’s legitimate
                            expectations.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a>(f)     The plaintiff did not have alternative
                    remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_g"></a>(g)     Finally,
                        the plaintiff submitted that if the court granted leave, the court also had
                        the power to order that JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal
                        Application be stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     JTC’s arguments against the application
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s explanation
                        for the delay should not be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal Application
                        was not justiciable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff did not discharge its burden of establishing a
                            <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion
                        of irrationality, illegality or breach of natural justice on the part of
                        JTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The AG’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Under O 53, r 1(3) of the Rules, an
                    applicant for leave to apply for a mandatory order, prohibiting order or
                    quashing order must serve the <em>ex parte</em> originating
                    summons, the statement referred to in O 53, r 1(2) and the supporting
                    affidavit on the AG. The AG would then have the right to attend and be heard at
                    the hearing of the application (<em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin and
                        others v Minister for Information and the Arts</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 627 at [4]-[5]; also see <em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell Asia, 2007) (“<em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em>”) at para 53/8/26).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The AG intervened in the application and
                    opposed it on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s dispute with
                        JTC was not a matter of public law. Only disputes concerning public law
                        matters were susceptible to judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff’s application for leave to
                        apply for a quashing order was filed out of time and the application for
                        leave to apply for a mandatory order was not made timeously. The
                        plaintiff’s reasons for its delay were
                unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The AG also opposed the plaintiff’s
                    prayer for the court to stay JTC’s rejection of the Renewal Application
                    and refusal to grant a new lease until the determination of the substantive
                    judicial review application. The AG argued that the plaintiff’s prayer in
                    that regard was unsustainable as regards its application for leave to apply for
                    a mandatory order. This was because O 53, r 1(5) of the Rules which
                    was the provision that gave the court the power to grant a stay, applied only to
                    applications for leave to apply for a prohibiting order and a quashing order. In
                    any case, JTC had already made its decision and so there were no
                    “proceedings” to be stayed. I did not have to consider this
                    argument because of the decision to dismiss the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The test for whether leave should be granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A court faced with an application for leave
                    under O 53, r 1 of the Rules is only required to consider whether the
                    material before it reveals “a <em>prima facie</em>
                    case of reasonable suspicion” that the applicant would obtain the
                    remedies that he has sought (“the <em>Colin
                        Chan</em> Test”) (see <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin
                        v Minister for Information and the Arts</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 294 (“<em>Chan Hiang Leng
                        Colin</em>”) at [25]

                    [2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 at [21]-[22]

                        2007</em> at para 53/8/22).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I should point out that some recent decisions
                    have gone further than the <em>Colin Chan</em> Test. In
                        <em>Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 1 (“<em>Yong Vui Kong</em>”),
                    the court was willing to fully consider the application for judicial review on
                    the merits while hearing the application for leave (<em>Yong Vui
                        Kong</em> at [16]-[19]). A notable feature of <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> was that the court was not faced with any factual
                    disputes. The court there was only concerned with pure questions of law that
                    were fully canvassed (<em>Yong Vui Kong</em> at [16]). There the court found (at [17]) support for this approach in an
                    observation made by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pang Chen Suan v
                        Commissioner for Labour</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 648, at
                        [56]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56 We should like to add by way of guidance to judges who hear <em>ex parte</em> applications for leave for judicial review
                        that the purpose of requiring leave is to enable the court to sieve out
                        frivolous applications. A case such as the present which clearly raises
                        issues which require more than a cursory examination of the merits should
                        have been heard as a substantive application. There is no reason why an
                            <em>ex parte</em> application such as Pang's could
                        not have been heard <em>inter partes</em> and disposed
                        of on the merits as a substantive application. As for this appeal, given our
                        conclusions on the substantive issues in this case, we indicated to State
                        Counsel that he should advise the Commissioner that Pang's claim for
                        workmen's compensation should be processed immediately without the necessity
                        of another court hearing, at which the Commissioner was bound to
                        fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Belinda Ang J in <em>Chai Chwan v Singapore Medical
                        Council</em> [2009] SGHC 115 (“<em>Chai Chwan</em>”) also made observations on the approach to be
                    taken at the leave stage. She commented on the difficulties of applying the
                        <em>Colin Chan</em> Test if the court deciding on the
                    leave application has had a contested hearing of the application (<em>Chai Chwan</em> at [31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     My view was that it was not appropriate to
                    adopt the approach in <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> for the
                    application because of the presence of factual disputes. For example, in
                    relation to the comments allegedly made at the 16 June 2010 Meeting (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>), Loh had deposed that he
                    could not confirm if Leung’s recounting of the comments was verbatim.
                    Another example of a factual dispute was the alleged involvement of Keppel
                    Singmarine (which denied any involvement in JTC’s decision – see
                    above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). JTC had also disputed the
                    plaintiff’s evidence on the details of the leases of its neighbours, Cosco
                    and Asia-Pacific Shipyard (see above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>). In the light of such factual disputes, it was not appropriate
                    for this court to go beyond the <em>Colin Chan</em>
                    Test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is, however, appropriate to consider
                    whether the decision of JTC was even susceptible to judicial review at the leave
                    stage. The Court of Appeal in <em>Linda Lai</em> opined
                    that it was appropriate for the court to consider such an issue because the
                    susceptibility of a decision to judicial review is a jurisdictional issue
                        (<em>Linda Lai</em> at [24]; also see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em> at para 53/8/22).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In arriving at the decision to dismiss the
                    application, I considered the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether this application was made
                        out of time (“Issue 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     if not, whether JTC’s decision to reject the
                        Renewal Application, or to refuse to grant a new lease, was susceptible to
                        judicial review (“Issue 2”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     if so, whether the material before this court
                        disclosed a <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable
                        suspicion that the plaintiff would obtain the remedies that it had sought
                        (“Issue 3”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I dismissed the application for the reason
                    that JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal Application, or to refuse to
                    grant a new lease was not susceptible to judicial review. For completeness, I
                    will also set out my views on Issue 1 and Issue 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: whether the application was made out of time</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Order 53, r 1(6) of the Rules
                    provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that leave will not be
                    granted to apply for a quashing order unless the application for leave is made
                    within three months after the date of the proceedings, or such other period
                    prescribed by written law, unless the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction
                    of the judge hearing the application for leave. The three month period runs from
                    the time when the right to seek relief arises (see <em>Teng Fuh
                        Holdings Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 568 (“<em>Teng Fuh
                    Holdings</em>”) at [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Order 53, r 1(6) of the Rules only
                    refers to applications for leave to apply for quashing orders. JTC, however,
                    submitted that an application for leave to apply for a mandatory order could
                    also be precluded on the ground of delay. In support of this submission, JTC
                    cited a passage from <em>O’Reilly v Mackman</em>
                    [1983] 2 AC 237 in which Lord Diplock stated the following (at
                    280-281):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The public interest in good administration requires that public
                        authorities and third parties should not be kept in suspense as to the legal
                        validity of a decision the authority has reached in purported exercise of
                        its decision-making powers for any longer than is absolutely in fairness to
                        the person affected by the decision. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The AG took a similar view. The AG referred to <em>Teng
                        Fuh Holdings</em>. In <em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal affirmed a dismissal of an application for leave to apply
                    for a quashing order and a mandatory order on the ground that the application
                    was made out of time (<em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em> at
                        [23] and [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     My view was that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em> accepted, at least
                    impliedly, that a leave application for a mandatory order should also be made
                    without undue delay. The leave application for a mandatory order in <em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em> should have been allowed if the court
                    considered that such applications could be made regardless of any delay, given
                    that the court commented that a serious argument could have been made for leave
                    to be granted if the application had been made in time (<em>Teng
                        Fuh Holdings</em> at [42]). I
                    should add, however, that the three month period prescribed for quashing orders
                    is not necessarily indicative of whether a leave application for a mandatory
                    order was made with undue delay since O 53, r 1(6) does not apply to
                    mandatory orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The application, so far as it concerned the
                    quashing order, was certainly made after the three month period prescribed under
                    O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules. As I noted above (at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>), the three month period under O 53
                    r 1(6) runs from the time when the right to seek relief arises. The
                    application was filed on 2 November 2010. In my view, the plaintiff’s
                    right to seek relief only arose at the time of the Second Rejection Letter which
                    was dated 19 May 2010 and <em>not</em> the time of the
                    First Rejection Letter. Although JTC indicated in the First Rejection Letter
                    that its decision was final, its conduct after that letter suggested that it was
                    open to reconsidering its decision. A clear indication of JTC’s
                    willingness to reconsider its decision may be found in its letter dated
                    29 April 2010 in which JTC informed the plaintiff that EDB and JTC would
                    jointly review the plaintiff’s business plans and give their joint
                    assessment in due course. If the plaintiff’s right to seek relief only
                    arose at the time of the Second Rejection Letter, the application would have
                    been delayed by two and a half months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However, the mere fact that the application
                    was delayed was not determinative. I had to consider whether the
                    plaintiff’s explanation had adequately accounted for the delay (see
                    O 53, r 1(6) of the Rules and above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff argued that it should not be
                    denied leave because of the delay for two reasons. First, the delay was only for
                    a short period that was not comparable to the delay in other cases. Second, it
                    had a good reason for the delay. The plaintiff explained that it only found out
                    during the 16 June 2010 Meeting that its business plan fell short of
                    JTC’s criterion that applicants for waterfront leases must commit to a
                    fixed asset investment of at least a certain minimum amount. JTC did not state
                    the minimum amount that it required. Accordingly, the plaintiff did not, at that
                    time, have sufficient information to determine if JTC’s decision was
                    irrational. The plaintiff further submitted that it only found out in early
                    October 2010 that other tenants had obtained renewals of their leases even
                    though their investments were lower than the amount that the plaintiff had
                    proposed. The plaintiff subsequently found out, through the LYP Injunction
                    Affidavit on 15 October 2010, that JTC’s required minimum amount of
                    fixed asset investment was $100m. The plaintiff submitted that it was only
                    apparent to the plaintiff at that point that it had grounds for impugning
                    JTC’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Both JTC and the AG argued that the
                    plaintiff’s reasons were not satisfactory. JTC argued that the plaintiff
                    could not rely on information about other companies’ leases because it
                    must have been apparent to the plaintiff that each transaction was assessed on a
                    case-by-case basis. JTC also submitted that the plaintiff’s ignorance of
                    its right to seek relief was not an excuse if it had the means to acquire the
                    necessary information. The AG asserted that if the plaintiff’s reasons
                    were accepted, it should only be applying for judicial review on the basis of
                    differential treatment. It should not also be raising procedural impropriety and
                    the alleged representations made by EDB. Those matters were known to the
                    plaintiff within the three month limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I was of the view that the plaintiff had
                    satisfactorily accounted for the two and a half months’ delay in making
                    the application. As a preliminary point, I disagreed with JTC’s submission
                    that the plaintiff’s ignorance of its right to seek relief was entirely
                    irrelevant. O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules to my mind was sufficiently broad
                    to admit an explanation based on ignorance. The question to ask is whether the
                    explanation was satisfactory to the judge hearing the application. The authority
                    that JTC cited in support of its argument, <em>Teng Fuh
                        Holdings</em>, did not stand for the proposition that ignorance is
                    never an acceptable excuse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Teng Fuh
                        Holdings</em>, the applicant had sought a quashing order and a
                    mandatory order in relation to the respondent’s declaration that the
                    applicant’s land was to be acquired for “a public purpose, viz:
                    General Redevelopment” (<em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em>
                    at [2]). The applicant’s complaint
                    was that the land was not redeveloped and was rezoned from industrial use to
                    residential use (<em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em> at [4]). The applicant’s excuse for its
                    extended delay in applying for judicial review was that it did not know that its
                    land was rezoned until September 2004 (<em>Teng Fuh
                        Holdings</em> at [8]). The
                    Court of Appeal rejected this explanation because the information on rezoning
                    was in the public domain, “accessible to everyone who wanted it”,
                    since 1993 (<em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em> at [21]-[22]). In any case, the applicant’s explanation did not
                    account for the delay in relation to the failure to redevelop the land. In
                    relation to that complaint, the applicant had actual knowledge of the failure
                    because it remained in occupation of the land as a licensee (<em>Teng Fuh Holdings</em> at [20]). The Court of Appeal in <em>Teng Fuh
                        Holdings</em> did not go so far as to hold that ignorance could
                        <em>never</em> be a satisfactory explanation. My view
                    was that the appellate court simply held that the applicant’s excuse was
                    not satisfactory because it could easily have found out about the rezoning as
                    that information was in the public domain since 1993. Arguably, the court might
                    have reached a different conclusion if the information was not generally
                    available to the public at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I felt that the plaintiff had adequately
                    accounted for the delay. As counsel for the plaintiff (Thio Shen Yi SC) argued,
                    the alleged discrepancy between the $100m investment commitment that JTC
                    required and the amounts that Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard had committed
                    (“the Alleged Discrepancy”) was the “main catalyst”
                    for the application. The plaintiff only found out about those facts in October
                    2010. The information on the amounts that Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard had
                    committed was not generally available to the public at large. The plaintiff only
                    found out the amount that Cosco had allegedly committed in the course of a
                    discussion with Cosco about possible business cooperation. As for the amount
                    that Asia-Pacific Shipyard had apparently committed, the plaintiff only found
                    out the same by making market inquiries. I accepted that before the plaintiff
                    discovered, by chance, the amount that Cosco had committed, it had no reason to
                    suspect that other tenants had committed to investing less than what the
                    plaintiff had proposed to commit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Admittedly, as the AG pointed out, the
                    plaintiff relied on not just the Alleged Discrepancy but also on facts that it
                    alleged gave rise to a legitimate expectation and breaches of the rules of
                    natural justice. The plaintiff also relied on the conversation that Leung had
                    with Keppel Singmarine’s Hoe (see above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) as support for its allegation that JTC exercised its
                    discretionary power to extend or grant leases irrationally, unreasonably and/or
                    in bad faith. Those facts were known to the plaintiff within the three month
                    time limit from the date of the Second Rejection Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I accepted, however, that the Alleged
                    Discrepancy was, as the plaintiff’s counsel had submitted, the main
                    catalyst for the application (see above at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>). I took this to mean that the plaintiff considered the
                    Alleged Discrepancy to be its strongest basis for judicial review. I inferred
                    that the plaintiff probably decided that it had a good chance of succeeding on
                    the application only after its discovery of the Alleged
                Discrepancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Accordingly, I was of the view that the
                    application, both in relation to the mandatory order and the quashing order,
                    could not be dismissed on the basis of delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: whether JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal
                Application, or to refuse to grant a new lease, was susceptible to judicial review </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The leading authority in Singapore on
                    determining whether a decision is susceptible to judicial review is <em>Linda Lai</em>. <em>Linda Lai</em>
                    involved an application by a former civil servant for leave to apply for a
                    quashing order to quash various decisions by the Public Service Commission
                    (“PSC”), and other public officials and authorities, that led to
                    the termination of her employment and for a mandatory order to reinstate her
                    employment (<em>Linda Lai</em> at [1]). The Court of Appeal allowed the
                    PSC’s appeal and dismissed Linda Lai’s application on the ground
                    that the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review for two reasons.
                    First, the applicant’s complaints concerned PSC’s actions as an
                    employer and not its performance of “public duties or the exercise of its
                    powers as an authority” (<em>Linda Lai</em> at
                        [40]). In other words, the
                    applicant’s complaints involved breaches of contract, for which the
                    applicant had her remedies in private law (<em>Linda
                        Lai</em> at [40]). Second, the
                    source of PSC’s power in making the decisions that the applicant had
                    challenged was the contract of employment (<em>Linda
                        Lai</em> at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>). The source of
                    power of the decision sought to be impugned is one of the tests for determining
                    whether the decision is susceptible to judicial review (“the Source
                    Test”) (<em>Linda Lai</em> at [41]). If the source of power lies in a
                    statute, or subsidiary legislation, the decision will be susceptible to judicial
                    review (<em>Linda Lai</em> at [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Court of Appeal did not suggest that the
                    Source Test is the only test for determining whether a decision is susceptible
                    to judicial review. This is evident from the appellate court’s recognition
                    that the Source Test was “one of the tests” and its citation of
                        <em>Regina v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, Ex Parte
                        Datafin plc And Another</em> [1987] QB 815
                        (“<em>Datafin</em>”) which considered
                    that the Source Test was not the sole test (<em>Linda
                        Lai</em> at [41]). Another
                    test that may be employed is to determine the nature of the power or function
                    performed by the body in question (“the Nature Test”) (<em>Datafin</em> at 847):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But in between these extremes there is an area in which it is helpful to
                        look not just at the source of the power but at the nature of the power.
                            <em>If the body in question is exercising public law
                            functions, or if the exercise of its functions have public law
                            consequences, then that may, as Mr. Lever submitted, be sufficient to
                            bring the body within the reach of judicial review</em>. It may be
                        said that to refer to "public law" in this context is to beg the question.
                        But I do not think it does. The essential distinction, which runs through
                        all the cases to which we referred, is between a domestic or private
                        tribunal on the one hand and a body of persons who are under some public
                        duty on the other. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Nature Test requires the court to consider whether the decision
                    sought to be impugned involved an exercise of “public law
                    functions”. In fact, the first reason for rejecting the application in
                        <em>Linda Lai</em> seemed to be based on an application
                    of the Nature Test. The Court of Appeal appeared to have considered that
                    PSC’s decisions were private in nature because the PSC made those
                    decisions in a “pure master and servant context” and not in the
                    exercise of its “public duties or the exercise of its powers as an
                    authority” (<em>Linda Lai</em> at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     To summarise, two tests may be applied in
                    order to determine whether a decision is susceptible to judicial review. The
                    Source Test requires the court to consider the source of the respondent’s
                    power in making the decision that the applicant seeks to impugn. If the source
                    of power is in a statute or subsidiary legislation, the decision is susceptible
                    to judicial review. The Nature Test requires the court to consider whether the
                    respondent’s decision involved an exercise of public law functions. If so,
                    the decision is susceptible to judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ arguments and the AG’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff argued that JTC’s decision
                    was susceptible to judicial review for three reasons. First, applying the Source
                    Test, JTC was exercising a statutory power in rejecting the Renewal Application.
                    Second, JTC’s decision-making process in relation to applications for
                    leases or the renewal of leases is important to businesses and the public at
                    large and should be closely scrutinised by the court. Third, JTC’s
                    assertion that it was no different from any private landlord contradicted what
                    Loh deposed in the LYP Injunction Affidavit. The LYP Injunction Affidavit also
                    raised considerations that a private landlord would not be concerned with. The
                    plaintiff also relied on Tang’s statement during the 16 June 2010
                    Meeting that JTC, as a statutory authority, would help the marine industry
                    during poor economic conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     JTC submitted that its decision to reject the
                    Renewal Application was not justiciable for three reasons. First, the JTC Act
                    does not limit JTC’s discretion in deciding whether to grant or renew a
                    lease. Second, judicial review is not the plaintiff’s only means of
                    recourse against JTC. Third, the subject matter of JTC’s decision to
                    reject the Renewal Application was purely commercial and
                contractual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The AG submitted that the plaintiff’s
                    dispute with JTC was not a matter of public law and that only disputes
                    concerning public law matters were susceptible to judicial review. The AG relied
                    on both the Source Test and the Nature Test. The AG also referred to Hong Kong
                    case law on disputes involving leases of state-owned land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In relation to the Source Test, I noted that
                    the JTC Act conferred JTC with the power to lease land under s 12(2)(d)
                    which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The Corporation shall have power to do anything for the purpose of the
                        discharge of its functions under this Act or which is incidental or
                        conducive to the discharge of those functions and, in particular, may
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) sell or lease land and premises for the purpose of the discharge of
                        its functions under this Act upon such terms as the Corporation may
                        determine;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, neither the JTC Act, nor any subsidiary legislation made
                    pursuant to that Act, prescribes the terms on which JTC may lease land and the
                    considerations that JTC should take into account in exercising its powers. In
                    fact, s 12(2)(d) of the JTC Act expressly states that JTC may sell or lease
                    land on such terms as it may determine. It should be noted too that
                    s 12(2)(d) also provides that the sale or lease of land must be for the
                    purpose of the discharge of its functions under the JTC Act. JTC’s
                    functions are spelt out in s 12(1) of the JTC Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Functions and powers of Corporation</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12. —(1) The functions of the Corporation are —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) to develop and manage sites, parks, estates, townships and other
                        premises for industries and businesses in Singapore or elsewhere;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) to provide facilities to enhance the operations of industries and
                        businesses including social amenities for the advancement and the well-being
                        of persons living and working in such sites, parks, estates and townships or
                        otherwise; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) to participate in overseas ventures and developments which the
                        Corporation has the expertise to engage or undertake in.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I decided that the source of JTC’s power
                    in declining to grant a new lease or rejecting the Renewal Application did not
                    lie completely in a statute or subsidiary legislation. JTC’s power to
                    lease was ultimately derived from the JTC Act. Therefore, JTC’s decision
                    had statutory underpinnings. However, this did not necessarily mean that
                    JTC’s decision was susceptible to judicial review. As the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Linda Lai</em> pointed out, it is not necessarily
                    the case that statutory bodies exercise statutory powers when they make
                    decisions (<em>Linda Lai</em> at [44]). Every action of a statutory body must,
                    ultimately, have some basis in the relevant statute. The question is whether, in
                    the circumstances, the body was exercising statutory powers when it made the
                    decisions sought to be challenged (see <em>Linda Lai</em>
                    at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     My view was that when JTC decided not to grant
                    a new lease and not to allow the Renewal Application, it was exercising its
                    private contractual rights under the Head Lease and the Lease respectively. As
                    mentioned above (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>), the JTC Act
                    did not prescribe any detailed criteria to guide JTC’s exercise of its
                    power apart from the general requirement that the exercise had to be “for
                    the purpose of the discharge of its functions” under the JTC Act.
                    Instead, JTC, just like any private landlord, came up with its own criteria for
                    determining whether to grant a new lease. As Loh deposed, JTC used “a
                    range of qualitative and quantitative factors” to reach its decision. Loh
                    further deposed that these criteria were not prescribed by any statute or
                    subsidiary legislation. Indeed, neither party directed me to any statute or
                    subsidiary legislation that further detailed the criteria that JTC was to take
                    into account. The source of JTC’s power to stipulate the factors, and its
                    application of those factors to reach its decisions, must lie in the Head Lease
                    and the Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Nature Test also led me to conclude that
                    JTC’s decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. I did not think
                    that JTC was performing “public law” functions when it decided not
                    to grant a new lease or to reject the Renewal Application. JTC was not doing
                    something that a private individual would not be capable of doing. JTC purchased
                    a lease of land from the State and entered into leases of shorter terms with
                    tenants like the plaintiff. JTC set its own criteria in deciding whether to
                    grant new leases or to extend existing leases. Admittedly, as the plaintiff had
                    argued, JTC’s criteria included non-commercial considerations. However, I
                    did not think that the mere fact that JTC took into account factors such as the
                    “quality of jobs generated” and the “value add to the GDP
                    [Gross Domestic Product] of Singapore” meant that it was exercising a
                    public law function. Private landowners may also take into account such
                    non-commercial considerations in deciding whether to lease their
                land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I found support for my application of the
                    Nature Test in a Hong Kong authority cited by the AG. In <em>Anderson Asphalt Ltd v The Secretary for Justice</em> [2009]
                    3 HKLRD 215 (“<em>Anderson
                    Asphalt</em>”), the Hong Kong Court of First Instance was faced
                    with an application for judicial review of a public authority’s decision
                    to grant a short-term waiver of the land use restrictions on certain plots of
                    land. The court had to consider a preliminary issue of whether the
                    authority’s decisions were amenable to judicial review. The court
                    proceeded to extensively review the relevant Hong Kong case law on the subject
                    (at [38]-[56]). Of particular relevance was the court’s astute
                    observation that the mere fact that a public authority took into account public
                    interest considerations does not necessarily mean that the authority’s
                    decision is susceptible to judicial review (at [78]). The observation was made
                    in the context of an argument that assumed that the mere fact that the public
                    authority took into account planning considerations meant that its decision was
                    amenable to judicial review (at [73]).
                    The court’s observation (at [78]) is worth reproducing here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Free from authority, again, the fallacy of the argument lies in assuming
                        that whenever some element of public interest or benefit or some published
                        public policy is involved, the decision in question must be a public law
                        one. <em>No, the true question is whether some public
                            element(s) of sufficient weight is/are present in a particular case so
                            as to render the function performed a public one, and the decision made
                            a public law decision amenable to judicial review</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court’s conclusion (at [79]) was that the public
                    authority’s decision was not amenable to judicial review. <em>Anderson Asphalt</em> was affirmed on appeal to the Hong Kong
                    Court of Appeal (see <em>Anderson Asphalt and others v The
                        Secretary for Justice</em> [2010] HKCA 185 at [61] (“<em>Anderson
                        Asphalt (HKCA)</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I should mention that a line of cases in Hong
                    Kong has held that the Hong Kong government’s refusal to renew
                    “special purpose leases” was amenable to judicial review (see
                        <em>Anderson Asphalt</em> at [49]-[50] citing <em>Hong Kong and China Gas Co Ltd v
                        Director of Lands</em> [1997] HKC 502 and <em>Kam Lan Koon v Secretary for Justice</em> [1999] 3 HKC 591;
                    also see <em>Anderson Asphalt (HKCA)</em> at [42]-[51]). I did not think that those cases were relevant because
                    they turned on rather unique facts. Those cases involved an express policy
                    statement by the Hong Kong government on how the extension of such special
                    purpose leases would be dealt with upon the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 (see
                        <em>Anderson Asphalt (HKCA)</em> at [50]-[51]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I agreed with the observation in <em>Anderson Asphalt</em> that the mere fact that a public
                    authority took into account considerations that were public in nature did not
                    necessarily mean that it was exercising public law functions. Whether the
                    consideration of such factors would make the public authority’s decision
                    susceptible to judicial review is ultimately a matter of degree. For the reasons
                    explained above (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>), I felt that
                    JTC’s decisions in the present case were not sufficiently of a public
                    nature. JTC was acting as any private landlord would in granting and renewing
                    leases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In summary, my view was that JTC’s
                    decisions were not susceptible to judicial review on both the Source Test and
                    the Nature Test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: whether the material before the court disclosed a prima
                facie case of reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff would obtain the remedies that
                it has sought</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Given my conclusion that JTC’s decisions
                    in this matter were not susceptible to judicial review, it was not strictly
                    necessary for me to consider Issue 3. I will however set out my views on Issue 3
                    for completeness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I have already described the threshold test
                    that was applied in dealing with the application (see above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>). I will now elaborate on the law governing
                    the grounds of the plaintiff’s challenge. As explained later, the
                    plaintiff had raised two broad grounds: (i) irrationality; and (ii) procedural
                    impropriety. I pause here to note that the plaintiff’s claim of procedural
                    impropriety was essentially a claim that it was deprived of a legitimate
                    expectation in two respects. First, the plaintiff claimed that it was deprived
                    of a legitimate expectation that the Lease would be renewed. Second, the
                    plaintiff alleged that it had a legitimate expectation that it would be able to
                    make representations to JTC when the latter conducted a fresh evaluation of its
                    business plans after the First Rejection Letter was issued. The plaintiff argued
                    that this second legitimate expectation was also defeated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law on irrationality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The test that is frequently applied to
                    determine if a decision was irrational is found in <em>Associated
                        Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation</em> [1948]
                    1 KB 223 (“the <em>Wednesbury</em>
                    Test”). The following passage from the decision is helpful (at
                    229):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does
                        that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation
                        to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word "unreasonable" in a
                        rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently
                        used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For
                        instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct
                        himself properly in law. <em>He must call his own attention
                            to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his
                            consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to
                            consider</em>. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be
                        said, and often is said, to be acting "unreasonably." <em>Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person
                            could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the
                            authority</em>. Warrington L.J. in <em>Short</em> v <em>. Poole Corporation</em>
                        gave the example of the red-haired teacher, dismissed because she had red
                        hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In another sense it is taking into
                        consideration extraneous matters. It is so unreasonable that it might almost
                        be described as being done in bad faith; and, in fact, all these things run
                        into one another. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is to be noted that the <em>Wednesbury</em>
                    Test has been endorsed in numerous Singapore cases (see, for example, <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin</em> at [39], <em>Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister
                        for Home Affairs and another</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at
                    [94] and <em>Mir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman and another v

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   
        <em>The law on legitimate
                    expectations</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In broad terms, a legitimate expectation in
                    administrative law refers to an expectation that one would be conferred with a
                    benefit even though one might not have a legal right to that benefit (<em>Council of Civil Service Unions and others v Minister for the Civil
                        Service</em> [1985] AC 274 at 401 (per Lord Fraser of
                    Tullybelton)). The term “legitimate expectation” is actually used,
                    at least in English law, in two contexts (see Lord Woolf <em>et
                        al</em>, <em>De Smith’s Judicial
                        Review</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Edition, 2007)
                        (“<em>De Smith’s</em>”) at para
                    12-002). The first context concerns procedural fairness. It would be a ground
                    for judicial review if the applicant was deprived of a legitimate expectation
                    without providing him with a fair hearing (see, generally, <em>De
                        Smith’s</em> at paras 12-003–12-010). In the second
                    context, the protection of the legitimate expectation extends beyond according
                    the applicant a fair hearing (see, generally, <em>De
                        Smith’s</em> at paras 12-011–12-014). The second context
                    is controversial because of the presence of competing tensions. The need to
                    check against inconsistent treatment must be balanced against the undesirable
                    effects of excessively fettering administrative discretion (see <em>De Smith’s</em> at para 12-012). The plaintiff seemed
                    to me to be relying on both aspects of the concept of legitimate expectation
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I entertain some doubt as to whether the
                    second understanding of legitimate expectations is part of our law. For our
                    purpose however it does not matter as neither JTC nor the AG submitted on the
                    issue of legitimate expectations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The plaintiff supported its claim of
                    irrationality by pointing to four aspects of JTC’s decision-making
                    process. First, JTC acted inconsistently by extending the leases of Cosco and
                    Asia-Pacific Shipyard even though they fell short of JTC’s requirement
                    that its tenants commit to investing at least $100m in fixed asset investment.
                    Second, JTC took into account extraneous considerations in making its decision.
                    The criteria that Loh deposed JTC applied in assessing lease renewal
                    applications did not include a consideration of any arrears by the applicant or
                    unauthorised subletting on the applicant’s part. Yet, JTC claimed that it
                    took into account the plaintiff’s previous arrears and unauthorised
                    subletting in making its decision. Third, Tang’s comments at the 16 June
                    2010 Meeting (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) showed that
                    JTC’s decision-making process lacked rationality in that it took into
                    account an irrelevant factor and/or unnecessarily fettered its discretion.
                    Fourth, the alleged encounter that the plaintiff had with Keppel Singmarine (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) gave the plaintiff a reasonable
                    suspicion that JTC had acted in bad faith towards the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The plaintiff’s arguments on procedural
                    impropriety have already been summarised above at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> and need not be repeated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     JTC’s response was that the
                    plaintiff’s allegations of unfair treatment were illogical for two
                    reasons. First, every case must be assessed on its own merits and so the
                    plaintiff’s comparison of its treatment with that of its neighbours was
                    irrelevant. Second, the plaintiff had no basis for its allegation that JTC sent
                    Keppel Singmarine, or collaborated with it, to threaten the plaintiff. Third,
                    the plaintiff exaggerated the meaning of the comments made at the 16 June 2010
                    Meeting. JTC also argued that the plaintiff had an opportunity to be heard
                    because the Renewal Application and the plaintiff’s appeals against
                    JTC’s rejection were thoroughly considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The AG did not make any submissions on Issue
                    3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The court’s view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I was of the view that the plaintiff had
                    satisfied the <em>Colin Chan</em> Test (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>) in relation to the ground of
                    irrationality. I thought that the plaintiff’s version of events gave rise
                    to a <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion that
                    it would be entitled to the remedies it sought after a full hearing. The
                        <em>Wednesbury</em> Test (see above at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>) may well be satisfied for at least the
                    following reason. JTC extended the leases of Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard
                    even though they did not meet JTC’s apparent criteria on fixed asset
                    investments. Arguably, no reasonable public authority would act so
                    inconsistently. I should emphasise that I was assuming that the plaintiff would
                    be able to establish its allegation that JTC had a definite criteria of
                    requiring at least $100m in fixed asset investments (see above at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>). The plaintiff’s allegation in this
                    respect was not entirely without basis. It was able to point to the LYP
                    Injunction Affidavit to support its allegation (see above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>). I must add, however, that I was aware that
                    Loh’s affidavit in these proceedings explained that JTC actually
                    considered a range of factors and not just the amount of fixed asset
                    investments. Loh also gave an explanation of the context in which he made the
                    LYP Injunction Affidavit (see above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>). His explanation might also be accepted after a full
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As for the ground of judicial review based on
                    legitimate expectations, I did not think that the plaintiff’s claim that
                    it was deprived of a legitimate expectation that it could make representations
                    to JTC satisfied the <em>Colin Chan</em> Test. I accepted
                    JTC’s argument that the plaintiff made several representations to JTC, EDB
                    and other entities. As I mentioned earlier (see above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>), the plaintiff wrote several letters to JTC
                    and EDB between November 2009 and June 2010. The plaintiff’s broader claim
                    of a legitimate expectation (<em>i.e</em>. the second
                    understanding of legitimate expectations set out at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>), however, satisfied the <em>Colin
                        Chan</em> Test. The plaintiff might be able to convince the court
                    hearing the merits that the second understanding applied in Singapore. The
                    plaintiff might also be able to prove that the various representations which it
                    claimed JTC or EDB made were in fact made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In summary, my view on Issue 3 was that the
                        <em>Colin Chan</em> Test was satisfied in relation to
                    the grounds of irrationality and deprivation of a legitimate expectation that
                    the Lease would be renewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In the final analysis however, it did not
                    matter that the plaintiff had adequately accounted for its delay or that it had
                    placed sufficient material before me to raise a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion. I dismissed the application
                    because JTC’s decisions to reject the Renewal Application and not to grant
                    a new lease over the Premises were not susceptible to judicial
                review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Consequently, I awarded costs to JTC and the
                    AG fixed at $3,500 each excluding disbursements which were to be paid by the
                    plaintiff on a reimbursement basis.</p>
