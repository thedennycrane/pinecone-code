        This was an interlocutory appeal against the

decision of the district judge ordering that certain prayers in the plaintiff’s

amended statement of claim be struck out. In brief, the appeal before me was concerned

mainly with the plaintiff’s contention that he had been prevented from seeking a

declaration that his dismissal by the defendants was contrary to the principles of natural

justice as he was dismissed without a hearing although his contract of employment

obligated his employers to give him a hearing. I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal

insofar as the said prayer was concerned, holding that the said issue be best determined

at the main trial. There were two other prayers under appeal. In relation to the

plaintiff’s second prayer for an order for reinstatement in his former employment, I

upheld the decision below without prejudice to whatever reliefs the trial court may deem

fit to order under prayer 7. As regards prayer 3, I allowed the appeal. The facts which

gave rise to this appeal and my grounds are as follows.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background facts</font>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The plaintiff had been in the employment of

Singapore Airlines Limited (SIA), the defendants herein, from 1973 until his services were

terminated in March 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        Admittedly, sometime in the course of 1996, the

plaintiff was investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau; arrested on 18

February 1997 and charged in court. As he was unable to raise the bail amount, he was

remanded in Queenstown Remand Prison until the conclusion of his trial and subsequent

acquittal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        As it happened, whilst the plaintiff was in

remand, he received a letter from the defendants dated 5 March 1997. The relevant part

therein reads:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">Dear Mr Clement,</font></p>
<p align="justify">           You have

  not reported for work since 21 February 1997 nor have you given the Company any reason for

  your unauthorised absence. You have therefore broken your contract of service with the

  Company and your employment is terminated with effect from 21 February 1997. Your last day

  of service was, therefore, 20 February 1997.</p>
<p align="justify">2.        Consequent on your

  termination, you will be paid your salary up to and including 20 February 1997.</p>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">5

        Following his acquittal of the charges in June

1997, the plaintiff sought reinstatement with the defendants but to no avail. Furthermore

no agreement was reached between the parties on the compensation package. The plaintiffs

then took out a suit - D C Suit 4989 of 1997 in November 1997 - against the defendants

claiming damages for his alleged wrongful dismissal. However, about six months later, he

sought the intervention of the Singapore Airlines Staff Union (SIASU) to bring his

grievance before the Industrial Arbitration Court. SIASU declined his request stating that

they could not justify an appeal under s 35(1) of the Industrial Relations Act.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The plaintiff’s application to the court

for a declaration and an order to compel SIASU to act pursuant to his request, was

unsuccessful in the first instance as well as on appeal to the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The Court of Appeal, in dismissing his appeal,

observed at para 14 of its judgment that ‘… while it may well be the case that a

contract exists between the SIASU and the appellant that the rules of a trade union form

the terms of such contract between the parties, the judge was correct to hold that article

3.2(iii) is not a term in the constitution capable of being enforced by a court of

law.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        The Court of Appeal further commented at para

28: ‘While we sympathise somewhat with the appellant’s position given the

circumstances under which he lost his job, we cannot find a legal basis on which to make

the declarations he applied for which compel the SIASU to make arrangement such that his

case may be brought before the IAC. If at all, the proper party against whom the appellant

should pursue his redress, if he feels that he has been done wrong by, is Singapore

Airlines. In the premises, we dismiss the appeal with costs to be taxed.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        The upshot was the resuscitation of the

plaintiff’s action against the defendants and by Summons-In-Chambers No 612285 of

2000 dated 1 September 2000, the plaintiff applied to court for leave to amend his

statement of claim. Insofar as is material, the proposed amendments included the following

segments:</font></p>

        The defendants would not let the application go

uncontested. They for their part took out a cross application (SIC No. 612790 of 2000) to

strike out the plaintiff’s action as well as the plaintiff’s proposed amendments

on grounds of want of prosecution and that the plaintiff’s claim disclosed no

reasonable cause of action, was frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of

court.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        The result was on 24 November 2000, both

applications were heard by the Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts, Terence Chua,

who after dismissing the defendants’ application to strike out the plaintiff’s

claim, granted leave to the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim as prayed for by

him. The duly amended statement of claim was filed by the plaintiff on 4 December 2000.</font></p>

Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts, Ng Peng Hong on 18 January 2002. Upon

answering the questions of law framed in paras 5(1) and 5(2) of the defendants’

application (see para 15 herein - highlighted parts) in the negative, the Deputy Registrar

ordered that prayers 11 (1)(e), (2) and (3) of the plaintiff’s amended statement of

claim be struck out. At the same time, the Deputy Registrar also dismissed the application

of the plaintiff (SIC No 600037 of 2002).</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        The effect of the decisions of the Deputy

Registrar was that the plaintiff could not contend at the trial that his dismissal was in

breach of the rules of natural justice; (prayer 11(1)(e)); he could not claim an order for

reinstatement in his former employment (prayer 11(2)); and that he could not claim loss of

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        The plaintiff’s application for the

amendment was objected to by defendants’ counsel. I found the objection unmeritorious

since it was plain that his notice of appeal was comprehensive to cover the whole of the

district judge’s decision which dealt with the plaintiff’s as well as the

defendants’ earlier applications. In any event, in my view, the plaintiff could have

argued his appeal even without an order to amend his notice of appeal since I found his

earlier notice of appeal to be all embracing. Consequently, I ruled that the plaintiff be

allowed to canvass the points contained in his application for amendment. In this milieu,

the appeal was argued before me.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Arguments</font></p>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        On appeal, the point of contention by the

plaintiff was that the principles extracted from <i><b>Ridge v Baldwin</b></i> (<i>supra</i>),

<i><b>Vasudevan Pillai</b></i> (<i>supra</i>) and <i><b>Lim Tow Peng</b></i> (<i>supra</i>)

should not be viewed in isolation. He suggested that the facts and circumstances of the

cases referred to bore little resemblance to his case and that the provisions of the

personnel procedure manual which required the defendants to conduct a hearing before an

employee’s services could be terminated, took the case out of the ambit of the

principles cited to the court. He further suggested that the terms of his contract

obligated his employers to give him a hearing; their failure and the implications arising

therefrom could not be appreciated without him being able to canvass the breach of one of

the important terms of his contract of employment. Implicit in his contention was the

aspect that had his employers given him a hearing he would have been able to demonstrate

to them that his absence from work was not unauthorised and that he had broken none of his

contractual obligations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        Counsel for the defendants contended otherwise.

He submitted that the law had already been well-settled and that there was no room for the

principles of natural justice in a pure master and servant relationship.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Law and conclusion</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        As I said earlier, the appeal before me

revolved around the rulings contained in an order made by the learned district judge on 11

April 2002 in relation to two questions of law, submitted to the court by the

defendant’s counsel, and the consequential striking out of certain prayers for relief

ie, prayers 11(1)(e); (2) and (3) of the plaintiff’s statement of claim (see para 9

herein – highlighted parts).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        The first question submitted to the court below

by counsel for the defendants was: whether the contract of employment between the

plaintiff and the defendants gave rise to the principle of <i>audi alteram partem</i> or

the principles of natural justice. Simply stated, the question was whether the plaintiff

should have been accorded a hearing by his employers before his services were terminated.

The plaintiff’s contention before me was that this issue could not be decided in a

vacuum, without determining first whether the personnel procedure manual of SIA (adverted

to by the plaintiff in his statement of claim) which seemed to require a hearing before

termination, applied to the plaintiff’s employment contract. He said that he intended

to call witnesses to support his contention that the said personnel procedure manual was

part and parcel of the plaintiff’s employment contract as had been applied by the

defendants over the years to many of their employees.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        It would be useful at this stage to revisit the

principles of law relied on by the defendants in the courts below.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        In <i><b>Ridge v Baldwin</b></i> (<i>supra</i>),

the facts as they appear in the headnotes are as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        In 1956 the appellant was appointed chief

constable of a borough police force, the appointment being subject to the Police Acts and

Regulations. On October 25 1957, he was arrested and charged, together with other persons,

with conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice. On October 28 1957, he was suspended

from duty by the borough watch committee. On February 28 1958, he was acquitted by the

jury on the criminal charges against him but Donovan J, in passing sentence on two police

officers who were convicted, said that the facts admitted in the course of the trial

established that neither of them had that professional and moral leadership which they

should have had and were entitled to expect from the chief ‘constable.’ </font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">32

        On March 6 1958, on a charge alleging

corruption against the appellant, on which no evidence was offered, the judge referred to

the borough’s police force and remarked on its need for a leader who would be a new

influence and who would set a different example from that which had lately obtained.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        After his acquittal, the appellant applied to

be reinstated. However, on March 7 1958, the watch committee (constituted under s 191 of

the Municipal Corporations Act and had certain powers to hire and fire borough

consultants) at a meeting decided that he had been negligent in the discharge of his

duties as chief constable and in purported exercise of the powers conferred on them by s

191 (4) of the Act of 1882, dismissed him from that office. Section 191 of the Municipal

Corporations Act, 1882 provided: (1) "The watch committee shall from time to time

appoint a sufficient number of fit men to be borough constables … (4) The watch

committee … may at any time suspend, and … dismiss, any borough constable whom

they think negligent in the discharge of his duty, or otherwise unfit for the same."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        It must be observed at this stage that no

specific charge was formulated against the appellant either at that meeting or at another

on March 18, when the appellant’s solicitor addressed the committee, but the watch

committee, in arriving at their decision, considered (inter alia) his own statements in

evidence and the observations made by Donovan J on February 28 and March 6. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        On the appellant’s appeal to the Home

Secretary, the decision given was that there was sufficient material on which the watch

committee could properly exercise their power of dismissal under section 191 (4). The

appellant then brought an action against members of the watch committee for a declaration

that his dismissal was illegal, ultra vires and void, and payment of salary from March 7

1958, or alternatively, payment of pension from that date and damages.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        On appeal, the House of Lords (per Lord Reid,

Lord Evershed, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, Lord Hodson and Lord Devlin - with Lord

Evershed dissenting) held that the decision of the respondents to dismiss the appellant

was null and void; and that, accordingly, notwithstanding that the decision of the Home

Secretary was ‘final and binding on the parties’ by s 2 (3) of the Police

Appeals Act 1927, that decision could not give validity to the decision of the

respondents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        It was further held by Lord Reid, Lord Morris

and Lord Hodson at page 42 that:</font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">As the appellant was not

    the servant of the respondents and they could dismiss him only on grounds stated in

    section 191 (4) of the Act of 1882, and they dismissed him on the ground of neglect of

    duty, they were bound to observe the principles of natural justice (post, pp. 66, 79, 121,

    124, 127, 132) by informing the appellant of the charges made against him and giving him

    an opportunity of being heard, and that they had not done.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        In his speech, Lord Reid observed at page 65:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><i>       

    The law regarding master and servant is not in doubt. There cannot be specific performance

    of a contract of service, and the master can terminate the contract with his servant at

    any time and for any reason or for none</i>. But if he does so in a manner not warranted

    by the contract he must pay damages for breach of contract. So the question in a pure case

    of master and servant does not at all depend on whether the master has heard the servant

    in his own defence: it depends on whether the facts emerging at the trial prove breach of

    contract. <i>But this kind of case can resemble dismissal from an office where the body

    employing the man is under some statutory or other restriction as to the kind of contract

    which it can make with its servants, or the grounds on which it can dismiss them</i>. The

    present case does not fall within this class because a chief constable is not the servant

    of the watch committee or indeed of anyone else.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        In that case, the appellants who were daily

rated unskilled employees of the respondent council, had been dismissed without due notice

for refusing to obey an order given to them by a <i>serang</i> (headman) on behalf of the

respondents. Before their dismissal, an inquiry into the incident was held by an officer

of the respondents. The appellants appealed against their dismissal to a sub-committee of

the establishments committee of the respondents which dismissed their appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        Following this, the appellants sought a

declaration that their dismissal had been wrongful and that they were still in the employ

of the respondents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        At the trial, the appellants had put in

evidence, with consent, some of the rules formulated by the respondents with regard to the

recruitment, engagement and discipline of the staff. The appellants contended first, that

the rules were expressly or by implication part of the terms of employment, or that they

were so made by the operation of statute or some statutory instrument having the like

effect. Alternatively they contended that they were entitled to the benefit of the

statutory instrument and entitled to sue for its breach. Secondly, upon the construction

of the rules, before they were dismissed they were entitled to an inquiry to which the

rules of natural justice applied. Thirdly, that these rules of natural justice had not

been observed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

    The matter stands thus. Assuming that contrary to their Lordships’ opinion the

    appellants can rely upon the rules either as part of the contract of employment or as a

    statutory instrument on which they are entitled to rely how far does this assist them?</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><i>        </i></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">Their Lordships have already pointed out that the

    relationship of master and servant or employer and employee gives rise to no application

    of the principle of audi alteram partem on dismissal. <i>Therefore the court, in

    construing the rules (for it is purely a matter of construction) must consider in the

    first place whether those rules were introduced to give rights to the employee or only to

    council and their officers and to provide guidance for the heads of departments</i>. Even

    the second construction would no doubt provide substantial protection for the employees in

    the security of their employment particularly against possibly petty-minded immediate

    superiors who might otherwise take an ill advised and presumptuous course to discipline or

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47

        The appellants were informed that their

services had been terminated after due investigation into their misconduct. In fact no

enquiry was made on the appellants of any alleged misconduct on their part; nor were they

told of the nature of any alleged misconduct on their part. They were not given any

opportunity to be heard concerning any alleged misconduct on their part. The appellants

claimed a declaration that their purported dismissal by the respondents was inoperative,

null and void and alternatively for damages. At the trial it was conceded that the

dismissal of the appellants was wrongful and that the respondents were liable to pay such

damages as the court may assess. The learned trial judge held that the appellants were

entitled to damages but declined to make the declaratory order sought by the appellants.

The appellants appealed.</font></p>

        In delivering the judgment of the Court of

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    The appellants’ case was based mainly on the provisions of section 14 of the

    Employment Act. Put shortly, it was this: that the respondents having failed to comply

    with section 14, their breach of that section entitled the appellants to a Declaratory

    Order on the authority of <i>Vine’s</i> case.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    Section 14 in its present form came into effect on September 1, 1973 and it is quite

    obviously based, to some extent, on the "unfair dismissal" provisions of the

    Industrial Relations Act, 1971 of England, which has placed a statutory limitation on the

    employer’s common law right to dismiss, whether by notice or for cause, which

    limitation has been described as the right of an employee to object to an "unfair

    dismissal." The provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1971 are much more

    comprehensive than Part II of our Employment Act and it is unnecessary to consider them

    save to point out that even under that Act, an employee who considers that he has been

    unfairly dismissed has no right to go to court and ask for reinstatement but may present a

    complaint to an industrial tribunal. If the tribunal finds that the complaint is well

    founded and considers that it would be practicable and in accordance with equity for the

    complainant to be re-engaged by the employer, the tribunal may make a recommendation to

    that effect, stating the terms on which it considers that it would be reasonable for the

    complainant to be so engaged. Otherwise, if it thinks the claim well founded but</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4"> </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">does not make such a recommendation, or if the recommendation so made is not

    complied with, the tribunal makes an award of compensation. (Section 106 of the Industrial

    Relations Act, 1971).</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    It will be seen that the refusal of the ordinary courts under the common law specifically

    to enforce a contract of employment where the employment has been wrongfully terminated

    has been dealt with in England by the legislature in the remedies available for unfair

    dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act, 1971. And this refusal has also been dealt

    with by our legislature in the remedies now available in Singapore for unfair dismissal

    from employment under section 14 of the Employment Act. Under section 14, an employee who

    considers that he has been unfairly dismissed, may present a complaint to the Minister who

    has the power to direct the employer to reinstate the employee in his former employment.

    The section gives a dissatisfied employee the right to complain to the Minister. It is a

    right to object to an unfair dismissal. The section does not give him any other right. It

    does not confer on an employee any status. It does, of course, indirectly restrict the

    employer’s right to dismiss in that the dismissal can be enquired into and overruled

    by the Minister if a complaint is made to him. And it gives the Minister, not the courts,

    the power to order reinstatement of the employee. In our judgment the provisions of

    section 14 are not mandatory. An employer is not obliged to comply with section 14 but if

    he disregards section 14 and dismisses an employee without an enquiry, as in this case,

    the dismissal can be enquired into and reinstatement with full pay ordered by the Minister

    whose decision cannot be challenged in any court. The effect of section 14 is that a

    dismissal without notice before due enquiry is wrongful and not that it is ineffective or

    null and void.</font></p>

        The principles that can be gathered from the

foregoing cases are these: Firstly, there cannot be any specific performance of a contract

of service; an employer can terminate the contract with his servant at any time for any

reason or for none but if he does in a manner not warranted by the contract he must pay

damages for the breach of contract (see Lord Reid’s speech in <i><b>Ridge v Baldwin</b></i>

at page 65, <i>supra</i>); secondly, the onus would be on the claimant to establish that

the relevant rules support his case that the principles of natural justice applied before

he could be validly dismissed (see <i><b>Vasudevan Pillai</b></i> – headnote held No.

1 and the comments of Lord Upjohn at page 19, <i>supra</i>); and thirdly if an employer

were to dismiss an employee in breach of s 14 of the employment, only the Minister has the

power to reinstate the employee in his former employment; and the effect of the said s 14

is that a dismissal without notice before enquiry is wrongful and not that it is

ineffective or null and void (see <i><b>Lim Tow Peng</b></i> – per Choor Singh J at

page 257, <i>supra</i>).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51

        I must also mention at this stage that the

principles articulated by Lord Reid in <i><b>Ridge v Baldwin</b></i> came up for

consideration before the House of Lords in <i><b>Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation</b></i>

[1971] 1 WLR 1578 (the appeal committee comprising Lord Reid, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest,

Lord Guest, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Simon of Glaisdale). In that case, a Scottish

teacher whose terms of employment were set out mainly in statute, appealed to the House of

Lords against the decision of the education committee dismissing him without a hearing. In

allowing his appeal, Lord Wilberforce in his speech at page 1597B-E observed:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><b><p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

  In <i>Ridge</i> v. <i>Baldwin</i> my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, said [1964] A.C.

  40, 65: "It has always been held, I think rightly, that such an officer" (sc.

  one holding at pleasure) "has no right to be heard before being dismissed." As a

  general principle, I respectfully agree: and I think it is important not to weaken a

  principle which, for reasons of public policy, applies, at least as a starting point, to

  so wide a range of the public service. The difficulty arises when, as here, there are

  other incidents of the employment laid down by statute, or regulations, or code of

  employment, or agreement. The rigour of the principle is often, in modern practice

  mitigated for it has come to be perceived that the very possibility of dismissal without

  reason being given – action which may vitally affect a man’s career or his

  pension – makes it all the more important for him, in suitable circumstances, to be

  able to state his case and, if denied the right to do so, to be able to have his dismissal

  declared void. So, while the courts will necessarily respect the right, for good reasons

  of public policy, to dismiss without assigned reasons, this should not, in my opinion,

  prevent them from examining the framework and context of the employment to see whether

  elementary rights are conferred upon him expressly or by necessary implication, and how

  far these extend. The present case is, in my opinion, just such a case where there are

  strong indications that a right to be heard, in appropriate circumstances, should not be

  denied.</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52

        Further, it seems that at present, the common

law, moving in step with the statutory unfair dismissal jurisdiction and modern ideas of

personnel management, has indicated a somewhat wider scope to the need for an unbiased

hearing. In <b><i>Stevenson</i> <i>v</i> <i>United Road Transport Union</i> </b>[1977] 2 All ER 941 (CA), the plaintiff, a full-time employee of the defendant trade union, was

dismissed by its executive after disciplinary proceedings. His claim that his dismissal

was invalid because he was not given an adequate opportunity to defend himself, was upheld

by the Court of Appeal. Buckley LJ reformulated the principle after a full review of the

authorities, in the following terms, at pages 948 and 949:</font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">      

  Counsel for the union has contended that the principles applicable here are those

  applicable to the dismissal of a servant by his master, where, as Lord Reid pointed out in

  <i>Ridge v Baldwin</i>, the master is under no obligation to hear the servant in his own

  defence (and see <i>Malloch v Aberdeen Corpn</i>, per Lord Reid). Counsel for the union

  contends that there is no circumstance in this case which elevates the plaintiff’s

  position to that of an officer whose tenure of his office or whose status as an officer

  cannot be terminated without his being given an opportunity to answer any charges made

  against him or any criticisms of him or of his conduct. In our opinion, it does not much

  help to solve the problem to try to place the plaintiff in the category of a servant, on

  the one hand, or of an officer, on the other. It is true that in <i>Ridge v Baldwin</i>

  Lord Reid divided cases of dismissal into three classes: (1) dismissal of a servant by his

  master; (2) dismissal from an office held during pleasure, and (3) dismissal from an

  office when there must be something against a man to warrant his dismissal; but he goes</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns=""> </font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><i>on in the next paragraph to point out

  that, although in ‘a pure master and servant case’ the master need not hear the

  servant in his own defence, dismissal of a servant by a master can resemble dismissal from

  an office where the body employing the man is under some statutory or other restriction as

  to the grounds on which it can dismiss its servants.</i></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns=""> </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">Moreover, the problem is not confined to termination of contracts of employment.

  It may arise in relation to the termination or denial of a privilege, as in <i>Russell v

  Duke of Norfolk</i>, or of an office which does not involve any contract of employment, as

  in <i>Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union</i>. In our judgment, a useful test can be

  formulated in this way. <i>Where one party has a discretionary power to terminate the

  tenure or enjoyment by another of an employment or an office or a post or a privilege, is

  that power conditional on the party invested with the power being first satisfied on a

  particular point which involves investigating some matter on which the other party ought

  in fairness to be heard or to be allowed to give his explanation or put his case?</i> If

  the answer to the question is Yes, then unless, before the power purports to have been

  exercised, the condition has been satisfied after the other party has been given a fair

  opportunity of being heard or of giving his explanation or putting his case, the power

  will not have been well exercised. [Emphasis added]</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">53

        Reverting to the appeal at hand, the issue that

is to be decided in the main trial of the present case would be, whether it was the

defendants who had committed a breach of their contract of employment as is being alleged

by the plaintiff or it was the plaintiff who had broken his terms of employment as is

being claimed by the defendants in their letter of dismissal dated 5 March 1977. The

plaintiff’s averments in his various affidavits and pleadings suggest that he had not

breached any of the terms of his employment, his employers knew the reasons for his

absence from work and had they given him a hearing – which he maintains ought to have

given him under the provisions of the personnel procedure manual that forms part of his

contract of service – he would have proven to them that his absence was not

unauthorized, not improper and not in breach of his terms of employment.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54

        In my view, a judicial evaluation of the

contestants’ mutual obligations and breaches could not be satisfactorily undertaken

by the court at the main trial without considering whether in the first instance there was

an obligation on the part of the defendants to provide the plaintiff a hearing –

since this aspect would most certainly have a bearing on the relief to be granted.

Conversely, the allegation of the defendants that it was the plaintiff who had broken his

terms of employment could not be adjudged without the court enquiring into whether the

plaintiff was given the opportunity to explain his absence. Given this backdrop, the

application by the defendants for the determination of the first question to the court

below was found by me to be premature, since it neither purports to dispose of the entire

cause or matter nor does it fully determine – I emphasize the word ‘fully’

- even a single issue as envisaged under O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court (see <i><b>Payna

Chettiar v Maimoon bte Ismail &amp; Ors</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11088&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 387</a> at 397).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55

        Having reviewed all the authorities, and

considered all the arguments, I am of the view that the question whether the principles of

natural justice apply to the plaintiff’s contract of employment, would depend upon

the question whether the provisions in the personnel procedure manual applied to the

plaintiff’s contract of employment. These inter-linked questions could not be

disposed of without regard to the attendant facts and in my view, ought to be decided at

the trial of the action in the context of available evidence. However, in relation to the

second question submitted to the court below, ie, whether any relief for reinstatement may

be claimed by the plaintiff, the law in this regard seems to have been conclusively

settled by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i><b>Lim Tow Peng</b></i>,<i><b> </b></i>that

power to reinstate a dismissed employee resides only with the Minister under s 14 of the

Employment Act. As regards ancillary prayer (3), the relief as to loss of salary, this

matter also, in my view cannot be disposed of summarily without hearing evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56

        For the reasons I have given, I allowed the

plaintiff’s appeal and ordered:</font></p>
