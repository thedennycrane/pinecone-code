The Applicant’s original position was that s 258(1) of the CPC applied to the Statements and consequently precluded the admission of the Statements from the DT proceedings as they were only “admissible in evidence at the person’s trial”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Applicant’s criminal trial. The Applicant took the original position in the DT proceedings below as well.

</div> However, in oral submissions before me, Counsel for the Applicant submitted instead that s 259(1) of the CPC was applicable since the Applicant is not an accused person in the DT proceedings and ought to be regarded as a person “other than the accused” within the meaning of the provision. Thus, the Applicant’s revised position is that the Statements are inadmissible in the DT proceedings unless any one of the exceptions listed in s 259(1) of the CPC applies. Counsel for the Applicant asserted that none of the exceptions listed in s 259(1) of the CPC operated to render the Statements admissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Given the change in the Applicant’s position and the novel nature of the present application, I invited parties to make further submissions, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, on the following areas:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the Applicant’s reliance on s 259(1) of the CPC; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the limits (if any) of the DT’s powers under s 51(4) of the MRA.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 4 May 2022, the Applicant filed further submissions on the limits of the DT’s powers under s 51(4) of the MRA and the impact of these proposed limits on the Evidence. His position is outlined below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In respect of the limits to s 51(4) of the MRA, reliance is placed on an English authority, <span class="font-italic">R (</span><span class="font-italic">on the application of Bonhoeffer) v General Medical Council </span>[2011] EWHC 1585 (Admin) (“<span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>”). The following points arising from <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> are made for the eventual submission that fairness should guide the determination of whether to admit the Evidence under s 51(4) of the MRA.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Rule 34(1) of the General Medical Council (Fitness to Practise) Rules Order of Council 2004 [SI 2004/2608] (“Rule 34(1)”) governs the admissibility of evidence in disciplinary proceedings in England. Rule 34(1) confers on the Fitness to Practise Panel (“FTP Panel”) the discretion to admit any evidence which it considers to be relevant to the case before it and which it considers fair to admit (<span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> at [35]).

He submits that the admission of the Evidence during the prosecution’s case would be manifestly unfair. Further, the admission of the Evidence is inconsistent with the purpose of the DT, which is to protect patients and public confidence. The Applicant contends that there is no patient to be protected and no public interest to be upheld. This contention is based on the patient’s testimony in the DT proceedings that there was “no finger” and “no saliva” involved.

</div> The Applicant posits that the patient’s testimony was entirely antithetical to the charge against the Applicant (see [6] above). It would therefore be prejudicial to the Applicant if the Evidence is admitted and relied on by the SMC as the sole basis to establish its <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The SMC’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The SMC relies primarily on the overarching provision in s 51(4) of the MRA, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) A Disciplinary Tribunal is not bound to act in a formal manner and is not bound by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1893 or by any other law relating to evidence but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Counsel for the SMC submits that in any case, it is premature for the Applicant to seek a judicial review of the Admissibility Decision before the DT makes a determination on the charges for professional misconduct. The SMC argues that the present application is akin to an interlocutory appeal filed in the midst of a criminal trial. In its submission, this is not allowed.

Relying on the ruling in <span class="font-italic">BNX v BOE</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter</span> [2017] SGHC 289 (“<span class="font-italic">BNX</span>”), a parallel can be drawn between DT proceedings and arbitration proceedings.

</div> This was done in recognition of the importance of the Admissibility Decision, and the divergence in parties’ positions on it. It reasoned that the Issues, if decided in favour of the Applicant on appeal, may lead to a fresh DT hearing being ordered by the court, in which case the witnesses (including the patient) would have to testify again. The DT considered that such a situation would also result in a waste of its time and resources.

The Disciplinary Committee found that there was a case to answer and the applicant was asked to enter his defence. Being dissatisfied with this, the applicant brought the issue to court prior to the commencement of the defence’s case. This was done before the Disciplinary Committee’s determination of the charges against him. The learned judge dismissed the leave application and found that it was premature. I will address the decision in greater detail below at [35]. For now, it suffices to highlight that the High Court held that “a premature application for leave to seek judicial review <span class="font-italic">in essence [is] one made before the actual decision-making process of the tribunal at first instance is completed</span>” [emphasis added] (at [14]).

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Chwan</span>, the applicant brought an application for leave to commence judicial review of the decisions of two reviewing committees to refer two complaints against him to the disciplinary committee. Ang J held that the application failed for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, prematurity. The formal inquiry before the disciplinary committee had not yet been held. The Court observed that none of the grounds raised by the applicant constituted errors that could fundamentally affect the conduct and utility of the procedure (at [73]). There was also neither irreparable damage nor a possible breach of natural justice. The applicant would be allowed to object to the charges on a point of law at the inquiry itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 <span class="font-italic">Chai Chwan</span> may be distinguished on its facts. The applicant in <span class="font-italic">Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Chwan</span> had alleged there was illegality, irrationality and / or procedural impropriety in the decisions to bring him before a disciplinary committee. The application had been made before the disciplinary hearing started. It was therefore only a challenge against the manner in which discretion was exercised by the reviewing committees to bring the applicant before a disciplinary committee. There were no novel questions of law in that case, unlike in the present case (see [23] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The better case which ought to be discussed is <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong</span>. Although parties have not brought this case to my attention, I consider it necessary to deal with the analogous precedent. The salient facts of the case are set out above at [32]. The application in <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong </span>was in essence an objection to the DT’s finding that the Law Society of Singapore had proven a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against him.

The DT in <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong </span>admitted the evidence and ruled against the applicant’s submission that there was no case to answer. Rajah J dismissed the application. One of the reasons for the dismissal was that the application was premature (<span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong</span> at [13]). The main reason for the finding of prematurity was that until the disciplinary committee decided that the disciplinary charges were of sufficient gravity to be referred to the C3J, it could not be said that calling on the applicant to enter his defence would have an adverse effect on him. The High Court observed that if the applicant had elected to give evidence, he may or may not have been able to convince the disciplinary committee that the Law Society of Singapore had not proved its case against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The applicant appealed against the decision in <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong</span>. He challenged the finding of prematurity on the grounds that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whatever final determination the disciplinary committee made was irrelevant. It was irrelevant because the disciplinary committee’s decision to call upon him to enter his defence would have been an error of law that could have a substantial effect on him. The applicant submitted that it was an error of law because it was based on the impugned evidence, which was inadmissible in law. It had a substantial effect on him because but for such evidence, the disciplinary committee had no other basis to call for his defence since there was no other evidence to support the disciplinary charges preferred against him. Further, the disciplinary committee’s decision to admit the evidence had wrongly shifted the evidential burden onto him, and had deprived him, as an accused person, of the presumption of innocence (<span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Leong Rayney v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong (CA)</span>” at [17]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong (CA)</span> upheld the decision of the High Court. It held that the impugned evidence did not constitute entrapment or illegally obtained evidence (<span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong (CA)</span> at [31]–[38]). However, the Court of Appeal made no ruling on whether the leave application was premature: see <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong (CA)</span> at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The facts of the current application, being one for leave to quash the Admissibility Decision, are similar to <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong</span>. It is similarly an application to exclude material evidence in the SMC’s case which the Applicant deems to be inadmissible. In <span class="font-italic">Rayney</span><span class="font-italic"> Wong (CA)</span>, the decision of Rajah J was upheld on the basis that the evidence challenged by the applicant was not illegal. The appeal failed on that basis. However, the parties have not engaged substantially with the issue of prematurity before me. Aside from the one case cited by the SMC on prematurity (<span class="font-italic">Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Chwan</span>), no other party has provided precedents on this issue. I also note the exceptional circumstances of this case. These include the earlier agreement between the parties and the DT that there were novel questions of law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Issues), which would materially affect the outcome of the DT proceedings. In the circumstances, I decline to pronounce whether or not the application is premature.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Nature and character of DT proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I address briefly the nature and character of DT proceedings in order to inform my subsequent analysis and interpretation of s 51(4) of the MRA (see below at [62]–[70]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Tribunals in Singapore span a wide spectrum in terms of the nature of parties appearing before the tribunal, the scope of review conducted and the standard of review that is used in assessing the merits of the decision: <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Tribunals in Singapore</span> at para 1.10.

The procedure substantially mirrors the criminal trial process. It includes the reading out of the charge(s) against the medical practitioner, the presentation of the evidence in the SMC’s case, followed by the evidence in the practitioner’s case and the opportunity to cross-examine or re-examine witnesses. A DT may make variations or modifications to the procedure as it thinks fit in any particular case: Regulation 34(4) of the MRR. If a DT determines that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the charge at any point during the proceedings, it shall discontinue them: Regulation 34(5) of the MRR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It is uncontroverted that the SMC <span class="font-italic">qua</span> prosecution has to establish the charge(s) against the medical practitioner beyond reasonable doubt. By the close of the SMC’s case, it must establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the practitioner on each of the elements of the charge(s). The practitioner may make submissions at the close of the SMC’s case that there is no case to answer. If the DT finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, then the practitioner will be called to enter his defence. At this juncture, the practitioner may elect to remain silent or to give evidence. Where the practitioner gives evidence which is contrary to his previous statements, he may be cross-examined on them under s 147(1) of the EA. This may entail the admission of previous statements into evidence to contradict and/or substitute the practitioner’s testimony. Section 147(3) of the EA provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement is by virtue of this subsection admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by the person would be admissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Another important feature of DTs is the presence of strong public interest considerations which underpin their inception, processes and outcomes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The C3J in <span class="font-italic">Pang Ah San v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2021] 5 SLR 681 recognised the gravity of public interest considerations in DT proceedings against medical practitioners.

The three main aims as articulated by the Second Minister for Law are as follows. The first aim of the DT is to uphold public interest. The second aim is that the DT is intended to preserve and protect public confidence in the health system and the medical profession. The third and final aim is for the DT proceedings to achieve general deterrence through disciplinary outcomes which deter other doctors from adopting unethical practices. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Whether the Evidence is hearsay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Evidence consists of the Statements, which were recorded from the Applicant pursuant to s 22 of the CPC, and the Testimony, which was the Applicant’s evidence at his criminal trial.

Where oral evidence is provided on assertions made outside of court and tendered in court as evidence as to the truth of the contents therein, but the maker of the assertion is not called as a witness, it is not admissible. Section 32 of the EA provides a list of situations where such evidence may be admissible. In this regard, the SMC submits that the Statements cannot constitute hearsay evidence as the statement recorders are being called to admit the Statements. It contends that the statement recorders are being called to establish the fact that the Statements were made by the Applicant, and not to establish the truth of the contents therein.

</div> The Evidence includes the prior Statements and Testimony provided by the Applicant in relation to HC/CC 85/2017. These inconsistencies are whether the Applicant had used saliva as a lubricant, the Applicant’s observations upon visual examination of the patient’s vagina at the material time, and the reason that had prompted the Applicant to conduct an internal pelvic examination. While the Applicant had stated that he put his saliva on his finger as lubricant in the Evidence, he denied the use of saliva in the Inquiry Documents. He also provided an account in the Evidence that he had not seen anything on initial visual examination of the patient’s private part, but the version in the Inquiry Documents is that he saw “slight redness around the vulva”. The explanation provided by the Applicant for why he had conducted an internal pelvic examination was that he wanted to check for any discharge and infection in the patient’s vagina in the Evidence; however, he claimed that he conducted the examination to exclude serious pelvic inflammatory disease in the Inquiry Documents. The SMC submits that it has therefore satisfied the requirements under s 147(3) of the EA. The basis for its submission lies in the inconsistencies identified by the SMC, especially when they are taken in the context that the Applicant had confirmed the contents of the Statements during the criminal trial.

It is clear that the provision pertains to the use of prior statements in the cross-examination of witnesses during a trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia</span> (Tan Yock Lin &amp; S Chandra Mohan gen eds) (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2020), the applicability of s 147(3) of the EA is discussed under the section “<span class="font-italic">cross-examination as to </span><span class="font-italic">credit</span>” [emphasis added] (at paras 2401 and 2550). The learned authors observe that cross-examination is “not limited to the evidence of a witness and <span class="font-italic">can proceed by eliciting contradictory accounts in the witness’ testimony for the purposes of showing the witness’ testimony to be lacking in credibility or by showing that the witness is not worthy of credit</span>” [emphasis added] (at para 2401). Section 147(3) of the EA is considered to provide for an effect greater than merely the impeachment of credit based on a previous inconsistent statement (at para 2550). This further effect is that the court has the discretion to admit the previous inconsistent statement as evidence of the facts stated in it, in substitution of the witness’ testimony in court (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). The crux of s 147(3) of the EA is not merely that there are two inconsistent statements provided by the same witness. The main intent behind the provision is to permit the use of prior statements made by a witness in his cross-examination during a trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It therefore cannot be the case that the Evidence is admitted pursuant to s 147(3) of the EA, ahead of the cross-examination of the Applicant. This does not comport with the textual and contextual meaning of s 147(3) of the EA. As provided by the provision, it is necessary for the previous inconsistent statement to be <span class="font-italic">proved</span> to invoke s 147(3) of the EA during cross-examination. Section 147(3) of the EA begins with “[w]here in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is <span class="font-italic">proved by virtue of this section</span>, …” [emphasis added]. This pre-requisite as to proof does not refer merely to the one-sided assertion of inconsistencies between at least two statements (as suggested by the SMC) (see [53]–[54] above). It requires the Applicant to be confronted with his previous contradictory statements. This must be the correct reading of Section 147(3) of the EA when it is read within s 147 of the EA in its entirety. I highlight that s 147(1) of the EA states that “… if it is intended to contradict [the witness] by the [statement made in] writing, <span class="font-italic">his</span><span class="font-italic"> or her attention must</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">before the writing can be proved</span><span class="font-italic">, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him</span><span class="font-italic"> or her</span>” [emphasis added]. This opportunity to confront the Applicant with his previous statements (and therefore meet the requirement of proof under s 147(3) of the EA) arises during his cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Thus, s 147(3) of the EA does not allow for the admission of the Evidence in the SMC’s case on the basis that it contradicts the Inquiry Documents. The SMC may only successfully rely on s 147(3) of the EA to admit the Evidence if and when it meets the requirements set out in that provision, which include challenging the Applicant with the inconsistent portions of the Evidence during his cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 5: Scope and application of s 51(4) of the MRA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I consider next the scope and application of s 51(4) of the MRA. In particular, whether it permits the admissibility of hearsay evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Section 51(4) of the MRA sets out the discretionary power conferred on DTs in determining the admissibility of evidence during proceedings. The provision is set out in full below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) A Disciplinary Tribunal is not bound to act in a formal manner and is not bound by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1893 or by any other law relating to evidence but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interpretation of s 51(4) of the MRA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “IA”) mandates a purposive approach to statutory interpretation, where  an interpretation which promotes the purpose or object underlying the written law should be preferred. The purposive interpretation of a statutory provision consists of the following three steps (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision in question, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute. There are two types of sources from which a court may draw to discern the legislative purpose: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [42]. The first is the text of the relevant provision itself and its statutory context: <span class="font-italic">ibid</span>. The second is “any material not forming part of the written law” as set out in ss 9A(2)–9A(3) of the IA: <span class="font-italic">ibid</span>. In discerning the legislative purpose behind a provision, primacy should be accorded to the text of the provision and its statutory context over any extraneous material: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [43]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 On a plain textual reading of s 51(4) of the MRA, the provision states that the DT “is <span class="font-italic">not bound to act in a formal manner</span> and is <span class="font-italic">not bound by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1893</span> <span class="font-italic">or by any other law relating to evidence</span>” but “may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit” [emphasis added]. It is incontrovertibly clear that s 51(4) of the MRA confers on the DT a discretion to admit evidence in proceedings, without being confined by the usual rules of evidence. This is the only possible interpretation of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I consider first the internal sources to ascertain the legislative purpose of s 51(4) of the MRA (see [62(b)] above). The internal sources include the long title of a statute, the words of the legislative provision and other legislative provisions within the statute (in so far as they are relevant to ascertaining what Parliament was seeking to achieve and how): <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [44]. In particular, the structure of the statute as a whole and the location of the provision in question within the statute may be relevant considerations: <span class="font-italic">ibid</span>. The long title of the MRA is “[a]n Act to provide for the registration of medical practitioners and for matters connected therewith”. Owing to the generality of the long title of the MRA, the legislative purpose behind s 51(4) of the MRA is not readily discernible from the long title. The object of the MRA as codified in s 2A of the MRA provides more assistance. Section 2A of the MRA states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The object of this Act is to <span class="font-italic">protect the health and safety of the public</span> by providing for mechanisms to — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) ensure that registered medical practitioners are competent and fit to practise medicine;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">uphold standards of practice</span> within the medical profession; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) <span class="font-italic">maintain public confidence</span> in the medical profession. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Aside from the general object of the MRA, the words of the provision clarify the legislative purpose behind it. The plain words used are that the DT is “not bound by the provisions of the [EA] or by any other law relating to evidence”. This can only mean that the DT is at liberty to consider evidence which would otherwise be excluded pursuant to the EA or any other law on evidence. This is precisely the occasion envisaged by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>(at [44]) in its observation that “if a provision is well-drafted, <span class="font-italic">its purpose will emanate from its words</span>” [emphasis added]. Consequently, there is no further need to consider the other provisions in the MRA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The ordinary meaning of s 51(4) of the MRA is unambiguous (see [63] above). The legislative purpose as discerned from the plain wording of the provision is similarly abundantly clear (see [64] above). The extraneous materials examined under s 9A(2)(a) of the IA are therefore only used to confirm the ordinary meaning of s 51(4) of the MRA (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [54(c)(iii)(A)]). Section 9A(3) of the IA sets out material that may be considered. This includes “<span class="font-italic">the speech made in Parliament by a Minister </span><span class="font-italic">on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in Parliament</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">any relevant material</span> <span class="font-italic">in any official record of debates</span> <span class="font-italic">in Parliament</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 There is no explicit reference to s 51 of the MRA in Hansard. In accordance with s 9A(3) of the IA, I consider the statements made in Parliament in relation to the MRA generally. It is well-settled that extraneous material that is “capable of assisting in ascertaining the meaning of the provision(s) by shedding light on the purpose of [the] statue as a whole, or where applicable, on the purpose of particular provision(s) in question, should be referred to”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [51]; see also <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng</span> [2017] 1 SLR 373 at [63].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the Second Reading of the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill on 11 January 2010 (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span><span class="font-italic">, Official Report </span>(11 January 2010) vol 86 at cols 1895–1896 (Khaw Boon Wan, Minister for Health)), then-Minister for Health stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Medical Registration Act (MRA) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">seeks to protect the health and safety of the public by creating mechanisms to ensure that medical practitioners are competent and fit to practise medicine</span>.

Since then, new issues in professional conduct and standards have arisen due to changing demands and expectations of patients and the public. This Bill seeks Members' support for several amendments to the MRA. The amendments will address four key objectives:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">To strengthen and streamline the Singapore Medical Council (SMC)'s existing disciplinary processes to cope with the increase in the number and complexity of complaints and disciplinary </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proceedings</span><span class="font-italic">;</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The extract above at [68] contains material which sets out the legislative intention of the MRA. Indeed, the Parliamentary intention of strengthening and streamlining the disciplinary process is coherent with the ordinary meaning of s 51(4) of the MRA, which facilitates the expeditious resolution of DT proceedings by conferring a broad discretion to admit all relevant evidence without impediment by traditional rules of evidence. This shows that the ordinary meaning deduced from s 51(4) of the MRA (see [63] above) comports with the policy imperatives for which the MRA was enacted: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [49]. Similarly, the legislative purpose inferred from the words of s 51(4) of the MRA, which is to provide a DT with a wide-ranging discretion to admit all relevant evidence, is consistent with Parliament’s intentions as deduced from the extraneous material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Ultimately, the purposive interpretation of s 51(4) of the MRA must be done with a view towards determining its purpose and object “as reflected by and in harmony with the express wording of the legislation”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [50]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Heng</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [50]. The correct interpretation of s 51(4) of the MRA is that the DT is granted decisional autonomy to admit evidence in proceedings, even when the evidence may be excluded by the rules of evidence. That said, it is not the case that the rules of evidence are immaterial to the application of s 51(4) of the MRA (see [115] and [120] below), nor that there is no further consideration of the weight to be accorded to the evidence (see [73] and [74] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Limits to the discretion in s 51(4) of the MRA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Applicant’s main contention against s 51(4) of the MRA is that there are limits to the discretion accorded to the DT. These limits include the rules of natural justice and constitutionality.

</div> I do not understand the SMC or the AG to be adopting positions contrary to the Applicant’s perspective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 However, parties differ on the extent of the limits to the DT’s discretion under s 51(4) of the MRA. The Applicant further suggests that fairness (in the substantive sense) acts as a limit to the discretion under s 51(4) of the MRA. I proceed to consider the restrictions to the powers conferred by s 51(4) of the MRA and the relevant case law (where available). There does not appear to be any local case law on the ambit of s 51(4) of the MRA. In view of the novel nature of this inquiry, I consider also the treatment of similar provisions governing the admissibility of evidence in tribunal proceedings in other jurisdictions.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Relevance</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Local Authority</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The first limit to s 51(4) of the MRA is that the evidence the DT admits must be relevant to the proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">BNX</span> at [83], the High Court held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]here is an almost insurmountable argument to be made that in all arbitrations conducted with Singapore as the seat, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the tribunal is empowered to receive all relevant evidence, with the concerns which underlie the exclusionary rules at common law such as the hearsay rule going only to weight and not to admissibility</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 While the High Court’s ruling in <span class="font-italic">BNX</span> was in the context of arbitration tribunals, it is reasonable to import the same observations to the context of medical DTs. This is especially so when s 51(4) of the MRA confers a broad discretion on a DT to admit evidence in its inquiry. The learned authors in <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Tribunals in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> propose that “the [aforesaid] position should be the same in respect of tribunal hearings” and that “it is unlikely that the exclusionary rules operate to prevent certain types of evidence from being considered by a tribunal”: at paras 5.76–5.77.

Before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, he was successful with only the claim for osteoarthritis. He appealed against the tribunal’s decision to the Federal Court of Australia. On appeal, the applicant argued that there was an error of law due to the admission by the tribunal of a statement of principles relating to hypertension and atherosclerotic ischaemic heart disease. The statement of principles had been prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority and contained the opinion of specialists as to the causes of specific medical conditions. The applicant challenged the admission of the statement of principles on the basis that it should not have been admitted into evidence unless the authors of the statement were present and available for cross-examination. The Court noted that a statement of the state of medical knowledge at a particular time would be inadmissible in a court. However, s 33 of the AAT states that “the tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks appropriate”. The main consideration for the tribunal in determining the admissibility of evidence would therefore be relevance.

In <span class="font-italic">Sammut</span>, the appellants, who were lessors of retail shop premises, alleged that the first-named respondent, the lessee, used the premises for non-permitted and illegal purposes. The appellants contested the use of<span class="font-italic"> </span>opinion evidence by the respondent in the proceedings below (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before the State Administrative Tribunal). The opinion evidence was from the officers of the City of Stirling who had inspected the retail premises. This was relied on by the respondent before the tribunal to show that the use of the premises was consistent with prescribed use and no illegal activities had occurred on the premises. The appellants argued before the court that the opinion evidence ought to have been excluded in making the assessment of whether the respondent’s use of the retail shop premises was for non-permitted and illegal purposes. The court held that the opinion evidence was not necessarily excluded because the normal rules of evidence did not apply (at [54]). Section 32(2) of the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA) provides that “[t]he Evidence Act 1906 does not apply to the Tribunal’s proceedings and the Tribunal – (a) is <span class="font-italic">not bound by the rules of evidence</span> … except to the extent that it adopts those rules …” [emphasis in original omitted, emphasis added].

The Australian provision which governs the procedure in disciplinary proceedings against registered health practitioners is s 185 of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009, which is enacted and implemented by each state and territory in Australia in accordance with its own laws. Section 185 of the Act is set out below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">185 <span class="font-weight-bold">Procedure of panel</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Subject to this Division, a panel may decide its own procedures.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-italic">A panel is required to observe the principles of natural justice but is not bound by the rules of evidence</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) <span class="font-italic">A panel may have regard to</span>—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) a report prepared by an assessor about the registered health practitioner or student; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">any other information the panel considers relevant to the hearing of the matter</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original reflected in bold; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It suffices to observe that s 185 of the Act provides that a medical disciplinary panel determining a complaint is “<span class="font-italic">not bound by the rules of evidence</span>” and may have regard to “<span class="font-italic">any other information</span> [it] considers <span class="font-italic">relevant to the hearing of the matter</span>” [emphasis added]. The provision, which is similar to the other Australian provisions discussed in this judgment (see [76], [79], [112] and [116]), accords the panel a broad discretion to admit evidence in its proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is not bound by the rules of evidence). I consider only the cases which illustrate the limits to the exercise of such a discretion conferred by the analogous provisions (at [76], [79], [112] and [116]) to be of assistance. I further note that parties have not brought to my attention any Australian cases in the specific context of medical disciplinary proceedings which are to the point.

Rule 34(1) (see [12(a)(i)] above) codifies relevance as one of the requirements for the admission of evidence by a medical tribunal. I set out the relevant parts of Rule 34 of the General Medical Council (Fitness to Practise) Rules Order of Council 2004 below: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Committee or a Panel <span class="font-italic">may admit any evidence they consider fair and relevant to the case before them, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a court of law</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where evidence would not be admissible in criminal proceedings in England, the Committee or Panel shall not admit such evidence unless, on the advice of the Legal Assessor, they are satisfied that their duty of making due inquiry into the case before them makes its admission desirable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original reflected in bold; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Applicant relies on <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer </span>(see [12] above) for his proposition that the Evidence ought to be excluded.

The issue of relevance was not in contention in the <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> case.

In my view, <span class="font-italic">R (on the application of </span><span class="font-italic">Squier) v General Medical Council </span>[2015] EWHC 299 (Admin) (“<span class="font-italic">Squier</span>”) is pertinent. In <span class="font-italic">Squier</span>, the applicant, a medical practitioner, faced allegations that she had deliberately misled the courts and acted dishonestly as an expert witness. She had given evidence as an expert consultant in the field of paediatric neuropathology on six different occasions before the United Kingdom High Court and the Court of Appeal. The evidence given related to non-accidental head injuries suffered by infants. The issue before the FTP Panel, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tribunal, was whether the evidence was relevant and if it was fair to admit the judgments (for the cases in which she had testified) as evidence. The FTP Panel had admitted the judgments as they provided context to each of the cases and allowed the evidence given by the applicant to be understood in its context. That said, the FTP Panel noted that the General Medical Council still had to prove the underlying facts of the charges and some redaction of the judgments would be fair. On appeal, the applicant argued that the judgments were irrelevant because the General Medical Council had to prove its case by providing factual evidence of what had happened. The applicant submitted that the judgments were being used as a shortcut to “the proper proving of what needed to be proved”. Ouseley J dismissed the application and held that the FTP Panel did not act unreasonably in admitting the judgments (at [39]). The court held that the judgments provided relevant context to the professional misconduct charges against the applicant, which formed the subject of the FTP Panel’s inquiry. The role of the FTP Panel is in examining the basis of the applicant’s evidence in the previous proceedings, not whether the applicant’s evidence was right (which was the issue before the courts in the proceedings in which she had given evidence) (at [40]). Ouseley J held at [25]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The language of the Fitness to Practise Rules [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the General Medical Council (Fitness to Practise) Rules Order of Council 2004] which focuses on the FTPP's judgment as to relevance should be fully recognised.

Although the manner in which Rule 34(1) is drafted differs from the broad and discretionary language in s 51(4) of the MRA and the Australian provisions, it imports the same flexibility for decision-makers to admit evidence which may not be admissible under the usual rules of evidence. Rule 34(1) permits the admissibility of “any evidence they (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the disciplinary committee or panel) consider fair and relevant to the case before them, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a court of law”. Section 51(4) of the MRA and the Australian provisions state, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that a disciplinary tribunal is “not bound” by the rules of evidence. The requirement of relevance to the admissibility of evidence is consistent throughout the three jurisdictions, whether or not it is expressly articulated in the governing provisions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Natural justice</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The second limit to the discretion afforded to a DT under s 51(4) of the MRA is that its exercise must comply with the rules of natural justice.

The Applicant appears to suggest that a broader view of the content of the rules of natural justice ought to be taken.

In <span class="font-italic">Moore</span>, the applicant sought industrial injury benefits for an alleged work-induced back injury. This claim was initially dismissed by the insurance officer. Subsequently, the applicant appealed to the deputy industrial injuries commissioner. The insurance officer relied on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, medical opinions made by experts in two other workplace injury cases at the hearing before the commissioner. The commissioner admitted and relied on the medical opinions before arriving at the decision to dismiss the applicant’s claim. The experts who provided the medical opinions in the other two cases were not called as witnesses. The applicant challenged the commissioner’s admission of the medical opinions on the basis that they were hearsay and sought a quashing order from the High Court. The High Court dismissed the application. The applicant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which noted that the commissioner had not acted contrary to natural justice as he had heard comments on these medical opinions from the medical experts who were called by parties when they had taken the stand: <span class="font-italic">Moore</span> at 489. It also agreed that there was no bar to the commissioner taking into consideration hearsay evidence which was not admissible in a court of law. Diplock LJ (as he then was) at 488 held as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…<span class="font-italic">the rules of natural justice</span><span class="font-italic"> which he </span>[<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deputy commissioner in <span class="font-italic">Moore</span>]<span class="font-italic"> must observe </span><span class="font-italic">can, in my view, be reduced to two</span>. First, he must base his decision on evidence, whether a hearing is requested or not. Secondly, if a hearing is requested, he must fairly listen to the contentions of all persons who are entitled to be represented at the hearing. In the context of the first rule, “evidence” is not restricted to evidence which would be admissible in a court of law. For historical reasons, based on the fear that juries who might be illiterate would be incapable of differentiating between the probative values of different methods of proof, the practice of the common law courts has been to admit only what the judges then regarded as the best evidence of any disputed fact, and thereby to exclude much material which, as a matter of common sense, would assist a fact-finding tribunal to reach a correct conclusion …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">These technical rules of evidence, however, form no part of the rules of natural justice.</span><span class="font-italic"> The requirement that a person exercising quasi-judicial functions must base his decision on evidence </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">means no more than it must be based upon material which tends logically to show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined</span><span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or to show the likelihood or unlikelihood of the occurrence of some future event the occurrence of which would be relevant</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>It means that he must not spin a coin or consult an astrologer, but he may take into account any material which, as a matter of reason, has some probative value in the sense mentioned above. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If it </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is capable of having any probative value, the weight to be attached to it is a matter for the person to whom Parliament has entrusted the responsibility of deciding the issue.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I agree with the observations of Lord Justice Diplock in <span class="font-italic">Moore</span>. As I found above (at [70]), s 51(4) of the MRA confers a wide discretion on the DT to admit evidence that is relevant and probative to the inquiry. The “probative value” of any evidence refers to its ability to prove a fact in issue or a relevant fact: <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 557 (“<span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span>”) at [47]. It follows that any evidence which is capable of showing the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue is generally admissible, even if it does not conform to the usual rules of evidence. This is unless the evidence falls foul of the rules of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 There is no support for the Applicant’s submission that the admission of hearsay evidence would in itself constitute a breach of natural justice. In respect of hearsay evidence, the relevant English authority (see [97] below) appears to suggest that it would be a sufficient safeguard to ensure that the other party is given a fair opportunity of commenting on the evidence and contradicting it. What a fair opportunity entails would depend on the facts (see [99]–[107] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In <span class="font-italic">T.A. Miller Ltd v Minister </span><span class="font-italic">of Housing and Local Government and Another</span> [1968] 1 WLR 992 (“<span class="font-italic">Miller</span>”), the owners of a nursery (who were disallowed by the planning authority to use their land for a specific purpose) appealed to the Minister. At an inquiry by an inspector on behalf of the Minister, the owners objected to the admission of a letter from the previous owner on the ground that “it was not on oath, no opportunity was given to test it by cross-examination, and it was objected to” (at 995). At the inquiry, the inspector admitted the letter as evidence and accepted the statements therein in his findings of fact (at 992). The owners applied to the Divisional Court for a review of the inspector’s decision on the ground that the admission of the letter was in conflict with the rules of natural justice. The Divisional Court dismissed their application. The owners then appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held that a tribunal such as the inspector’s inquiry was master of its own procedure, subject to the application of the rules of natural justice. It was not contrary to natural justice to admit hearsay evidence. This was because the owners had a fair opportunity of commenting on and contradicting the contents of the letter. Lord Denning M.R. rejected the owners’ arguments and held as follows (at 995):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A tribunal of this kind is master of its own procedure, provided that the rules of natural justice are applied … <span class="font-italic">Tribunals are entitled to rely on any material which is logically probative, even though it is not evidence in a court of law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Hearsay is clearly admissible before a tribunal</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No doubt in admitting it, the tribunal must observe the rules of natural justice, but this does not mean that it must be tested by cross-examination</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It only means that the tribunal must give the other side a fair opportunity of commenting on it and of contradicting it</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> … </span>The inspector here did that<span class="font-italic">.</span> [The letter] was put to the witnesses and they contradicted it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The English position as stated in <span class="font-italic">Moore</span> and <span class="font-italic">Miller</span> appears to accord tribunals considerable scope for the admissibility of hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence would therefore be admissible if it was relevant and probative. The presentation of an opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the hearsay evidence is not necessary to avoid a breach of natural justice, as long as the other side is given a fair opportunity to contradict it. Any other considerations as to the reliability of its content would go towards the weight accorded to the evidence in the determination of the issue (see the extract from <span class="font-italic">Miller</span> at [94] above). However, this later developed into a more nuanced approach. It may be that cross-examination is necessary to safeguard the applicant’s right to a fair hearing. This depends on all the circumstances (see [99] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In <span class="font-italic">Bushell and another v Secretary of State for the Environment</span> [1981] AC 75 (“<span class="font-italic">Bushell</span>”), an inquiry was held to consider objections to a road building scheme. Pursuant to s 11 and Schedule 1 of the Highways Act 1959 (UK), the minister “shall cause a local inquiry to be held” by an inspector if affected persons lodged objections against such construction schemes. The minister then considers, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the report prepared by the inspector at the close of the inquiry to reach his decision on whether to make the scheme, and if so, either with or without modifications. Counsel for the Secretary of State informed the inspector of a report which was prepared by and relied on by the Department of the Environment for the road building scheme. The report projected future traffic growth and it formed the main impetus for the new roads. The applicants challenged the report, and applied to cross-examine the witnesses who gave evidence on the Department’s behalf to test the accuracy of the traffic predictions. The inspector dismissed the application to cross-examine the Department’s representatives on the reliability of the predictive statistics, but allowed the applicants to call their own evidence to refute the report. At the material time, there was no express provision in the authorising statute about the scope of the inquiry and the procedure to be followed, beyond what is stated above: <span class="font-italic">Bushell </span>at 92–93. The applicants sought the quashing of the minister’s decision to proceed with the scheme on the basis that the inquiry was in breach of their right to a fair hearing. The High Court dismissed their application. On appeal, the Court of Appeal ruled that the inquiry had been conducted in a manner in breach of the applicants’ right to a fair hearing. The House of Lords overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision on further appeal. Lord Diplock, on behalf of the majority, held as follows (at 97–98):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To "over-judicialise" the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair. <span class="font-italic">It would, in my view, be quite fallacious to suppose that at an inquiry of this kind the only fair way of ascertaining matters of fact and expert opinion is by the oral testimony of witnesses who are subjected to cross-examination</span> on behalf of parties who disagree with what they have said … So <span class="font-italic">refusal by an inspector to allow a party to cross-examine orally at a local inquiry a person who has made statements of facts or has expressed expert opinions is not unfair per se</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether fairness requires an inspector to permit a person who has made statements on matters of fact or opinion</span>, whether expert or otherwise, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to be cross-examined</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by a party to the inquiry who wishes to dispute a particular statement</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must depend on all the circumstances</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In considering all the facts, the majority in <span class="font-italic">Bushell</span> found that it was not unfair for the inspector to have refused to allow the cross-examination of the Department’s witnesses (at 109). The validity of the report, which the applicants were seeking to undermine, was treated as akin to a matter of government policy: <span class="font-italic">Craig’s Administrative Law</span> at para 9-046.

One of the charges against the midwife was dependent on the evidence of a sole witness, her former supervisor. The evidence was adduced before the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s Conduct and Competence Committee in a written statement. The midwife alleged that it was unfair for the statement to be admitted as she had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The Committee had decided against the midwife, and convicted her of all the charges. The High Court found for the midwife on appeal. The applicant, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, appealed to the Court of Appeal. The issue before the court was whether it was right of the Committee to admit a written statement by a witness, notwithstanding objections on the ground that the midwife had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The English Court of Appeal agreed that the statement should not have been admitted, given that no efforts were made to secure the attendance of the witness (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the pursuit of Charge 1…was regarded as important, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it should have been obvious to the NMC</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> [</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, the Nursing and Midwifery Council]</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> that it could and should have sought to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">make arrangements to enable such cross-examination to take place</span> – either by flying Ms Pilgrim [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the witness] to the UK at its expense, or else by setting up a video link ... <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If, of course, despite reasonable efforts, the NMC could not have arranged for </span><span class="font-italic">Ms Pilgrim to be available</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">for</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> cross examination, then the case for admitting her hearsay statement might well have been strong</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> But the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">NMC made no such efforts</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">at all</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> did not approve or lay down a general rule that fairness requires that a practitioner facing disciplinary proceedings is entitled in every case to test the evidence of his accuser(s) by way of cross-examination unless good and cogent reasons can be given for the non-attendance of the witness: <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> at [78]. Rather, the Court of Appeal held that the resolution of what is required by “fairness” would necessarily be fact-sensitive: <span class="font-italic">ibid</span>. The holding in <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> confirmed that the court below was correct to conclude that “on the facts of that case, fairness required that the appellant was entitled to test the evidence of the witness by way of cross-examination unless good and cogent reason could be given for non-attendance”: <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> at [79]. The holding of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> (as set out above at [102]) was considered by Justice Stadlen in <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> (at [84]). The learned judge held that <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna </span>supported the proposition that “in the absence of a problem in the witness giving evidence in person or by video link, or some other exceptional circumstance, fairness requires that in disciplinary proceedings a person facing serious charges, especially if they amount to criminal offences which if proved are likely to have grave adverse effects on his or her reputation and career, should in principle be entitled by cross-examination to test the evidence of his accuser(s) where that evidence is the sole or decisive evidence relied on against him” (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>, the applicant’s fitness to practise as a doctor was challenged in disciplinary proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the FTP Panel)<span class="font-italic"> </span>due to allegations of serious sexual misconduct against young boys and men (see [12(a)] above). Rule 34 governed the admissibility of evidence in medical disciplinary proceedings in the United Kingdom. The provision has been set out in full above at [81]. In the proceedings below, counsel for the General Medical Council sought to rely on the transcripts of interviews with a witness who was based in Kenya. These formed the sole source of evidence against the applicant for the majority of the charges he faced. The Kenyan witness repeatedly indicated that he was willing and able to travel to the United Kingdom to give evidence in person to the FTP Panel in support of the allegations he made against the applicant. The General Medical Council elected to adduce, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the transcripts of the video-taped interviews of the Kenyan witness without requiring him to give oral testimony because it held the view that he would be exposed to a significantly increased risk of harm in Kenya if he were to give oral testimony, whether in person or via video-link. The High Court held that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the FTP Panel was irrational in admitting the hearsay evidence of the Kenyan witness (at [130]). Justice Stadlen found that there was no absolute rule that the FTP Panel ought to automatically refuse to admit hearsay evidence without considering all the relevant circumstances (at [126]). Further, the Court observed that there was no requirement that fairness could only be satisfied where a doctor facing serious charges of professional misconduct was offered a right to cross-examine his accusers (at [72]). However, in <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>, there were powerful factors going against the admissibility of the hearsay evidence, such as the seriousness of the allegations levied against the practitioner, and the fact that the alleged threats to the Kenyan witness were unsubstantiated. The means by which the applicant could challenge the hearsay evidence were not capable of outweighing those factors (at [129]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Court in <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer </span>found that the FTP Panel’s conclusion that it was fair to admit the hearsay evidence of the Kenyan witness, and its decision to admit it, were irrational and in breach of the practitioner’s right to a fair hearing. The Court therefore quashed the FTP Panel’s decision. It held (at [108(viii)]) as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In disciplinary proceedings which raise serious charges amounting in effect to criminal offences</span> which, if proved, are likely to have grave adverse effects on the career and reputation of the accused party, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if reliance is sought to be placed on the evidence of an accuser</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">between whom and the accused party there is an important conflict of evidence</span><span class="font-italic"> as to whether the misconduct alleged took place,</span> <span class="font-italic">there would, if that evidence constituted a critical part of the evidence against the accused party </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and if there were no problems associated with securing the attendance of the accuser</span><span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">need to be compelling reasons why the requirement of fairness and the right to a fair hearing did not entitle the accused party to cross-examine the accuser</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The hearsay evidence in <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> was not admitted because of their unique facts.

Whether the admission of hearsay evidence without the opportunity to cross-examine its maker constitutes a breach of the practitioner’s right to a fair hearing depends on the circumstances of each case. It has been observed that where hearsay evidence was the sole evidence of many serious allegations made, the arguments in favour of requiring cross-examination were “formidable” and cross-examination had to be allowed to secure fairness: <span class="font-italic">Wade &amp; Forsyth’s Administrative Law</span> at p 439, commenting on <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>. The AG suggests that whether the absence of the opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the evidence contravenes the practitioner’s right to a fair hearing may depend on the specific reasons for failing to secure the attendance of the maker.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>, the maker of the statement containing allegations against the practitioner was willing and able to attend the trial. The situation in <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> was that the Nursing and Midwifery Council had not even attempted to procure the attendance of the maker of the statement at trial. In their contexts, it was necessary as a matter of fairness to offer the practitioners the chance to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements formed the main evidence in the charges brought against them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In sum, the position in the United Kingdom is that there is generally no bar to the admissibility of hearsay evidence in disciplinary hearings against medical practitioners if the evidence conforms with the requirements under Rule 34 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> relevance and fairness). However, the hearsay evidence would be inadmissible if there was a breach of natural justice. To ensure that there is no breach of his right to a fair hearing, it usually suffices that the practitioner has an opportunity to comment on and contradict the hearsay evidence. Cross-examination is not the only way to challenge the hearsay evidence. The right to a fair hearing includes the right to submit evidence in support of his own case and the right to comment on and contradict evidence which forms the basis of his opponent’s case: see Geoffrey A Flick, <span class="font-italic">Natural Justice: Principles and </span><span class="font-italic">Practical Application</span> (Butterworths, 1979) at p 41. In some circumstances, however, there may be no compelling substitute for the opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the hearsay evidence. The reasons for the unavailability of the maker for cross-examination on the hearsay material may then have a bearing on whether it ought to be excluded from evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The AG substantially agrees with the nuanced approach in the English line of cases (as summarised at [107] above). The AG submits that there could be situations where the facts, taken as a whole, are such that a tribunal may be inclined not to admit the hearsay material as evidence.

</div> The AG suggests that the absence of cross-examination itself does not necessarily constitute a violation of natural justice. The AG posits, particularly in the context of serious disciplinary charges, that the reasons for failing to secure the relevant witness for cross-examination on the hearsay evidence may be pertinent in determining if natural justice is breached.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I consider the English position as set out at [107] above to be a reasonable one. Even if hearsay evidence meets the threshold of relevance, it may not be admissible when it is in breach of the right to a fair hearing. The content of the right to a fair hearing (see [107] above) is premised on procedural fairness. It is not always necessary that the practitioner is accorded an opportunity for cross-examination to protect his right to a fair hearing, but there may exist situations where the absence of such an opportunity would deprive him of his right to a fair hearing. This is necessarily a fact-specific inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The SMC’s position is that hearsay evidence ought to be admissible where it is relevant, with issues on its reliability going to its weight. It does not expressly consider how natural justice rules should operate to exclude hearsay evidence in the local context. The preliminary question is whether the hearsay evidence is properly admissible. In this initial inquiry, the admissibility of hearsay evidence also turns on whether any breach of natural justice is occasioned. If there is a breach, the assessment of the weight to accord to the hearsay evidence only mitigates the consequential prejudice to the practitioner as a result of that breach. The SMC’s proposal therefore conflates the anterior evaluation of the procedural propriety in the admission of the hearsay evidence with the subsequent analysis of the substantive merits of the hearsay evidence itself. As Lord Wright held in <span class="font-italic">General Medical Council v Spackman</span> [1943] AC 627 at 644–645, “[i]f the principles of natural justice are violated in respect of any decision, it is, indeed, immaterial whether the same decision would have been arrived at in the absence of the departure from the essential principles of justice”. The fact that the hearsay evidence may thereafter be accorded its requisite weight is a separate point from its admissibility, and cannot remedy the initial breach of natural justice caused by the admission of the hearsay evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">Australia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The rules of natural justice in Australia have their grounding in the same rules of fair hearing and fair adjudication.

The applicant contended that there was no basis for the tribunal’s reliance, given that the doctor who had given opinions in that report was unidentified. The doctor had not been called to give evidence nor had he been cross-examined. The tribunal had admitted the school’s report pursuant to s 38(1) of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW).

The Court further held that the Tribunal “had to ensure that [the applicant] had the opportunity to put before it his case in relation to [the school’s report]” but this did not mean that the applicant “also had the right to require any of those who had expressed the opinions appearing in the School's report to attend to be cross-examined before the Tribunal” (at [116]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In <span class="font-italic">Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Ors v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd &amp; Ors</span> [2006] NSWSC 530 (“<span class="font-italic">Ingot Capital</span>”), the applicant sought an order for access to certain documents that had been prepared on behalf of the respondent for the purpose of proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The respondent resisted the production of the documents on the basis that the documents were protected because they were brought into existence for the purposes of use in or in relation to litigation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, litigation privilege). Litigation privilege safeguards communications between the client and the lawyer made for the dominant purpose of providing the client with legal services in connection with pending or anticipated legal proceedings (at [18]).

Section 98(1) of the VCATA is set out as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">General procedure</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)     The Tribunal—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">is bound by the rules of natural </span><span class="font-italic">justice</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">is not bound by the rules of evidence</span> or any practices or procedures applicable to courts of record, <span class="font-italic">except to the extent that it adopts</span> <span class="font-italic">those rules, practices or </span><span class="font-italic">procedures</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">may inform itself on any matter as it sees </span><span class="font-italic">fit</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) must conduct each proceeding with as little formality and technicality, and determine each proceeding with as much speed, as the requirements of this Act and the enabling enactment and a proper consideration of the matters before it permit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in bold; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The tribunal took the view that the fact <span class="font-italic">per se</span> that a statement is unsworn and made by a person who will not be tested in cross-examination does not constitute “unfairness of such a magnitude” as to render the statement inadmissible (at [7]). However, the tribunal ruled that one specific file note was not admissible because there were other concerns over its contents, namely that the note “contain[ed] florid language”, “refer[red] in part to matters otherwise unsubstantiated and, in some instances, irrelevant to the issues”, and contained “remarks made in anger or outrage” (at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In <span class="font-italic">Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> v Kostakis </span>[2003] VCAT 951 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan</span>”), the applicants, who were landlords, sought <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> possession of the property they leased to the respondents and the outstanding arrears of rent. The first respondent brought an application for a summary dismissal of the claims against him on the basis that they were frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance and/or otherwise an abuse of process, pursuant to s 75 of the VCATA (at [8]). In support of his position, the first respondent exhibited a letter addressed to his solicitors. The letter was purportedly written and sent by a director of a company which managed the property. The contents of the letter informed that there were changes to the locks of the property on two occasions due to breaches of the lease (at [22]). The first respondent submitted that on either or both occasions, the lock-outs were effective to terminate the lease and therefore absolved him of liability for the arrears (at [23]). He claimed that he was unable to provide any further information about the letter as he was not in physical possession of the property (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). The tribunal acknowledged that it was able to receive and consider hearsay material, and inform itself in such manner as it saw fit by virtue of s 98(1) of the VCATA (at [26]) (see [116] above). Yet the tribunal found that it would be contrary to the rules of natural justice to allow the letter to be the basis of a crucial finding of fact (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the first respondent was in fact locked out of the property) without opposing parties having the opportunity to cross-examine the maker of the statement or to clarify the situation (at [26]). It therefore dismissed the first respondent’s application for summary dismissal of the claims against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kais Jewellery (Syd) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation</span> [2021] AATA 16, the applicants applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decision of the Commissioner of Taxation. In the proceedings below, the commissioner refused to admit a witness statement made by a person who died before the applications were heard. The basis for this refusal was that the hearsay statement could not be tested by cross-examination and its admission would be unfairly prejudicial. On review, the tribunal found that the witness statement ought to be admitted. It held that the witness statement had direct relevance to the central issue, and it was not possible to obtain the evidence to which the witness deposed from the other witnesses (at [24]). The tribunal considered that while there was potential for unfair prejudice to the commissioner in admitting the evidence, there might be similar prejudice to the applicants if the statement was excluded (at [23]). The objections raised by the commissioner on the potential unfair prejudice related to the lack of insight to the circumstances in which the statement was made (at [22]). The tribunal observed that it was possible for the commissioner to seek further information regarding the circumstances in which the witness statement was made from the interpreter and/or the applicants’ solicitor who witnessed the statement (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). It noted that this was ultimately a consideration which could go to the weight placed on the statement (at [22]–[23]). Although the tribunal allowed the statement to be admitted, it made two salient observations. First, “that a statutory provision [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the AATA (see [76] above)] … provides <span class="font-italic">that an administrative tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence</span> ‘<span class="font-italic">does not signify that the tribunal must</span>,<span class="font-italic"> over objection</span>, s<span class="font-italic">upinely receive any evidence that is tendered before it</span>’ [emphasis added]” (at [11]). Second, the fact that tribunals had “for the most part” admitted the evidence where the deponent was not available for cross-examination “[did] not suggest automatic admission of such evidence without a proper weighing of the potential for unfair prejudice against its probative value” (at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The Australian provisions on the admissibility of evidence in proceedings before a tribunal are very similar to s 51(4) of the MRA (see [76], [79], [80], [112] and [116] above). The position adopted in <span class="font-italic">CFJ</span> assists with conceptualising the limits on the admissibility of hearsay evidence under s 51(4) of the MRA (see [113] above). The Australian approach coheres with the English approach in so far as it acknowledges that hearsay evidence is not always admissible (see [116]–[118] above). There is no hurdle to the admission of hearsay evidence in hearings before a tribunal which is not bound by the usual rules of evidence. The only caveat to that is when the applicant is deprived of the opportunity to respond or rebut the hearsay evidence presented against him. In such a scenario, the applicant’s right to a fair hearing may be compromised. The analysis will inevitably turn on the context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Another pertinent observation is that the rules of evidence are not entirely disregarded by a tribunal. In <span class="font-italic">Ingot Capital</span>, the court granted the order for accessing documents in the possession of another party to the proceedings before the tribunal. This was in recognition of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the exclusion of the usual rules of evidence (specifically common law litigation privilege) by s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the AAT. Even so, Bergin J noted the continued relevance of the rules of evidence in proceedings before a tribunal (see above at [115]). This may arise in determining whether the evidence itself held rational probative force (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Conclusion on the Authorities</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The discretion to admit evidence under s 51(4) of the MRA must be limited by the rules of natural justice. I refer to the conception of natural justice as being the two limbs of procedural fairness as set out above at [88]–[89]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I distil the following observations from the Australian and English case authorities, as applied to the context of s 51(4) of the MRA. Hearsay evidence is admissible under s 51(4) of the MRA as the provision confers a broad discretion on the DT. That said, in admitting hearsay evidence, the DT should exercise due caution in ensuring that the right to a fair hearing is not breached. To satisfy this requirement, the respondent must be given the opportunity to comment and contradict the hearsay evidence. The content of this opportunity is fact dependent (see [124] below). The DT should maintain the distinction between the question as to admissibility of the evidence and the decision as to the weight to accord to it. The assessment as to the weight placed on the evidence may incorporate guidance from the time-tested rules of evidence (see [115] above). The holding in <span class="font-italic">Ingot Capital </span>is that the wide discretion conferred on tribunals in admitting evidence should not be seen as equivalent to disregarding all rules of evidence as of no account (see [115] above). I find this to be a sound observation. Indeed, this manifests in the standard of proof required to establish a professional misconduct charge against a medical practitioner (see [123]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The MRA and the MRR are silent on the requisite standard of proof to establish a professional misconduct charge pursuant to the MRA. This is not to say that the DT does away with any standard of proof. At the close of the SMC’s case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the prosecution’s case, it must show that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the medical practitioner based on the charge(s) brought against him. It is trite that this is the standard to meet, and parties expressed the same view in proceedings below. Chan Sek Keong CJ’s comments on the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</span> [2012] 3 SLR 440 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero</span>”), which were in the context of legal disciplinary proceedings before a tribunal, are equally applicable. The concept of a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” is also characterised as the appropriate threshold that had to be met before the DT would call upon the defence at the close of the prosecution’s case: <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero</span> at [17]. In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon </span>Zero at [14], the court endorsed Lord Diplock’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Haw </span><span class="font-italic">Tua Tau v PP</span> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133 at [17] that the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard is met if “there is <span class="font-italic">some evidence (not inherently incredible)</span> which, <span class="font-italic">if [the judge] were to accept it as accurate, would establish each </span><span class="font-italic">essential element in the alleged offence</span>” [emphasis added]. Crucially, by the end of the proceedings, the legal burden is on the SMC to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the charge against the medical practitioner is made out: <span class="font-italic">Gobinathan</span><span class="font-italic"> Devathasan v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2010] 2 SLR 926 at [62]. That these standards of proof are enshrined in medical disciplinary proceedings before a tribunal only shows that the rules of evidence are not entirely abandoned by virtue of s 51(4) of the MRA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I consider it necessary to set out how the opportunity to comment and controvert the evidence may present itself in the context of DT proceedings. What would suffice to comport with the practitioner’s right to a fair hearing turns on the particular circumstances of the case. Cross-examination is one of the ways in which the practitioner can deal with the adverse evidence. The practitioner also has an opportunity to comment on or contradict the evidence at the close of the prosecution’s case. He may do so by submitting that there is no case to answer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the SMC has failed to adduce evidence that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. The DT would then rule on whether the prosecution has discharged its burden of proof at that juncture and determine if the defence should be called. If the defence is called, the practitioner may choose to respond to the contents of the evidence by electing to give evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Applicant submits that the Evidence is hearsay as it was adduced before the DT as “indirect evidence”

</div> He appears to argue that the reliance on the Evidence in the prosecution’s case is not permitted as it was hearsay at that juncture. The Applicant concedes that the Evidence would be admissible during his case <span class="font-italic">if</span> he elects to give evidence, and his testimony is contradictory to the Evidence (pursuant to s 147(3) of the EA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I discuss first the implications of the Applicant contesting the admissibility of the Evidence in the SMC’s case. The Applicant appears to make this submission for the reason that the Evidence comprised the Statements provided by him in the course of criminal investigations and the Testimony he provided at his trial, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Applicant himself was the maker of the Evidence. Taken with the Applicant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>, this would mean that the Applicant needed to be cross-examined on the Evidence for it to be tested, and such an opportunity could only arise during the presentation of his case. This would be after the close of the SMC’s case, if the DT calls on the defence’s case and the Applicant elects to take the stand. The Applicant therefore argues that the Evidence is hearsay at the present juncture, where the maker of the Statements and Testimony is not available to testify to it.

</div> He acknowledges that the Evidence may be admissible in the defence’s case (see [125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I do not consider the present situation to be similar to <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span> such as to cause the exclusion of the Evidence from the proceedings before the DT. In <span class="font-italic">Ogbonna</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>, the challenges made by the respondents against hearsay evidence were due to the prosecution’s failure to produce the makers of the evidence. The curious situation in the present case is that the respondent (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Applicant) himself is the maker. This is precisely the reason why the Applicant has couched the hearsay objection in these terms. It cannot be said that the admission of the Evidence in the DT proceedings would cause any breach of natural justice when the Applicant himself may properly challenge the substance of the Evidence. After all, only the Applicant is capable of responding to the allegations contained within the Evidence as its contents originated from him. I understand the Applicant’s contention on the hearsay nature of the Evidence to be narrowly confined to the situation where the Evidence is admitted during the SMC’s case. It suffices that he has an opportunity to comment and/or contradict the Evidence at the close of the prosecution’s case by submitting that there is no case to answer (see [124] above). It is open to the Applicant to submit that the contradiction between the patient’s testimony and the Evidence cannot sustain a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. It is then for the DT to consider whether there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case made out against the Applicant before deciding if the defence should be called (see [123] above). Moreover, on the unique facts of this case, the Applicant’s narrow objection to the admissibility of the Evidence in the prosecution’s case faces another hurdle. The right to a fair hearing, in general, relates to procedural fairness in the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Regina v Secretary of State for Transport, </span><span class="font-italic">Ex parte Gwent County Council</span> [1988] QB 429 (“<span class="font-italic">Gwent County Council</span>”) at 446–447, the English Court of Appeal held that the court’s function was to consider whether the procedure <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>, being the proceedings before the inspector and the Secretary of State, was fair to the objecting party. The Secretary of State had allegedly failed to consider the objections to a proposed order before making it. While the basis of the challenge in <span class="font-italic">Gwent County Council</span> was that the Secretary of State had acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>, rather than the breach of a right to fair hearing, the principle pronounced is equally applicable to the assessment of whether there is a breach of a right to fair hearing. If the DT assesses that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the Applicant, it calls for the defence’s case. The Applicant may then elect to respond to the Evidence and, in so doing, raise his own evidence to comment on or challenge it. Thus, the Applicant’s right to a fair hearing is not abrogated by the admission of the Evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I consider a related contention that the Applicant makes on the admissibility of the Evidence. The Applicant contests the use of the Evidence in the SMC’s case because it allows the SMC to be “relieve[d] … of the prosecution’s burden to lead sufficient <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence to justify the calling of the defence”.

</div> There is no merit to this argument. The effect of adducing the Evidence does not shift or alleviate the burden of proof. The SMC retains the duty of establishing a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case at the close of its case. It bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the charges against the Applicant at the close of the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 On the facts of this case, the DT should be allowed to perform its function to achieve the aims as stated above at [44]–[46]. In <span class="font-italic">Bonhoeffer</span>, the High Court regarded the preservation of procedural propriety in the proceedings before the FTP Panel as being consistent with the aims of the FTP Panel in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, upholding the public interest in protecting patients and maintaining public confidence in the medical profession. It held as follows (at [129]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The reality would appear to be that the factor which the FTPP considered decisive in favour of admitting the hearsay evidence was the serious nature of the allegations against the Claimant coupled with the public interest in investigating such allegations and the FTPP's duty to protect the public interest in protecting patients, maintaining public confidence in the profession and declaring and upholding proper standards of behaviour. In oral argument Mr Warby QC on behalf of the FTPP submitted that the gravity of the allegations is a factor arguing in favour of admissibility of the hearsay evidence. In my judgment that submission is misconceived. It is of course self-evidently correct that the greater is the gravity of allegations, the greater is the risk to the public if there is no or no effective investigation by a professional body such as the FTPP into them. However, that factor on its own does not in my view diminish the weight which must be attached to the procedural safeguards to which a person accused of such allegations is entitled both at common law and under Article 6 [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the right to a fair hearing]. To the contrary, the authorities to which I have referred suggest the reverse to be the case. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The more serious the allegation, the greater the importance of ensuring that the accused doctor is afforded fair and proper procedural safeguards. There is no public interest in a wrong result.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There is no issue of a wrong result in the present case. The Applicant is the maker of the Evidence. It does not lie in his mouth to say that the Evidence is hearsay. When the matter is considered in the round, there is simply no unfairness caused to the Applicant by the admission of the Evidence. It is therefore well within the public interest for the DT to have admitted the Evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I am aware that “fairness” is often used in the discussion of natural justice as being procedural fairness. The Applicant has alluded to the assessment of “fairness” as being a substantive inquiry, which includes querying whether the prejudice caused to the medical practitioner outweighs the probative value of the evidence in determining its admissibility. For avoidance of doubt, I do not accept fairness, in so far as it refers to non-procedural fairness, as a relevant factor in the DT’s determination of the admissibility of evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Summary</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In sum, the main considerations limiting the DT’s discretion under s 51(4) of the MRA include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Relevance of the evidence: The pre-requisite to the admissibility of the evidence is whether it is logically probative or relevant to the proceedings (see [73], [79] and [84] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Natural justice: Notwithstanding s 51(4) of the MRA, the DT is required to comply with the rules of natural justice (see [88]–[89] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Generally, any evidence is admissible if relevant to the DT proceedings, including hearsay evidence. This is contingent on its compliance with the rules of natural justice. In particular, the right to a fair hearing. The right to a fair hearing is usually secured by offering the respondent an opportunity to comment on and contradict the evidence.

</div> This is consistent with the plain words of s 259(1) of the CPC, which reads “[a]ny statement made by a person other than the accused <span class="font-italic">in the course of any investigation </span>… is inadmissible …” [emphasis added].

The Applicant’s position on what constitutes statements recorded from “a person other than the accused” under s 259(1) of the CPC is entirely contradicted by the C3J’s express holding. The Applicant’s position is that whether a statement is considered to be made by a person other than the accused (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, within the ambit of s 259(1) of the CPC) is determined based on the standing of the person in the relevant proceedings. He argues that his present capacity is that of “a person other than the accused” because he is not an accused person in a criminal trial for the present DT proceedings.

</div>
</div> Counsel for the Applicant submitted at the hearing that the reference to any statement made by a person “<span class="font-italic">other than the</span> <span class="font-italic">accused</span>” [emphasis added], must necessarily mean the accused in a criminal trial. It was conceded at the hearing that the Applicant relies only on <span class="font-italic">Manohar</span> for this proposed interpretation.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As set out above at [139], the court in <span class="font-italic">Manohar </span>held in unambiguous terms that the question of whether statements were made by the “accused” must be considered in relation to whether criminal proceedings were brought against him in connection with the recording of the statements. There is no basis which underpins the Applicant’s interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In the present case, criminal proceedings were brought against the Applicant following the recording of the Statements in the course of investigations. Thus, the Statements cannot be said to fall within the ambit of s 259(1) of the CPC. The inadmissibility of all witness statements in evidence (save for limited statutory exceptions) pursuant to s 259(1) of the CPC does not apply to the Statements. Section 259(1) of the CPC does not render the Statements inadmissible in the DT proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Are the Statements inadmissible under s 258(1) of the CPC?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 It is not necessary to consider the effect of s 258(1) of the CPC on the admissibility of the Statements in the proceedings below. The Applicant’s initial position was that the Statements were governed by s 258(1) of the CPC (see above at [9(d)]). However, Counsel for the Applicant clarified at the hearing that s 258(1) of the CPC did not apply to the Statements (see [10] above). For completeness, however, I address the Applicant’s arguments on s 258(1) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Section 258(1) of the CPC is set out below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Admissibility of accused’s statements</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">258.—(1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), <span class="font-italic">where any person is charged with an offence</span>, <span class="font-italic">any statement</span> made by the person, whether it is oral or in writing, <span class="font-italic">made at any time</span>, whether before or after the person is charged and whether or not in the course of any investigation carried out by any law enforcement agency, <span class="font-italic">is admissible in evidence at the person’s trial</span>; and if that person tenders himself or herself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross‑examination and for the purpose of impeaching that person’s credit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in bold; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Applicant submitted that s 258(1) of the CPC permits the admission of an accused person’s statements “at his trial” regardless of whether he has taken the stand.

</div> Therefore, he asserted that s 258(1) of the CPC should be read restrictively to apply only to criminal proceedings and to regulate the use of police statements taken under the CPC, but not the DT proceedings. Accordingly, the Applicant argued that s 258(1) of the CPC “does not apply to allow the admission” of the Statements in the DT proceedings.

</div> The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span> noted that with s 258(1) of the CPC, the starting point is that any statement given by an accused person in the course of investigations is admissible in evidence at his trial (at [36]). This is subject to the requirement of voluntariness expressed in s 258(3) of the CPC (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). The rationale underpinning the admissibility regime in s 258(3) of the CPC is reliability (at [37]). Thus, excluding the admissibility of the Statements in non-criminal proceedings was not in any way related to, and therefore did not further, the legislative purpose of ensuring the use of only reliable statements from accused persons in criminal proceedings.

</div> The C3J in <span class="font-italic">Manohar</span> identified two of several legislative purposes of s 259 of the CPC as being the disclosure purpose and the limitation purpose (at [92] and [97]). The disclosure purpose was “the promotion of the public interest in encouraging the free and candid disclosure of information by witnesses to law enforcement agencies”: <span class="font-italic">Manohar</span> at [92]. The limitation purpose was “to place limits on the use of information obtained from witnesses pursuant to the exercise of coercive police powers”: <span class="font-italic">Manohar</span> at [97]. The C3J expressly found that the disclosure purpose did not apply to s 258 of the CPC (at [93]).

</div> It would have far-reaching consequences to impute the limitation purpose to s 258 of the CPC in interpreting the provision, which would essentially exclude the use of statements recorded from accused persons from any other proceedings.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 I agree with the AG’s reading of s 258 of the CPC (see [146] above). The provision is silent on whether statements recorded from an accused person pursuant to the CPC are admissible in proceedings other than his own criminal trial. It is outside of the ambit of the plain wording of s 258 of the CPC to interpret the provision as excluding the admissibility of statements made by an accused person from all other proceedings. Section 258 of the CPC only provides for the admissibility of statements given by an accused person in his criminal trial. It is otherwise silent on their admissibility (or exclusion) in other non-criminal proceedings. The legislative purpose of s 258 of the CPC (as set out in [147(b)] above) is not furthered by the prohibition on the use of statements by an accused person outside of his criminal trial. Section 258 of the CPC facilitates the admission of statements from an accused person as <span class="font-italic">reliable</span> evidence in the course of criminal proceedings. This is distinct from the aims of s 259 of the CPC (as set out in [147(c)] above), which relate to statements recorded from persons other than accused persons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Thus, the Applicant’s original position on the inapplicability of s 258(1) of the CPC to the Statements in the proceedings before the DT does not assist him.
