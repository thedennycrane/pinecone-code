<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The applicant Danish companies, Strandore Invest
                    A/S (“Strandore”), LKE Electric Europe A/S (“LKE
                    Europe”) and MS Invest Odense A/S (“Odense”), (collectively
                    “the Applicants”), filed Originating Summons 19/2010
                    (“OS 19/2010”) to enforce an arbitration award (“the
                    Final Award”) against the Respondent, Soh Kim Wat (“Soh”).
                    The Final Award, dated 30 April 2008, in favour of the Applicants, was made
                    by a 3-member Arbitral Tribunal and issued out of the Danish Institute of
                    Arbitrators, (“DIA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Soh made the following applications;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Summons No 712/2010/D: to stay
                        this Originating Summons, OS 19/2010, pending the resolution of Suit
                        No 968 of 2009 (“S 968/2009”), (in which Soh basically
                        challenged the Final Award and asked for various declaratory reliefs), in
                        the alternative, Soh applied to have OS 19/2010 continue as if the same
                        had been commenced by way of Writ of Summons under O 28 r 9 of the
                        Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)(“RSC”),
                        and that OS 19/2010 be heard together and consolidated with S
                        968/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Summons No 282/2010/J: to set aside the Mareva injunction issued on
                        8 January 2010 (“the Mareva injunction”) against him,
                        following an <em>ex parte</em> application by the
                        Applicants for the said injunction in Summons
                No 94/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Originating Summons and Soh’s two
                    applications came up for hearing before me on 9 April 2010. After hearing
                    the parties, I dismissed Soh’s applications, granted the Applicants leave
                    to enforce the Final Award and declined to discharge the Mareva injunction. Soh
                    appealed against my decision on 13 April 2010 and I now set out my grounds for
                    my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Applicants were shareholders of a Malaysian
                    company, LKE Electric (M) Sdn Bhd (“the Company”). Soh was and
                    still is a director and shareholder of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 22 March 2003, Soh entered into Share
                    Sale Agreements with Strandore and Odense to purchase their shares in the
                    Company with the former selling 1,520,000 shares for US$500,000 and the latter
                    selling 732,561 shares for US$289,169. On 10 December 2004, Soh entered
                    into a Share Sale Agreement with LKE Europe to purchase its 500,000 shares in
                    the Company for DKK 1,611,923. All the Share Sale Agreements, (collectively,
                    “the Agreements”), contained a similar arbitration clause
                    providing that Danish Law was the governing law and any dispute was to be
                    resolved by arbitration in Denmark:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This agreement shall be governed by Danish Law and any dispute or claim
                        between the parties arising directly or indirectly out of this agreement
                        shall be subject to arbitration before Copenhagen Arbitration according to
                        the Rules of Procedure of Copenhagen Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Soh made payment of DKK44,673 to LKE Europe but
                    otherwise failed to make any payments under the Agreements. On 23 June
                    2006, Strandore, LKE Europe and Odense filed their Request for Arbitration
                    before the DIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The DIA had its own published Rules of Procedure
                    which came into force on 1 April 2006, (“DIA Rules”). The
                    Applicants contended that Copenhagen Arbitration meant arbitration under the DIA
                    Rules of Procedure and the applicable law was the Danish Arbitration Act which
                    came into force on 1 July 2005. Mr Leo, counsel for Soh, did not seek
                    to argue otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The DIA sent notice of the Applicants’
                    Request for Arbitration by registered letter dated 30 June 2006 to Soh at
                    the address used in the Agreements, 16 Ford Avenue, Singapore (“the
                    Singapore Address”). This letter was returned “unclaimed”.
                    The Applicants then served the Request for Arbitration on Soh on 4 November
                    2006 together with the DIA’s letter dated 30 June 2006 and the DIA
                    Rules at Soh’s office at Lot 1 &amp; 3, Jalan SS 13/3C Subang Jaya
                    Industrial Estate 47500, Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia,
                    (“Soh’s Malaysian office address”). There is a statutory
                    declaration from a Malaysian solicitor to that effect and it exhibits a document
                    with Soh’s endorsement: “Received without prejudice.” Soh
                    followed this up with a 3-page letter dated 8 November 2006 to the DIA,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, challenging the validity of the
                    request for arbitration, the service and contending that the documents were
                    “definitely not in order”. Soh also gave some background and
                    alleged an agreement that all the Agreements were for the collateral purpose of
                    showing them to a third party to assist the Claimants (<em>ie</em> the Applicants in this case), and were at all material times
                    not meant to be enforced against him. However Soh did not nominate an arbitrator
                    as required under the DIA Rules. The DIA sent a letter dated 29 December
                    2006 in accordance with Article 19 of the DIA Rules notifying Soh of its
                    proposal to appoint Advokat Peter Wengler-Jørgensen and Attorney Per Magid, both
                    from Copenhagen, as members, and Dr Wolfgang Kühn from Dusseldorf, as
                    Chairman, of the Arbitral Tribunal. The DIA requested Soh for his comments on or
                    before 16 January 2007, failing which the DIA would proceed with their
                    formal appointment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 31 January 2007, the DIA informed
                    parties of the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with
                    Articles 19 and 20 of the DIA Rules. This letter was sent to Soh’s
                    Malaysian office address. This was followed by a Procedural Order dated
                    26 February 2007 from the Arbitral Tribunal ordering a hearing to take
                    place on 3 May 2007. In his letter dated 6 March 2007, Soh opposed the
                    appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal on various grounds, including lack of
                    proper service of the Request for Arbitration. The hearing was held as scheduled
                    on 3 May 2007 and the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Award dated 15 May
                    2007 on jurisdiction ruling that it had no competence to render a decision on
                    the grounds, <em>inter alia</em>, that Soh did not receive
                    the DIA’s letter dated 29 December 2006 on the appointment of the
                    Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The DIA then sent a letter dated 24 May
                    2007 enclosing the Arbitral Tribunal’s Award of 15 May 2007 and
                    proposed the appointment of the same three arbitrators. The DIA also said that
                    unless one of both parties propose other candidates or are otherwise instructed
                    by the parties no later than 24 July 2007, it would proceed to regard the
                    three gentlemen as approved by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Soh replied on 16 July 2007, stating,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please note that <u>I STRONGLY OBJECT</u> to the
                        Proposed Tribunal, proposed members of the Tribunal and the proposed
                        Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>If</em> the proposed Tribunal/Arbitration is
                        valid, I would certainly wish to propose an Arbitrator for the purported
                        Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the proposed Tribunal and the proposed Arbitration <u>is invalid</u>. In any event your documents are not
                        even complete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Soh also complained that there was no valid Request for Arbitration
                    issued to him, the Request for Arbitration was unsigned and not authenticated,
                    not addressed to any person or organisation, it was unlawful, highly improper
                    and irregular for the DIA to employ the Applicant’s lawyers to effect
                    service on him, the DIA was not impartial, the Agreements relied upon to launch
                    the arbitration were being challenged by him, as the Applicants well knew
                    (referring to Singapore Court proceedings), their arbitration clauses were
                    therefore invalid, that the Agreements were not to be enforced against him
                    personally since they were for the collateral purpose of assisting the
                    Applicants and to be showed to a third party. Soh also claimed that under the
                    DIA Rules he could propose his arbitrator and only upon his failure to do so
                    could the DIA proposed an arbitrator. He accused the DIA of not treating him
                    with equality and fairness, for not being impartial, breaches of natural justice
                    and proper procedure and reserved his rights. It should be noted however, that
                    Soh did not propose anyone as arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Applicants’ solicitor wrote to the
                    DIA on 30 July 2007 stating that their clients had no objections to the
                    tribunal and noted that Soh had not objected to the claims and had not put
                    forward any comments about the claims. It appears the Applicants or their
                    solicitor sent an earlier letter dated 29 May 2007 informing the DIA that
                    they had no objections to the proposed arbitrators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The DIA informed both parties on 9 August
                    2007 that it “could not follow” Soh’s objections and
                    strongly urged Soh to propose an arbitrator no later than 10 September
                    2007, otherwise the DIA will consider the tribunal as approved by the parties
                    and therefore duly constituted. Soh responded on 6 September 2007,
                    repeating his objections and again objected to the arbitration and appointment
                    of the proposed tribunal. But Soh did not propose or appoint an arbitrator. On
                    10 September 2007, the DIA appointed Dr Wolfgang Kühn, Peter
                    Wengler-Jørgensen and Per Magid as the Arbitral Tribunal with Dr Kühn as
                    the Chairman and asked Soh to submit a Statement of Defence by 1 October
                    2007. Soh replied on 1 October 2007, repeating his arguments. On
                    22 November 2007, Soh was given an extension by the DIA to submit his
                    Statement of Defence by 15 January 2008. Soh responded by letter dated
                    28 December 2007 repeating some of his arguments. By letter dated
                    17 January 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal scheduled a hearing on 17 March
                    2008 at 10.00 am at the DIA’s offices in Copenhagen. Soh objected to this
                    in a letter sent by email to the Chairman on 13 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Soh did not, in the event, file any Statement
                    of Defence (save for what he had contended in his letters referred to above),
                    and did not turn up at the hearing on 17 March 2008. On 30 April 2008,
                    the Final Award was rendered in favour of the Applicants and a copy was served
                    on Soh on 8 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 30 July 2008, Soh challenged the Final
                    Award in the City Court of Helsingore (“City Court of Denmark”).
                    This challenge was dismissed on 25 June 2009. Soh’s appeal to the
                    High Court of Denmark against the judgment of the City Court was dismissed on
                    19 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the meantime, on 10 November 2009, Soh
                    filed Suit No 968/2009 in the High Court of Singapore to, in effect,
                    challenge the Final Award. The Statement of Claim contained many of Soh’s
                    contentions set out in his letters referred to above, but with more details. Soh
                    contended that the Agreements were unenforceable, void or voidable, that there
                    would be unjust enrichment to the Applicants, the shares could not be
                    transferred to Soh even if he paid for them, the disputes were not capable of
                    settlement by arbitration, enforcement of the Final Award would be contrary to
                    public policy, Soh alleges fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation and asks for
                    various declaratory reliefs. This Writ is currently in the process of being
                    served on the Applicants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 7 January 2010, the Applicants filed
                    OS 19/2010 for leave to enforce the Final Award. On 8 January 2010,
                    the Applicants applied for and obtained a worldwide Mareva Injunction against
                    Soh, which restrained him from removing from Singapore up to $3 million of the
                    proceeds of sale of his property at 16 Ford Avenue, Singapore 268695
                    (“the Ford property”). The sum frozen was reduced to S$2.6 million
                    on 26 January 2010 by Belinda Ang J.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the stay should be granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As noted above, Soh asserted that
                    OS 19/2010 ought to be stayed pending the resolution of S 968/2009, or in
                    the alternative that it be converted to a writ action and be consolidated
                    together with S 968/2010. Mr Leo argued that this was an unusual case
                    because the Agreements were never meant to be enforced from the outset. Soh
                    contended that the Agreements were merely a ploy to help his close friend, Kaare
                    Vagner Jensen (“Kaare”), who was the Chairman and Executive
                    Director of the company, divest his interest in the company as he was facing
                    legal action by “Schneider”, a European company, for trademark
                    infringement. They were not true share sale and purchase agreements at all. In
                    addition, Soh claimed that the shares could not be transferred to him even if he
                    paid for them because the directors had the power under the Company’s
                    Articles of Association to refuse consent to any such transfer. Soh produced an
                    affidavit dated 9 February 2010 from one Mr Lim Boon Thor, (“Mr
                    Lim”), an independent director of the Company, stating that he has been a
                    director of the Company for more than 10 years and he would have objected to any
                    purported share transfer from any of the Applicants to Soh. Mr Lim
                    exhibited two letters dated 23 March 2003 and 20 April 2009 to that
                    effect. Mr Lim also confirmed that he knew that the Agreements were not
                    true share sale and purchase agreements and Mr Kaare Vagner told
                    Mr Lim this sometime in or about 2005 in Copenhagen. Hence, Soh submitted
                    that enforcement of the final award was unconscionable and against public
                    policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Ms See Tow for the Applicants argued that
                    Soh was delaying matters in every way that he could. His current S 968/2010
                    should be seen in light of the full history of this matter. Very much earlier on
                    in this dispute, the Applicants’ former solicitors, Acies Law Corporation,
                    sent a letter of demand on 4 January 2006 to Soh demanding payment under
                    the Agreements. Soh’s Malaysian solicitors, Messrs Sidek Teoh Wong &amp;
                    Dennis, responded on 23 January 2006 stating that Soh was “prepared
                    to proceed with Copenhagen Arbitration in accordance with the terms of the said
                    Agreements” and that the Applicants’ threat to commence proceedings
                    in Singapore was in breach of the Agreements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our client categorically disputes your client’s demands and for the
                        avoidance of any doubt, our client is prepared to proceed with Copenhagen
                        Arbitration in accordance with the terms of the said Agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Applicants filed Suit No 55 of 2006, (“S
                    55/2006”), for the purchase price under the Agreements and served it on
                    Soh on or about 21 February 2006. Soh promptly applied to stay the same.
                    Soh swore an affidavit in S 55/2006 on 11 March 2006, which stated, <em>inter alia</em>, his intention and readiness to have the
                    disputes resolved by arbitration, notice of which of had been sent by his
                    solicitors to the Applicants and Soh stated that at all material times he was
                    willing and ready to have the disputes arbitrated via Copenhagen
                    Arbitration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I verily state based on the aforesaid that the Plaintiffs ought to be held
                        to the Arbitration Clause which they themselves have agreed to from the
                        outset” (see paragraphs 61 and 62).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">S 55/2006 was stayed on 10 May 2006 pursuant to s 6 of
                    the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev
                    Ed)(“IAA”) and the Applicants were ordered to pay costs fixed at
                    $1,200 plus reasonable disbursements. Hence, as noted above, the Applicants
                    proceeded to arbitration and issued the Request of Arbitration before the DIA on
                    23 June 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Ms See Tow then put forward the following
                    facts obtained from the affidavits as being very noteworthy:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     When the Final Award dated
                        30 April 2008 was rendered in favour of the Applicants, the Applicants
                        commenced enforcement proceedings in Singapore in OS 999/2008 on
                        29 July 2008. Leave to enforce the Final Award was granted on
                        31 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 30 July 2008, Soh challenged the Final Award by filing
                        challenge proceedings in the City Court of Denmark, (Case
                        No 1-1389/2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Soh then effectively set aside all orders obtained in
                        OS 999/2008, including the leave to enforce the Final Award (and an
                        Order for Examination of Judgement Debtor obtained on 24 September
                        2008) on 20 February 2009 on the basis that he was challenging the
                        validity of the Final Award before the Danish Court. The Applicants were
                        ordered to pay costs of $2,500 plus reasonable
                    disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Soh’s challenge was dismissed by the City Court, Denmark on
                        25 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     Soh proceeded to file an appeal in the High Court of Denmark on
                        13 July 2009 appealing against the judgment of the City
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_f"></a>(f)     On
                        12 November 2009, Soh commenced S 968/2009 in Singapore against the
                        Applicants, challenging the Final Award and to litigate his claims set out
                        above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_g"></a>(g)     On the 19 November 2009,
                        Soh’s appeal to the High Court of Denmark was dismissed, not on the
                        merits but because Soh had not paid the High Court fees for the
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_h"></a>(h)     In the
                        meanwhile on 8 October 2009, one Martua Sitorus lodged a caveat against
                        Soh’s property at 16 Ford Avenue in Singapore claiming an interest as
                        a purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ms See Tow submitted that
                    sub-paragraphs (e), (g) and (h) clearly showed Soh filed the appeal to the High
                    Court in Denmark to drag the matter out and not because he had a genuine
                    disagreement with the decision of the City Court of Denmark; further, whilst
                    dragging matters out, he attempted to quickly sell his Ford Avenue property in
                    the meanwhile so as to defeat any fresh enforcement proceedings. I accepted that
                    submission. Soh knew the Applicants had already tried to enforce the Final Award
                    in July 2008, but were stymied by his challenging the Final Award at the seat.
                    He could have been in no doubt the Applicants would try again once the challenge
                    failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It will be readily seen from the recitation
                    above that Soh had successfully taken every possible procedural step and availed
                    himself of every technicality to delay the Applicants. First, Soh stayed the
                    Applicants’ Singapore action (S55/2006) under s 6 IAA on the ground
                    that there was a valid and binding arbitration clause and that he was willing to
                    go to arbitration to resolve the disputes. Then he objected, I must say, on
                    rather unmeritorious technicalities to thwart the Danish arbitration from
                    proceeding. When he could delay no longer, (despite telling the Singapore Court
                    he was able and willing to proceed to arbitrate his disputes by Danish
                    Arbitration as agreed), he did not appoint his arbitrator, failed to file his
                    Statement of Defence, despite being given a number of opportunities to do so,
                    and finally refused to appear or otherwise participate at the hearing of the
                    Danish Arbitration. Soh then appealed to the City Court in Denmark against the
                    Final Award against him, raising all his grounds already canvassed and more, and
                    meanwhile stopping enforcement proceedings in Singapore. Having lost before the
                    courts of the seat, Soh came back to start another action in the Singapore Court
                    and wanted the Applicants’ second attempt to enforce the Final Award in
                    this OS 19/2010 to be stayed pending resolution of S 968/2010 or to be
                    consolidated with that action. On the facts, I could not see how Soh could be
                    allowed to stay an action in Singapore, insist that he wants to go to
                    arbitration, then play out his delay options at the arbitration and having lost,
                    come back to the Singapore Court and ask that his disputes now be dealt with by
                    the Singapore Courts. What Soh raises in S968/2009 should have been raised
                    before the Danish Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I now turn to the law. <em>Aloe
                        Vera of America, Inc v Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd and another</em>
                    [2006] 3 SLR(R) 174 (“<em>Aloe
                    Vera</em>”) lays down the rule that the enforcement of a foreign
                    arbitration award under s 30 IAA and O 69A r 6 RSC, is a
                    mechanistic process. All the applicant seeking enforcement has to do is to
                    produce the arbitration agreement, prove that the defendant was mentioned in the
                    arbitration agreement exhibited by the applicant, and that an Arbitral Tribunal
                    had made a finding that the defendant was a party to that agreement and that the
                    Arbitral Tribunal had made an award against him, exhibiting the duly
                    authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof. It does not
                    require a judicial investigation by the court enforcing the award under the IAA,
                    the examination that the court must make of the documents under O 69A
                    r 6 RSC is a formalistic and not substantive one. Section 31(1) IAA
                    supports this approach. This approach has also been endorsed recently in
                        <em>Denmark Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/s I Likvidation
                        (formerly known as Knud Hansen A/S) v Ultrapolis 300 Investments Ltd
                        (formerly known as Ultrapolis 3000 Theme Park Investments Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 108, (“<em>DSK v
                        Ultrapolis</em>”). A distinction is drawn between the first
                    stage under s 30 and the second stage under s 31.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     With great respect to two very experienced
                    judges, I have my reservations, especially on <em>Aloe
                        Vera</em>, and how far the approach that is advocated is consistent
                    with other cases, including the recent English Court of Appeal decision in
                        <em>Dallah Estate and Tourism Holding Company v The Ministry
                        of Religious Affairs, Government of Pakistan</em> [2009] EWCA
                    Civ 755, (“<em>Dallah Estate</em>”). The
                    judge at first instance stated that when a party is challenging the jurisdiction
                    of an arbitral tribunal under s 103(2) of the English Arbitration Act 1996,
                    (which is the equivalent of our s 31(2) IAA), and that party is, by the
                    very words of that section, required to “prove” a matter, that
                    must mean prove the existence of the relevant matters on a balance of
                    probabilities. That exercise is, to that extent, a rehearing, not a
                    review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The English Court of Appeal agreed with that
                    approach and ruled that proceedings under s 103(2) should take the form of
                    a full re-hearing and not a more limited review. Nothing in our IAA or the
                    Convention suggests that “…the supervisory court at the seat is
                    intended to have any primacy in the sense that enforcing courts are expected,
                    much less required, to treat the award as valid and binding unless and until
                    successfully challenged in the supervisory court… and it is well
                    established… that a person against whom an arbitration award has been
                    made is not bound to challenge it before the supervisory court in order to
                    challenge its enforcement in another jurisdiction..” (at [18] and for the
                    latter point citing <em>Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB v
                        Government of Lithuania (No.2)</em> [2006] EWCA Civ 1529).
                    Insofar as <em>DSK v Ultrapolis</em> seems to accept that a
                    s 31 challenge is a rehearing, I respectfully agree and insofar as
                        <em>Aloe Vera</em> suggests otherwise, I respectfully
                    disagree. Counsel for Dallah had also advocated that international comity and a
                    general “pro-enforcement” approach should be adopted in
                    recognition and enforcement of international arbitration awards. Both the judge
                    and first instance and the Court of Appeal did not agree and said it was a
                    matter of statutory interpretation. However that may not be the last word as
                        <em>Dallah Estate</em> is due to be heard by the
                    Supreme Court in late June this year. There are other jurisdictions which follow
                    the <em>Dallah Estates</em> approach and have to come to a
                    different conclusion from that reached in <em>Aloe
                        Vera</em>. It is worth remembering that just as parties who have
                    chosen arbitration must live with their arbitrator, ‘good, bad or
                    indifferent,’ our courts may be called upon to enforce ‘bad’
                    awards from another jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, none of these reservations arise in
                    the present case. The Applicants have satisfied the formal requirements set out
                    in s 30 IAA and O 69A r 6 RSC. Mr Leo took no issue on
                    that score but rested Soh’s application squarely on s 31(4)(b) IAA
                    which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any proceedings in which the enforcement of a foreign award is sought
                        by virtue of this Part, the court may refuse to enforce the award if it
                        finds that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Burroughs J’s<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> epithet of an
                    “unruly horse”, when applied to the common law concept of public
                    policy and never knowing where it will carry one, does not seem to apply
                    s 31(4)(b) IAA. Our Court of Appeal has interpreted that phrase as only
                    giving a court very limited powers of review. In <em>PT Asuransi
                        Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007]
                    1 SLR(R) 597. The Court of Appeal stressed at [59] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the concept of public policy of the State is not defined in the
                        Act or the Model Law, the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion
                        is that public policy under the Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view,
                        it should only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award
                        would "shock the conscience" (see <em>Downer
                            Connect</em> ([58] <em>supra</em>) at [136]),
                        or is "clearly injurious to the public good or ... wholly offensive to the
                        ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public" (see <em>Deutsche Schachbau v Shell International Petroleum Co
                            Ltd</em> [1987] 2 Lloyds' Rep 246 at 254, <em>per</em> Sir John Donaldson MR), or where it violates the
                        forum's most basic notion of morality and justice: see <em>Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co Inc v Societe Generale de
                            L'Industrie du Papier (RAKTA)</em> 508 F 2d 969
                        (2nd Cir, 1974) at 974.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The restrictiveness of ‘public
                    policy’ set out in s 31(4)(b) IAA can be seen in <em>Aloe Vera</em> itself. There an award made by an Arizona arbitrator,
                    holding the manager of a Singapore company personally liable, even though he had
                    signed an agreement made between a Singapore company and a US corporation, in
                    his capacity as manager of the Singapore company, was held nonetheless
                    enforceable against him in Singapore. My reservation arises because it must
                    follow from this that if a foreign arbitrator, applying a foreign governing law
                    of the contract, were to hold not only the company which was a party to that
                    contract liable but also its holding companies up to the ultimate holding
                    company also liable, on the basis that the foreign governing law treats all the
                    different companies in the group as one, then when enforcement of that award is
                    sought in Singapore, the Singapore courts will enforce that award as it stands,
                    mechanistically, against all the companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, Mr Leo’s submission was
                    that the Agreements were all very unusual agreements, made only for a collateral
                    purpose and were never meant to be enforced, and it would therefore be against
                    public policy to enforce such agreements, which were not, by far, something that
                    shocked the conscience or violated Singapore’s most basic notions of
                    morality and justice. All Mr Leo could point to included the fact that the
                    Agreements were very ‘unusually brief’, there was some mistake in
                    the one of the Agreements, <em>viz</em>, that dated
                    22 March 2003, where although the agreement stated that 500,000 shares are
                    to be transferred from LKE Electric Europe to Soh, the appendix stated that the
                    500,000 shares were transferred to LKE Electric Europe, Article 23 of the
                    company’s Articles of Association clearly provided that “directors
                    may in their discretion and without assigning any reasons refuse to register a
                    transfer of any shares”. Mr Leo argued that if Mr Lim was asked
                    to approve the share transfer, he would have objected to it. However the full
                    Article 23 in the Articles of Association should be looked at:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Directors may in their discretion and without assigning any reasons refuse
                        to register a transfer of any share to any person of whom they do not
                        approve, and they may also refuse to register a transfer of any share on
                        which the Company has a lien</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the Applicants correctly pointed out, it was difficult to see why
                    Mr Lim would refuse a transfer of shares when the transfer was made between
                    existing shareholders of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the final analysis, all these matters are
                    contentions that should have been brought up in the Danish arbitration
                    proceedings. Soh had been given every opportunity to do so by the DIA. There was
                    no substance in Soh’s complaints that he was treated unfairly by the DIA.
                    He was given a number of opportunities to appoint his arbitrator but he failed
                    to do so. Here therefore cannot complain about the composition of the Arbitral
                    Tribunal. All the issues Soh wanted to ventilate in S 968/2009 were matters that
                    he should have raised in the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For these reasons, I dismissed Soh’s
                    stay application and granted the Applicants’ leave to enforce the
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Mareva injunction should be set aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for the application to set aside the Mareva
                    injunction in Summons No 282 of 2010, Soh asserted that the injunction
                    should be set aside as there was no real risk of dissipation of assets, that
                    there had been no full and frank disclosure to the court by the Applicants and
                    the interest due to the Applicants had not been properly computed thereby
                    resulting in freezing a greater sum than was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is a basic requirement that an applicant
                    has to show the risk of dissipation of assets before he can be granted a
                        <em>Mareva</em> injunction. In <em>Barclay-Johnson v Yuill</em> [1980] 1 WLR 1259, Sir Robert
                    Megarry VC said, at 1264:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he heart and core of the Mareva injunction is the risk of the defendant
                        removing his assets from the jurisdiction and so stultifying any judgment
                        given by the courts in the action. If there is no real risk of this, such an
                        injunction should be refused; if there is a real risk, then if the other
                        requirements are satisfied the injunction ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Megarry VC’s view was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Choy Chee Keen Collin v Public Utilities Board</em>
                    [1996] 3 SLR(R) 812 at [19].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Soh contended that his other assets were known
                    to the Applicants as he had declared his other assets in his
                        1<sup>st</sup> affidavit at para 47. These included his
                    shares in the company, a 24,000 square feet plot of land in Seremban, an
                    apartment in a condominium in Singapore, and shares in a business based in
                    China. However, the question I have to address is the risk of dissipation of
                    assets in Singapore, not elsewhere. It is in Singapore that the Applicants have
                    chosen, as they are entitled to, to enforce their Final Award. The Applicants
                    may well have their own valid reasons for not choosing to enforce their Final
                    Award in other countries like Malaysia or China or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I accepted the Applicants’ submission,
                    as I did when they first applied for the <em>Mareva</em>
                    injunction before me, that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets if we
                    look at the timing of the sale and resisting the validity of the Final Award.
                    After the Final Award was rendered on 30 April 2008, the Applicants served
                    a copy on Soh on 8 May 2008. Soh knew the Applicants wanted to enforce the
                    Final Award in Singapore because they had filed OS 999/2008 on 29 July
                    2008 seeking leave to do so. As noted above, Soh filed his challenge in the City
                    Court of Denmark on 30 July 2008. On the basis of his challenge before the
                    Danish Courts, Soh succeeded in getting the Applicants’ OS 999/2008
                    and all orders obtained there dismissed on 20 February 2009. On
                    25 June 2009, the City Court Denmark dismissed Soh’s challenge. Soh
                    filed an appeal against that decision to the High Court of Denmark on
                    13 July 2009. I accepted that appeal was to gain time because Soh did not
                    even pay the required fees to the High Court for the appeal. That was the reason
                    for its dismissal and shows his appeal was not genuine. In the meanwhile, he
                    sold his 16 Ford Avenue property. The purchaser lodged his caveat on
                    8 October 2009. It is therefore clear to me that Soh was trying to
                    liquidate that property to defeat the Applicants’ enforcement in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Soh alleged that there was nothing
                    surreptitious in his wanting to sell the Ford Avenue property. Soh deposed in
                    his 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of 19 January 2010, at
                    para.52, that the Ford property was sold as his wife was staying alone in a big
                    house and they were getting older. They had plans to use the funds, <em>inter alia</em>, to develop or purchase properties.
                    Unfortunately Soh forgot about his earlier affidavit when he was raising
                    technicalities and objecting to service of the arbitration notices and documents
                    on him at his Singapore address. In Soh’s affidavit filed on 11 March
                    2006 in S 55/2006, he stated that he has been residing in Malaysia since
                    2003 and the Singapore address used by the Applicants for service is a house
                    actually occupied by his wife from whom he has been separated since 2003 and he
                    has not stayed there for many years. Soh referred to his wife as his
                    “estranged wife” from whom he was “separated for many
                    years”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Considering Soh’s behaviour as a whole,
                    I was of the view that he was liquidating his assets and accepted that there was
                    a real risk of dissipation of his assets to frustrate enforcement of the Final
                    Award against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is also clear law that a party applying for
                    a <em>Mareva</em> injunction must make full and frank
                    disclosure to the court. I need only refer to two authorities for the rationale
                    and scope of that duty to make full and frank disclosure. In <em>Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore
                        Branch)</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 901, the Court of Appeal
                    explained the rationale:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that on an <em>ex parte</em>
                        application, the applicant must disclose to the court all matters within his
                        knowledge or which ought to have been within his knowledge, which are
                        material to the proceedings and which may be in favour of the party against
                        whom the application is made: see <em>The King v The General
                            Commissioners for the Purposes of the Income Tax Acts for the District
                            of Kensington, ex parte Princess Edmond de Polignac</em> [1917]
                        1 KB 486 at 514 and <em>Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd
                            v Tan Beng Huwah</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 786 … at
                        [21].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Siporex Trade SA v Comdel Commodities
                        Ltd</em> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 428 at 437,
                    Bingham J set out the scope of the duty to make full disclosure in these
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He must identify the crucial points for and against the application, and
                        not rely on general statements and the mere exhibiting of numerous
                        documents. He must investigate the nature of the cause of action asserted
                        and the facts relied on before applying and identify any likely defences. He
                        must disclose all facts which reasonably could or would be taken into
                        account by the Judge in deciding whether to grant the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Soh claimed that the Applicants had failed to
                    inform the court that the Agreements were not meant to be enforced and that the
                    shares could not be transacted because the other directors of the company would
                    have opposed the transaction. First, these claims by Soh were contained in the
                    multiple documents exhibited in the affidavits of the Applicants. They were
                    therefore before me at the time I granted the <em>Mareva</em> injunction. Secondly, I do not find there to be much
                    substance in any of these contentions. When measured against the rationale and
                    scope set out above, I find they were certainly not in the nature of material
                    facts that were not disclosed and would have affected my decision whether to
                    grant the <em>Mareva</em> injunction or not. This objection
                    is, in my view, untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As for Soh’s assertion that the interest
                    due to the Applicants was not computed properly or clearly, and the Applicants
                    had to concede lowering the amount frozen before Belinda Ang J, Ms See
                    Tow explained that the interest computations were complex and unclear as they
                    depended on what the bank rates were for various periods in the past. There was
                    difficulty ascertaining these rates but once they were obtained and
                    re-calculated, the Applicants readily accept a reduction in the sum to be frozen
                    by the <em>Mareva</em> injunction. There was evidence
                    before me making good these submissions and I accept there was some confusion
                    about the Danish interest rates over different periods in the past. This
                    objection accordingly failed as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     After considering all the circumstances and
                    submissions, I was of the view that the Mareva injunction order should be
                    maintained. It is worth noting that the Applicants already have a Final Award in
                    hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I therefore dismissed Soh’s applications
                    and gave leave to the Applicants to enforce the Final Award.</p>
