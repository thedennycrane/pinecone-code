        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff and the defendant are both
                    business entities and they dealt with each other on a number of transactions
                    under which the plaintiff sold, and the defendant bought, consignments of
                    rubber.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff brought these proceedings to
                    obtain a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from continuing with a
                    law suit filed in the courts of Switzerland. It was able to get an interim
                    injunction to this effect. Having been notified of the interim order, the
                    defendant applied for it to be discharged. The plaintiff then applied for the
                    injunction to be made permanent. The applications were heard together since one
                    was the obverse of the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       What makes this anti-suit injunction different
                    from the usual one of its kind is that it seeks to permanently restrain foreign
                    court proceedings in favour of arbitration. This raises distinct jurisdictional
                    considerations which are not typically encountered in situations where an
                    anti-suit injunction is sought in support of foreign court
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       While the question of the court’s
                    jurisdiction is intriguing, the defendant argues that it does not need to be
                    considered at all because the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant
                    did not contain any arbitration or jurisdiction clause and the defendant was
                    therefore perfectly entitled to take action in the courts of Switzerland. This
                    is a threshold issue which must be determined first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       R1 International Pte Ltd (“R1
                    International”), the plaintiff, is a Singapore company in the business of
                    wholesale trading and brokering of rubber. It dealt with Lonstroff AG
                    (“Lonstroff”) through its authorised agent, R1 Europe GmbH
                    (“R1 Europe”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Lonstroff is a Swiss company in the business of
                    processing natural rubber and plastics.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Between 2012 and early 2013, R1 International
                    supplied natural rubber to Lonstroff via R1 Europe. There were five transactions
                    in total. Details of how the orders were placed, the contracting process and
                    delivery of the rubber were given by Andreas Schenker (“Mr
                    Schenker”), Head of Purchasing in Lonstroff. He said that each
                    transaction was negotiated and concluded in a similar manner. First, there were
                    sales negotiations between Lonstroff and R1 Europe via email. Acceptance of R1
                    International’s offers would be communicated to R1 Europe by telephone.
                    The latter would then send an email to Lonstroff confirming the sale.
                    Subsequently, R1 International would send out a signed sales contract for
                    Lonstroff’s signature but Lonstroff would never sign it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The first order was concluded between 24 and 25
                    January 2012. On 24 January 2012, R1 Europe sent an email to Mr Schenker,
                    thanking him for a contract to purchase 42.32 metric tonnes of rubber from R1
                    International and stating several terms of the contract. No mention of any
                    arbitration agreement was made in that email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 1 February 2012, R1 Europe sent an email to
                    Lonstroff requesting them to sign a sales contract dated 27 January 2012. This
                    contract had been pre-signed by R1 International and included a term
                    stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the terms, conditions and rules (including the arbitration
                        clauses and rules) of the International Rubber Association Contract for
                        technically specified rubber in force at date of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In clause 12(C) of the Index to the
                    International Rubber Association Contract (“IRAC terms”), it is
                    specified that any dispute arising out of the contract shall be settled at the
                    designated centre of arbitration which, in respect of shipments to Europe would
                    be London unless the parties agreed otherwise. Lonstroff did not sign the sales
                    contract, but it accepted delivery of the order on 25 May 2012 and made payment
                    to R1 International on 16 July 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The second order was concluded on or around 15
                    August 2012. An email was sent to Lonstroff by R1 Europe, thanking it for the
                    purchase and stating several terms on which the contract was concluded. There
                    was no mention of arbitration as the dispute resolution mechanism or any
                    arbitration agreement in that email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The order was delivered to and accepted by
                    Lonstroff on 27 August 2012. Four days later, on 31 August 2012, R1 Europe sent
                    an email on behalf of R1 International to Lonstroff with a sales contract dated
                    16 August pre-signed by R1. This contract contained the same clause referring to
                    the IRAC terms but, immediately below that, also had the following additional
                    clause (“the SICOM arbitration agreement”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>In the event of any arbitration, it will be conducted
                            in Singapore.</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="right">[Emphasis added in bold italics]</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Lonstroff did not sign the sales
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There were three other orders that were made
                    after the first and second orders. In each case, R1 International sent out a
                    sales contract containing the IRAC clause and the SICOM arbitration
                    clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The dispute arose from the second order. On 20
                    September 2012, Lonstroff emailed R1 Europe, complaining about the smell of the
                    rubber supplied and alleging that R1 had breached the contract because the goods
                    emitted a foul smell that made them unsuitable for Lonstroff’s use.
                    Lonstroff threatened legal proceedings when R1 International refused to offset
                    payment against the cost of delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural history and issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Lonstroff commenced legal proceedings against
                    R1 International in Switzerland on 28 March 2013. On 2 July 2013, R1
                    International requested the Singapore Commodity Exchange (“SICOM”)
                    to set up an arbitration tribunal to resolve the dispute. SICOM replied on 17
                    July 2013 and stated that they would only consider the request when it was
                    confirmed that Swiss proceedings had been suspended and that both parties agreed
                    to refer the dispute to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     R1 International then filed these proceedings
                    on 5 August 2013, to obtain an anti-suit injunction preventing Lonstroff from
                    continuing legal proceedings in the Commercial Court of Canton of Aargovia in
                    breach of the SICOM arbitration agreement. An interim order to this effect was
                    made which Lonstroff then applied to discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The ensuing hearing before me dealt with the
                    applications of both parties since the issues they raised were the same. Three
                    issues were canvassed during the hearing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the contract between the
                        parties provided for disputes to be submitted to
                    arbitration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so,
                        whether this court can grant a permanent anti-suit injunctions supporting
                        international arbitration either under s 12A(2) read with s 12(1)(i) of the
                        International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the
                        IAA”) or under any other power; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     In either case, when should the power be
                        exercised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the contract for the second order contain an arbitration
                clause?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Mohamed, counsel for R1 International,
                    initially advanced his case on the proposition that the SICOM arbitration
                    agreement was part of the contract for the second order on the basis of trade
                    custom. His alternative case was that at least the IRAC term providing for
                    arbitration in London was part of the contract having been incorporated in it by
                    a previous course of dealing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Incorporation by trade custom</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Turning to the plaintiff’s grounds, Mr
                    Mohamed first submitted that the SICOM arbitration agreement was incorporated by
                    trade custom. He relied on the evidence of Oh Kian Chew (“Mr Oh”),
                    the plaintiff’s Head of Global Trading, and that of the president of the
                    board of directors of R1 Europe, Mr Lorenzo Pietro Paolo Dufour (“Mr
                    Dufour”). The effect of their evidence is that the rubber trade is a very
                    mature trade and it is a trade custom for the majority of international rubber
                    traders to conclude contracts based on IRAC terms. Lonstroff’s immediate
                    past supplier, Wurfbain BV, had also used IRAC terms in its dealings with
                    Lonstroff and stipulated for Singapore arbitration. This latter evidence came
                    from Mr Dufour who exhibited a copy of Wurfain BV’s standard form contract
                    to his affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Citing <em>Louis Dreyfus
                        Commodities Asia Pte Ltd v Govind Rubber Limited</em> (Arbitration
                    Petition No 174 of 2012), Mr Mohamed then requested the court to take judicial
                    notice of this fact and find the SICOM arbitration agreement incorporated via
                    trade custom. He cited <em>Zheng Yu Shan v Lian Beng Construction
                        (1988) Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 587 (“<em>Zheng Yu Shan</em>”) at 599 in further support.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Lobo, counsel for Lonstroff, objected and
                    contended that there was insufficient evidence before the court that all
                    contracts for the sale and purchase of rubber incorporated IRAC terms. Moreover,
                    all that had been alleged was that Lonstroff had had a previous supplier who
                    dealt on IRAC terms. This was not supported by evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In my view, on the facts of this case,
                        <em>Zheng Yu Shan</em> is not applicable. The court can
                    only take judicial notice of facts which are clearly established such that they
                    are beyond reasonable dispute or of specific facts which are capable of being
                    immediately and accurately shown to exist by authoritative sources. I cannot
                    take judicial notice of any practice in the rubber trade which is not something
                    I or any ordinary layman who was not involved in the rubber trade would have
                    ordinarily been aware.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Accordingly, the trade practice has to be
                    proved. In this, R1 International has failed. The only evidence came from Mr Oh
                    and Mr Dufour, the latter being R1 International’s agent and therefore not
                    an independent party. The standard form contract of Wurfbain BV was of little
                    probative value as it was not shown that Lonstroff bought from Wurfbain BV on
                    these terms. Mr Schenker’s evidence was that Lonstroff had never been
                    shown the IRAC terms nor had these been mentioned in the course of negotiations.
                    In any case, Lonstroff is not an international rubber trader but an end user of
                    the product so it is believable that it may not be aware of the practice of
                    international rubber traders even if one exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel has neither adduced evidence on the
                    prevalence of IRAC terms in the rubber trade nor shown that the use of IRAC
                    terms is of an incontrovertible nature. I thus reject his submission and find
                    that no trade custom has been established. The SICOM arbitration clause cannot
                    therefore be regarded as having been incorporated in the second order by trade
                    custom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is also worth noting that the SICOM
                    arbitration agreement is not part of the standard IRAC terms. These provide for
                    the place of arbitration to be settled according to the destination of the goods
                    and Singapore is not a designated arbitration centre for goods shipped to
                    London. Thus it would not have been enough for the plaintiff to prove a custom
                    in the rubber trade to contract on IRAC terms; additionally it would have had to
                    establish that in the case of shippers from Singapore these terms included the
                    SICOM arbitration agreement. The plaintiff did not even attempt to do
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Incorporation via previous course of dealing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Alternatively, Mr Mohamed submitted that the
                    SICOM arbitration agreement was incorporated by the parties’ previous
                    course of dealing in which IRAC terms had been incorporated into their
                    contracts. This submission relied on the fact that when the first transaction
                    between the parties took place in early 2012, R1 International had forwarded its
                    sale contract referring to the IRAC terms to Lonstroff. In that case, Lonstroff
                    had not signed the sale contract but it had taken delivery of the goods some    
                    months thereafter and paid for the same without expressly disputing or rejecting
                    the sale contract. I note that Lonstroff disputes that the IRAC terms applied to
                    the first order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Mohamed further submitted that this
                    approach was supported by <em>International Research Corp PLC v
                        Lufthansa Systems Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014] 1 SLR
                    130 (“<em>International Research Corp</em>”),
                    which held that a valid arbitration agreement can be constituted by reference
                    where a document containing an arbitration agreement is referred to in a
                    contract and the reference is such as to make the arbitration agreement part of
                    the contract. Whether this was satisfactorily incorporated was a matter of
                    contractual interpretation and the court must have regard to the context and the
                    objective circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract. For the
                    purpose of the discussion that follows, I am taking R1 International’s
                    case at its highest and assuming that the IRAC terms were incorporated into the
                    first order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Relying on <em>Ajwa for Food Industries Co (MIGOP), Egypt v Pacific
                        Inter-Link Sdn Bhd</em> [2013] 5 MLJ 625 (“<em>Ajwa Food Industries</em>”), which held that an arbitration
                    agreement need not be signed and was incorporated by the parties’ previous
                    course of dealing, Mr Mohamed argued that since the parties had entered into a
                    prior order and in that order the IRAC clause was incorporated, it must have
                    been aware that the second order contained the same clause with a nomination for
                    the arbitration to be conducted in Singapore. In this manner, the SICOM
                    arbitration agreement was incorporated by the parties’ previous course of
                    dealing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Lobo did not dispute the holding in
                        <em>International Research Corp</em> but submitted
                    that, on a contextual interpretation, the SICOM arbitration agreement was never
                    incorporated into the second order since the matter was never discussed by the
                    parties, the IRAC was never referred to or provided to Lonstroff, and the
                    pre-signed contract had been sent only after delivery of the order had been
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Alternatively, the arbitration agreement in
                    the first contract could not be accepted as having been incorporated by previous
                    course of dealing since the relationship between the parties was not long
                    enough. Two orders were insufficient to establish the continuity of acts
                    required to prove incorporation by previous course of dealing: <em>Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd v Wadkin Robinson Asia Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 424 at [22]. In his further written
                    submissions, Mr Lobo distinguished <em>Ajwa Food
                        Industries</em> on the basis that the parties in that case had a
                    course of dealing which stretched over a period of twenty years and had
                    previously referred their trade disputes to arbitration. This was despite their
                    not having signed the arbitration agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I accept Mr Lobo’s argument: one prior
                    transaction between these parties was, in my view, insufficient to found a
                    course of dealing between them. There was no continuity in the transactions as
                    the facts themselves show. Whilst in the first transaction, R1 International was
                    content to rely on the standard IRAC terms, in the second order it wanted to
                    modify those by adding the SICOM arbitration agreement. That change in the terms
                    showed that there was, at the time of the second order, no settled course of
                    dealing between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Even if there was indeed a previous course of
                    dealing between the parties, I find that the SICOM clause could not have been
                    incorporated by reference. In <em>United Eng Contractors Pte Ltd
                        v L &amp; M Concrete Specialists Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 524, G P
                    Selvam J held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general rule is that he is not bound by the terms of offer if he
                        merely remains silent even if the offer provides that silence will be deemed
                        to be acceptance. More so if the terms are contained in a document which he
                        is required to sign to signify his intention to accept. <b>It is even more so, if the parties have already been acting on an oral
                            contract and one party unilaterally tries to impose onerous terms after
                            the original oral contract has been acted upon.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="right">[Emphasis added in bold]</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Here, I hold that the SICOM arbitration
                    agreement was not and could not have been incorporated by reference into the
                    second order. The sales contract dated 16 August 2012 was sent to Lonstroff only
                    on 31 August 2012 while the order had been delivered on 27 August 2012. The
                    SICOM arbitration agreement was not incorporated since the contract had been
                    concluded and performed between both parties before Lonstroff was notified of
                    the SICOM arbitration agreement. There was also no discussion pertaining to the
                    incorporation of the SICOM arbitration agreement during negotiations between the
                    parties. Hence, the SICOM arbitration agreement was not incorporated by
                    reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Since the SICOM arbitration agreement has not
                    been incorporated into the second order, I find that there is no basis to grant
                    a permanent anti-suit injunction or sustain the interim anti-suit
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether this court can grant a permanent anti-suit injunctions
                supporting international arbitration under s 12A(2) read with s 12(1)(i) of the
                International Arbitration Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In light of my holding above, there is
                    strictly no need to consider the court’s power to grant a permanent
                    anti-suit injunction in aid of an international arbitration. However, since both
                    parties dealt with this point extensively in their submissions and since it is a
                    point that may have significance in future cases, I give my views on it
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Mohamed submitted that this court had the
                    power to grant permanent injunctions in support of international arbitration. In
                    its "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
                    (“UNCITRAL”) on the work of its Thirty-third Session" at
                    para 15, UN Doc A/CN.9/WG.II/WP.111 (“the UNCITRAL Report”),
                    UNCITRAL reported as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Availability of provisional and
                            protective measures (Principle 3)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15. It is desirable that the measures be available to both foreigners and
                        citizens alike and in respect of arbitrations held in both the country of
                        the court issuing the measure and in a foreign country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     He contended that s 12A(1)(b) of the IAA gives
                    effect to this principle, noting that in <em>WSG Nimbus Pte Ltd v
                        Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1088
                        (“<em>WSG Nimbus</em>”), Lee Seiu Kin JC
                    (as he then was) had sustained an interim anti-suit injunction in aid of
                    domestic international arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr Mohamed also cited <em>Maldives Airports Co Ltd and another v GMR Male International Airport Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 449 (“<em>Maldives
                        Airports</em>”), which held that s 12A(2) and (4) read with s
                    12(1)(c) to (i) did not confine the court to just granting <em>Anton Piller</em> orders or <em>Mareva</em>
                    injunctions; as long as it is necessary for the preservation of evidence or
                    assets, the court has the power to grant injunctions, including permanent
                    anti-suit injunctions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Whilst I accept Mr Mohamed’s general
                    proposition on the court’s ability to grant such injunctions, with due
                    respect, I do not agree that this power to grant permanent anti-suit injunctions
                    to assist arbitration can be derived from s 12A of the IAA. Principle 3 found in
                    paragraph 15 of the UNCITRAL Report concerned provisional and protective
                    measures in respect of both domestic and foreign international arbitrations.
                    This was discussed in the context of disputes with an international element and
                    the possibility of developing uniform rules for the provision of interim
                    measures: see UNCITRAL Report at para 7. I agree with Mr Mohamed that this
                    principle has been accepted here to the extent that s 12A(2) read with s
                    12(1)(i) of the IAA provides for interim injunctions in aid of both domestic and
                    foreign international arbitration. However, I do not think that the s 12(1)(i)
                    of the IAA extends to permanent anti-suit injunctions. This is essentially a
                    question of statutory interpretation and interplay between the court’s
                    injunctive power under s 12A read with s 12 of the IAA and its general
                    injunctive power under s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (“CLA”) and paragraph 14 to the First Schedule of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The relevant portions of s 12A and s 12 of the
                    IAA read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            action or a matter in the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The High Court or a Judge thereof may refuse to
                            make an order under subsection (2) if, in the opinion of
                            the High Court or Judge, the fact that the place of arbitration is
                            outside Singapore or likely to be outside Singapore when it is
                            designated or determined makes it inappropriate to make such
                            order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>12.</b> —(1) Without prejudice to the
                        powers set out in any other provision of this Act and in the Model Law, an
                        arbitral tribunal shall have powers to make orders or give directions to any
                        party for —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>i</em>)    an interim
                            injunction or any other interim measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     From the above it can be seen that as far as
                    the power that s 12(l) grants the courts in respect of injunctive relief, this
                    is a power to be exercised on an interim basis only. This makes eminent sense as
                    the interim injunction is to be given in aid of the arbitration proceedings
                    which will make the findings and give the orders that permanently resolve the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This does not mean, however, that the court
                    has no power to grant a permanent anti-suit injunction in relation to
                    arbitration proceedings, only that the source of that power is not the IAA. As
                    stated above, the court’s general injunctive power emanates from s 4(10)
                    of the CLA. This is the power that the court exercises when it grants a
                    permanent anti-suit injunction in aid of local court proceedings. There is no
                    reason why this power cannot be exercised to make permanent anti-suit
                    injunctions in aid of domestic international arbitration proceedings especially
                    since under s 12A(2) read with s 12(1)(i) of the IAA and the holding in
                        <em>Maldives Airports</em>, the courts can grant
                    interim anti-suit injunctions in such situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     An argument was made in the United Kingdom
                    (“UK”) that the power to grant interim injunctions in aid of
                    arbitration proceedings conferred on the courts by the Arbitration Act 1996 (c
                    23) (UK) (“the Arbitration Act 1996”) limited or excluded or
                    qualified the court’s general jurisdiction to order injunctive relief in
                    cases relating to arbitration that had hitherto been exercised under s 37 of the
                    Senior Courts Act 1981 (c 54) (UK) (“ the Senior Courts Act
                    1981”). This argument was roundly rejected: see <em>AES
                        Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydropower Plant LLP v Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydropower Plant
                        JSC</em> [2013] 1 WLR 1889 (“<em>AES
                        Ust-Kamenogorsk</em>”) at [57]. Instead, the UK Supreme Court
                    held that clear words would be needed to abrogate the court’s general
                    jurisdiction to grant anti-suit injunctions. The language of s 4(10) of the CLA
                    is very similar to that of s 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and I am happy to
                    adopt the holding in <em>AES Ust-Kamenogorsk</em> and hold
                    that there is no clear language in the IAA which would cut down the breadth and
                    scope of the court’s powers under s 4(10) of the CLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The facts of <em>AES
                        Ust-Kamenogorsk</em> are interesting. It involved an owner of
                    hydroelectric facilities in Kazakhstan which entered into a concession agreement
                    with the operator of the facilities. The agreement was governed by Kazakh law
                    but provided for London arbitration under English law. Disputes having arisen
                    subsequently, the owner started court proceedings in Kazakhstan in breach of the
                    arbitration agreement. The operator contested those proceedings. However, the
                    Kazakhstan Supreme Court held that the arbitration clause was contrary to Kazakh
                    public policy and thus invalid. The owner then started proceedings in the
                    Kazakhstan Economic Court, which assumed jurisdiction over the matter. The
                    operator was forced to defend the merits of the claim while denying the Kazakh
                    court’s jurisdiction – if it did not, it would not be able to appeal
                    the Kazakhstan Supreme Court’s decision on jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The operator then sought an interim anti-suit
                    injunction from the English against Kazakh proceedings started in breach of the
                    arbitration clause by the owner, even though English arbitration proceedings had
                    not commenced and it had no settled intention yet to commence arbitration. The
                    judge at first instance granted a final order, which declared that certain
                    claims could only be pursued in arbitration and their pursuit in other forums
                    must be restrained. The owner’s appeal to the English Court of Appeal was
                    dismissed and the question before the UK Supreme Court was whether an anti-suit
                    injunction under s 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 but not under s 44 of the
                    Arbitration Act 1996 could be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The UK Supreme Court held that since the
                    Arbitration Act 1996 did not apply where proceedings are not starting and have
                    not started, any injunction granted must be under s 37 of the Senior Courts Act
                    1981. There was nothing in the Arbitration Act 1996 which abrogated the
                    court’s general injunctive power and the jurisprudence on anti-suit
                    injunctions was not to be undermined. It observed that it would be astonishing
                    if Parliament should without warning have abrogated or precluded the use by the
                    English Court of its well-established jurisdiction under s 37 in respect of
                    foreign proceedings threatened in breach of the negative aspect of an
                    arbitration agreement (by which it meant the negative obligation imposed on a
                    party to an arbitration agreement not to commence proceedings in any other
                    forum): see <em>AES Ust</em>-<em>Kamenogorsk</em> at [57]. Therefore, the owner’s appeal was
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">When would it be appropriate to grant a permanent anti-suit
                injunction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The established principles concerning the
                    grant of permanent anti-suit injunctions can be found in <em>Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</em> [1987]
                    AC 879. These principles were adopted by <em>Maldives
                        Airports</em> in relation to arbitration proceedings. There, the court
                    affirmed its jurisdiction and ability to protect the parties’ contractual
                    rights to have disputes resolved by arbitration in a contractually chosen
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     This is recognised as part of Singapore law:
                        <em>Halsbury Law of Singapore</em> vol 6(2)
                    (LexisNexis, 2013) at para 75.133.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The position is clear for arbitration
                    agreements providing for international arbitrations in Singapore – where
                    there is such a clause, the innocent party can seek a permanent anti-suit
                    injunction under the court’s general power to grant an
                injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Singapore should grant a permanent anti-suit injunction where
                the arbitration agreement is for a foreign international arbitration </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the course of proceedings, a question arose
                    as to whether it would be appropriate to grant a permanent anti-suit injunction
                    if I found that an arbitration agreement calling for arbitration in London had
                    been incorporated into the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I think this point can be dealt with shortly.
                    The court now has the power under s 12A(2) read with s 12 of the IAA to grant
                    interim injunctions, even in aid of foreign international arbitration
                    proceedings. This was not the case under the former s 12(6) of the IAA, which
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    The High Court or a Judge thereof shall have, for
                            the purpose of and in relation to an arbitration to which this Part
                            applies, the same power of making orders in respect of any of the
                            matters set out in subsection (1) as it has for the purpose of and in
                            relation to an action or matter in the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     To enable the courts to assist foreign
                    international arbitration, s 12A was then enacted to replace s 12(6) of the IAA.
                    It empowers the courts to issue interim injunctions in aid of foreign
                    international arbitration and brings the IAA in line with legislation in other
                    countries, such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand: see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official
                        Report</em> (19 October 2009) vol 86 at cols 1633-1634. The present
                    position is that s 12A(2) read with s 12(1)(i) of the IAA grants to the court
                    jurisdiction to issue an interim anti-suit injunction in aid of foreign
                    international arbitration: <em>Maldives Airports</em> at
                    [34].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I have opined above that the courts have
                    jurisdiction under s 4(10) of the CLA to grant permanent anti-suit injunctions
                    in aid of domestic international arbitrations. It would be logical and
                    consistent with the court’s power under s 12A(2) read with s 12(1)(i) to
                    issue interim anti-suit injunctions in aid of foreign international arbitrations
                    to hold that the court has power under the more wide-ranging law in s 4(10) of
                    the CLA to issue permanent anti-suit injunctions in such cases. Logic alone,
                    however, may not be a sufficient basis to extend the court’s powers beyond
                    what is in the IAA to parties who have agreed to arbitrate abroad especially
                    since the interim orders made should be sufficient to put matters on the right
                    track. Any such extension of power would have the potential to affect more
                    situations than simply those concerned with arbitration and therefore policy
                    considerations would come into play. Since this point was not fully argued and,
                    in the event, it is not necessary to decide it, I do not express a concluded
                    opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On this note, I also agree with Choo Han Teck
                    J’s warning in <em>People’s Insurance Co Ltd v Akai
                        Pty Ltd</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 291 at [12] that Singapore should not be
                    an international busybody; it is only when strong reasons are present that the
                    courts would intervene with a permanent anti-suit injunction to support foreign
                    international arbitration. One possible situation might be where the forum in
                    which the arbitration is to take place does not provide for effective interim
                    measures in support of arbitration: see UNCITRAL Report at para 7. Since I do
                    not have to decide this issue, I shall say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the premises, I allow the appeal by
                    Lonstroff and discharge the interim anti-suit injunction. I also dismiss R1
                    International’s application for a permanent anti-suit injunction. Costs
                    will follow the event and I will hear the parties in order to fix the amount of
                    the same.</p>
