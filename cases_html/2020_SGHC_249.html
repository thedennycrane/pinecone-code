That was the plaintiff’s case under the Amended SOC, after it had abandoned its original position that the contract included Appendix 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I found that the plaintiff did not have a good arguable case that it had <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ny </span>contract with the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It was not contemplated that a contract would be concluded by an exchange of correspondence on the 10 April Quote</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Ms Fonzar considered that a contract might be formed in one of two ways: in the form of a draft contract from the plaintiff, or under a PO (see [15] above). She thus asked Mr Hopkins if he had a draft contract; in response, he provided Appendix 6 as that draft (see [16] above). On her part, Ms Fonzar sent Mr Hopkins the PO General T&amp;C (see [17]–[18] above). The plaintiff’s case was that although the discussions up to the 17 April E-mail only referred to two possible ways of forming a contract, Ms Fonzar had chosen a third method instead: she had formed a contract by an exchange of correspondence – namely, by accepting the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote by way of the 17 April E-mail. But that is an unlikely conclusion to draw.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Put another way, both Mr Hopkins and Ms Fonzar contemplated that any contract would not simply be on the terms of the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote: for this reason, Mr Hopkins had provided the draft Appendix 6 as a draft contract, while Ms Fonzar had provided the PO General T&amp;C. The plaintiff’s case was that neither set of terms was eventually used, whereas the defendant’s case was that SES had contracted with the plaintiff on SES’ POs and the PO General T&amp;C. The plaintiff did not have the “better of the argument” on this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The contents of the 17 April E-mail did not support the plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The 17 April E-mail itself (see [21] above) stood against rather than for the plaintiff’s case. In the e-mail, Ms Fonzar first informed Mr Hopkins that she was “working on the PO issuance today to [the plaintiff]”. This suggested that Ms Fonzar was proceeding with the PO method of forming a contract, which would in turn imply that she had not contemplated that her 17 April E-mail alone would suffice for the formation of a contract with the plaintiff. Further, Ms Fonzar stated that she had to get many approvals in her internal process – that pointed to her not being in a position there and then to award a contract to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The plaintiff relied on the following sentence in the 17 April E-mail: “Just for formality, I am confirming that the working is being awarded to Tecnomar.” That sentence, however, cannot be read in isolation – it must be read in the context of the whole e-mail, and especially what Ms Fonzar had just said about working on the PO issuance and having to get many internal approvals. But even if that sentence were read in isolation, the phrase “is being awarded” would appear to refer to a process that was underway, rather than concluded; Ms Fonzar did not say that a contract “is awarded”, “was awarded”  or “had been awarded”, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. Moreover, Ms Fonzar expressed that she was <span class="font-italic">still</span> in the process of “confirming” that the contract was being awarded to Tecnomar. The plain meaning of the sentence that the plaintiff relied on was clear – the contract had yet to be awarded to Tecnomar and Ms Fonzar had yet to obtain confirmation of the same – and did not assist the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Reading the 17 April E-mail in its entirety, and noting Ms Fonzar’s reference to needing many internal approvals, the picture which emerged was that she did not form any contract with the plaintiff by the 17 April E-mail. The plaintiff’s case was extreme: even if Ms Fonzar failed to get the internal approvals which she said she needed, she had nevertheless awarded a contract to the plaintiff by the 17 April E-mail. That would have either brought the party she represented into contractual relations with the plaintiff or exposed her to a claim for acting without authority. This argument and its consequences flew in the face of Ms Fonzar telling the plaintiff (in the same 17 April E-mail) that she still needed many internal approvals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It was also curious that the plaintiff’s case was that Ms Fonzar had accepted the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote by the 17 April E-mail, but before me, the plaintiff did not contend that she had also accepted Appendix 6, which Ms Fonzar had in draft form by 17 April 2018. Appendix 6 contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration according to the SCMA Rules, and indeed, the plaintiff had commenced arbitration against both the defendant and SES pursuant thereto. Thus, when the defendant applied to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order and service in this action, it included an alternative prayer for a stay of proceedings under s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed). But the plaintiff abandoned the arbitration, the defendant withdrew the prayer for a stay, and the plaintiff amended its SOC to delete the reference to Appendix 6 that was originally in paragraph 9.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 With the plaintiff having already put forward its proposed terms and conditions in the form of draft Appendix 6, was there still an offer on the terms of its 10 April Quote alone? And if (as the plaintiff seemed to accept before me) Ms Fonzar did not accept Appendix 6 by the 17 April E-mail, did she even accept the 10 April Quote by the same e-mail? As of 17 April 2018 when Ms Fonzar sent the 17 April E-mail, what the plaintiff had proposed was its 10 April Quote <span class="font-italic">and</span> the draft Appendix 6. The plaintiff cherry-picked the former and left out the latter, but it was questionable whether <span class="font-italic">any</span> contract had been formed by the 17 April E-mail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 17 April E-mail was not Ms Fonzar’s last e-mail of the day</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 After sending the 17 April E-mail, Ms Fonzar corresponded further with Mr Hopkins that day. Ms Fonzar sent an e-mail commenting on the plaintiff’s proposed terms in the draft Appendix 6 (see [24] above). This was inconsistent with her already having formed a contract by accepting the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote. Mr Hopkins did not however respond to say that there was already a contract in place. Nor did Mr Hopkins provide such a response when he received the first PO from SES the next day, under cover of Ms Lee’s e-mail (see [27]–[30] above). One would have expected him to clarify that there was a contract <span class="font-italic">with the defendant</span> on the terms of the <span class="font-italic">10 April Quote</span>, when presented with a PO <span class="font-italic">from SES</span> with the <span class="font-italic">PO General T&amp;C</span>. Instead, Mr Hopkins proceeded to acknowledge the POs; the plaintiff invoiced SES thereafter and was paid by SES (see [31]–[36] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Later the same day, Ms Fonzar sent Mr Hopkins the vessel certificates, including the Certificate of Registry which showed that the owner of the Vessel was SES (see [25] above). If Mr Hopkins thought the plaintiff had by then contracted with the defendant, it was curious that he raised no issue about SES’ being the owner of the Vessel. He would however later express concerns about SES’ sale of the Vessel, and specifically about the impact of the sale on the plaintiff’s security for payment for its work (see [41]–[43] above). Yet throughout the correspondence with Ms Fonzar, Mr Hopkins unquestioningly accepted that the Vessel had been sold <span class="font-italic">by SES</span>

</div> – a fact that must surely have troubled him had he genuinely believed that the plaintiff had contracted with the defendant rather than with SES.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff argued that Ms Fonzar had concluded a contract with the plaintiff by the 17 April E-mail because she was concerned that the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote was only valid for seven days, and so if she did not accept it by 17 April 2018, she might be left with no contract with anyone. That is however not the impression one gets from reading the correspondence. In particular, Ms Fonzar said in the 17 April E-mail itself: “I am working on the PO issuance <span class="font-italic">today</span> to Tecnomar … I will try to expedite the process and have it delivered to you <span class="font-italic">latest tomorrow</span>.” [emphasis added]. From that, it sounded like Ms Fonzar thought “PO issuance today”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 17 April 2018, was still possible, or at least “latest tomorrow”. If Ms Fonzar were concerned about the expiry of the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote, one would have expected her to ask Mr Hopkins if he could extend its validity by one day, if need be. Ms Fonzar had in her earlier e-mail of 12 April 2018

Moreover, the 17 April E-mail was sent at 12.56pm, and Ms Fonzar went on to send two further e-mails later the same day, as I noted above. If Ms Fonzar were concerned about the 10 April Quote expiring, she could have waited till later in the day to see if she could get the necessary approvals and have a PO issued, before taking the drastic step of purportedly concluding a contract which she admittedly had no approval for.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">From 18 April 2018 onwards, the plaintiff dealt with SES</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The POs, invoices and payments all involved SES rather than the defendant (see [27]–[28], [30], [33]–[35] and [61] above).

The plaintiff understood all of this full well – nowhere was this made clearer than in Mr Hopkins’ e-mail of 31 July 2018 to Ms Fonzar, in which he stated that “our formal arrangements are with your good selves, (SES/SBM)” and that “we are in a position to only receive instructions from <span class="font-italic">yourself/SES </span>at this time”

The basis of including the defendant as a respondent was unclear: if Appendix 6 applied, the parties would be SES as Owner and the plaintiff as Contractor. The defendant would not be a party to the contract, nor would it be a party to the arbitration agreement. Further, paragraph 8 of the Notice of Arbitration stated that invoices were issued by the plaintiff to SES “through the 1st Respondent”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant, but that was factually wrong. The invoices were not issued to SES through the defendant; they were issued to SES through another company in the SBM Offshore group, SBM Holding Inc. SA (in accordance with the POs) – see [28] and [33]–[35] above. Similarly, paragraph 12 of the Notice of Arbitration referred to the Soft Proposal as “an amended quotation dated 18 July 2018”, and stated that it was issued to the defendant, but the documents showed that the Soft Proposal was addressed to SES – see [40] above. The impression one gets is that the plaintiff knew that it had contracted with SES, but nevertheless wanted to bring in the defendant somehow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendant’s position was clearly stated in the defendant’s Denial of 11 June 2019 – see [45] above.

This did not make sense to me. If the plaintiff were already contractually bound to do the work <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the defendant, it would add nothing for SES to then make another contract with the plaintiff (at least to the extent of the same work) with different terms and conditions. Nothing in the contemporaneous documents indicated that the plaintiff considered it had two contracts, with different parties, on different terms. Even the Notice of Arbitration did not bear this out. It referred to a single “agreement” having been reached on 17 April 2018 (before the SES POs were issued from 18 April 2018 onwards).

</div> This was an affidavit filed by Mr Chapman for the defendant’s application to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order for leave to serve process out of jurisdiction, and the consequent service of process. In his first affidavit, Mr Chapman had stated the defendant’s position that “the contract for the Plaintiff’s services was (i) not based on the Plaintiff’s 10 April Quote and (ii) was not with the Defendant, but was with SES”.

</div> In paragraphs 7–23, he said that the plaintiff had contracted with SES, which was the Vessel’s owner; in paragraphs 29–31, he said that the POs from SES had not been issued pursuant to the alleged contract on the basis of the 10 April Quote; he addressed the Handover Letter in paragraphs 32–34; he addressed the plaintiff’s Soft Proposal to SES in paragraphs 35–44; he addressed SES’ sale of the Vessel in paragraphs 45–47; and finally, he concluded at paragraph 48:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mr Hopkins’ affidavit dated 10 October 2019 </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> (which was filed in support of the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for leave to serve process out of jurisdiction) had just nine pages of text, 70 pages including exhibits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Mr Hopkins asserted that there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, formed through an exchange of correspondence: specifically that the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote had been accepted by 17 April E-mail. He referred to paragraphs 3–22 of the SOC for particulars of the contract, and said that a copy of the contract was exhibited at pages 46–69 of his exhibit, and that the defendant’s acceptance of the contract was exhibited at page 70 (the 17 April E-mail).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The supposed “contract” exhibited comprised the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote running into 15 pages (pages 46–60 of the affidavit), together with Appendix 6 which was still titled “Appendix 6 (Draft)” (pages 61–69 of the affidavit).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The other documents exhibited in the affidavit were: extracts from the defendant’s annual report (pages 11–28), the writ and the SOC (pages 29–45).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Although the plaintiff’s case was that the contract had been formed through an exchange of correspondence, the only correspondence that was exhibited was the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote and the 17 April E-mail. The other correspondence was not exhibited – not Ms Lee’s 30 March 2018 e-mail with the RFQ, not the plaintiff’s original 6 April Quote, not Mr Hopkins’ covering e-mail of 10 April 2018 to which the 10 April Quote was attached, not the correspondence leading up to the 17 April E-mail, not the correspondence after the 17 April E-mail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 This gave the court an incomplete and misleading picture. Thus, the 17 April E-mail started with Ms Fonzar saying “[t]hank you for the reply” – but what “reply” from Mr Hopkins was she referring to? The only prior correspondence exhibited in Mr Hopkins’ first affidavit was the 10 April Quote. If the court had the full correspondence, it would have seen that Ms Fonzar was <span class="font-italic">not</span> replying to the 10 April Quote in her 17 April E-mail; rather, she was replying to Mr Hopkins’ 16 April 2018 e-mail that provided answers to certain questions she had raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Indeed, several e-mails were exchanged between the 10 April Quote and the 17 April E-mail. Significantly, those included Mr Hopkins’ e-mail of 12 April 2018 attaching the draft Appendix 6.

</div> It would have been apparent from that, that the 10 April Quote did not include the draft Appendix 6 that was provided only <span class="font-italic">two days later</span>. On the plaintiff’s own case that the contract was formed by the 17 April E-mail accepting the 10 April Quote, the contract would not have included the draft Appendix 6.

The defendant’s position was that it was SES that had contracted with the plaintiff; moreover, the contract was not on the terms of the plaintiff’s 10 April 2018 quote, but on the terms of SES’ POs (see [45] and [78] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the non-disclosure material?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Zoom</span>”) at [68]: “The test of materiality, which is an objective test, is whether the facts in question are matters that the court would likely take into consideration in making its decision …” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> ([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>),<span class="font-italic"> </span>which concerned an application for service out of jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal put it thus (at [106]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the question ultimately is whether the facts which are disclosed are (<span class="font-italic">The Vasiliy Golovnin</span> at [91]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘… sufficient for [the] purpose of making an informed and fair decision on the outcome of the application, such that the threshold of full and frank disclosure can be meaningfully said to be crossed.’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In relation to the draft Appendix 6, the non-disclosure (and indeed misrepresentation) was obviously material: the court was told that the contract included Appendix 6, which was exhibited to the supporting affidavit for the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application, but it turned out that the draft Appendix 6 had never been agreed to and did not form part of the contract. The misrepresentation and non-disclosure led the court to grant leave on the premise of a contract that included Appendix 6, a premise which was now discernibly wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 All the other categories of information and documents I have listed (at [107] above) are likewise material: they would likely have been taken into consideration by the court, and without them the court could not have made an informed and fair decision on the outcome of the application. I took them into account in evaluating whether the plaintiff had a good arguable case (see [49]–[92] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I considered the non-disclosure of the defendant’s Denial to be particularly troubling. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Vasiliy Golovnin</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 had stated at [87]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he duty imposed on the applicant requires him to ask what might be relevant to the court in its assessment of whether or not the remedy should be granted, and not what the applicant alone might think is relevant.

It extends to all material facts that could be reasonably ascertained and defences that might be reasonably raised by the defendant. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Here, the defendant’s position – that SES was the contracting party with the plaintiff – was not just a defence that “might reasonably be raised”; it <span class="font-italic">had been raised</span> by the defendant when the plaintiff commenced arbitration. The plaintiff knew about the defendant’s Denial, yet did not inform the court of it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Whether or not the plaintiff thought there might be two contracts, one with the defendant and one with SES (as it sought to argue – see [79] above), the plaintiff knew that the defendant’s position was that there was only one contract, and that the contract was not with the defendant, but with SES. The plaintiff ought to have informed the court of that, but it did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Besides material <span class="font-italic">non-di</span><span class="font-italic">sclosure</span>, various facts were <span class="font-italic">misrepresented </span>to the court in the SOC, which Mr Hopkins’ first affidavit referred to and exhibited:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  Paragraph 21 of the SOC said that several amendments were made to the contract (between the plaintiff and the defendant) to provide for works to be conducted by the plaintiff; but everything that was done in that regard, was done by POs from SES.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Paragraph 22 of the SOC said that, as provided for under clause 12 (of the plaintiff’s 10 April Quote), the plaintiff forwarded to the defendant, by an e-mail dated 18 July 2018, an amendment to the contract in the form of the Soft Proposal. In fact, the Soft Proposal was addressed to SES.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Paragraphs 25–26 of the SOC said that the Vessel was sold by and removed from the yard by the defendant. In fact, SES owned the Vessel, SES sold the Vessel, and it was because of SES’ sale of the Vessel that the Vessel was removed from the yard – and the correspondence showed that the plaintiff knew this full well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 All these facts related to the core issue of whether the defendant or SES had contracted with the plaintiff, and like the non-disclosures identified above, were material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Other than in relation to Appendix 6, there was no attempted explanation of the litany of material non-disclosures and misrepresentations. Indeed, at first instance, the plaintiff disputed whether there had been <span class="font-italic">any</span> material non-disclosure. The AR’s notes recorded counsel for the plaintiff saying, “If Your Honour takes the position that this (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant’s Denial) should have been disclosed, humbly apologise and say that this was inadvertent error.”

</div>
</div> In saying that, the plaintiff did not concede that there was material non-disclosure: it merely said that <span class="font-italic">if</span> <span class="font-italic">the court were to find</span> there was material non-disclosure, then it would apologise and chalk it up as an inadvertent error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The AR’s conclusion (at [81] of her oral judgment) was: “The statement of claim and the Plaintiff’s Order 11 application were completely silent on SES. Given the role of SES in the parties’ dealings and the position that the Defendant has taken which was made clear to the Plaintiff in the context of the arbitration proceedings, I question whether it is even possible for the Plaintiff to have innocently omitted all mention of SES.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I would put it even more strongly: my conclusion was that the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">deliberately</span> omitted all mention of SES (including the defendant having denied being the contracting party and pointing to SES instead). What was more, the plaintiff had replaced SES with the defendant, in its narrative of the additional works commissioned to deal with the mercury within the Vessel, the Soft Proposal, and the sale and removal of the Vessel (see [115] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Unlike the arbitration, where the plaintiff had proceeded against both the defendant and SES, and had referred to SES’ POs, the invoices to SES and payments from SES, in this action the plaintiff tried to make SES disappear. In the SOC, the Amended SOC, the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application, and Mr Hopkins’ first affidavit, the only trace of SES was that it was innocuously listed in a long list of subsidiaries of the defendant.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff gave the court no clue as to how significant SES was to the correspondence, documents and events in this matter – all of which were hidden from the court’s sight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Had the plaintiff been full and frank with the court, the court may well not have granted the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order. Instead, the plaintiff gave the court the misleading impression that it had a neat and tidy case of a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, for which the court should grant leave to serve out of jurisdiction. But the real picture was not so flattering to the plaintiff – indeed, not flattering at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Towards the end of the hearing before me, counsel for the plaintiff articulated the gravamen of the complaint as being non-disclosure of SES’ role, the POs and the defendant’s Denial. That did not capture the full extent and flavour of what the plaintiff had done here. But at least counsel finally acknowledged that <span class="font-italic">there had been </span><span class="font-italic">non-disclosure</span>. He asked that the court nevertheless exercise its discretion to let the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order and the service stand, a discretion recognised in <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> ([108] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [92(c)])<span class="font-italic"> </span>and other cases. He acknowledged though that <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> was not authority for the proposition that if a plaintiff had made out a good arguable case, non-disclosure on its part did not matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the material non-disclosure warrant setting aside?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 If there has been material non-disclosure, the court may set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order; but the court has a discretion to continue the order or to make a new order (see <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah)</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 786 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee</span>”) at [25], [33] and [35]). How that discretion is exercised “depends on the nature of the non-disclosure and the circumstances of the case” (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee</span> at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span>, the Court of Appeal decided not to set aside an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order notwithstanding that there had been material non-disclosure, as it considered that what was undisclosed was not so material in all the circumstances as to warrant setting aside (at [69] of the judgment). In that regard, I found in the present case that what was undisclosed, and what was misrepresented, was <span class="font-italic">highly</span> material – indeed, it went to the heart of the issue of who had contracted with the plaintiff: the defendant or SES?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Another consideration is whether the non-disclosure (or misrepresentation) was innocent or deliberate. Even if non-disclosure were innocent, setting aside may be warranted (see <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee</span> at [25] and [27]). But if the non-disclosure were <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span>, it “must be a special case for the court to exercise its discretion not to discharge the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> [order]” (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee</span> at [35]). In that case, the Court of Appeal agreed with the first instance judge that there had been deliberate suppression and that the non-disclosures could not be viewed as minor (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee</span> at [31] and [35]); the Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision setting aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order and declining to grant a fresh order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the present case, the undisclosed information and documents were highly material; there was not just non-disclosure but also misrepresentation; and all of this was deliberate – the plaintiff went from claiming against both the defendant and SES in arbitration, to scrupulously avoiding any mention of SES in this action against the defendant alone. In the circumstances of this case, setting aside was warranted.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I agreed with the AR that the plaintiff did not have a good arguable case for service of process out of jurisdiction, and that there had been material non-disclosure which warranted setting aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order and the consequent service of process. I thus upheld the AR’s decision, with costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Peter Gabriel, Nandwani Manoj Prakash, Henry Li-Zheng Setiono and Selina Naidu (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kenneth Tan SC (Kenneth Tan Partnership) (instructed), Loh Wai Yue, Alankriti Sethi and Chan Zijian Boaz (Incisive Law LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
