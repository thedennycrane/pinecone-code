However, the Company was the entity that performed the necessary work in furtherance of the Yamal Supply Subcontract for the supply of the insulation materials as well as the subcontract for the installation of these insulation materials. The Defendant paid the Company several sums totalling S$1,931,291.95.

The Defendant, on the other hand, alleges that no such arrangement existed and that any profit entitlement payable to the Company would always be documented.

</div> The Plaintiff also relies on several email exchanges between the Plaintiff and various representatives of the Kaefer Group to support his case that the Defendant had agreed to retain the Disputed Sum as a loan. It is undisputed that the Disputed Sum was used to pay off some of the liabilities of the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 All of this, in the Plaintiff’s view, explained why he allowed the Defendant to retain the Disputed Sum.

However, the Defendant denies that the Company was entitled to the entire profit from the Insulation Supply Subcontract. The Defendant also denies the existence of the Loan Arrangement. The Defendant’s main defence is that the Management Agreements formed the contractual entitlement of the profit paid out of the Insulation Supply Subcontract and allocated it between the Company and the Defendant. Since the Management Agreements do not include the Disputed Sum, the Defendant states that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the Disputed Sum.

Be that as it may, I shall consider them in turn below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As regards the Plaintiff’s reliance on the Payment Arrangement outlined at [18] above, the Defendant’s case is that the Payment Arrangement does not exist. Instead, any profit allocation to the Company would be discussed between representatives of the Company and the respective Kaefer entity. The negotiations would be reduced to written agreements, and any payments made, whether to the Company or to the Plaintiff, would be documented accordingly.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The overarching issue is whether the Company was entitled to the entire profit arising from the Insulation Supply Subcontract, including the Disputed Sum. The determination of this issue is largely a fact-finding exercise. The Court has to decide whether to believe:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff’s account that the Company was entitled to the entire profit paid out of the Insulation Supply Subcontract under the Yamal Project, including the Disputed Sum, and that the Company had allowed the Defendant to use the Disputed Sum to pay the Defendant’s liabilities under the Loan Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The Defendant’s account that the Company was not entitled to the Disputed Sum as the Company’s proportion of the profit entitlements was documented under the Management Agreements.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27  Hence, the Court has to determine whether: (a) the Company’s profit entitlement in respect of the work done for the Insulation Supply Subcontract was governed by the Management Agreements, and that these documents are conclusive proof of the Company’s share of its profit; or (b) the Company would be entitled to the entire profit paid out of the projects for which it had undertaken work, regardless of the Management Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 At the outset, I note that it would have been desirable and would have greatly assisted the Court if Justin and Kevin had been called to testify given their crucial role in the Yamal Project. Before the trial started, it appeared that both parties intended to call them to testify. At trial, however, both parties failed to call them as witnesses. Thus, I am mindful that much of the parties’ accounts regarding Justin and Kevin must be treated cautiously as they fall within the realm of hearsay evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Plaintiff had rightfully informed the Court on the first day of the trial that the Plaintiff would not be making an application under s 32 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) to admit Kevin’s AEIC.

</div> Thus, the Court does not have the benefit of Kevin’s and Justin’s first-hand account of the details of the Loan Arrangement and other relevant events pertaining to this case. Be that as it may, the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove his case on a balance of probabilities. In order to resolve this factual dispute, it is important that the Court considers the internal business arrangements between the Company and the Defendant, particularly, the business arrangements within the Kaefer Group and between the Kaefer Group and the Company. The Court has to ascertain whether the parties conducted their business arrangements formally, with a system of documentation and proper written records put in place even in respect of internal transactions or arrangements. Alternatively, were the parties transacting with a certain degree of informality, such that transactions and arrangements were recorded verbally with minimal or no documentation put in place as they were closely related entities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 With the above factual issues in mind, I now turn to set out my analysis of the Plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Plaintiff’s primary case is premised on both the Payment Arrangement and the Loan Arrangement. The Plaintiff submits that the Payment Arrangement supports his case that the Company would always be entitled to the entire profit earned from any project for which it had done work. Similarly, as regards the Insulation Supply Subcontract, the Company is entitled to the entire profit, which includes the Disputed Sum. The Loan Arrangement made between the Plaintiff and Justin supports the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant was allowed to retain the Disputed Sum to discharge some of the Defendant’s liabilities on the understanding that this verbally-arranged loan was to be repaid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 This is contrasted with the Defendant’s case, which is premised entirely on the Management Agreements. The Defendant argues that the Management Agreements are binding contracts entered into between the Defendant and the Company.

</div> Further, the Defendant argues that the Management Agreements are conclusive proof of the Company’s profit entitlement in respect of the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Hence, the Defendant relies heavily on the Management Agreements in arguing that the Company is not entitled to the Disputed Sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I shall now deal with the Defendant’s case on the Management Agreements. If I accept that the Management Agreements are binding contracts, then they are likely to be conclusive proof of the Company’s profit entitlement flowing from the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Hence, the Company would not be entitled to the Disputed Sum. The Plaintiff’s case, thus, has to be dismissed on this ground alone.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Management Agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Defendant’s case is that the Management Agreements are contracts entered into between the Company and the Defendant to regulate the Company’s profit entitlement from the Yamal Project.

This, in the Defendant’s submission, is all that the Company is entitled to from the profit paid out of the Insulation Supply Subcontract.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Despite the Management Agreements having the apparent appearance of a contract, I accept the Plaintiff’s case that the Management Agreements are not in fact binding contracts. The Management Agreements also do not limit the Company’s profit entitlement to what is stated therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, the most important question is whether the parties intend the Management Agreements to be a binding contract. The mere fact that a document uses words such as “contract” or “agreement”, or contains the company stamp, does not necessarily mean that the document is a legally valid and binding contract. Indeed, to do so would be to elevate substance over form. It is essential to go beyond the veneer of the document to ascertain whether, in substance, that document was intended by the parties to operate as a legally valid and binding contract (see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners) </span>[2011] 2 SLR 232 at [77], citing <span class="font-italic">MCST Plan No 1933 v Liang Huat Aluminium Ltd</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 91 at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Second, and bearing the above in mind, I find that the substance of the Management Agreements does not have the hallmark of a valid and binding contract. In particular, it is unclear as to what was the consideration contemplated by the parties in respect of some of the Management Agreements. For instance, the first Management Agreement was indicated to be for the period commencing 1 January 2016, while the fourth, fifth and sixth Management Agreements were for periods after the completion of the Insulation Supply Subcontract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, April 2017. The Insulation Supply Subcontract, on the other hand, was executed in April 2016 and completed in April 2017. Thus, three out of the six Management Agreements were supposedly entered into after the completion of the Insulation Supply Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This is, indeed, highly unusual. It is undisputed that the Insulation Supply Subcontract and the accompanying subcontract for the installation of those insulation materials were completed in April 2017. The Defendant’s allegations that there were still uncompleted contractual works for which profit was being paid to explain the three Management Agreements made after the completion of the Insulation Supply Subcontract and the installation of the insulation materials cannot be believed. Hence, this puts the legitimacy of the three Management Agreements, made after the completion date of April 2017, in serious doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The total value of the purported contracts for the three Management Agreements post-April 2017 was S$745,316.85. This sum was paid by the Defendant to the Company, and the Defendant appears to have received no consideration in return. It is trite law that every legally binding agreement must be supported by consideration. If the Defendant alleges that the Management Agreements were contracts between the parties that sought to allocate the profit entitlement for the Insulation Supply Subcontract, then this gives rise to the question of why the Defendant continued paying the Company after the completion of the works for the Insulation Supply Subcontract and the installation of the insulation materials. The Defendant could not provide a satisfactory explanation as to what was the consideration underlying these three Management Agreements post-April 2017. This simply makes no sense, and it raises serious suspicion as to whether the Management Agreements were indeed intended to be binding contracts as alleged by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Victor suggested that the payments for these three Management Agreements were for the work done by the Plaintiff for the installation of the insulation materials.

</div> Victor was asked to explain why these three Management Agreements were dated after the completion of the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Victor’s response was that there was a delay in the installation of the insulation materials, and this led to a corresponding extension in the period of supply of the insulation materials.

The evidence subsequently revealed that there was no delay in the subcontract for the installation of the insulation materials, and the insulation works were in fact completed in April 2017. In particular, two emails sent by the representatives of PT Kaefer showed that the supply and delivery of the insulation materials, as well as their installation, had already been completed sometime on 19 April 2017.

</div> Accordingly, the last delivery date for the insulation materials under the Insulation Supply Subcontract and the installation date for the insulation materials fell within the original contractually stipulated time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, April 2017. Victor, therefore, provided no satisfactory explanation as to why the post-April 2017 Management Agreements were issued after the Insulation Supply Subcontract was completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Third, when the Management Agreements are scrutinised collectively and from a broader perspective, it is clear that the parties could not have intended the very brief Management Agreements to be a valid and binding contract, albeit having included the labels “agreement” and “contract” in its contents. Close scrutiny of the Management Agreements shows a disturbing feature. The payments made thereunder were described as “profit entitlement of [the Company] for Yamal material for insulation”. However, the table in the Management Agreements described the sum as “Yamal Insulation Material Project Management Fee”. There is a material difference between payments made pursuant to a contractual profit entitlement versus payments made pursuant to a management fee. This, therefore, raises the question as to whether the Management Agreements were drafted to record the payment of money for the purpose of profit entitlement, or for the payment of management fees due to the Company. When queried on the stand, Victor was unable to explain the difference in the terminology used.

</div> In this case, the Management Agreements were signed during and after the Insulation Supply Subcontract.

</div> The serious discrepancies in the dates of some of these Management Agreements <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the corresponding invoices suggest that the Management Agreements were not in fact negotiated contracts between the Plaintiff and Kevin. Rather, the Management Agreements appear more likely to be documents produced to record any payment of profit from the Defendant to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I pause to emphasise another related point. The Counsel for the Plaintiff (Mr Yeo) referred to a management agreement which recorded the profit entitlements arising from two different projects. This was a management agreement dated 29 December 2016 signed between the Company and PT Kaefer. This management agreement stated the Company’s profit entitlements in respect of two different projects, namely the “GORGON” project and two other subcontracts under the Yamal Project.

</div> The Plaintiff explained that this was another example of the mechanism in which the parties remitted money back to the Company. Despite the use of labels such as “agreement” and “contract”, the management agreement is clearly in substance an invoice from the Company to PT Kaefer seeking payments from different projects, and clearly supports the finding that the parties did not intend that any document titled “management agreement” to be a legally binding contract between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Crucially, Victor’s admission at trial on the purpose of the Management Agreements and their accompanying invoices strengthens the Plaintiff’s case that Management Agreements were created for accounting purposes, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to move funds from a particular Kaefer entity back to the Company:

This sum was clearly more than what the Company had asked for, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, more than six times of the Company’s asking sum. Assuming also that the figure of three percent referred to the profit earned from the Insulation Supply Subcontract, which is S$3,475,434.42, the amount which the Company would have been entitled to would have been only S$104,263.02.

This manner of entering into a contract is highly unusual and irregular. Indeed, when asked about whether it was usual for parties to conclude contracts in this manner, Victor agreed that it was unusual:

</div> This concession is yet another critical blow to the Defendant’s case, as it further reinforces the absence of any entitlement on the Defendant’s part to retain the Disputed Sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Accordingly, there was in fact no agreement on the profit entitlement and, specifically, there was no agreement that the Defendant was entitled to retain the Disputed Sum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The purported work done by Kaefer Australia and the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Defendant then argues that it is entitled to retain the Disputed Sum on the basis of the work done by Kaefer Australia and the Defendant in respect of the procurement of the insulation materials for the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Specifically, Victor explained that in the preparation for the Yamal Project, personnel from Kaefer Australia were engaged to review engineering drawings, prepare the specifications, and develop the quantities of insulation materials required as well as to prepare the purchase orders for the insulation materials. This preparation was done in consultation with PT Kaefer and the Defendant. It was only after the discussions had concluded that purchase orders were issued to the Defendant’s suppliers.

Indeed, Victor did not provide any evidence detailing the manner in which any of the Defendant’s personnel were involved in the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Nor was there any document detailing the costs incurred by the Defendant in performing the work in respect of the Insulation Supply Subcontract.

</div> This aspect of David’s evidence was not challenged by the Defendant in cross-examination. In this regard, I note the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67, which was stated by Lord Herschell LC at 70–71:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit. … it will not do to impeach the credibility of a witness upon a matter on which he has not had any opportunity of giving an explanation by reason of there having been no suggestion whatever in the course of the case that his story is not accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, it is essential that when the Defendant sought to disagree with David’s evidence-in-chief it must put its case to him so that he had an opportunity to explain the Defendant’s allegations, failing which there might be an implicit acceptance of David’s evidence-in-chief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Defendant’s failure to put its case to David, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Company did not do any work in furtherance of the Yamal Project, means that it is not now open to the Defendant to allege that David’s evidence does not support the Plaintiff’s case and should be rejected by the Court. The Defendant must be taken to have accepted David’s evidence that it was the Company and PT Kaefer which performed the works in relation to the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Hence, the Defendant’s case that it was entitled to retain the Disputed Sum on the basis of the works done by the Defendant and Kaefer Australia cannot stand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s purported profit margin allocation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Defendant also alleges a 15% profit margin entitlement from the total value of the Insulation Supply Subcontract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 15% of S$10m which equates to S$1.5m, on its part to justify the retention of the Disputed Sum.

However, when he was asked to elaborate further, Gregory explained that the 15% profit margin from the final contract sum was in fact derived from the Management Agreements. Put another way, Gregory’s explanation was that since the parties entered into the Management Agreements and nothing further, this suggests that the Defendant was in fact entitled to a 15% profit margin allocation arising from the Insulation Supply Subcontract:

Your Honour, it doesn’t say specifically. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Moreover, Victor was unable to provide the Court with a valid explanation or refer to other evidence supporting the Defendant’s case on how the parties arrived at the respective profit entitlement. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the Defendant was entitled to retain the Disputed Sum for the Insulation Supply Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of the Defendant’s defence regarding its entitlement to the Disputed Sum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Ultimately, the Defendant alleges that the Company was not entitled to the Disputed Sum as this was the Defendant’s share of the profit in the Insulation Supply Subcontract. This, therefore, implies that the Company’s share was S$1,931,291,95 and the Defendant’s share was S$1,544,142.27. Assuming the Defendant is right, the immediate question is how the parties arrived at such a precise apportionment of the profits for the Insulation Supply Subcontract. There is no evidence to assist the Court in accepting this assertion other than the Management Agreements (the basis of which I have rejected above). The Defendant also did not plead on how the parties were to share the profit accrued from the Insulation Supply Subcontract when the Defendant secured the Yamal Project from PT McDermott. And as I have found above, the further justifications which were provided by the Defendant’s witnesses were not only unpleaded and belatedly raised during the trial, but more importantly were neither supported by any evidence nor capable of withstanding logical scrutiny. The Defendant’s case on the entitlement to the Disputed Sum is, therefore, not credible and difficult to believe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Despite my finding that the Defendant cannot establish any defence to justify its retention of the Disputed Sum, I am aware that this does not automatically mean that the Plaintiff succeeds in his case. This is because such a finding merely means that the Defendant’s defence against the Plaintiff’s claim for the Disputed Sum cannot be made out. This finding does not discharge the Plaintiff’s burden of proving that the Company was entitled to the Disputed sum. In this connection, I am mindful of the fundamental requirement that the Plaintiff ultimately bears the legal burden of proving his case on a balance of probabilities. Indeed, it is a trite proposition that a plaintiff in a civil claim bears the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact necessary to make out its claim on a balance of probabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 (“<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>”) at [60]). The defendant, on the other hand, will likewise have a legal burden of proving a pleaded defence, unless the defence is a bare denial of the claim (see <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA</span><span class="font-italic"> (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The mere fact that the court is not satisfied that a defendant has not made out its defence on a balance of probabilities does not mean that the plaintiff succeeds on its claim on the basis that there is no viable defence. This is because the legal burden of proof is always placed on the plaintiff and does not shift, as the party that bears “the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute exists” (<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> at [58]). To do otherwise would, as Goh Yihan JC correctly and aptly stressed in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi (alias </span><span class="font-italic">Paul Chan) v Wang Jian and other matters</span> [2022] SGHC 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi</span>”) at [38], “confer an unintended advantage to the plaintiff where the defendant’s defence is unsustainable”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the present case, the legal burden of proof is ultimately placed on the Plaintiff to prove that the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum, and that the Loan Arrangement exists to justify the Defendant’s retention of the Disputed Sum. With this in mind, I shall now consider the Plaintiff’s case on the Company’s entitlement to the Disputed Sum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Company’s entitlement to the Disputed Sum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I shall now consider  the Plaintiff’s case that the Company was entitled to  the Disputed Sum, on the basis of the Payment Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Payment Arrangement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The Plaintiff relies heavily on the Payment Arrangement to advance his case that the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum. In particular, the Plaintiff referred to the arrangement between the Company and the various Kaefer entities in respect of three prior projects: (a) the Australian Pacific LNG project (“the APLNG Project”); (b)  the “Inpex Project”; and (c)  the “Wheatstone Project”.

In these projects, the Company was not the contracting party with the third party; rather the contracting party would always be a Kaefer Group entity. Thus, the payment of profit was made to the respective Kaefer Group entity which was the contracting party for the relevant project. In turn, the respective Kaefer Group entities channelled the profit to the Company.

The Defendant was thus permitted to retain the Disputed Sum because the Company had agreed to allow the Defendant to use the Disputed Sum to discharge its liabilities in anticipation of a merger between the Company and the Defendant. It was not disputed that the Disputed Sum was indeed used to discharge some of the Defendant’s liabilities. This was at the time when Kaefer Germany intended to buy over the Plaintiff’s remaining 20% shares in the Company and the Company and the Defendant would merge as one entity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I shall now consider the parties’ evidence in relation to these three projects.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The APLNG Project</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96  The Company carried out and completed the APLNG Project in Batam on behalf of PT Kaefer.

</div> The fact that the revenue from the APLNG Project was recorded under the Company’s accounts, as opposed to PT Kaefer’s accounts, suggests that there was an understanding between the Kaefer Group and the Company that the Company was entitled to the entire profit from the APLNG Project, although such an arrangement was evidently not recorded in a written agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Inpex Project</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The Plaintiff further relies on the Company’s profit entitlement under the Inpex Project.

</div> Indeed, the Wheatstone Business Agreement has the essential features of a valid contract between the Company and Kaefer Australia, and clearly stipulates the Company’s profit entitlement arising out of its work done in respect of the Wheatstone Project. This is clear from the words “[Kaefer Australia] will subcontract 100% of the contract to [the Company]” and that “all risk and rewards lies with [the Company]”.

Accordingly, the court generally will not consider claims which are not pleaded (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span> at [38]). However, the court is not required to adopt an overly formalistic and inflexibly rule-bound approach, and departure from the general rule is allowed where no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so (see <span class="font-italic">V</span><span class="font-italic"> Nithia</span> at [39]–[40]). In this regard, evidence given at trial, where appropriate, can overcome a defect in the pleadings provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced (see <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Despite not being contained in the Statement of Claim or the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1), details regarding the Wheatstone Project and the application of the Payment Arrangement to Kaefer Australia were set out in the Plaintiff’s Supplementary AEIC filed on 16 August 2022.

</div> for instance, by taking out a notice of objection. However, this objection aside, the Defendant was happy to go along with this point and also took the opportunity to respond to the Plaintiff’s case on the Wheatstone Project at multiple points: (a) in Victor’s AEIC filed on 13 September 2022; (b) during cross-examination of the relevant witnesses at trial; and (c) in the parties’ written submissions. Further, documents relating to the Wheatstone Project were also tendered before this Court throughout the course of this derivative action. Further, at no point in time throughout the trial did the Defendant bring home its concern to this Court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the application of the Payment Arrangement to Kaefer Australia was not pleaded in the Statement of Claim. It is only in its closing submissions that the Defendant then raised its objection and asked the Court to disregard any submissions and evidence led on the Wheatstone Project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 After all these developments, the Defendant’s objections cannot seriously be taken. The Defendant has had sufficient notice of this point and has had adequate opportunities to respond to this point during the trial and after. Moreover, the Plaintiff’s reference to the Wheatstone Project did not materially change the Defendant’s strategy or burden at trial or in its submissions. Indeed, the Defendant was able to sufficiently raise evidence at trial and make arguments to deal with the Plaintiff’s case on the Wheatstone Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Therefore, the Defendant cannot be said to be prejudiced in any way, and it certainly cannot complain that the Plaintiff’s case on the Wheatstone Project should be disregarded. In contrast, not ruling on the issues would have been unjust to the Plaintiff as he had expended resources to procure evidence and make submissions on the Wheatstone Project. Moreover, the Defendant did not raise any challenges to the pleadings earlier, and this deprived the Plaintiff of an opportunity to further amend its pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Summary of the Court’s findings on the Payment Arrangement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In summary, the three projects discussed above support the Plaintiff’s case regarding the Payment Arrangement. In the case of the APLNG Project and the Wheatstone Project, the respective Kaefer entities would pay to the Company all of the profits received from the projects. This operational understanding between the Company and the Defendant might have been done with or without any written agreements. However, it remains that whilst the respective Kaefer Group entity, as the contracting party for each of these projects, may have been entitled to payment of a fee in some circumstances, that Kaefer entity would certainly not be entitled to keep all or even part of the profit. As for the Inpex Project, it is true that only some of the profit earned was paid <span class="font-italic">directly</span> to the Company. However, a portion of the profit in the Inpex Project was paid to the Company’s shareholders, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff and Kaefer Germany. In that sense, therefore, the entire profit arising from the Inpex Project was accounted for the benefit of the Company, either directly or indirectly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The existence of this Payment Arrangement is further supported by the parties’ conduct as regards the allocation of the profits in respect of three of the subcontracts under the Yamal Project. It is undisputed that the Company was the entity that financed the works to be done under the three subcontracts, and also provided the necessary manpower in support of the completion of these subcontracts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I shall consider the principles relating to the formation of an oral agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The law on oral agreements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 It is well accepted that the principles for ascertaining the formation of an agreement, whether the agreement is oral or written in nature, are substantively the same (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi </span>at [63], citing <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) at p 184). Whether an oral agreement amounts to a binding contract depends on whether the following elements are established: (a) offer and acceptance; (b) intention to create legal relations; (c) certainty of terms; and (d) consideration (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan and another v Johnny Lian Tian Yong</span> [2018] SGHC 169 at [222]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 However, it must be emphasised that a distinction needs to be drawn between the <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> requirements for proving an oral agreement, and the <span class="font-italic">mode</span> of proving an oral agreement. As Goh JC aptly observed in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi</span> at [63]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63  … oral agreements present a different challenge from written contracts in how one goes about proving those substantive requirements. This is because unlike a written contract, where the substantive requirements (such as formation, consideration and certainty) can be found on the face of the written document, an oral agreement, by its very nature, is not recorded on such a written document. Accordingly, it is important to differentiate between two separate questions: first, the substantive requirements needed for an oral agreement, and second, <span class="font-italic">how</span> to go about proving those substantive requirements. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The relevant considerations that the court should bear in mind when determining whether an oral agreement was formed were succinctly summarised by Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Tan Li Yin Michel v Avril Rengasamy </span>[2018] SGHC 274 at [29]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court has to consider the relevant documentary evidence and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [39]). The test for determining the existence of any such agreement is objective (at [40]). The Court of Appeal has also emphasized the importance of looking to the relevant documentary evidence <span class="font-italic">first</span> as they would be more reliable than a witness’ oral testimony given well after the fact, and which may be coloured by the onset of subsequent events and the dispute between the parties (<span class="font-italic">OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon</span> [2012] 4 SLR 1206 at [41]). Where there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will “attempt its level best by examining closely (and in particular) the precise factual matrix” (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In determining whether the substantive requirements of an oral agreement are satisfied, the court must, therefore, first look to the relevant documentary evidence. These documents reduce the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists. This is important since a witness’ oral testimony given well after the fact may be less reliable for various reasons and may be coloured by the onset of subsequent events and the dispute between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 It is only where the documentary evidence is unsatisfactory will the court turn to examine the parties’ oral testimony. Thus, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 held at [60] that where there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will “nevertheless attempt its level best by examining closely (and in particular) the precise factual matrix”. In examining the reliability of oral testimony, Quentin Loh J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">ARS v ART</span> [2015] SGHC 78 (“<span class="font-italic">ARS</span>”) set out at [53(d)]–[53(f)] the following guiding principles that a court ought to bear in mind:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’ recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 With the above principles in mind, I now turn to consider the parties’ case and the evidence relating to the Loan Arrangement, beginning first with the relevant documentary evidence and written communications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The relevant documentary evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In support of the Plaintiff’s case that Justin and the Plaintiff had negotiated and orally concluded the Loan Arrangement on behalf of the Defendant and the Company respectively, the Plaintiff relies on several documents. These are, namely, an email dated 8 March 2017 (“the 8 March Email”), email exchanges on 11 September 2019 (“the 11 September Email Thread”), and a project account referring to the Yamal Project (“the Yamal Project Account”).

This was said in the context of Kaefer Germany’s consideration of the option to purchase the balance of the Plaintiff’s shareholding in the Company.

There is no mention of whether the Company was entitled to retain the Disputed Sum on the basis of the Loan Arrangement. Indeed, the Plaintiff concedes that the 8 March Email does not expressly state that the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum; it also did not state that the Disputed Sum was to be retained by the Defendant as a loan.

</div> In respect of the 11 September Email Thread, the Plaintiff’s case is that the reference to “approx. 300k SGD” in the 11 September Email Thread was a reference to the Plaintiff’s dividend pay-out from the Disputed Sum which he claims to be entitled to by virtue of his 20% shareholding in the Company. This, in the Plaintiff’s view, could only be the case if the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum. This is because 20% of the Disputed Sum would have been S$303,424.00. The Plaintiff submits that this is roughly equivalent to the  alleged  share of the profit in terms of his dividend entitlement.

Victor was thus referring to the Plaintiff’s purported entitlement to the dividend payment from the Disputed Sum.

</div> But it was not the Plaintiff who had asked him about his dividend. It was Victor, his boss, who sent him and Kristoff an email asking them whether the Plaintiff was entitled to any dividend. Thus, Gregory’s explanation about being diplomatic to the Plaintiff is completely irrelevant. In any case, this was the first time the Court was informed of this explanation and none of this featured anywhere in Gregory’s AEIC.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">COURT: [Gregory], Mr Yeo is saying this: if you had said what you told us this morning, in 2017 you knew that [the Company] is not entitled to the [Disputed Sum].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A:  Yes, I knew they were not entitled.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">COURT: No, this affidavit in paragraph 8 refers to a situation in 2019. So in 2019, you state in your affidavit you are puzzled. Right? There’s no reason for you to be puzzled if what you told us is the truth. If in 2017 you knew that he was entitled.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So in your affidavit you should not have stated you were puzzled. You should have stated that you knew that [the Company] was not entitled, that [the Plaintiff] was not entitled to 20 per cent of the [Disputed Sum], but you just wanted to be diplomatic and you didn’t want to tell him bluntly, is what you told us in court?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A:  Yeah.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Accordingly, I do not accept Gregory’s evidence on this very crucial issue of whether the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum. I am also unable to accept the Defendant’s explanation as regards the preparation of the Yamal Project Account regarding the Disputed Sum. On the contrary, the true reason for Gregory to prepare the Yamal Project Account was because at that time he thought that the Plaintiff was entitled to the portion of the Disputed Sum according to his shareholding in the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Finally, it is important to bear in mind Kristoff’s reply email in the 11 September Email Thread. Kristoff’s reply (see [151] above) in fact confirms that there was some form of agreement reached between the parties regarding the Defendant’s retention of the Disputed Sum and the Plaintiff’s dividends from a portion of the Disputed Sum to be paid directly to the Plaintiff. I note that Kristoff’s email states that it was Kevin, and not Justin, who had concluded the Loan Arrangement with the Plaintiff. This apparent inconsistency is explicable as at the material time Justin had left the Defendant’s employment and Kevin was still the Defendant’s employee. Kevin was also involved in the negotiations as both the Plaintiff and Justin had informed Kevin of the Loan Arrangement. In any case, this inconsistency is not material, as what is important is that Kristoff’s email suggested that the Loan Arrangement was in fact negotiated between the parties. In any case, I shall refer to the Plaintiff’s oral testimony at [175]–[177] below which would shed light on how the entire Loan Arrangement was negotiated. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) The 7 September Email and 16 September Email</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 There is one final piece of written correspondence that I find to be relevant in establishing the Plaintiff’s case on the existence of the Loan Arrangement. This relates to the email correspondence between the Plaintiff and Mr Steen Hansen (“Hansen”), who was the then-Chief Financial Officer of Kaefer Germany, that occurred shortly before the 11 September Email Thread.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 By way of background, the Plaintiff had, during the discussions regarding Kaefer Germany’s intended buyout of his shareholding in the Company, mentioned that he was entitled to a “portion of share” for the Yamal Project.

It’s easy to ignore this but we must do what’s right!</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 It is important to note that both the 7 September Email and the 16 September Email were the first time the Plaintiff had informed a representative of the Kaefer Group of the existence of the Loan Arrangement. I find this to be important, as there was no reason for the Plaintiff to have fabricated the Loan Arrangement to Hansen. More importantly, what the Plaintiff has said in these two emails was corroborated by Kristoff’s email to Victor in the 11 September Email Thread, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Kevin and the Plaintiff had agreed for some of the profit from the Insulation Supply Subcontract to be retained by the Defendant to pay off the Defendant’s liabilities, but that dividends from a portion of the Disputed Sum equivalent to the Plaintiff’s shareholding in the Company would be paid to the Plaintiff (see [151] above). Similarly, I note that there appears to be an inconsistency regarding whether it was Justin or Kevin who had negotiated the Loan Arrangement with the Plaintiff, although as explained (at [165] above) this inconsistency is not in my view material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Accordingly, I find that the 7 September Email and the 16 September Email are also relevant in supporting the Plaintiff’s case regarding the Loan Arrangement, in so far as they explain the parties’ understanding regarding the Defendant’s retention of the Disputed Sum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Summary of the Court’s findings on the relevant documentary evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 To summarise, the 8 March Email does not expressly mention that the parties had entered into the Loan Arrangement or that the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum. On the face of it, therefore, the Plaintiff cannot rely on the language of the 8 March Email to support his case that the Loan Arrangement existed. However, when I consider the Plaintiff’s oral testimony regarding the context of the 8 March Email (at [178]–[179] below), I find that the 8 March Email is relevant to the Plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The 11 September Email Thread and the Yamal Project Account on the other hand, support the Plaintiff’s case regarding the Company’s entitlement to the Disputed Sum. In particular, the only logical explanation for Gregory to prepare the Yamal Project Account was to explain to Victor the Plaintiff’s share of 20% in the Disputed Sum, which should have been but was yet to be accounted for the benefit of the Company. It should also be emphasised that Gregory had signed four of the Management Agreements. Thus, he would have known whether the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum. If it were true that Gregory knew that the Company was not entitled to the Disputed Sum at that time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, September 2019, he would have told Victor accordingly. Instead, he took considerable time and resources to prepare the Yamal Project Account, a very detailed document, to explain to Victor the Disputed Sum due to the Company and the Plaintiff’s potential share in the Disputed Sum. This showed that Gregory understood the meaning of Kevin’s email in the 11 September Email Thread.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: So can I ask you to tell the court, where in this email from [Kevin], dated 8 March, does it say that [the Defendant] and Kaefer Germany recognises that [the Company] is entitled to the profit of 1,544,142.47 to be retained by the [D]efendant; where does it say that?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: It didn’t state that. To me, it’s an internal Kaefer matter. And whether Kevin or Victor informed [Kaefer Germany] or not, I don’t know. But as far as I’m concerned, this email was generated because I’ve requested [Kevin], who is leaving soon, at that time, that he must be sure that this portion of the loan is covered. That’s why it’s sent to me and to [Victor].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Your evidence is that it doesn’t say that, right?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: It doesn’t say that, but what he say make sense to me, that he is implying that the com – [the Defendant] do owe the balance profit to [the Company].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: You then agree that item A of paragraph 14, which is [Kevin’s] email, right, relates to the buyout of your shares?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: All right.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: By Kaefer Germany?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: All right.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: And actually doesn’t confirm or provide evidence of this profit that must be, in your words, accounted for by the [D]efendant to [the Company]. Correct?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: It’s all linked, Mr Lim Tat. How can I get a dividend payment for this portion that is retained in [the Defendant] if the profit is not accountable to the [Company]. So I can -- this only applies because the fact that the entire profit belongs to [the Company]. This statement doesn’t make any sense if … all the profit are not accounted to [the Company]. This statement A, 14A doesn’t apply at all.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Okay. The only way I can receive my share of -- I use the word “dividends” -- is if only that profit belongs to [the Company]. I’m not a shareholder or anything of [the Defendant]. So by Kevin implying that the result of the Yamal material balance which is retained in [the Defendant], they have to pay out my cut of the share, meant that this profit actually belongs to [the Company]. That’s – that’s the only way it can correlate. I can only get a share of the profit in [the Defendant] if that money belongs to [the Company]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So, like I say, this email got no meaning, if the entire profit did not belong to the [Company]. So, Kevin, by writing it this way, encompassed the left and right of the whole thing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The Plaintiff’s explanation regarding the contents of the 8 March Email, and in particular, the words “[f]or [the Defendant] the [Yamal Project] result are taken into consideration (Less Germany mgt fee)”, must be considered in the context of the background that the Company would be wholly owned by Kaefer Germany. At that time, there was an expectation that Kaefer Germany would buy out the Plaintiff’s remaining shareholding in the Company. I shall elaborate more on this at [183]–[190] below. Under this buyout scheme, there was an implicit understanding and arrangement that the valuation of the Plaintiff’s shares would take into account the profit that was due to the Company. That is why the Plaintiff said that the profit that would be taken into consideration in this valuation process would include the Disputed Sum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Summary of the Court’s findings on the existence of the Loan Arrangement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 From the above, therefore, I accept the Plaintiff’s oral testimony as regards the existence of the Loan Arrangement. I find that the Plaintiff was largely consistent in his account as to how the Loan Arrangement came into existence and is also corroborated by the documentary evidence in the form of the email correspondence which I referred to above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Loh J in <span class="font-italic">ARS </span>at [53(f)] stated that where the witness was not legally trained the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words. In this instance, the Plaintiff was not legally trained. When the Plaintiff used the word “loan” to describe the arrangement between the Company and the Defendant, the Plaintiff was referring to no more than an understanding between the parties regarding the flow and accounting of monies paid by third parties for work done by an entity under the Kaefer Group. The Plaintiff’s explanation at trial was as follows:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">COURT: Is it reflected anywhere in [the Company] that the sum of 1.5 million was a loan to [the Defendant]?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A:  Not the term “loan”, no.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">COURT: No. Or “receivable”? Is it reflected in the [Company’s] account … that the outstanding sum of 1.5 is recorded as receivable from [the Defendant]?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: No, sir. The intention was, because of the buyout … this amount was not meant to be declared as a receivable in [the Company]. It’s supposed to be like declared as dividend. That's why [Kevin] put … my share of the 20 per cent dividend in the email. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That was the intention at that time; that is declared as a dividend. That means the monies stay in [the Defendant].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 When the Plaintiff used the word “loan”, he was referring to the understanding that money would ultimately be paid back to the Plaintiff and the Company. How the money was eventually paid back was not as important from the Plaintiff’s perspective – it may be indirectly through a payment to the Company, followed by the Company’s declaration of a dividend paid to the Plaintiff as its shareholder, or as a direct payment from the relevant Kaefer Group entity to the Plaintiff, similar to what occurred in the Inpex Project (see [110] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) The intended merger of the Company under the Kaefer Group</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 There was no written agreement or documentation stipulating the Company’s entitlement to the Disputed Sum, but this can be explained from the parties’ relationship and the circumstances operating on them at that time. The most obvious and common feature about the Company and the Defendant is that they were both under the control of the Kaefer Group. The Defendant, in particular, was wholly owned by Kaefer Germany, which also had controlling shareholding of 80% in the Company. Therefore, there was some degree of informality and flexibility when they engaged each other in a common project like the Insulation Supply Subcontract, notwithstanding that they were separate legal entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Following Kaefer Germany’s acquisition of the shares in the Company from Richard, and around the time of the Yamal Project, there was an underlying expectation that Kaefer Germany would be acquiring the Plaintiff’s remaining shareholding in the Company.

</div> This was confirmed by Victor and Gregory. At that time, they and the staff believed that there would soon be a merger of the Company and the Defendant. This explains why, around that time, the parties’ internal dealings became much more informal, and there was no emphasis placed on proper and strict accounting between the parties. The Company and the Defendant were also operating from the same premises at No 6 Sungei Kadut Street 2, Singapore 729228, and the Defendant did not pay any rental, either to the Company or to the Landlord; rather, the rental was only paid for by the Company to the Landlord.

Moreover, the staff of one Kaefer entity also signed documents belonging to another Kaefer entity. For instance, under the Yamal Project, Kristoff signed the subcontract for the supply and delivery of the passive fire protection, as well as the subcontract for the relevant installation works on behalf of PT Kaefer, despite not being an employee of PT Kaefer.

</div> These incidents demonstrate the blurring of lines between the separate and distinct nature of each Kaefer entity, with their operations managed without any due regard paid to their separate legal personalities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Following the proposed share buyout by Kaefer Germany in 2016, the intention was to shift the Defendant’s operations to the Company and operate as one entity.

</div> Indeed, the Kaefer Group’s intention to transform the Company into its profit centre is wholly consistent with the understanding that all profits derived from projects entered into between the respective Kaefer entities and third parties would eventually be transferred to the Company. The Company was intended to be the “profit centre” in respect of projects conducted in that region by the Kaefer Group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 An appreciation of this background explains why the parties’ dealings were carried out informally, and why there was the absence of written documentation regarding the parties’ entitlement to the Disputed Sum. In 2016 when the Yamal Project was being carried out, the parties were already working towards integrating the Plaintiff and the Defendant. For all intents and purposes, only one entity was envisaged and all the profits for the Yamal Project was to be booked under and accounted for the benefit of the Company as the profit centre.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The Kaefer Group’s intention to integrate the Defendant with the Company and the winding down of the Defendant’s operations also supported the existence of the Loan Arrangement.

</div> In particular, Kristoff’s reply in the 11 September Email Thread referred to the Plaintiff agreeing to the Defendant’s retention of the profit from the Yamal Project to enable the Defendant to settle its liabilities (see [151] above). Since it is undisputed that the Defendant has not retained any money from the other subcontracts under the Yamal Project (see [130] above), Kristoff’s statement in his reply email could only be a reference to the Disputed Sum, which was then held on by the Defendant and which was yet to be paid to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 For the above reasons, I find that the Company was entitled to the Disputed Sum, and the only reason why the Defendant retained the Disputed Sum was due to the Loan Arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff was not acting in bad faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Unfortunately, Kaefer Germany did not buy over the Plaintiff’s shares in the Company, and the <span class="font-italic">laissez faire</span> way in which the Company and the Defendant operated ultimately affected the interest of the Plaintiff, who remained a 20% shareholder in the Company. While the issue of the Disputed Sum remaining unpaid to the Company may not have any significant implication on the Defendant and the Kaefer Group, it nevertheless has a substantial impact on the Plaintiff, who is entitled to S$303,424 from the Disputed Sum in the form of a dividend payout.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In this vein, the Defendant submits that the Plaintiff had commenced the present derivative action in bad faith and this amounts to an abuse of s 216A of the CA. The Defendant alludes to the fact that the Plaintiff commenced the present derivative action almost two years after the completion of the Yamal Project, and after negotiations between the Plaintiff and Kaefer Germany regarding the sale of the Plaintiff’s shares had broken down.

</div> In other words, the Defendant’s case was that the Plaintiff has brought the present derivative suit in bad faith and for a collateral purpose as the Plaintiff was attempting to pressure Kaefer Germany into buying out the Plaintiff’s minority shareholding at a higher value.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I do not accept the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff’s commencement of the present derivative action was for a collateral purpose sufficient to amount to an abuse of s 216A of the CA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I shall deal with the concept of “good faith” in the context of a statutory derivative action. In <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Healthstats International Pte Ltd and others</span> [2019] 4 SLR 825, Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he then was) held at [44] that one facet of the “good faith” requirement is that the complainant seeking to bring the derivative action cannot be doing so for a collateral purpose. Ang JC elaborated on the notion of a collateral purpose at [45], as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45 As regards this second facet of the good faith requirement, it will not suffice to show dislike, ill-feeling or personal animosity between the parties as hostility between warring factions within a company is commonplace. However, if it can be shown that the applicant is “so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations”, then this would constitute a lack of good faith: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [20]. A history of grievances against the majority shareholders or the board would make it easier to characterise the derivative action as having been brought for no other purpose other than the satisfaction of the applicant’s private vendetta: <span class="font-italic">Swansson v R </span><span class="font-italic">A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd</span> (2002) 42 ACSR 313 at [41], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [13]. An applicant’s good faith will also be in doubt if he appears set on damaging the company out of sheer spite or for the benefit of a competitor: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah v Wong Kai Yuan and another</span> [2014] SGHC 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah</span>”) at [70].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Ang JC at [47] also drew the distinction between a complainant’s “motive” and “purpose” in analysing whether the complainant is bringing the derivative action in “good faith”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47     In considering the requirement of good faith, a distinction between “motive” and “purpose” should be drawn. The element of good faith is “dependent less on the motives” behind the application and “more on the purpose of the proposed derivative action, which must have an obvious nexus with the company’s benefit or interests”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… at [16]. <span class="font-italic">In other words, it is not the questionable motivations of the applicant </span>per se<span class="font-italic"> that amounts to bad faith; </span><span class="font-italic">instead bad faith may be established where questionable motivations constitute a personal purpose which will be pursued at the expense of or in lieu of the company’s interests</span>. In this sense, the requirements under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CA are quite clearly inter-linked: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [13] and [16], citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [20].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 In other words, the court must not only consider the applicant’s motive for bringing the statutory derivative action, but must also consider whether the applicant’s purpose for bringing the derivative action amounts to advancing his personal interest <span class="font-italic">at the expense of the company’s interest</span>. It follows that an applicant who seeks to bring a derivative action in his or her own interest is not necessarily acting in bad faith, as long as it would also be in the company’s interest to do so. This point was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor</span> [2013] 2 SLR 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">An</span><span class="font-italic">g Thiam Swee</span>, the Court of Appeal at [13]–[16] endorsed a line of Canadian authorities stating that an applicant who brings a derivative action to maximise the value of his shares would not be found to be acting in bad faith:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 …This crucial distinction between the applicant’s <span class="font-italic">motivation </span>or<span class="font-italic"> motive</span> on the one hand and his <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> on the other has been neatly encapsulated in Palmer J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Swansson v R </span><span class="font-italic">A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd</span> (2002) 42 ACSR 313 (“<span class="font-italic">Swansson</span>”) at [41] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To take another example: a derivative action sought to be instituted by a current shareholder for the purpose of restoring value to his or her shares in the company would not be an abuse of process even if the applicant is spurred on by intense personal animosity, even malice, against the defendant: it is not the law that only a plaintiff who feels goodwill towards a defendant is entitled to sue … On the other hand, an action sought to be instituted by a former shareholder with a history of grievances against the current majority of shareholders or the current board may be easier to characterise as brought for the purpose of satisfying nothing more than the applicant’s private vendetta. An applicant with such a purpose would not be acting in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 Canadian case law has over time unequivocally established that an applicant who acts out of self-interest need not be lacking in good faith. In <span class="font-italic">Primex Investments Ltd v Northwest Sports Enterprises Ltd and 453333 BC Ltd</span> [1996] 4 WWR 54 (“<span class="font-italic">Primex Investments</span>”), which concerned s 225 of the British Columbia Company Act (RSBC 1979, c 59) (now repealed and replaced by s 233 of the British Columbia Business Corporations Act (SBC 2002, c 57)), Tysoe J observed at [42] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I have no doubt that the Petitioner is acting out of self-interest in wanting to prosecute the derivative action. The self-interest is to maximize the value of its shares in Northwest by pursuing causes of action which it may have against Mr. Griffiths and the other directors. The Petitioner’s self-interest coincides with the interests of Northwest. This does not mean the Petitioner is acting in bad faith: see <span class="font-italic">Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. v. Kalmacoff</span> [(1995) 22 OR (3d) 577]. <span class="font-italic">Anything that benefits a company will indirectly benefit its shareholders by increasing the share value and it is hard to imagine a situation where a shareholder will not have a self-interest in wanting the company to prosecute an action which is in its interests to prosecute</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15     In <span class="font-italic">Richardson Greenshields of Canada Limited v Kalmacoff et al </span>(1995) 22 OR (3d) 577 (“Richardson Greenshields”) at 586–587, it was held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he extent of [the appellant shareholder’s] stake, monetary or otherwise, in the outcome of these proceedings is of little weight in deciding whether it has met the good faith test applicable to the present circumstances. … I think it significant that the appellant has had a long-standing commercial connection with this class of shares and is familiar with the matters in dispute. It acknowledges that it has clients who purchased shares on its recommendation, and, it can be inferred from the shareholders’ vote, that it voices the views of a substantial number of the preferred shareholders. <span class="font-italic">Whether it is motivated by altruism, as the motions court judge suggested, or by self-interest, as the respondents suggest, is beside the point. Assuming, as I suppose, it is the latter, self-interest is hardly a stranger to the security or investment business. Whatever the reason, there are legitimate legal questions raised here that call for judicial resolution</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16     The general tenor which emerges from the case law is that good faith is dependent less on the motives which trigger the application for leave to bring a statutory derivative action, and more on the purpose of the proposed derivative action, which must have an obvious nexus with the company’s benefit or interests. As this court noted in Pang Yong Hock at [20], “there is an interplay of the requirements in s 216A(3)(b) and (c)” … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 To summarise, the fact that the complainant may have a personal interest in pursuing the derivative action is not necessarily fatal to the finding of good faith. On the contrary, where the complainant is seeking, by bringing the proposed action, to maximise the value of or to restore value to his shares in the company, the court may, on the contrary, find that the complainant is acting in good faith. This is because an action that benefits the company will ultimately benefit its shareholders, and the complainant’s personal interest is, therefore, aligned with the company’s interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 With the above principles in mind, it becomes clear that the fact that the Plaintiff brought the present derivative action after the collapse of the negotiations for the buyout of the Plaintiff’s shares by Kaefer Germany is not detrimental to the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> nature of this derivative action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 It is true that, when questioned by the Counsel for the Defendant regarding the Plaintiff’s thoughts on Kaefer Germany’s refusal to buy out his shares in the Company, the Plaintiff expressed his unhappiness:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: … in your discourse by email with Mr Steen Hansen, you had reached a point where you were very unhappy with the development. Would that be fair to say?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: I think you would be unhappy too, Mr Lim Tat. You know, there is an agreement between me and Kaefer previous management, that there is a base of 3 million to purchase my share. And suddenly the new management come in with a less than 20 per cent of that, and you expect me to be happy about it, sir? I don’t think anyone would be happy, right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 It is, however, well accepted that dislike, ill-feeling or personal animosity between the parties is insufficient to show that the complainant was acting in bad faith in bringing the derivative action. What is required is that the complainant is “so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations”, then this would constitute a lack of good faith (see <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 at [20]). In this instant case, it cannot be argued that the Plaintiff lacks good faith on the basis that the Plaintiff was also motivated by personal considerations in bringing the present derivative action, or that the Plaintiff was also motivated by the collateral purpose of putting pressure on Kaefer Germany into buying up the Plaintiff’s shares at a higher value. Rather, I find that the Plaintiff was motivated by his wish to claim back what, in his view, was money rightfully owed to the Company. In doing so, the Plaintiff would no doubt benefit in terms of an increase in the value of his shareholding. As the Plaintiff said in cross-examination, “the worth of [his] share, is based on the profit of [the Company]”.

On the contrary, this is a case where the Plaintiff’s interest is aligned with that of the Company. The fact that the Plaintiff succeeding in this derivative action would result in a positive impact on the value of his shareholding in the Company does not in itself amount to a lack of good faith. If the Plaintiff did not take action for the return of the Disputed Sum from the Defendant, the Kaefer Group would not have taken any action as Kaefer Germany is the majority shareholder of the Company. For all intents and purposes, the Company is, in substance, part of the Kaefer Group. In fact, it is advantageous to the majority shareholder of the Company, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Kaefer Germany, to retain the Disputed Sum in the Defendant, a wholly owned entity of Kaefer Germany, so that it pays less for the Plaintiff’s shares in the Company. Accordingly, I do not accept the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff’s commencement of the present derivative action is an abuse of s 216A of the CA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The credibility and reliability of the witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I turn lastly to deal with the credibility and reliability of the witnesses.

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Moreover, when asked to explain to the Court the justification for the Defendant to retain the Disputed Sum, Victor’s evidence was internally inconsistent. Victor first gave evidence that the Defendant’s retention of the Disputed Sum was premised on the 4 April 2016 Emails which state that the Company would retain its “territory commission” which was “3%” of the final contract value. However, when he was unable to explain how the Company was eventually paid S$1,931,291.95 despite three percent of the final value for the Insulation Supply Subcontract being only S$300,000, Victor shifted his case to the </span>7 March 2016 Email and sought to explain, but again without success, that this email formed the justification behind the Defendant’s retention of the Disputed Sum. When these failed, Victor then sought to explain the Defendant’s retention of the Disputed Sum on the basis that the profit accrued to the Defendant were used to pay for the costs incurred by Kaefer Australia. However, as I have found at [69] above, this evidence was not found in Victor’s AEIC. This aspect of Victor’s testimony contains false assertions made up by him on the go. Finally, when all the previous explanations were not accepted, Victor asserted that the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Company had done only 10% or less of </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the work and was therefore entitled to a corresponding proportion of the profit amounting to about S$350,000. Similarly, when pressed on this, Victor was unable to explain why the Company was paid S$1,931,291.00 instead, and again became evasive with his answers.</span>

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> It is thus clear that Victor was embellishing his evidence on the go as the trial progressed, as he sought to adapt his evidence to suit the Defendant’s case.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">When Gregory was asked the same questions as Victor, he furnished an entirely different version. As I have stated at [73] above, Gregory claimed that the accepted profit margin in the Kaefer entity was 15%, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> after the Defendant was paid 15% of the profit, the balance was then paid to the Company. However, Gregory’s explanation was given for the first time during cross-examination and none of this featured in his AEIC. His evidence was, therefore, internally inconsistent. More importantly, Gregory’s evidence in this regard also contradicts </span>Victor’s (constantly evolving) account as to the Company’s entitlement to its three percent profit margin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">What was most egregious was the fact that Victor was caught “red-handed” in not telling the truth in Court. </span>As I have discussed at [44] above, when asked to explain why three of the six Management Agreements were dated after the completion of the Insulation Supply Subcontract, Victor claimed that this was because there was a delay in the installation of the insulation materials and this led to a corresponding extension in the period of supply of the insulation materials. This explanation, however, was proven to be completely false as the evidence subsequently revealed that there was no delay in the subcontract for the installation of the insulation materials which was also completed in April 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">For the above reasons, I find that the Defendant’s witnesses were unreliable and lacked credibility. Their testimonies were internally and externally inconsistent. This also made it more difficult for me to believe the Defendant’s case on its retention of the Disputed Sum which, as can be seen above, was constantly evolving. On the contrary, the Plaintiff was candid, frank and truthful in his testimony in Court. His candour and willingness to make concessions that harmed his case readily made him a more reliable and trustworthy witness. </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 For the above reasons, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant. I make the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Management Agreements relied on by the Defendant are not legally binding contracts. Rather, I find that these documents are merely evidence of receipts of payments by the Company. Further, the Management Agreements do not state that the Company was only entitled to S$1,931,291.95 for the Yamal Project’s Insulation Supply Subcontract. Accordingly, the Management Agreements cannot be evidence that supports the final amount of profit entitlement to which the Company is entitled. The Management Agreements do not suggest that the Company is not entitled to the Disputed Sum.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendant is unable to furnish any valid justification for its retention of the Disputed Sum from the Yamal Project’s Insulation Supply Subcontract for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) First, I am satisfied that there is no evidence to support the finding of an agreement between the Defendant’s and the Company’s representatives on the Company’s profit entitlement and, specifically, an agreement that the Defendant was entitled to retain the Disputed Sum.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Second, there is no basis for the Defendant to suggest that it is entitled to retain the Disputed Sum for the work done by Kaefer Australia and the Defendant regarding the procurement of the insulation materials for the Insulation Supply Subcontract. Victor’s and Gregory’s evidence on this matter cannot be believed and must be rejected. There is simply no evidence to support the Defendant’s claim for the Disputed Sum. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Turning to the Plaintiff’s case, I am satisfied that both the documentary evidence and the Plaintiff’s testimony support the finding that the Loan Arrangement was concluded between the Company and the Defendant for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Plaintiff has shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Payment Arrangement existed, and that pursuant to this arrangement, the profit paid out of any projects for which the Company had done work would be accounted for the benefit of the Company. Accordingly, the Company is entitled to retain the entire profit paid out of the Yamal Project’s Insulation Supply Subcontract. Further, the Company had done the work in furtherance of the performance of the Insulation Supply Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The documentary evidence supports the existence of the Loan Arrangement between the Company and the Defendant. The Defendant was in fact to account the profit, including the Disputed Sum, for the benefit of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Finally, the Plaintiff’s oral testimony supports the existence of the Loan Arrangement. I find that the Plaintiff was largely consistent in his account as to how the Loan Arrangement came into existence. This is also corroborated by the documentary evidence in the form of the email correspondence which I referred to above. I also find the Plaintiff to be a forthcoming, candid and reasonable witness. His testimony can be believed. On the other hand, I find the Defendant’s witnesses evasive and had also embellished numerous aspects of their evidence with falsehood. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) I also observe that the absence of any written documentation between the parties regarding the existence of the Loan Arrangement can be attributed to the informal nature in which the parties operated the Company and transacted with each other. At the material time, there was an expectation that the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary within the Kaefer Group, and that the Company would be designated as the Kaefer Group’s “profit centre” in respect of projects conducted in the region by the Kaefer Group. An appreciation of this background explains why the parties’ dealings were carried out more informally, and why there was the absence of written documentation regarding the parties’ entitlement of the Disputed Sum.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Finally, I find that the Plaintiff was not acting in bad faith in bringing the present derivative action on behalf of the Company to recover the Disputed Sum. The mere fact that the Plaintiff had expressed his unhappiness with the Defendant and Kaefer Germany, the majority shareholder of the Company, is insufficient to show that the Plaintiff was acting in bad faith in bringing the present derivative action. The Plaintiff is motivated by the Company’s financial interest and in ensuring proper accountability and corporate governance as the value of his shares and the Company’s performance are interdependent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The Defendant is to pay costs to the Plaintiff to be agreed or assessed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Choon Hsien Leslie (Sterling Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tat, Subir Singh Grewal and Glenda Lim Jia Qian (Aequitas Law LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
