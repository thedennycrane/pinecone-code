The Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Liao Eng Kiat v Burswood Nominees Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 690 (“<span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees</span>”) that it does not. However, a subsequent Court of Appeal commented, in <span class="font-italic">Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc</span> <span class="font-italic">(trading as Caesars Palace) </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1129 (“<span class="font-italic">Desert Palace</span>”), that <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was wrongly decided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After hearing submissions, I held that I remain bound by <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>notwithstanding the comments made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Desert </span><span class="font-italic">Palace</span>, and declined to set aside the registration of an Australian judgment under the RECJA. The judgment debtor has appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Star Entertainment QLD Limited (“the Judgment Creditor”) operates a casino known as “The Star Gold Coast” (“the Casino”) in Queensland, Australia, pursuant to a casino licence issued under Queensland’s Casino Control Act 1982.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Mr Yong Khong Yoong Mark (“the Judgment Debtor”) was a customer of the Casino and had incurred certain debts arising from his patronage of the Casino.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 25 September 2020, the Judgment Creditor obtained a default judgment against the Judgment Debtor in the Supreme Court of Queensland for the sum of A$ 3,883,058.28, including A$ 72,053.14 in interest, and A$ 4,228.30 in costs (“the Judgment”). The Judgment Creditor applied <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>for, and obtained the registration of the Judgment in Singapore under the RECJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Judgment Debtor filed an application to set aside the registration of the Judgment pursuant to s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA. This was dismissed by the learned Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) who heard the application. The Judgment Debtor’s appeal against the AR’s decision was heard before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The following facts were undisputed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The debt underlying the Judgment was incurred pursuant to a cheque cashing facility (“CCF”), whereby the Judgment Creditor handed over a cheque drawn in favour of the Casino in exchange for chips for the purpose of gambling at the Casino. Chips lost by the Judgment Debtor at the gambling tables would have to be made good by the Judgment Debtor. The cheque could be redeemed by the Judgment Debtor within a specified period by way of cash, gambling chips, bank draft or electronic fund transfer. If the cheque was not redeemed within the specified period, the Casino would present the cheque for payment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Judgment Debtor was an experienced patron of gambling establishments, including casinos operated by the Judgment Creditor. Specifically, the Judgment Debtor used the Casino’s CCF twice in January 2018. He had also used the CCF in the Judgment Creditor’s casino in Sydney, Australia on 14 occasions from April 2010 to January 2018. Over this period, the Judgment Debtor had exchanged gambling chips worth a total of A$ 37,871,835.01 in these two casinos. According to a report produced by Central Credit, LLC, a worldwide credit reporting agency specialising in casino operations, the Judgment Debtor had patronized no less than 15 casinos worldwide from 2006 to 2018.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Gambling by the Judgment Debtor at the Casino was not against public policy in Australia. The debt underlying the Judgment was thus valid under the express choice of law of Queensland, Australia, which governed the CCF. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Judgment Debtor’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Section 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA provides that a foreign judgment shall not be registered if: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the judgment was in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy or for some other similar reason could not have been entertained by the registering court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Judgment Debtor submitted that, as the Judgment was for recovery of gambling debts, it was a judgment in respect of a cause of action which, for reasons of public policy, could not have been entertained by a Singapore court. This was because s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No action shall be brought or maintained in the court for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager or which has been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager has been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 It is settled law that, pursuant to s 5(2) of the CLA, claims for gambling debts could not be entertained by Singapore courts even if such debts were incurred pursuant to gambling activities overseas and wagering contracts governed by foreign law – see <span class="font-italic">Star Cruise Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 183, <span class="font-italic">Star City Pty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">formerly known as Sydney Harbour Casino Pty Ltd</span>)<span class="font-italic"> v Tan Hong Woon </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 306 and <span class="font-italic">Star Entertainment QLD Ltd v Wong Yew Choy</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter </span>[2020] 5 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Star Entertainment</span>”). Therefore, the combined effect of s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of RECJA and s 5(2) of CLA was that, where the underlying debt was a gambling debt caught by s 5(2) of the CLA, a foreign judgment in respect of such a debt could not be registered under RECJA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The difficulty with the Judgment Debtor’s submission was that this specific submission had already been previously considered and rejected by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Burswood</span><span class="font-italic"> Nominees</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>similarly involved the registration of an Australian judgment for gambling debts under the RECJA. In fact, like the present case, the underlying debt giving rise to the Australian judgment in <span class="font-italic">Burswood</span><span class="font-italic"> Nominees </span>was also a debt incurred pursuant to an Australian casino’s CCF (at [3]). The court held that, although the debt arising from the CCF took the form of a loan, it was in substance a claim for money won upon a wager, which would have been caught by s 5(2) of the CLA if the claim had been brought in a Singapore court in the first instance (at [21]–[22]). However, the court went on to hold that, while s 5(2) of the CLA elucidates Singapore’s domestic public policy, s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA requires a higher threshold of public policy to be met in order for the registration of a foreign judgment to be refused (at [24]). The meeting of this higher threshold of public policy, described by the court as “international” public policy, involves asking whether the domestic public policy in question was so important as to form part of the core of essential principles of justice and morality shared by all nations (at [42]). The court held that the domestic public policy encapsulated in s 5(2) of CLA did not meet this higher threshold (at [42]–[46]). It therefore declined to set aside the registration of the Australian judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As already noted (at [1] above), the correctness of <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>was doubted by a subsequent Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Desert </span><span class="font-italic">Palace.</span> The relevant passages from <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">113 <span class="font-italic">Ex hypothesi</span>, the statutory public policy expressed in s 5(2) of the CLA is superior to what may be called the “higher” international public policy at common law, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “higher standard of public policy in operation when a forum court is faced with a foreign judgment” (see <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>… at [32]). This is because the higher international public policy is only common law public policy. The position would be different if the court’s refusal to enforce a foreign gambling debt, in whatever form or guise that debt takes (including the debt as converted into a foreign judgment), is based on domestic public policy that has no basis in statute; in such circumstances, the court would be entitled to prefer the higher international common law public policy to its domestic common law public policy. But, this is not the case where s 5(2) of the CLA is concerned. In a contest between the higher international public policy at <span class="font-italic">common law </span>and <span class="font-italic">statutory </span>public policy, the latter <span class="font-italic">must </span>prevail. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">114 Turning to s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA, this court held in <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>(at [41]) that “Liao would have to surmount [a] higher public policy threshold in order to prevail upon [the court] to refuse registration of the [WA] [J]udgment on grounds of public policy”. In our view, there is no legal basis for reading this requirement into s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>). This provision expressly states that a Commonwealth judgment shall not be registered if “<span class="font-italic">the judgment was in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy </span>or for some other similar reason <span class="font-italic">could not have been entertained by the registering court</span>” [emphasis added]. These words are absolutely clear. The public policy referred to in s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA is the public policy of Singapore, whether it be our common law public policy or our statutory public policy. Section 5(2) of the CLA expresses the public policy which precludes the enforcement of any cause of action based on a gambling debt. In <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees</span>, the cause of action on which the WA Judgment was based was a gambling debt. No doubt, the gambling debt in question was a valid debt, but s 5(2) of the CLA applies to all gambling debts. Accordingly, the court should have accepted Liao’s argument that the WA Judgment could not be registered under s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA on the ground that that judgment was based on a cause of action which could not, by virtue of the public policy encapsulated in s 5(2) of the CLA, be maintained in Singapore. In our view, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>is, with respect, unsound and should be reviewed if a similar issue were to come before this court in the future. We might add that, in his commentary on <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>in “Statute and Public Policy in Private International Law [: Gambling Contracts and Foreign Judgments]” [(2005) 9 SYBIL 133], Prof Yeo Tiong Min was of the view (at 140–146) that the decision was not defensible in the light of the express words of s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Thus, the <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>court considered that, in a contest between <span class="font-italic">statutory</span> public policy as encapsulated in s 5(2) of the CLA and the higher international public policy <span class="font-italic">at</span> <span class="font-italic">common law</span>, the statutory public policy must prevail. Arising from this, the <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>court observed that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the <span class="font-italic">Burswood</span><span class="font-italic"> Nominees </span>decision was “unsound”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there was “no legal basis” for the<span class="font-italic"> Burswood </span><span class="font-italic">Nominees </span>court to read the requirement of a higher public policy threshold into s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA. The words of the provision were absolutely clear that a judgment cannot be registered where it was in respect of a cause of action which would have contravened the public policy of Singapore; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the <span class="font-italic">Burswood</span><span class="font-italic"> Nominees </span>court should have accepted the judgment debtor’s argument that the Australian judgment could not be registered under s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the RECJA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Had I felt bound by, or at liberty to follow the passages from <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>quoted above, I would have been inclined to allow the appeal and set aside the registration of the Judgment. However, <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>concerned the enforcement of a foreign judgment at common law and not the registration of a foreign judgment under the RECJA. Consequently, the statements made in <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>on the correctness of <span class="font-italic">Burswood</span><span class="font-italic"> Nominees </span>were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. In this regard, I note that the court in <span class="font-italic">Star Entertainment </span>had similarly taken the view that the comments made in <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>regarding <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>were <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>(at [48]). This means that <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>remained binding on me. In fact, by saying that <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>“should be reviewed if a similar issue were to come before this court in the future” (at [114]), the <span class="font-italic">Desert Palace </span>court made clear that it merely disapproved of, but did not overrule <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees</span>. Thus, any departure from the actual ruling in <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees</span> was left to a future Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 For the reasons given above, I held that <span class="font-italic">Burswood Nominees </span>remained binding on me.
