The Husband appealed against my decision on 17 October 2017 on the division of matrimonial assets. The two adult sons of the marriage, now studying in a university in the USA, appealed against my decision dismissing their applications for the Wife (their mother) to contribute towards their maintenance.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Husband and Wife married on 17 December 1990. The Husband, then 27 years old, was a student studying for his Masters degree in a university in the USA, whilst the Wife, then 34 years old, was a teacher in a Singapore school. Shortly after they married, the Wife took no-pay leave to accompany the Husband to the USA from January 1991 until December 1992. Parties returned to Singapore in January 1993, before the Husband could complete his studies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The parties have two children. Their older son was born in the USA at the end of 1991. Their younger son was born in Singapore in early 1994. On 3 June 2009, the Wife left the matrimonial home. The two sons, then aged 18 and 15 years respectively, remained with the Husband in the matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Husband filed for divorce on 17 August 2009 on the basis of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour; <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, improper association. The Wife counterclaimed on the basis of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour; <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, several acts of family violence during marriage.  Both said that there were many quarrels and no peace between them. Interim judgment, uncontested, was granted on 21 November 2011 on each party’s claim. This was almost 27 months after commencement of divorce proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 This was a marriage of about 21 years up to date of Interim Judgment on 21 November 2011.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The ancillary matters were first heard on 18 December 2015. The matter was prolonged when, in May 2016, the Wife sought, at an advanced stage of the proceedings, to introduce further evidence to counter the allegations made by the Husband that the Wife had misappropriated monies from their bank accounts. On 17 October 2017, I gave my orders in relation to the parties’ ancillary matters as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Division of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The matrimonial assets valued at $5,809,359.49 are to be divided equally between parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. [The Husband] is to inform [the Wife] or her solicitors in writing within 6 weeks of the date of this order, if he wishes to take over [the Wife’s] estate title and interest in the [matrimonial home], by paying her 38.67% of the value. The valuation is to be done by a joint valuer. Parties are to appoint the valuer within 3 weeks from the time, [the Husband] elects to take over the property. Completion of the transfer to [the Husband] is to be effected by [the Husband] paying [the Wife] a sum equivalent to 38.67% of the value of the property within 3 months of the valuation report. The costs and expenses of the valuation and transfer are to be borne by [the Husband].

The net sales proceeds (net of valuation costs and the costs and expenses of sale) are to be divided 61.33:38.67 ([Husband]:[Wife]) between parties.

Although parties agreed on most of the assets in the pool of matrimonial assets, they disputed the inclusion and/or valuation of certain assets and liabilities. The Wife has not appealed. As such, I cover in brief my exclusion of the Husband’s assets from the pool and findings on the value of his assets as well as the inclusion of the Wife’s assets and their values in the matrimonial pool. My reasons were given in my oral grounds of 17 October 2017 recorded in the notes of evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The value of the Husband’s shares in Cadence Technologies Pte Ltd</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Husband was the sole owner and director of his own company, which was in the business of trading in electronic components (“the Company”). The Company had a paid-up capital of $1.2m with 1.2m shares at $1 par value. I rejected the Wife’s contention that the value of the Company was $1.2m, equivalent to its paid up capital. As the Company was essentially a trading company without substantive assets, and the Company’s financial statements as at 30 September 2014 showed a net deficit of $442,163

</div>  I had, in my oral grounds of judgment issued on 17 October 2017, mistakenly thought that the $158,905.84 included an amount of $114,500 alleged to have been taken from the sons’ trust accounts, thereby further reducing this sum to $44,405.84. However, that was not so, and the figure therefore remains at $158,905.84.    Even so, this lower figure of $158,905.84 is a reduction of more than half a million dollars from the first figure of $687,866.84.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 These alleged misappropriations by the Wife arose from payments that occurred in the early years of the marriage. It is not disputed that the Husband had given the Wife a free hand to manage the monies in the joint account (POSB/DBS Account ending with 24-4), his sole name account (POSB Account ending with 88-4) and the children’s trust accounts (the older son’s POSB Account ending with 41-1 and the younger son’s POSB Account ending with 73-1) and that she had been the person handling the payment of the family bills and expenses. The Wife provided various explanations in response to the Husband’s allegations listed in the Misappropriation Table filed on 12 May 2016. According to her, many of the withdrawals were made either for the family’s or the Husband’s expenses. Some of the withdrawals were reimbursements of monies paid upfront by her on behalf of the family. Given that many of these transactions had occurred a long time ago, and that the Husband had chosen to let the Wife manage the family’s financial affairs over a prolonged period of time before she moved out in June 2009, it does not lie in his mouth to now claim that it is for the Wife, alone, to account for the use of these “misappropriated” funds. In the premises, I found that the Husband had not proved his allegation that the Wife had misappropriated the sum of $158,095.84.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As for the Husband’s claims that the Wife had misappropriated $114,500 from the two sons’ trust accounts, parties had earlier agreed that monies in these trust accounts were not matrimonial assets. The Wife claimed that she had, on the Husband’s instructions and to pay for some of the Husband’s purchases, transferred monies from the sons’ trust accounts. Both sons are now above 21 years of age. As such, I found that any issues relating to these trust account monies were not matters ancillary to or arising from the divorce of the parties. It was not for this court to deal with this matter or decide that the Wife had misappropriated the monies in the sons’ trust accounts, without a proper application and hearing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Based on my findings above, I found the net value of the matrimonial assets to be worth S$5,809,359.49, comprising the following assets (the assets in dispute on appeal are highlighted in the table below):</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">S/N</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Asset Description</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court’s value (S$)</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remarks</span></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Parties’ Joint Assets </span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">1. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Matrimonial home </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">3,800,000</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Agreed</div></td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(253,233,217)"><div class="txt-body text-left">2. </div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(253,233,217)"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Collection of luxury watches</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">(as at 31 December 2011) </div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(253,233,217)"><div class="txt-body text-right">750,000</div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(253,233,217)"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Agreed.

</div> The Wife’s position was that this was a gift to both parties. The matrimonial home was purchased in mid-1992. By then, the parties had just started a family, with the older son being born in late 1991. The family returned to Singapore in January 1993. At the time, the parties were not financially able to make the payments themselves. This was acknowledged by the Husband in his 2nd affidavit (at [10(b)(ii)]). The Husband had, in his 1st affidavit, initially claimed that he paid for the renovation expenses, although some of the documents produced in his 1st affidavit (pp 63–73) bore his father’s name. The Husband, in his 2nd affidavit, then changed his position, saying that the renovation monies were a loan to him.

The exhibits of the bank statements (pp 511 to 522) showed amounts deducted for the home loan, denoted “HLN.” The Wife disputed this, stating that she had not been given leave to respond to this allegation on affidavit since the Husband had only raised this allegation in his 3rd affidavit.

</div>
</div> The Wife, in essence, stated in the Joint Summary, that she had transferred monies from her personal account into the joint account on several occasions to ensure that cheques issued from the joint account to pay for the watches would not bounce. The total known transfers from her personal account for which she had not been reimbursed was at least $51,050, which should be attributed as her direct financial contribution. The exact amount, however, could not be conclusively ascertained because some of the bank statements were consolidated (as a result of the bank books not being updated periodically).

Although the Wife had taken no-pay leave from teaching to join the Husband in the USA from 1991 to 1992, I found that this was a conscious choice on her part as she was then a mature 34-year-old who wished to join him when he was studying in the USA. I would not regard this as a career sacrifice on her part. He was then already a student and she knew that he would be returning to the USA for his studies. Parties differed on their account on this, with the Husband claiming that he had not asked the Wife to join him, and that she had insisted on going to the USA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Parties’ indirect financial contribution was hotly disputed and each party had differing accounts. Based on a review of the movement of funds in parties’ joint account and other accounts, I found that the Husband was, by far, the larger contributor to the parties’ joint account. As for the issue of indirect non-financial contribution, the Wife would have been the main caregiver of the sons in the earlier years of their lives. She was on no-pay leave in the USA when the older son was born in late 1991 and had again taken no-pay leave for a time to take care of the younger son, after birth. They had full time domestic help from the mid-1990s. The Wife was also the main person entrusted with handling and managing the household expenses including payment for all their purchases. I accept the Wife’s claims that she had also assisted the Husband in setting up his Company and in some of the business operations. I noted that the Wife claimed that after she left the matrimonial home in June 2009, the sons, who were then 18 and 15 years old, had cut her out of their lives. Bearing in mind the Husband’s amended Statement of Particulars and the Wife’s amended counterclaim in the divorce, both of which were accepted by the other, this could have been a trying marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 After considering the totality of the circumstances, I decided, in the round, on an indirect contribution of 60:40 in favour of the Wife. I did so notwithstanding my finding that there were serious credibility issues with the Wife’s accounts in her affidavits. However, I noted that much of that related to matters after 2009, when she moved out of the matrimonial home. I do not cover those matters here as they were covered in my oral grounds as recorded in the notes of evidence of 17 October 2017.

This intention had been formed in happier times, when the family was largely intact. The Husband in his 1st affidavit filed on 5 July 2012 (at [24]) had stated that he would maintain the sons solely, including seeing them through college. He also asserted that he wanted the Wife to fully account for all monies she had taken from the bank accounts. There was no change in this stated position in the Husband’s 2nd affidavit filed on 2 December 2013. It was only in the Husband’s 3rd affidavit filed on 27 October 2015 that he said that he wanted the Wife to contribute to half of the sons’ education costs and expenses.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Husband’s 3rd Affidavit dated 27 October 2015 at para 416.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> He had changed his mind when he found out that the Wife had been “looting” their joint account. He claimed that the Wife had “looted” $687,866.84. As I had previously stated (see [24] above), the Husband, after clarification from the Wife, reduced the figure by more than half a million dollars to $158,905.84. The other event referred to by the Husband in his 3rd affidavit as leading to his wanting the Wife to contribute to the sons’ maintenance was that he no longer received dividends from his father’s company as it was liquidated in 2007. This was an event long past that the Husband would have already known of when he made his 1st and 2nd affidavits in 2012 and 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 That the Husband did not change his position on his paying wholly for the sons’ maintenance until late 2015 suggests that he remained of the view that he had the means to pay for the sons’ education in the USA. The case history also showed that the Husband’s father was generous and willing to help out with family expenses. The Husband had himself, in his 2nd affidavit, said that it was no secret that his father was financially well off and successful in business. I make clear that my observation on this point does not detract in any way from the obligation of the Husband and Wife to maintain their sons until they complete their first university degree. It is clear that the Husband’s father is not legally obliged to maintain the parties’ sons. I noted that the Husband, pending my final decision, was still paying wholly for the sons’ overseas university expenses, including the costs of purchasing and running a car for each son although they are both attending the same university, albeit taking different courses and living off-campus. The Husband could also afford to take a $204,000 loan in January 2015 to buy a new BMW “7 Series” car.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It was not disputed that the Wife was not consulted or kept informed by the Husband or the sons on their university choice or the costs and had first found out about these matters during the divorce ancillary matters proceedings. The Wife had been estranged from her sons since she left the family home in early June 2009 when they were 18 and 15 years old. The sons did not want any interaction with her. Whilst the Wife attributed this to the Husband’s doing, I was of the view that Wife’s relationship problems with her sons were largely of her own doing. As I had stated earlier (see [47] above), issues relating to the Wife’s credibility were dealt with and recorded in the notes of evidence for the 17 October 2017 hearing. One particularly contentious point was that the older son was particularly aggrieved at his mother’s having re-directed his mail, leading to problems with his national service enlistment and him having to elect his country of citizenship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Wife is seven years older than the Husband and was now 61 years old compared to the Husband’s age of 54 years. Of the two, the Husband was, in light of his overall situation, better able to maintain and pay for the sons’ education. The facts do not show any significant change in his circumstances since 2012 and 2013, when his first two affidavits were made. Based on my consideration of the entirety of the circumstances of the case and in assessing each party’s relative means and/or access to funds going forward, I dismissed the MSS applications by the sons for the Wife to contribute towards their maintenance as they complete their university studies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For these reasons, I made the orders as aforementioned. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Foo Tuat Yien <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Hur Yuin (Wee Swee Teow LLP) for the plaintiff in DT 4096 of 2009 and the applicants in MSS 2792 and 2793 of 2016;<br/>Koh Tien Hua and Yoon Min Joo (<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Eversheds Harry Elias LLP</span>) for the defendant in DT 4096 of 2009 and the respondent in MSS 2792 and 2793 of 2016.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
