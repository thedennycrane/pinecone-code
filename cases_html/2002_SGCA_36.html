<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1

         I have perused the judgment of the

majority delivered by the learned Chief Justice. The facts of the case are clearly set out

therein and I do not propose to restate them. While I entirely agree with the first part

of the judgment where it held that the positive and negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i>

principle is an established common law principle, I have to, with the utmost respect,

differ from my learned brothers where they proceeded to find that in the scheme of things

under our Land Acquisition Act (the Act), the negative principle of <i>Pointe Gourde</i>

can have no application. The effect of the positive and negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i>

principle is that any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the acquired property

that results from the scheme leading to the acquisition is to be ignored for the purpose

of assessing the value of the property.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

         The provisions of the Act which are

relevant to the case have been set out in the judgment of the majority. All I wish to do

in this judgment is to set out my reasons why I find myself unable to take the approach

which they have adopted.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

         For this purpose, it is necessary for me

to set out the grounds upon which my learned brothers have held that the negative <i>Pointe

Gourde</i> principle can have no application under the Act. First, they say that some

provisions in the Act clearly conflict with the application of that principle, referring

to s 33(1)(b) and s 33(5)(e). Second, relying on s 33(1) which provides that "in

determining the amount of compensation to be awarded … the Board shall … take

into consideration the following matters <i>and no others</i>", they say that the

phrases "<i>and no others</i>" excludes the application of the negative <i>Pointe

Gourde</i> principle. It would be noted that both grounds concern s 33.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Section 33</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

         I shall deal with the two grounds in the

same order. Section 33(1)(b) states that in determining the compensation payable,

"any increase in the value of any other land of the person interested likely to

accrue from the use of which the land acquired will be put" shall be taken into

account. This provision overrides the decision in <i>South Eastern Rly Co v London County

Council</i> [1915] 2 Ch 252 which held that the effect of the scheme on an adjoining

property should be ignored when calculating the compensation for the acquired property. So

<i>South Eastern Rly</i> would no longer apply. But I do not think anything more can or

should be read into that.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

         In a sense, it can be argued that s

33(1)(b) strengthens the reverse argument: if Parliament had intended to do away with the

negative principle of <i>Pointe Gourde,</i> it would have done so more clearly as it did

in s 33(1)(b) in overriding <i>South Eastern Rly</i>, rather than leaving it to

implications. In this regard, the second reading speech made by the then Minister for Law

and National Development, Mr E W Barker, in Parliament when explaining the Land

Acquisition Bill, 1966, which was intended to consolidate the law, is germane:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) the assessment of

    compensation provisions have been re-drafted on the basis of two principles enunciated by

    the Prime Minister in December 1963. Firstly, <u>that no landowner should benefit from

    development which has taken place at public expense and, secondly, that the price paid on

    acquisition of land for public purposes should not be higher than what the land would have

    been worth had the Government not carried out development generally in the area,</u> and

    (2) provision has been made for the hearing of appeals by an Appeals Board instead of the

    Court as at present.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

         As regards s 33(5)(e), this provision in

summary states that in determining market value no account shall be taken of the potential

value of the land for any other more intensive use other than the purpose designated in

the Development Baseline (previously the Master Plan). As far as I can see, s 33(5)(e) has

nothing to do with either the positive or negative principle of <i>Pointe Gourde. </i>This

is borne out by the second reading speech of Mr Barker made on 18 December 1973 when

explaining the object behind s 33(5)(e):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This will obviate the argument

    that is sometimes made where land has been zoned for a restrictive use, as for example,

    "public open space", that the land has got considerable potential for

    development for residential or other purposes. In future, such arguments based on the

    hypothetical consideration that a future change of zoning or use will be granted by the

    Planning Department will not be taken into consideration in determining the compensation

    payable upon acquisition. Thus, land zoned "Agriculture", "Rural",

    "Green Belt" or "Unclassified" at the time of acquisition, will be

    valued as such.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

         Finally, as regards the phrase "<i>and

no others</i>" in s 33(1) it is true that the phrase was first introduced into the

Land Acquisition Ordinance in 1932. The then Acting Commissioner of Lands, Mr WS Ebden,

when speaking in the Legislative Council, made it clear that the phrase was inserted to

limit the heads of compensation to only those enumerated in s 25 of the then Ordinance. Mr

Ebden himself thought that even without the phrase, s 25 was clear enough and that owners

whose lands had been acquired could only claim under those heads enumerated in s 25. But

his predecessor had thought, in the light of a decision then, that what was listed in s 25

were merely guides and were not exhaustive and that an award could be given in respect of

a matter which did not fall under any of those heads. So the phrase was inserted to remove

any conceivable doubt.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

         At this moment, and for a better

appreciation of the issue, it may be expedient if I set out the heads enumerated under the

present s 33(1):-</font>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9        In

relation to the present case, heads (b) to (f) are not pertinent. Only head (a), which

relates to how the market value is to be determined, is relevant. Under this head, the

lowest of the market values on three different dates, namely, 1 January 1995, (the

acquisition being after 27 September 1995), the date of publication of s 3(1) notification

(in this case there was no such s 3(1) notification) and the date of publication of s 5

declaration, shall be taken to be the market value. This head really sets the valuation

date and has nothing to do with the increase or decrease in value which is due to the

scheme underlying the acquisition. It is common ground between the parties that in this

case the applicable date is the date on which the s 5 declaration was published, the

market being lowest at that point. So the market value on that date is determinative. It

is vitally important to note that the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle relates to the

determination of the market value and it does not add a new head of claim. In my view,

there is nothing in head (a) nor in heads (b) to (f), which necessarily suggests that the <i>Pointe

Gourde</i> principle should be disregarded in determining the market value of the acquired

land.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10        If

it were correct to hold that by virtue of the phrase "<i>and no others</i>" in s

33(1), the negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle is excluded, then it should also be

wholly unnecessary to provide in s 34(e) that the Board shall not take into consideration

"any increase to the value of the land acquired likely to accrue from the use to

which it will be put when acquired", this being the positive principle of <i>Pointe

Gourde</i>. Why is there a need to have s 34(e) when such a claim or argument would not

have been possible? Indeed, the enactment of s 34(e), which really relates to the

determination of the market value, is inconsistent with the argument placed on the words

"<i>and no others</i>" by the Collector of Land Revenue.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Presumption against implied

alteration</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11        In

this connection, it is vitally important to bear in mind another settled principle of

interpretation of statutes. The principle is that the court should not construe a

statutory provision to have modified or altered a common law principle or right unless

Parliament has by express words, or necessary implications, done so. Lord Reid said in <i>Black-Clawson

International Limited v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG</i> [1975] AC 591 at 614:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is a presumption which can

    be stated in various ways. One is that in the absence of any clear indication to the

    contrary Parliament can be presumed not to have altered the common law further than was

    necessary to remedy the "mischief"</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12        In <i>National

Assistance Board v Wilkinson</i> [1952] 2QB 648, Lord Devlin said (at p.661):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"It is a well-established

    principle of construction that a statute is not to be taken as effecting a fundamental

    alteration in the general law unless it uses words that point unmistakeably to that

    conclusion."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13        In <i>Murugiah

v Jainudeen</i> [1955] AC 14 the Privy Council, on an appeal from Ceylon, approved the

following passage found in <i>Maxwell’s Interpretation of Statute (10<sup>th</sup>

Edn at p.81)</i>:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Presumption against

    implicit alteration of law: One of these presumptions is that the legislature does not

    intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares,

    either in express terms or by clear implications, or, in other words, beyond the immediate

    scope and object of the statute. In all general matters outside those limits the law

    remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would

    overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or departs from the general system of

    law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14        A

very useful summary of the principles on the interpretation of statutes is set out in <i>Bennion

on Statutory Interpretation (3<sup>rd</sup> Edn)</i> at p.626. I should add that the

author was a former British Parliamentary Counsel:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) It is a principle of legal

    policy that law should be altered deliberately rather than casually, and that Parliament

    should not change either common law or statute law by a sidewind, but only by measured and

    considered provisions. In the case of common law or Acts embodying common law, the

    principle is somewhat stronger than in other cases. It is also stronger the more

    fundamental the change is.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) The court, when considering,

    in relation to the facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the

    enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume that the

    legislator intended to observe the principle. The court should therefore strive to avoid

    adopting a construction which involves accepting that Parliament contravened the

    principle.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15        The

fact that Parliament had incorporated the positive principle of <i>Pointe Gourde</i> into

s 34(e) does not necessarily mean that it had discarded the negative principle. It simply

does not follow. In their judgment, my learned brothers accepted this. In fact, it could

be argued that this fact reinforces the reverse argument: if Parliament intended to do

away with the negative principle, it would have easily said so. When it does not say so,

it must be inferred that Parliament had no such intention.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16        In

this context, the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Melwood Units v Commissioner of Main

Roads</i> [1978] WLR 520, a case on appeal from New South Wales, is on point. There, the

Privy Council held that statutory enactment of only the positive <i>Pointe Gourde</i>

principle did not imply that its converse principle was intended to be omitted. Lord

Russell said (at 526):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In their Lordships opinion it is

    a part of the common law deriving as a matter of principle from the nature of compensation

    for resumption or compulsory acquisition, that neither relevantly attributable

    appreciation nor depreciation in value is to be regarded in the assessment of land

    compensation. The relevant New South Wales section merely reflects the law … and the

    absence of the reverse of the medal in the relevant section of the Queensland Main Roads

    Acts is not to be taken as altering the law."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17        The

consequences of holding that the negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle can have no place

under our Act could be very severe. It could lead to the acquired property being

compensated perhaps even nominally. Let me explain. As is often the case, a public scheme

is announced before the lands affected are actually acquired. It could be six months, or a

year or two before the acquisition. It could even be very much longer, as in the present

case. Following the announcement, say for a new MRT station, if the land is affected

totally, it is unlikely that thereafter there will be buyers for that land. If the

negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle is held not to be applicable, no one would

thereafter touch it. In the past, perhaps some people might buy on speculation, expecting

a near full compensation. With the instant ruling, the land may become totally unsaleable.

Conceivably, the land could, as a result, have no significant market value at the time of

acquisition. Any sale of another property around that area, which is not affected by the

scheme, would hardly be an appropriate comparable. Such a consequence is indeed grave.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18        Even

in a situation where only part of a land is acquired, the adverse consequence of the

ruling will also be felt, although the extent of its effect would be less clear cut. It is

common knowledge that, hitherto, whenever a public scheme affects a private property, be

it a road line or any other public project, the value of the property will invariably be

adversely affected. The extent of such adverse effect would necessarily depend on the

circumstances. It is probably true to say that if the scheme was a road line, its negative

effect on the price of the property would be less, as there was usually a belief that the

road widening might not take place for some years to come and that when acquisition should

occur there would be compensation. So a buyer of a property of 10,000 square feet,

affected by a road line say to the extent of 2,000 square feet, would naturally tell the

owner that he really had only 8,000 square feet to sell. But the owner would be able to

retort that if that part were eventually acquired, the buyer would be compensated. But

with this ruling, I am not sure an owner can truly tell a buyer that he would be

adequately compensated for the part which would be acquired. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19        All

these discussions may appear somewhat theoretical. But when one looks at the figures

thrown about (e.g., $488,000/$285,000 or $406,000/$240,000) in relation to the case which

give rise to the present Case Stated, the problems are real. They indicated a drop of some

40%. This was under the current position before this Case Stated where the seller and

buyer were unaware as to how the negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle was to be

applied, but with the buyer thinking he would be compensated in the usual way. It must

follow that if the negative <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle were now held to be

inapplicable, the consequential fall in value will be even more severe.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20        I

would hasten to add that I recognise, as pointed out by State Counsel for the Collector,

that if we were to apply in general the negative principle of <i>Pointe Gourde</i>, it

could lead to an owner, who has purchased a property at a depressed price from a desperate

seller during the interim period between the announcement of the scheme and the actual

acquisition, getting a windfall. This aberration cannot and should not be a good enough

reason to deny other owners their just due. With respect, the reasoning is <i>non sequitur</i>.

If this sort of aberrations should give rise to concern, the solution lies in further fine

tuning the law by legislative intervention. </font></p>

conscious that the Act is a piece of social legislation for the good of society as a

whole. Public interest stands paramount. No one should stand in the way of the progressive

development of the country: thus the need for an acquisition law. For some property

owners, it is not just a question of price. They simply would not want to move, no matter

how attractive the offer. We have read in the media where some owners even refused an en

bloc sale where they could have reaped significant benefits. While it is understandable

that they may have sentimental attachment to the place, such sentiments should never be

allowed to stand in the way of progress and public interest. While the Act has set out the

perimeters (under ss 33 and 34) as to how the compensation of an acquired property is to

be assessed, some of which are obviously geared towards giving something less than the

current market value to the owner (like s 33(1)(a) – the lowest value based on three

different dates), it is highly doubtful that Parliament intended the owner to bear the

brunt of the sacrifices which would be the case if the negative principle is not applied.

Here, I think Mr Barker’s speech in 1966, which is quoted in 4 above, should be

placed foremost in mind.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22        It

would be noted that the emphasis by Mr Barker was on landowners benefitting, and to make

sure they would not. That was the cardinal object. But it is altogether another thing to

expect an owner to lose his property as well as to suffer very substantial loss in terms

of compensation. It would be a heavy burden to place only on the owner, instead of

spreading the burden among taxpayers.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23        I

would further add that Mr Barker reiterated the same objective in his third reading speech

of the 1966 Bill, after it was examined by the Select Committee, when he said the

following:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As has already been explained in

    this House previously, <u>the principle underlining this provision is that no landowner

    should benefit at the public’s expense, from any windfall gains resulting from

    enhancement of land values either through Acts of God or because of public expenditure in

    the neighbourhood</u>. Members are aware of the phenomenal increases in land values which

    result when heavily encumbered lands are devastated by fire. This fortuitous increase in

    value will not now go to the landowner. Again, development by Government and public

    authorities in areas like Jurong, Kallang Basin and Kranji has resulted in phenomenal

    increases in land values in these neighbourhoods. It was ironical that under the existing

    legislation, when additional lands in these areas had to be acquired for public purposes,

    Government had to pay compensation at values which Government itself had helped to

    enhance. The element of enhancement attributable in these cases to public participation

    (as opposed to participation by the private sector), is the element which under the new

    Bill will be creamed off when land is acquired for public purposes. (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24        All

said, even with the application of the negative principle and the owner gets compensation

near to the market value, it would not help him do more than to acquire something

equivalent elsewhere in the open market. There will not be any gain or benefit of the sort

which the Minister for Law and National Development said the statutory scheme under the

Act was intended to prevent the owner from obtaining. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25        It

seems to me critical to bear in mind that what is encapsulated in the positive and

negative principle of <i>Pointe Gourde</i> is really fairness. A landowner should not

benefit from the proposed scheme leading to the acquisition; but neither should he be

penalised on that account. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26        

There is a previous case where the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle was raised in argument

– <i>Chew Ming Teck v Collector of Land Revenue and anor</i> [1988] SLR 118. It was a

decision of this Court. In that case, it was argued that no account should be taken of the

fact that planning permission for redevelopment by the owner was refused due to a public

scheme. This Court seemed to have accepted that the <i>Pointe Gourde</i> principle

applied, although it was true that the respondents there agreed with the appellant’s

argument that the land must be valued for compensation leaving out of account any effect

on value, either up or down, of the acquisition itself or the scheme underlying it. But,

on the facts, the Court held that when the Collector awarded the appellant a nominal sum

of $1/- he did not allow the refusal of the planning permission to the appellant to

influence his valuation, either up or down, as the interest which the appellant had in the

land was only a building sublease under which, upon the completion of the new buildings,

the owners of the land would grant to the appellant a lease of 30 years with two options

of 30 years each. All I would observe is that the Collector in the present case is taking

a stand different from that he had taken in <i>Chew Ming Teck </i>as far as the negative <i>Pointe

Gourde</i> principle is concerned.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Conclusion</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27        In

conclusion, it is my opinion that there is nothing in the Act which necessarily suggests

that the negative principle has no place under our statutory scheme of compensation.

Parliament wanted to modify the ruling in <i>South Eastern Rly Co,</i> so there is s

33(1)(b). Similarly, Parliament expressly incorporated the positive principle of <i>Pointe

Gourde </i>in s 34(e) in order to make it clear beyond doubt that that principle applies.

So it cannot be said that Parliament was not aware of the negative principle. In any case,

as mentioned before, the fact that there is no express reference to the negative principle

does not mean that the negative principle is thereby impliedly abrogated. Bearing in mind

the ministerial speeches made in Parliament as to the objects of ss 33 and 34 of the Act,

I am humbly of the view that it was not the intention of Parliament that a common law

principle such as this, which concerns rights of property owners, should be done away with

by a sidewind. Otherwise, Parliament would have said so as expressly as they did in s

33(1)(b) in relation to the rule enunciated in <i>South Eastern Rly Co</i>. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28        I

deeply regret that I am unable, in this instance, to come to the same views as my learned

brothers, whose opinions I have always held in the highest regard.</font></p>
