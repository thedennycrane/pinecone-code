<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        The defendants are the

owners of the vessel MV Zubaran that they had chartered to an Indonesian party called

Menaras. The Zubaran was carrying a cargo of timber in respect of which the defendants had

issued a total of nine "freight to collect" bills of lading. They were obliged

to issue "freight prepaid" bills (the switch bills) in exchange for the

originally issued bills when freight has been paid. The plaintiffs had purchased the cargo

and re-sold it to a customer in India. When the defendants refused to issue the switch

bills, the plaintiffs sued in this action and on 5 November 2002, in an interlocutory

application, obtained an order from JC Woo Bih Li for mandatory injunction requiring the

defendants to issue the switch bills to them. Against this order the defendants intend to

appeal and applied by this summons for a stay of execution.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        Before me, Mr. Joseph Tan

made several points in which he says are the substance of the defendants' grounds of

appeal. First, he says that there was no privity of contract between the plaintiffs and

themselves and that the plaintiffs were therefore not the proper party to sue. Secondly,

Mr. Tan submitted that the plaintiffs' counsel, Mr. Srivathsan, had wrongly relied on the

UK Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 when they argued the injunction application

before JC Woo. Counsel submitted that he had filed affidavit evidence from London counsel

to the effect that the said Act had no application on the facts of this case. The

plaintiffs, he says, on the other hand, had not filed any affidavit to contradict that.

Thirdly, Mr. Tan says that the plaintiffs wrongly suggested that an independent contract

was created by the exchange of correspondence between them and the defendants. That could

not be the case since the plaintiffs paid freight as agents for the charterers. Payment of

freight was an existing obligation of the charterers and therefore no fresh consideration

can be said to have been given in exchange for the promise to issue the switch bills.

Finally, Mr. Tan submitted that freight was already due in any event and had to be paid,

implying that the payment of freight cannot be a fresh consideration.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        It was not disputed that

the plaintiffs had made payment of US$258, 341 as freight charges on 21 October 2002. The

defendants however, assert that a sum of US$187,930 in demurrage is due to them from the

charterers. Mr. Srivathsan drew my attention to the terms of the charterparty which were

set out in the fixture note at p.13 of the affidavit of Vyas Rajendra Kumar, the

plaintiffs' Commercial Executive. In particular counsel pointed out the following term

which in effect states that the defendants were bound to issue the "freight

prepaid" bills against a Letter of Indemnity from their local agent:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Owners to appoint a Singapore agent (free of charge to [the

    plaintiffs] to issue a second set "freight prepaid" BOL against LOI as per

    owners' format which [is] to be signed by their authorised signatory." Furthermore,

    Mr. Srivathsan argued that by the following clause the defendants were not entitled to

    have a lien on the cargo for the purposes of exacting payment of demurrage from the

    charterers: "Demurrage and detention charges, if any, including at the loading port

    to be settled within two weeks of completion of discharge of cargo based on relevant

    supporting documents."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        Mr. Srivathsan also drew

my attention to the exchange of correspondence between the plaintiffs and defendants

beginning with the defendants’ telefax to the plaintiffs dated 18 October 2002 in

which the defendants pointed out that freight had not been paid. The plaintiffs then asked

for confirmation that the defendants will switch bills as soon as freight is paid. By a

reply dated 21 October the defendants gave the plaintiffs the confirmation sought. Mr.

Srivathsan submitted that the plaintiffs are a Singapore company with a paid-up capital of

$34,000,000 and there is no suggestion that they will not be in a position to pay damages

should the defendants succeed on appeal, which, by the nature of the claim, will

effectively determine the final outcome of this suit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        On the submissions before

me, it seems that the only concern of the defendants in not issuing the switch bills is to

retain a perceived right to lien on the cargo. That would be a matter for the appeal

proper but at this stage I am entitled to consider the relative strength of that ground as

a basis for the exercise of my discretion whether to grant a stay. On the facts and the

balance, I am of the view that it does not seem a sufficiently strong point. Against that,

the plaintiffs who have already paid the freight on the basis of the representation by the

defendants that switch bills would be issued may be liable to their purchasers for breach

of contract if the switch bills are not issued. There is only Mr. Tan's surmise but no

evidence before me to indicate that the plaintiffs paid freight as agents for and on

behalf of the charterers. In any event, I doubt that it would have made any difference

even if they had paid as agents because the confirmation and representation by the

defendants in their response to the plaintiffs on 21 October was unequivocal and which the

plaintiffs or the charterers (if they were the principals) were entitled to rely on. Mr.

Tan says that there was no consideration moving from the charterers if they were the

principals. That argument ignores the sagely wisdom in the common law contract principle

that although consideration must be sufficient it need not be adequate. That is to say,

that once the subject of exchange is recognised in law as suitable consideration, quantity

is irrelevant. Hence, as natural love and affection are not reckoned as suitable

consideration (when no element of a bargain is present), it matters not that they were

copiously lavished. See, for instance, <i>White v Bluett</i> (1853) 23 LJ Ex 36. On the

other hand, legal tender the veritable commercial consideration of choice, is good

consideration even if one offers two cents for a piece of cake. In the present case, the

payment of freight was an obligation but the time for payment was not defined save that

the switch bills would be issued only after payment of freight, or when a letter of

indemnity was given, otherwise, the charterers would have to be satisfied with retrieving

their cargo on the basis of the "freight to collect" bills. Therefore, by their

express agreement to issue the switch bills upon payment the defendants had varied,

however slightly, the time for payment. That is sufficient consideration as there were

clear indications of a bargain.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        I come now to Mr. Tan's

argument that the UK Contract (Rights Against Third Parties) Act 1999 does not apply and

his contention that the plaintiffs did not file any affidavit of UK lawyers to say how the

law under that Act works. It is true that foreign law is a question of fact and is

ordinarily proved in that manner. But where it comes to English law (European Union law

excepted), it is in my view, unnecessary to require evidence from counsel. English law,

not only the common law principles but even statutes such as the Sale of Goods Act, have

been used in argument by counsel in Singapore without reference to the opinion of English

counsel tendered as evidence of fact. Furthermore, on the facts in this instant case, I am

doubtful that the defendants' point is at all relevant. When the defendants say to the

plaintiffs that they (the defendants) will issue the switch bills upon payment of freight

by the plaintiffs, it lies ill in their mouth to say that the Act does not apply. That is

really a substantive matter for judge hearing the substantive application, and as it had

been so considered by that judge, in determining whether a stay ought to be granted, I

would only interfere if I can be persuaded that the judge was palpably wrong. In this case

I have not been persuaded so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        The law as to what is

required to be weighed in an application for stay of execution has been summarised and

applied in the judgment of Yong Pung How CJ in <i>Lee Sian Hee (t/a Lee Sian Hee Pork

Trader) v Oh Kheng Soon (t/a Ban Hon Trading Enterprise)</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=5692&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 77</a>. Basically, a

successful litigant is not to be denied the judgment he had obtained, or have his

enjoyment of it deferred just because of a pending appeal. In exercising the court's

discretion as to whether a stay of execution ought to be granted, the court will have to

consider the grounds of the intended appeal, not substantively as if sitting in place of

the appeal court, but sufficiently to see if there are merits in it. It ought also to

weigh the balance of convenience of a stay order, and finally, to consider whether the

appeal would be rendered nugatory or academic if a stay was not granted. In the present

case, although the order was an interlocutory one, it effectively dealt with the

substantive claim and involved the issuance of bills of lading which cannot be recalled

once they are acted upon before the appeal, the essence of the dispute is nonetheless

measurable in monetary terms. If the defendants succeed on appeal, damages is quantifiable

and the plaintiffs appear to be viable for payment. I had also taken into account the fact

that the defendants' intended appeal concerns an interlocutory order as opposed to a final

order after the full merits of the case had been fully argued at trial. The circumstances

of this case are such that oral evidence does not appear to be relevant and, indeed, the

arguments before JC Woo were limited to mostly undisputed facts. In the circumstances, I

am of the view that a case for stay of execution has not been sufficiently made out and

this application was accordingly dismissed.</p>
