Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that the interim judgment was couched in mandatory terms (“shall be transferred to” Mr Tan) and that it severed the joint tenancy over the investment property, notwithstanding that Mr Tan had not transferred Ms Toh the $60,000 and the property was still registered in their joint names (<span class="font-italic">Toh Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Poh</span> at [24], [25] and [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In the same vein, the Interim Judgment in the present case was phrased mandatorily – it stated: “[Mr Li] <span class="font-italic">shall</span> transfer his title, share and interest” in the Orchard Property to Ms Xia (emphasis added). The result is the same as that in <span class="font-italic">Toh Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Poh</span>: the joint tenancy was severed from the time of the Interim Judgment and Mr Li no longer had any beneficial interest in the property. It follows that Mr Li had no interest in the Orchard Property that Mr Song, as his judgment creditor, could thereafter seize and sell.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Mr Song was aware of the Interim Judgment at the time he applied for leave to seize and sell Mr Li’s interest in the Orchard Property: the Interim Judgment was mentioned in para 20 of Mr Song’s draft affidavit filed under cover of his solicitor’s affidavit in support of his application.

In that capacity, Ms Tao successfully contended that because the interim judgment between Mr Tan and his ex-wife (Ms Toh) had severed the joint tenancy between them, Ms Tao obtained a 50% share of the property by devolution upon Mr Tan’s death intestate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 <span class="font-italic">Central Provident Fund Board v Lau Eng Mui</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 826 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Eng Mui</span>”) is another example demonstrating that a judgment for division of matrimonial property may affect parties other than the matrimonial parties. In that case, in prior divorce proceedings, the husband was ordered to pay the wife a lump sum which was to be charged against the husband’s CPF monies. The Central Provident Fund Board (the “CPF Board”) was not a party to the divorce proceedings, but thereafter it applied to challenge the order for division of matrimonial property, contending that the order contravened a provision of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 1991 Rev Ed) (the “CPF Act”). The Court of Appeal held that there was no contravention of the CPF Act, further holding that an order for division of a matrimonial asset “operates <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> on the asset” (<span class="font-italic">Lau Eng Mui</span> at [7]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 <span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi Murakami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 565 (“<span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span>”) was also cited to me, but it is distinguishable. <span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span> did not concern a Singapore judgment or order for <span class="font-italic">division</span> of matrimonial property, but rather a <span class="font-italic">declaratory</span> Indonesian judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In that case, one of the issues was whether certain proposed counterclaims were time barred, which turned on whether an earlier judgment obtained in Indonesia was <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> or <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> (for if the Indonesian judgment was <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, the claim would not be time barred) (<span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span> at [26]). The Court of Appeal observed that in determining whether a judgment is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> or <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, it is necessary to consider, among other things, the intention of the court making the order as to the effect of the order on the parties (<span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span> at [30]). Notably, the Court of Appeal concluded that the Indonesian judgment, which was made pursuant to divorce proceedings, merely <span class="font-italic">declared</span> the respective rights of the parties to the matrimonial assets, and did not amount to a <span class="font-italic">disposal</span> of the assets so as to constitute it a judgment <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> (<span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span> at [31]). <span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span> is therefore distinguishable from the present case – the facts before me involved a Singapore judgment for the <span class="font-italic">division</span> of matrimonial property which ordered Mr Li to transfer his title, share and interest in the Orchard Property to Ms Xia. The Interim Judgment in the present case was thus one which <span class="font-italic">disposed</span> of the matrimonial assets, and which was described in <span class="font-italic">Lau Eng Mui</span> (at [7]) as a judgment or order operating <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> on the assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Song also contended that I should not give effect to the Interim Judgment or grant the declaration and orders sought by Ms Xia because Ms Xia had not come to court with clean hands: he alleged that the divorce and division of matrimonial assets was a sham, designed to render Mr Li judgment-proof.

</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Song simply asked that I do not give effect to the Interim Judgment. I could not agree with this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 So long as the Interim Judgment subsists, it has the effect of severing the joint tenancy over the Orchard Property, and making Ms Xia its sole beneficial owner. It follows that Mr Li had no interest in the Orchard Property that Mr Song could seize and sell.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Mr Song contended that it was not necessary for him to apply to set aside the Interim Judgment, for the court to choose not to give effect to it. He relied on the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim v American Home Assurance Co and Others</span> [2000] SGHC 185 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (HC)”). There, Yap (the plaintiff executrix and sole beneficiary of the deceased’s estate) claimed payment on certain insurance policies. The viability of Yap’s claim depended on (among other things) whether the deceased’s death was accidental. The court concluded that the deceased’s death was not accidental, finding that Yap and Lim had conspired to cause the death of the deceased intentionally, in order to benefit from the insurance monies (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (HC) at [254]). In coming to this conclusion, the court considered Yap’s divorce from Lim to be a sham and a charade (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (HC) at [230], [232], [236], [237] and [239]), which they orchestrated so that Yap could keep the matrimonial flat, and Lim could buy another (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (HC) at [237]). Hence, the court observed that the testimonies of Yap and Lim in relation to whether the deceased’s death was accidental must be examined with circumspection, as they were willing to present false particulars to the court in the prior divorce proceedings to obtain a sham divorce for financial gain (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (HC) at [239]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The insurance companies’ defence in <span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (HC) concerned whether the deceased’s death was accidental, and indeed they had not put in issue whether Yap’s divorce from Lim was a sham – that was a point pursued by the judge of his own initiative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Whether the order for division of matrimonial property between Yap and Lim was effective (or not) did not affect the insurance companies’ defence, nor was that the court’s focus. Rather, the court scrutinised Yap’s and Lim’s intentions in relation to their divorce, in deciding whether the deceased’s death was accidental (or whether Lim – with Yap as a conspirator – had a hand in it).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In contrast, Mr Song’s contention in the present case – that Mr Li had an interest in the Orchard Property which he could seize and sell – could only succeed if the court did not give effect to the Interim Judgment which severed the joint tenancy. Otherwise, Ms Xia would be the sole beneficial owner of the Orchard Property, and Mr Li would have no interest in it that Mr Song could seize and sell. In those circumstances, Mr Song ought properly to have applied to set aside the Interim Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is noteworthy that on appeal, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim v American Home Assurance Co and others</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 638 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (CA)”) held that the trial judge ought not to have, on his own, conducted an investigation into Yap’s divorce from Lim, which resulted in him finding that it was a sham – that question was not raised in the pleadings, the insurance companies’ affidavit evidence, or the cross-examination by counsel for the insurance companies (at [27] and [28]). Yap’s appeal was dismissed on the limited ground that she had not proved that the deceased’s death was accidental (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (CA) at [40]). Unlike the trial judge, the Court of Appeal did not find that there was sufficient evidence to implicate Yap in a conspiracy to cause the death of the deceased (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Chwee Khim</span> (CA) at [31] and [32]), nor did the Court of Appeal find that the deceased’s death was caused by Lim (<span class="font-italic">Yap</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Khim</span> (CA) at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, where Mr Song had not applied to set aside the Interim Judgment, and his counsel said I was not being asked to set aside the Interim Judgment (see [24] above), I could not, and indeed should not, decline to give effect to the Interim Judgment. I was reinforced in this conclusion by the High Court’s decision in earlier proceedings, which gave effect to the same Interim Judgment in contempt proceedings between Mr Song and Mr Li, as I elaborate upon below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The prior attempt to avoid the effect of the Interim Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 This was not Mr Song’s first attempt to avoid the effect of the Interim Judgment, without getting it set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 On 1 October 2020, by HC/SUM 4329/2020, Mr Song applied to hold Mr Li in contempt of court in relation to alleged breaches of the Mareva injunction obtained on 26 November 2019, which included:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) non-disclosure of Mr Li’s interest in a Duchess Crest Property;
