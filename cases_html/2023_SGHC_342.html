From around April 2020, EAM’s business of purported nickel trading was transferred to EGT. Thereafter, Investors who invested in the purported nickel trading did so by way of RPAs instead of LOAs. Under the terms of the RPAs, the Investor would directly purchase a proportion of the receivables that EGT was purportedly entitled to receive under a Forward Contract with a third-party buyer at a certain “Sale Price”. The Investor would profit from the difference between the “Sale Price” and the proportion of the receivables that the Investor is entitled to. In addition, Investors had to be accredited investors (“AI”) as defined in the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) before they could continue investing in the purported nickel trading. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 However, since not all of the Investors qualified as an AI, several Investors reinvested purported returns from their LOAs/RPAs through accounts other than their personal investment accounts with the Envy Companies. These primarily took place through: (a) the investment account of a third-party AI; and/or (b) a joint account with another Investor (“Joint Account”). Some of the Investors would reinvest their purported returns by means other than their personal investment accounts (with the Envy Companies) through other third parties such as family members, and may claim beneficial interest over those investments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The winding up of the Envy Companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 22 March 2021, the Commercial Affairs Department announced that it had preferred charges against the Envy Companies’ key person, Mr Ng Yu Zhi (“NYZ”), for cheating and fraudulent trading. On 15 April 2021, the Envy Companies filed applications to place themselves under judicial management. Interim judicial managers (“IJMs”) were appointed over the Envy Companies on 27 April 2021. The IJMs were tasked with, among other things, preparing a report on the financial position of the Envy Companies, along with their views on the prospects of the objectives of judicial management being achieved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 25 May 2021, the IJMs issued the Interim Judicial Managers’ Report (the “Interim Report”).

The IJMs then applied on the same day to wind up the Envy Companies since there was no meaningful business to rehabilitate. On 16 August 2021, a winding up order was made against each of the Envy Companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Events leading to the present applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the Update, the IJMs identified claims against certain Investors (the “Overwithdrawn Investors”) for: (a) referral fees paid by the Envy Companies; and/or (b) the Overwithdrawn Sums, as a potential avenue of recovery for the Envy Companies. By way of letters of demand dated between September 2022 and February 2023, the Liquidators wrote to the Overwithdrawn Investors to demand the return of the Overwithdrawn Sums. One hundred of the Overwithdrawn Investors responded to claim that they reinvested part of, or the entirety of, their referral fees and/or Overwithdrawn Sums in the Envy Companies through a third party’s account and/or a Joint Account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 26 September 2022, the Liquidators filed various applications to seek the court’s approval of the Liquidators’ use of the “running account” approach to adjudicate on the Investors’ proofs of debts. During the hearings of those applications in November 2022, the Liquidators were asked how they would treat the sums reinvested by the Overwithdrawn Investors. The Liquidators responded that they would allow the Overwithdrawn Investors to consolidate and net-off the sums reinvested. However, the Liquidators would seek the approval of the Committee of Inspection (“COI”) or the court for such an approach after they had verified the sums reinvested by the Overwithdrawn Investors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 7 February 2023, a single COI over the Envy Companies was constituted. On 21 February 2023, the COI gave its in-principle approval of the Proposed Consolidation. However, the COI’s approval was subject to the court’s approval of the Proposed Consolidation in the present applications. In addition, any and all agreements between the Liquidators and the relevant individuals as a consequence of the application of the Proposed Consolidation shall be presented to the COI and will ultimately be subject to the COI’s approval.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It was against these background facts that the Liquidators made the present applications.

The first was whether the Liquidators could even rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA. The second related but ultimately distinct question was, if the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3), whether the court should make the directions sought by the Liquidators. In the end, I decided both questions in the Liquidators’ favour and made the directions sought by the Liquidators. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As mentioned above, in considering the present applications, I began with a threshold question: could the Liquidators rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA to bring these applications in the first place? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In this regard, s 145(3) of the IRDA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Exercise and control of liquidator’s powers</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  The liquidator may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 145(3) is framed identically to its predecessor, s 273(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “CA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, the local decisions on s 145(3) of the IRDA and its predecessor have primarily addressed only discrete questions of law and/or facts. For instance, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Solvadis</span><span class="font-italic"> Commodity Chemicals Gmbh v Affert Resources Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1337, the court’s decision regarding an application under s 273(3) of the CA was limited to the issue of whether the liquidator may sell certain of the company’s properties and things in action pursuant to s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CA. As such, in the absence of directly binding or relevant local authority, I agreed with the Liquidators that it was proper to refer to relevant foreign decisions on the ambit of the court’s powers under s 145(3) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I begin with the relevant New South Wales legislation. Section 379(3) of the Companies (NSW) Code (the “Code”), which is framed identically to s 145(3) of the IRDA, provides that “[t]he liquidator may apply to the [c]ourt for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding up”. In the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd </span>(1985) 10 ACLR 115, Young J provided helpful guidance on when a court can properly exercise its power under s 379(3) of the Code. The learned judge began by stating that while s 379(3) was expressed widely, it “does not permit the liquidator or a provisional liquidator to come to the court whenever he feels some unease about a situation and wishes to obtain some sort of insurance against the possibility of error, as well as assurance that he is on the right track” (at 116). He explained further that because the court does not usually consider it proper to intervene and make the liquidator’s commercial decisions for him, it will only exercise its power under s 379(3) “where the matter involves guidance to the liquidator on matters of law or principle or to protect him against accusations of acting unreasonably” (at 117). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As such, in the Australian cases at least, the court’s exercise of its powers under s 379(3) of the Code are largely confined to the following four classes of cases: (a) guidance to the liquidator on matters of law; (b) questions involving legal procedure (such as whether a liquidator should settle curial proceedings); (c) whether a liquidator should act on his commercial judgment to postpone a sale because he recognises his legal duty ordinarily requires him to reduce the company’s assets into cash as soon as possible and to distribute; or (d) where there are two or more competing purchasers for the company’s property and the liquidator can see that it may be alleged that he has acted<span class="font-italic"> mala fide </span>or in an absurd or unreasonable or illegal way. Included within these four classes of cases is the situation where the liquidator’s decision-making may be subject to criticism and is likely to be contested. This will especially be the case if the liquidator’s decision involves a balancing of the creditors’ competing interests (see the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">In the matter of AE&amp;E Australia Pty Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2017] NSWSC 950). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> MF Global Australia Ltd (in liq) </span>[2012] NSWSC 994 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> MF Global</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>Black J helpfully summarised the applicable principles in relation to the court’s power to give directions under s 479(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Corporations Act 2001”), which is the equivalent of s 379(3) of the Code, in the following terms (at [7]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 479(3) of the Corporations Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>allows a liquidator to apply to the court for directions in relation to a matter arising under a winding up.

Section 181 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application to Court to have questions determined or powers exercised</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">181.</span>—(1)  The liquidator or any creditor or contributory may apply to the Court —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  to determine any question arising in the winding up of a company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The Court, if satisfied that the determination of the question … is just and beneficial, may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  accede wholly or partially to any such application on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  make such other order on the application as the Court thinks just. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Section 181 differs from s 145(3) in that the former posits an additional requirement that the court must be satisfied that the determination of the question is “just and beneficial”.

The principles applicable to an application under that section were recently reviewed by Ward J in <span class="font-italic">Re Purchas</span><span class="font-italic"> (as liquidator of Astarra Asset Management Pty Ltd (in liq)) </span>[2011] NSWSC 91 … Applications made under this section in a voluntary winding up are determined in a similar manner to applications in a court ordered winding up under s 479(3) of the Corporations Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>notwithstanding that section does not expressly require that it be “just and beneficial” to give the relevant direction.

The effect of a determination under the section is to sanction a course of conduct on the part of the liquidator so that he or she may adopt that course free from the risk of personal liability for breach of duty: <span class="font-italic">S&amp;D International</span> at [7].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 From the foregoing, it appears that the statutory requirements that must be satisfied in a liquidator’s application for directions from the court <span class="font-italic">differs </span>depending on whether it is a court-ordered winding up or a voluntary winding up. The chief difference lies in the court’s determination of whether it is “just and beneficial” to make the direction. Notwithstanding these differences, the courts have interpreted both provisions similarly. Indeed, Young J recognised as such in the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Dean-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd </span>(1997) 24 ACSR 79 (at 81):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is a real difference between a court appointed liquidator and a liquidator appointed in a voluntary winding up. In the former case the liquidator is an officer of the court and the court is at liberty to give him directions accordingly or may utilise the statutory power under s 479. With a voluntary winding up, the liquidator is not an officer of the court but is the agent of the company. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Re Reid Murray Holdings Ltd (in </span><span class="font-italic">liq)</span> [1969] VR 315 at 318, Adam J pointed out that the court has an inherent or implied jurisdiction on an application by its own officer to assist him. This does not apply to a voluntary liquidator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, it bears emphasising that the learned judge qualified this by observing that “although a voluntary liquidator does not have the same access to the court through s 479, he has access through s 511 and the authorities tend to suggest that the court has the same jurisdiction under both sections” (at 81).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Similarly, in the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> the matter of Octaviar Limited (in liq) and Octaviar Administration Pty Ltd (in liq) </span>[2017] NSWSC 1005 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Octaviar Limited</span>”), Black J concluded that the court’s powers to give directions under ss 479(3) and 511 of the Corporations Act 2001 (at [8]) “are of substantially the same character and are intended to facilitate the performance of a liquidator’s functions”. As such, the learned judge opined (at [8]) that these provisions “should be interpreted widely to give effect to that intention”, especially when “it is advantageous to the liquidation to do so”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Further reasons in support of treating applications by liquidators for directions from the court identically were expounded on by Warren CJ in the Victoria Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Hanberg</span><span class="font-italic"> (in his capacity as liquidator of S &amp; D International Pty Ltd) (in liq) and another v MIG Property Services Pty Ltd and others </span>(2010) 79 ACSR 373 (at 378–379): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the qualification that the direction must be “just and beneficial” in the context of a voluntary winding up is one of purpose and not one of scope. Therefore, the powers of the court to make directions in a voluntary winding up application cannot be characterised as more or less limited than the powers of the court to make directions in a court-ordered winding up application. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, based on the legislative history of Australian and the UK insolvency legislation, no essential distinction was intended to be made between voluntary and court-ordered windings up when the court was directing liquidators as to what actions they should take. The qualification that the direction must be “just and beneficial” in the context of voluntary windings up was aimed at reducing the work of the court in voluntary windings up to the minimum supervision necessary to ensure that such windings up were conducted properly and fairly, as if they had been conducted by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I respectfully think that these principles should likewise apply in Singapore. First, the court’s powers under s 145(3) of the IRDA can be invoked where, among other things, the liquidator’s decision-making may be subject to criticism and is likely to be contested. Second, ss 145(3) and 181 of the IRDA, while not framed identically, should be interpreted in the same manner so as to give effect to the broad legislative intention of allowing the liquidation an opportunity to proceed advantageously. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision: the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Having had regard to the applicable principles, I concluded that the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA. I was satisfied that the present applications involved potentially controversial issues of law and principle. Indeed, the Liquidators’ views on these issues, and their proposed course of action in the form of the Proposed Consolidation, may be subject to criticism by opposing creditors. As such, I decided that the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3). However, whether I should grant the specific directions sought was a different question, to which I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the directions sought should be made</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 To begin with, I highlight again that there are two distinct requirements involved in an application under s 145(3) of the IRDA. First, there is the threshold question of whether a liquidator may apply to the court for directions. Second, the court must also be satisfied that the directions sought <span class="font-italic">should </span>be granted. These requirements should not be conflated: while the former goes to a question of the nature of the direction sought, the latter concerns the court’s assessment of whether it benefits the liquidation to grant the direction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In considering whether the directions sought under s 145(3) of the IRDA should be granted, I considered Black J’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Octaviar Limited </span>to be helpful. The learned judge had opined (at [8]) that a court can make the directions sought “where it is advantageous to the liquidation to do so”.

By the running account approach, the Liquidators would treat all dollars in and out of the Envy Companies as attributable to an Investor as part of a single “running account” for that Investor. This would apply whether the moneys in or out of the Envy Companies were accounted for in the Investor’s personal account or an Investor’s investment through a third-party AI, a Joint Account, or through other third parties such as family members. As such, the Proposed Consolidation would simply lay bare the true outstanding claim of an Overwithdrawn Investor. Rather than being a contravention of the <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>principle, the Proposed Consolidation would allow the Liquidators to determine the true claims of the Investors and give effect to that principle in the specific circumstances of the Envy Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Second, the Proposed Consolidation is in the best interests of the estate of the Envy Companies and the general body of creditors. Subject to further agreement, the Proposed Consolidation would allow the Liquidators to compromise claims by the Envy Companies against certain Overwithdrawn Investors, and avoid significant time and costs involved in commencing separate proceedings against them. The Proposed Consolidation would also allow the Liquidators more certainty in the adjudication process and allow the Liquidators to determine the total liabilities more accurately and/or claims of the Envy Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Third, the COI and the investors’ working group comprising 108 Investors are in support of the Proposed Consolidation. There was also no objection to the Proposed Consolidation from any creditor at the hearing of the present applications.

This was made clear in para 1(c) of the summonses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Finally, while the Liquidators stated that the eventual compromises or arrangements that result from the implementation of the Proposed Consolidation would “in principle” receive the court’s approval pursuant to ss 144(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 144(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA, they also reiterated that they were not seeking such approval in these applications. As such, despite the Liquidators making rather detailed submissions on this matter, I did not see why it was appropriate or necessary for the court to consider the likelihood of such a compromise or arrangement passing muster at this stage. I therefore emphasise that nothing in these grounds should be taken as making any observations on such compromises or arrangements. These applications had nothing to do with the validity of any such compromises or arrangements. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For all of these reasons, I made the directions sought in these applications.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Ming Onn David, Fong Zhiwei Daryl, Lin Ruizi, Yong Ying Jie Denise and Tan Wei Sze (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the applicants;<br/>The defendants absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Toh Yong Xiang (WongPartnership LLP) for the non-party (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
