<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Woon Brothers Investment Pte Ltd (“the
                    plaintiff”) filed Originating Summons No 499 of 2010 (“the
                    OS”) against the management corporation (“the first
                    defendant”) of International Plaza (“the Building”) as well
                    as against Cheong Keng Hooi (“the second defendant”), Cheong Hooi
                    Hong (“the third defendant”) Cheong Sim Lam (“the fourth
                    defendant”) and International Associated Company Pte Ltd (“the
                    fifth defendant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The second to fourth defendants (who are
                    siblings) are council members of the first defendant while the fifth defendant
                    was the developer of the Building. The second defendant is also the chairman of
                    the first defendant. The second and third defendants are also shareholders of
                    the fifth defendant as well as shareholders and directors of two other
                    companies, <em>viz</em>, Seiko Architectural Wall Systems
                    Pte Ltd (“Seiko”) and Tian Teck Realty Pte Ltd (“Tian
                    Teck”). The second defendant is also a shareholder and director of
                    another company called Ka$h International Pte Ltd (“Ka$h”). All
                    three companies feature in the OS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is the subsidiary proprietor of
                    unit #46-15 (“the unit”) in the Building. It sued the defendants
                    in the OS, in particular, the second to fourth defendants, <em>inter alia</em>, for fraud, misappropriation of funds belonging to
                    subsidiary proprietors, failure to act honestly and with reasonable diligence,
                    taking advantage of their positions as council members to gain advantage
                        <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By Summons No 2788 of 2010 (“the
                    application”), the second to fifth defendants applied under O 28
                    r 8 and O 5 rr 2 and 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) to convert the OS into a
                    writ of summons. The application was supported by an affidavit filed by the
                    third defendant on 18 June 2010 and was opposed by the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The application was heard and dismissed by an
                    assistant registrar (“the Assistant Registrar”) on 29 July
                    2010 on the ground that the third defendant’s affidavit did not convince
                    the Assistant Registrar that there were substantial disputes of facts that
                    warranted the conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The second to fifth defendants appealed to a
                    judge in chambers against the Assistant Registrar’s decision by way of
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 300 of 2010 (“the Appeal”). This court
                    heard and allowed the Appeal on 23 August 2010. I reversed the decision of
                    the Assistant Registrar below, converted the OS to a writ of summons and gave
                    directions and timelines to the parties for the filing of their pleadings. The
                    plaintiff is dissatisfied with and has filed a Notice of Appeal (in Civil Appeal
                    No 153 of 2010) against my decision. I shall now set out my
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In support of the OS, the plaintiff’s
                    manager Woon Wee Teng (‘Woon”) filed a lengthy (2,581-page)
                    affidavit although the actual text was 15 pages with the remaining 2,566 pages
                    being exhibits referred to by Woon. The OS itself numbered 58 pages as it
                    contained 20 summaries listing the plaintiff’s complaints against the
                    defendants. The OS concluded with general prayers in which the plaintiff claimed
                    interest on the sums awarded by the court, costs and a liberty to apply
                    provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In his affidavit, Woon (a retired lawyer) who
                    occupies the unit deposed that he was motivated to take out the OS as he wanted
                    the court to determine certain issues and make certain orders for the proper
                    management and administration of the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Woon explained the relationship between the
                    defendants and the various companies mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above). He said that Seiko was awarded a
                    contract of $4,975,468 for facade upgrading works at the Building by the
                    defendants as well as a subsequent contract of $1.7m for repair works of hollow
                    and spalling concrete and plaster of window ledges. Tian Teck was the managing
                    agent of the Building from 1975 to November 2003 before Chesterton International
                    Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“Chesterton”) took over. Ka$h was/is
                    the landlord to the first defendant for the swimming pool and jacuzzi on the
                        36<sup>th</sup> floor of the Building. The first defendant
                    makes payments to Ka$h for the usage by subsidiary proprietors of the swimming
                    pool and the jacuzzi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Woon alleged that by reason of the second and
                    third defendants’ vested interests in the three companies mentioned in
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, they placed themselves in a
                    position of conflict of interests and failed to comply with statutory
                    requirements set out in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act
                    (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the BMSMA”) as well as in the Land
                    Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev Ed). Woon added that the second and
                    third defendants have substantial proprietary interests in the Building either
                    solely or jointly with their families as they own several units. He surmised
                    that that was the reason why the two defendants held onto their position as
                    council members when the Building was completed by the fifth defendant and its
                    management handed over to the first defendant in 1975.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Woon made further serious allegations against
                    the second and third defendants. He alleged that they managed the first
                    defendant as if it was their own private company without regard to the interests
                    of the other subsidiary proprietors or for the need for statutory compliance.
                    They appointed their own people to be the managing agents and put their own
                    people in the council of the first defendant. They bought the loyalty of staff
                    by paying good salaries, bonuses, medical and other benefits including
                    gratuities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Woon revealed that the OS was brought on by
                    the second and third defendants’ requiring the first defendant to question
                    the plaintiff on the tonality of the glass panels that were installed in the
                    unit and to dismantle the same. Woon deposed that it was the previous owner of
                    the unit who had installed the glass panels, not the plaintiff. Woon asserted
                    that after the installation, the first defendant must have checked and approved
                    the glass panels before returning the mandatory renovation deposit to the
                    subsidiary proprietor or the contractor concerned. As such, the first to third
                    defendants could not now raise objections to the plaintiff over the
                    installation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Woon further accused the first three
                    defendants of practising double standards as they had installed the same colour
                    glass panels at the management office at unit #36-05. He contended that the
                    first three defendants should not waste their time on such trivialities and
                    should instead focus their attention on more important issues for the proper and
                    better management of the Building. He cited as one example the fifth
                    defendant’s wrongful operation of the car park as a business at the
                    expense of the rights and interests of other subsidiary
                proprietors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Woon deposed that he devoted two years of his
                    time after retirement to assisting the plaintiff in advancing the righteous
                    cause of protecting the rights and interests of other subsidiary proprietors of
                    the Building and in exposing the wrongdoings and questionable payments and
                    expenditure of the first defendant in relation to the second and third
                    defendants and their connected companies. He added that he commenced these legal
                    proceedings with the sincere and noble intention of wanting the defendants to
                    rectify their wrongs, to desist from continuing their wrongdoings, and to
                    refrain from retaining or taking what belonged to other subsidiary
                    proprietors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Woon said the plaintiff had engaged in
                    extensive correspondence with the defendants to obtain important and complete
                    information and documents from the latter but the first defendant and relevant
                    council members had either refused to provide or had only partially furnished
                    the same or furnished incorrect or misleading documents/information. The
                    plaintiff had repeatedly attempted but failed to persuade the defendants to
                    acknowledge their mistakes, wrongdoings and violations and to rectify
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In his affidavit filed in support of the
                    application, the third defendant (who is the first defendant’s chairman)
                    deposed that an originating summons was inappropriate for the plaintiff’s
                    action as there were numerous contested issues and disputed facts in the present
                    action which could not be resolved by way of affidavit evidence but required
                    proof by way of oral testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The third defendant pointed out that the OS
                    listed out 20 summaries of the plaintiff’s grievances, ranging from the
                    alleged illegal car park business operated by the fifth defendant to special
                    parking privileges being enjoyed by the fourth defendant to conflict of
                    interests on the part of the defendants. He believed that the plaintiff chose to
                    commence proceedings by originating summons to obtain a quick resolution of the
                    issues in dispute based on affidavit evidence alone. While he acknowledged that
                    an expedient resolution of the issues in dispute was for the benefit of all
                    parties, the third defendant believed that a writ of summons would be more
                    appropriate in this case due to the multiple issues and facts in dispute raised
                    by the plaintiff which could not be resolved on the basis of affidavits
                    alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Counsel for the plaintiff argued that
                    s 124(1) of the BMSMA required that every application to the court be
                    commenced by way of an originating summons, notwithstanding that he made no
                    reference at all to any sections of the same either in the heading of the OS or
                    in Woon’s affidavit. (The BMSMA repealed the Buildings and Common Property
                    (Maintenance &amp; Management) Act (Cap 30, 2000 Rev Ed) and made
                    consequential amendments to the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158,
                    1999 Rev Ed). Section 124 of the BMSMA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Legal proceedings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Every application to the court under this Act shall be by originating
                        summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Where this Act provides for any sum to be recovered by any person or
                        authority from any other person or authority, the sum may be recovered by an
                        action for a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I was of the view that counsel’s argument was misconceived and
                    showed a lack of understanding of the purpose and scope of the
                BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As stated earlier, the plaintiff had made no
                    reference whatsoever to any section of the BMSMA either in the heading of the OS
                    or in Woon’s affidavit. Woon’s lengthy and often rambling affidavit
                    included completely irrelevant matters such as newspaper reports on spending by
                    the National Heritage Board, the Accountant-General’s criticism of civil
                    servants’ lax management of public funds, the Media Development
                    Authority’s evaluation of grant applications and BBC’s transcripts
                    of the UK prime ministerial debate held on 22 April 2010. Such irrelevant
                    matters made it even more difficult to determine the actual nature (and extent)
                    of the plaintiff’s grievances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     To elaborate, the plaintiff had listed 20
                    summaries in the OS. To give a flavour of the varied nature of the
                    plaintiff’s complaints, I will highlight a number of them: Summary 1
                    referred to the carpark business and its management by the fifth defendant,
                    Summary 4 alleged that there was forgery of the minutes of council meetings to
                    cover wrongdoings whilst Summary 15 questioned whether the council members of
                    the first defendant had acted honestly in respect of the erection and renewal of
                    satellite dishes on the Building installed by the CNBC television
                    network.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The scope of the BMSMA as stated in its long
                    title is to provide for “proper maintenance and management of
                    buildings”. The typical proceedings envisaged as coming under the purview
                    of the BMSMA would be disputes between the management corporation of a strata
                    titled building (be it residential or commercial) and its subsidiary proprietors
                    in relation to common property such as whether the upkeep and/or repair of an
                    area in a building was common property. An originating summons would also be the
                    appropriate mode of commencement if the applicant wanted the court to interpret
                    any section of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     However, the prerequisites for bringing an
                    originating summons under the BMSMA were not met by the plaintiff here.
                    Woon’s complaint that gave rise to the OS started with the first
                    defendant’s directive to him (with which he disagreed) to dismantle the
                    glass panelling of the unit, which had nothing to do with common property. As no
                    evidence was presented by either side, the court was not privy to whether the
                    bye-laws implemented by the first defendant for the Building stipulated that
                    glass panelling of individual units should be of uniform colour or tones. If
                    such a bye-law existed, the plaintiff would not even have a basis to commence
                    the OS in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Counsel for the defendants had submitted that
                    the only sections in the BMSMA where matters are referred to the court under
                    s 124 were those under ss 32(1), 36 and 76 to 83. Section 32(1) covers
                    bye-laws for common property; s 36 refers to applications by subsidiary
                    proprietors to court regarding common property whilst ss 76 to 83 come under
                    Division 7 of the BMSMA. The purpose of Division 7 is to provide for the
                    administration of subsidiary management corporations (s 80), the sharing of
                    the expenses of a subsidiary management corporation amongst subsidiary
                    proprietors (s 81), the application of the bye-laws to limited common
                    property (s 82) and the enforceability of judgments by management
                    corporations and subsidiary proprietors (s 83).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The application was made under O 28
                    r 8 of the Rules which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where, in the case of a cause or matter begun by originating summons, it
                        appears to the Court at any stage of the proceedings that the proceedings
                        should for any reason be continued as if the cause or matter had been begun
                        by writ, it may order the proceedings to continue as if the cause or matter
                        had been so begun and may, in particular, order that pleadings shall be
                        delivered or that any affidavits shall stand as pleadings, with or without
                        liberty to any of the parties to add thereto or to apply for particulars
                        thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court has a discretion to convert an originating summons to a writ
                    without waiting for proof that there are substantial disputes of facts. Order 28
                    r 8 only requires a court to be of the view that there are likely to be
                    substantial disputes of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Another provision that is relevant is O 5
                    r 2 of the Rules which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Proceedings in which a substantial dispute of fact is likely to arise
                        shall be begun by writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It cannot be denied that many facts would be in dispute in this case
                    arising from the plaintiff’s allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the plaintiff appeared to have
                    overlooked both O 5 and O 8 of the Rules as well as the provisions of
                    the BMSMA (referred to at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above) in his
                    argument that it was a regulatory requirement for the plaintiff’s
                    complaint to be commenced by originating summons and that the court had no
                    discretion to convert the same to a writ of summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     One of the reasons for the refusal of the
                    Assistant Registrar to convert the OS to a writ was her view that even without
                    conversion, the court had the power under O 28 to hear oral evidence and
                    give directions for the filing of affidavits and the attendance of deponents for
                    cross-examination. She criticised the affidavit filed by the third defendant as
                    lacking in particulars of what was the actual dispute between the parties, a
                    criticism that in my view should more rightly have been levelled against the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Allegations of fraud are very serious indeed
                    and the allegations levelled by the plaintiff against the five defendants were
                    replete with accusations of fraud, misuse and mismanagement of funds and other
                    wrongdoings. The plaintiff also raised allegations against other management
                    council members who were not joined as defendants to the OS. It would be
                    impossible to determine the merits of such allegations, whether against the
                    defendants or non-parties, based on affidavits alone, even if the deponents were
                    subjected to cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Instead of being faced with a lengthy
                    originating summons and a rambling affidavit that was long on accusations and
                    complaints but short on the nature of the plaintiff’s claim, the OS should
                    be converted to a writ so that the plaintiff would be obliged to plead and
                    particularise its cause(s) of action to enable the defendants to meet the case.
                    Further, persons like Simon Kwan who was not named as a defendant but against
                    whom allegations of conflict of interest and the making of false declarations
                    were made, could and should have an opportunity to apply to be joined as a
                    defendant if the OS was converted to a writ. This recourse was not available to
                    Simon Kwan if the action remained as an originating summons and would be grossly
                    unfair to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the reasons given above, I allowed the
                    Appeal.</p>
