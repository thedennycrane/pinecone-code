</div> However, employment contracts generally contain specific provisions that deal with the remuneration of employees. This is also the case for Praveen. Clauses 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of the LOA explicitly set out his remuneration and other entitlements. It could not be said that the ITMTC as pleaded is necessary to ensure proper remuneration. More generally, even if GSK employees expect GSK to comply with its own policies, that does not make it a business or commercial necessity such that it should be contractually part of the EA. Therefore, I do not find the second step of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> test, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, business or commercial necessity, to be made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Neither is the third step of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>test met.

</div> However, Tamara, Tess and Mr Jayant Kumar Singh (who was one of Praveen’s line managers) (“Jayant”) all testified, when asked, that they did not know what an ITMTC was. In addition, they, along with Rick Sheppard (“Rick”) (Praveen’s line manager after Jayant), did not testify that they saw GSK’s compliance with the Policies as part of GSK’s contractual obligations to its employees. Their evidence is summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Rick saw a nuanced distinction between trust in a company and a legal obligation. He believed that the company’s legal obligations are set out in the employment contract, but that the company will also follow its values and expectations to look at the employment contract in the right light.

She did not know if GSK as an entity would be contractually bound to its employees to follow the Policies.

Their understanding of the terms of the Employment Contract is not necessarily representative of GSK’s understanding. Furthermore, even taking Praveen’s case at its highest, these witnesses did not know in the first place what an ITMTC was, and they also did not clearly consider GSK to be contractually bound by its Policies. Therefore, I find it difficult to conclude that they would have said “Oh of course!” if it was suggested to them that GSK was contractually bound by the ITMTC as pleaded. Neither is there any evidence before the court to conclude that GSK as an entity would have also said “Oh of course” to this suggestion. That GSK expressly limited the obligation of compliance with the Policies to employees in cl 5.2 of the EA, suggests the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I hence find that neither step 2 nor step 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> test is satisfied on the evidence, and that the plaintiff has not proven that the ITMTC is implied in fact. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implied in law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I will next examine if an ITMTC as pleaded should be implied in law.

</div> However, while cl 5.2 of the LOA places an obligation on the employee to comply with the Policies, and there is no term placing an obligation on the employer GSK to comply with the Policies, there is no express term in the LOA precluding the inclusion of the ITMTC as pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiff relies on decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Chea</span><span class="font-italic">h Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 577 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>”) to support its position. There, the High Court held that unless there are express terms to the contrary or the context implied otherwise, an implied term of mutual trust and confidence and fidelity, is implied by law into a contract of employment under Singapore law: at [59]. Subsequent High Court decisions have also recognized the existence of the ITMTC in Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 GSK relies on the observations of the Appellate Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Dong Wei v Shell Eastern Trading (Pte) Ltd and another </span>[2022] 1 SLR 1318 ("<span class="font-italic">Dong Wei</span>") to submit that the issue of whether ITMTC is part of Singapore law is still an open question. In <span class="font-italic">Dong Wei</span>, the Appellate Division noted at [73] that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San Lawrence Bernard v </span><span class="font-italic">Robinson &amp; Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 357 ("<span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span>") did not formally endorse the existence of the ITMTC, unlike certain High Court decisions. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span> was cognisant that <span class="font-italic">Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Barker</span> (2013) 214 FCR 450 (“<span class="font-italic">Barker</span><span class="font-italic"> (FC)</span>”) – then in the Federal Court of Australia (“FCA”) – was on appeal to the High Court of Australia (“HCA”): at [30]. In a subsequent Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">The One Suites Pte Ltd v Pacific Motor Credit (Pte) Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">One Suites</span>”), the Court of Appeal expressly noted that <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San </span>left open the position in Singapore on the existence of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence: at [44]. The court in <span class="font-italic">Dong Wei</span> thus observed at [82]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the status of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence has not been clearly settled in Singapore. It remains an open question for the Court of Appeal to resolve in a more appropriate case, ideally with facts capable of bearing out a claim based directly on the existence of the implied term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 GSK also refers to the decision of the HCA in <span class="font-italic">Commonwealth Bank of Australia v </span><span class="font-italic">Barker</span> (2014) 312 ALR 356 (“<span class="font-italic">Barker (HC)</span>”) to support its position that the ITMTC should not be recognized under Singapore law.

When asked, counsel for the plaintiff confirmed to the court that he has not found any precedent anywhere, where an ITMTC of the pleaded content, that a company has to comply with its policies, has been accepted.

The ITMTC as pleaded is very different from the formulation of the ITMTC in <span class="font-italic">Malik</span> that “[p]arties shall not engage in conduct likely to undermine the trust and confidence required if the employment relationship is to continue in the manner the employment contract implicitly envisages”. Rather, the issue is this: even assuming that the ITMTC is part of Singapore law, should the content of the ITMTC include a contractual duty on the part of the employer to comply with its internal policies? Counsel for the plaintiff accepts that this would indeed be the inquiry before this court, and that even if this court accepts that ITMTC is part of Singapore law, the court will have to find that an ITMTC of the pleaded content is part of Singapore law.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 To sharpen the inquiry before this court, the substance of what the plaintiff is contending is no different in terms of the outcome, if his submission was that there should be “an implied term in the EA that GSK should comply with its policies”, rather than “an implied term of <span class="font-italic">mutual trust and confidence</span> in the EA that GSK should comply with its policies”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Even assuming, without making a judgment on it, that the ITMTC is part of Singapore law, the plaintiff’s submission here on the pleaded ITMTC introduces a different order of uncertainty. It is trite law that the certainty of contractual terms is an important tenet of contract law. In <span class="font-italic">T2 Networks Pte Ltd v Nasioncom Sdn</span> <span class="font-italic">Bhd</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [44], Judith Prakash J, as she then was, cited <span class="font-italic">G Scammell and Nephew, Limited v H C and J G Ouston </span>[1941] AC 251 (at 268-269) for the proposition:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to give it a practical meaning. Its terms must be so definite, or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties, that the promises and performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The doctrine of implication of terms in law inevitably raises some degree of uncertainty given the broadness of the criteria utilized to imply such terms: <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 769 at [90]. Therefore, courts must be cautious in determining whether to imply certain terms in law and carefully consider the degree of uncertainty that such terms may introduce. Further caution should be exercised when the content of the implied term involves a concept which is itself controversial: <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 at [46]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The uncertainty here takes place at two levels, first in respect of GSK, and second, in respect of other companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, in respect of GSK, not all the content or clauses in GSK’s company policies were traversed in the course of the trial. Only the Policies and particular clauses of the Policies that were relied on for the plaintiff’s action were mentioned. There remains a large body of GSK’s documents that are neither identified nor discussed (‘the unknown GSK documents”), the legal status of which remains unclear by the end of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Hence, it could not be said with certainty which of the unknown GSK documents should rightly be regarded as part of GSK’s policies or contractual obligations. This is particularly since, even for purposes of this suit, there are documents which are titled as “Guidance” or “Best Practices”, but which the plaintiff submits are nevertheless contractually binding policies, despite their wording on the face of the documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The plaintiff submits that GSK should still be bound by the unknown GSK documents since it knows what these other documents are. The plaintiff argues that since it has been pleaded that under cl 5.2 of the LOA, all GSK policies are part of the EA, then the onus is on GSK to identify which of the remaining unknown policies are not to be regarded as contractual obligations.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 With respect, I have several difficulties with this submission for the following reasons:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, as set out above, cl 5.2 only binds the employee and not GSK. There is no express clause that incorporates a contractual obligation on GSK to follow all its policies. Indeed, it is because there is no express contractual obligation, that there is a need to consider whether there is an ITMTC. There is hence no place to rely on cl 5.2 of the LOA, in relation to this issue of uncertainty in the pleaded ITMTC. The uncertainty over the universe of unknown policies that should be subject to the pleaded ITMTC remains to be addressed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, while the plaintiff submits that there is no uncertainty because GSK would know which policies are binding, the position taken by GSK in this case is that it disputes that there are any policy documents that are contractually binding on it in the first place. Therefore, it is no answer for the plaintiff to say that GSK would be able to identify these unknown GSK documents. Most certainly, an employee would also not know what is the realm of unknown GSK documents that are regarded as contractually binding. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, there could be many other unknown GSK documents for which it is uncertain if such documents are policy documents and if they bind GSK. This is especially when the plaintiff’s position during the trial was that townhall communications can also be classified as policies. It would be overly onerous to expect GSK to identify all such potential documents in the course of this suit and clarify which of such documents are policies, and which of these policies are regarded as binding. This is especially when many of these documents may not be or are unlikely to be related to this suit, since they were not relied on by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Therefore, the first order of uncertainty for GSK, if the pleaded ITMTC is upheld, is the uncertainty over which of the unknown GSK documents are to be regarded as policies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There is a second order of uncertainty with the pleaded ITMTC in relation to GSK. Even if it can be ascertained which of the unknown GSK documents are to be regarded as policies, it is uncertain which part of such policies should be regarded as contractually binding under the pleaded ITMTC. Many of the statements in the Policies, such as in the Code of Conduct, are clearly phrased as aspirational statements. They do not appear to give employees a contractual right to sue. The defendant referred to “principles of equality, transparency and integrity” as an example. Another example is the company’s value of “Respect” stated in the Code of Conduct, which is described as “supporting colleagues and communities around us, and embracing diversity and individuality, so that we can all achieve great things”. It is not apparent that this was intended to give employees the contractual right to sue GSK for any lack of diversity or impose legal standards that GSK is contractually obliged to meet. A similar point was made in <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan and another v Johnny Lian </span><span class="font-italic">Tian Yong</span> [2018] SGHC 169. There, it was alleged at [50(c)] that a term stating that “the ultimate objective … was to list [a company] on NASDAQ, a stock exchange in the United States of America” was a contractually binding term. The court rejected this, holding at [240] that the term was merely “an aspiration”, as it was “hard to see how the defendant could agree to be subject to such a term … [the success of the NASDAQ] listing would depend on numerous variables and circumstances, some or many of which the parties will have little control over”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff acknowledges that there are aspirational statements in the Policies and submits that aspirational statements should be treated as obligations for GSK to use reasonable endeavours to achieve those standards. Where, however, there are statements in the Policies that are phrased in mandatory language, those should be treated as binding even though there is an aspirational quality.

</div>
</div> However, the very same page of that document also states that managers must “[c]reate an environment where employees are engaged in challenging work that matches their talents and increases their skills”. Whether there is such an environment would be highly subjective. What constitutes a breach would be highly uncertain. It is not likely that GSK would regard such a phrase as contractually binding, even though the word “must” was used. Words such as “must” or ‘should” can also be used as exhortations, particularly in aspirational documents, and need not necessarily indicate an intention to impose a contractual obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 There is a separate level of uncertainty with the pleaded ITMTC, and that is in relation to other companies or entities, whether in the private sector, public sector or charity sector. There is no evidence before the court of the content that other companies put into their internal policies, and whether it would be appropriate for such policies to be treated as part of those companies’ contractual obligations with their employees, which is the inevitable outcome if the plaintiff is correct in submitting that the ITMTC as pleaded is implied by law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The plaintiff seeks to go around this difficulty by submitting that the ITMTC as pleaded need not go that far as to affect other companies. This is because it was held in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [60] that the content of ITMTC can vary greatly depending on the facts of each case. The plaintiff hence submits that a finding that the pleaded ITMTC is implied by law need not affect other companies.

</div> The EA does not appear to be particularly unique. Following the principle set out in <span class="font-italic">Forefront</span>, at the least, a company that imposes a contractual obligation on its employees to comply with company policies, would similarly face an implied term that the company too would be contractually bound by such policies. Moreover, counsel for the plaintiff also accepts that if the pleaded ITMTC is upheld on the basis of it being implied by law, then such a decision would have precedential value, and other companies would have to be more precise if they do not want to be bound by their internal policies in future. In other words, there would be impact on other companies.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 This raises the question of whether it is appropriate, by way of implying in law the pleaded ITMTC, to lay down a contractual obligation for other companies to comply with their policies. Many companies include in their internal documents, aspirational statements, as GSK did in this case. It is commendable that companies put in aspirational statements in their policies, as it provides high standards to strive towards. Oftentimes, companies do so knowing that they may not be at that standard yet, but the aspirational statements are nevertheless useful in providing the right directions to strive toward. It is unlikely that they conceived of such aspirational statements as being contractual obligations when they were crafted. It is also unclear whether organisations would be discouraged from having such aspirational statements and goals included in their policies if they were regarded as contractual obligations. The plaintiff acknowledges that aspirational statements could be caught by the umbrella of “all policies” and submits that the distinction should be based on whether the aspirational statements were phrased in mandatory terms. However, the plaintiff also accepts that it is not known if aspirational statements elsewhere have been written in mandatory terms or not.

</div>
</div> Consequently, there is uncertainty over whether the aspirational statements in internal policies for other companies should be held to be contractually binding, simply because of the presence of some mandatory language, particularly when these could be set out in aspirational documents such as documents on the values of a company. All of these introduce uncertainty of an order which was not placed before the court in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This brings me to another issue, which is whether a court hearing involving a private dispute between a company and its employee, is the best modality to decide if the internal policies of other companies, should be part of their contractual obligations with their employees. In <span class="font-italic">Barker</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, the HCA observed that the ITMTC would “intrude a common law policy choice of broad and uncertain scope into an area of frequent, detailed and often contentious legislative activity”: at [118]. Our courts have also expressed similar concerns about such intrusion and have held that it “is impermissible for the courts to arrogate to themselves legislative powers” or become “mini-legislatures”: <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter </span>[2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span>”) at [77]. This is because the courts have no mandate to create or amend laws in a manner which permits recourse to extra-legal policy factors as well as considerations. The jurisdiction as well as the power to do so lie exclusively within the sphere of the legislature: <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang </span>at [77]. At the same time, our courts have been able to make advancements in areas of common law, which affect a polarity of parties, for example with respect to the test on medical negligence in <span class="font-italic">Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin London Lucien and another</span> [2017] 2 SLR 492.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In my view, the issue here is not about the respective capabilities or the proper reach of the different institutions. Rather, it is a question of whether the wider impact on other companies that flows from the plaintiff’s submission on the pleaded ITMTC, is one that is best arrived at through the process of a private employment dispute between two parties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiff and GSK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiff’s submission is a very broad and far reaching one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 If accepted, his submission will lead to implications for other companies in the private sector, public sector and charity sector, and not just GSK. There will be a precedent for companies to be <span class="font-italic">contractually bound</span> by their own policies pursuant to an ITMTC. Yet, there is nothing before the court as to what constitutes policies for these companies or what part of their policies should be binding. For example, the plaintiff submits that GSK’s townhall communications of 29 May 2019 and June 2019 constitute policies. However, townhalls are generally used for internal communications and discussions between an organisation and its staff. There would be a wide range of communications in a townhall. It is not clear that all such communications would or should be regarded as policies. Neither is there evidence on whether other companies have drafted their policies with the intent that the clauses of such documents could form a potential ground for a contractual claim against the company. A ruling that such policies have contractual force could have widespread implications on the employer-employee dynamic in Singapore, raising many unanswered questions and uncertainties. For example, what are the implications if companies subsequently re-frame their policies in order to limit such unintended legal exposure? What are the legal effects of internal policies that are not published to employees? Whose breach would suffice to constitute a breach on the part of the company in relation to this broad range of policies? Will another employee’s breach of the company’s policies be attributed to the company? These are highly pertinent questions that affect the landscape of employment relationship in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For the above reasons, I find that even on the assumption that the ITMTC exists in Singapore, the ITMTC as pleaded by the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a company is contractually bound to comply with all its policies, is not part of Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In summary, I observe that while the plaintiff frames his case as being based on the ITMTC, there is no precedent for an ITMTC of the content that he seeks to ascribe. While positioning the claim as one of an ITMTC may allow the plaintiff to tap into the jurisprudence accepting ITMTC, one should not lose sight that the fundamental question that the plaintiff’s submission raises is not whether an ITMTC exists in Singapore law, but whether it should be implied in law (through an ITMTC) that companies are contractually bound to comply with all their policies. For the reasons above, I find that such a term would be too uncertain. I also do not regard an employment dispute between two private parties as being the appropriate forum for determining that companies elsewhere are similarly contractually bound to comply with all their policies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As this is a threshold question for the plaintiff, my finding that there is no ITMTC as pleaded that is implied in law, means that the plaintiff’s case would be dismissed on this basis alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For completeness, I nevertheless proceed to consider if there are breaches of the EA, assuming that an ITMTC as pleaded, is implied by law in Singapore.

On the plaintiff’s evidence then, being on the List did not automatically result in a role with Unilever. That being the case, it is difficult for the plaintiff to submit that the mere exclusion of Praveen from the List resulted in him being unable to secure a role with Unilever. More fundamentally, there is no evidence that Unilever, as the party taking over the business, was unable to exercise its discretion on what roles it needed and who to offer them to, and instead had to offer roles to anyone who was on the List put up by GSK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Praveen also acknowledged that when he does recruitment, he would take the best person for the job, regardless of whether that person was on some initial list.

</div> If Unilever did need people for Expert Marketing roles, there is no logical reason, and certainly no reason that has been placed before the court, as to why Unilever would choose not to take Praveen if he was suitable for a role Unilever required, even if he was not on the List. This is particularly so when Unilever’s interest in the Unilever deal was not just the purchase of the Nutrition business but also the people and their expertise. Prateek testified to that effect: “[a]s part of the Unilever Deal, GSK started to look into which personnel would be transferred to Unilever as the latter would not simply be purchasing the Nutrition business, which was around 45% of the NDH business, but more importantly, the people and their expertise.”

It also states that as part of the A&amp;S process, the talent appointment ought to be considered with similar employees in the same pool. Thus, the plaintiff submits that even if Tess was considered a “talent”, the A&amp;S process suggests she should have been put in a pool with similar candidates (in this case, other LT-2 Global Experts) in order to decide who ought to get the LT-1 Global Expert role. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the plaintiff submits that the absence of related documents from GSK shows that: (i) there was no guidance from HR or the senior leadership team to Tamara on this, contrary to what she alleged; (ii) there were other considerations relating to the LT-1 role that if revealed, will show that Praveen is not less qualified than Tess; and/or (iii) there were other candidates (including Praveen) besides Tess put forth for the LT-1 role but Tamara did not consider them. Alternatively, the lack of documentary records shows that Tess’s appointment to the LT-1 role was done without regard to GSK policies.

</div> The Posting Policy states that the company “may choose not to post a job when the following apply”. This includes where “Qualified candidates have been identified through the Leadership Planning/Succession Planning/ Differentiated Development process internally”. The Posting Policy also includes other situations which does not involve personnel considered by GSK as a Talent Appointment, for example, where the “job is part of a developmental or rotational programme”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Tamara’s evidence on direct deployment is supported by the Posting Policy as well as contemporaneous correspondence. GSK’s internal investigator Chris Dilworth (“Chris”), in his email to Praveen on 29 June 2020 (“Chris’ email”) informing him of the state of his investigations, stated that Tess’s appointment was a “Talent Appointment”. He refers to a “UK Postings” policy and indicates that he understands that the sentiments within it apply globally. What he cites is exactly the same as the first bullet point in the Posting Policy, namely that there could be direct deployment for qualified candidates identified through “Leadership Planning/Succession Planning/Differentiated Development process internally”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiff submits that Chris’ email supports his case. He refers to a part of Chris’ email, where he said that there appeared to have been no reference to the use of such appointments in the distributed literature and it might have been prudent to explicitly state that the company reserved the right to make Talent Appointments in advance.

Tamara’s evidence was that this document sets out the process in relation to open postings and does not preclude direct deployments for Talent Appointments.

I accept that this is the proper reading of this document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I make the following observations on the A&amp;S HR Guidance that Praveen relies.

</div> These suggest that the document is meant to provide guidelines and not binding instructions that GSK must comply with under all circumstances.

</div> I do not find that this sentence alone changes the entire nature of the document, such that it takes the document beyond what it is clearly titled as, namely “Guidance”, rather than a binding set of HR instructions. Given that it is only “Guidance”, it would be a stretch to say that a breach of its contents amounts to a breach of GSK’s contractual obligations to its employees, whether read on its own or together with the GSK values and commitment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, in any event, even if it is a binding set of HR instructions, I am of the view that the A&amp;S HR Guidance does not preclude direct deployment of a Talent Appointment under the Posting Policy. Praveen relies on a line in that document that states: “If an open role/ new role has been created as part of the restructure, which you think you would be suitable for / which you would like apply for, you would be supported to apply via the usual GSK Vacancy/GSK Job Posting process.”

</div> However, this line is set out in a table that describes four most likely outcomes in the event of an organisational change, one of which is that there is an “Open Role”. The line that Praveen relies on is the description for such an outcome. Notably, the slide as a whole does not set out to define the posting processes, but merely highlights likely outcomes. Neither does it specify whether the “open role / new role” that is mentioned, applies to LT-1 or LT-2 roles or both. Nor does it state that there will be only open postings and that direct deployments are precluded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I note also that there is a question in the FAQ to this document, asking “How do you treat employees who are Talent Appointments?” The answer given is “The TA would be considered with the aligned pool of employee”.

</div>  The reference to “TA” in the FAQ suggests that Talent Appointments are recognised within GSK generally. The plaintiff accepted that on the basis of this document, there may have been a “TA” process but submits that “TA” postings would still have to be subject to the processes set out in A&amp;S HR Guidance.

</div> I found him to be a credible and reasonable witness, who provided candid responses that did not always follow GSK’s case. His evidence adds further weight to what Tamara testified, as well as what the documents and correspondence show. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Moreover, LT-1 roles are very senior positions in GSK. They are one level down from the top leadership roles, which contains C-Suite appointments. It is not unbelievable that GSK would retain discretion to make direct appointments of such senior positions for talent management purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As the primary materials that Praveen relies on do not support his case that GSK could not have carried out a direct deployment of a Talent Appointment, it is not necessary to go into how the absence of documentary records could show that there were other candidates including Praveen or show that Praveen was not less qualified than Tess.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there was a breach of the direct deployment process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Praveen also objects to the direct deployment of Tess as a Talent Appointment, assuming that her deployment was valid, on the ground that Tamara, as the manager, failed to record her justification for not conducting an open application, as required by the Posting Policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I note that it is unclear on the wording of the Posting Policy, if it was intended to be a binding set of HR instructions.

Taken together, these lines suggest that the document sets out recommended practices which are not necessarily binding. The plaintiff accepts that this document is just for guidance.

</div> As set out above, the use of the term “must” in the Equality Policy does not mean that this line should be regarded to be a binding obligation. Moreover, if the Posting Policy is only a best practice or guidance, as accepted by the plaintiff, that would also mean that there is no binding HR instruction that required Tess to keep documentation. It would only be a breach of a recommended practice or guidance. That would present a far weaker case for a breach of “equal and inclusive treatment", than a breach of binding HR instructions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In any event, even if the Posting Policy was binding, under the Posting Policy, the “keeping” of such documentation is not couched as a condition that managers must fulfill before the Talent Appointment process can be used. The Posting Policy states that the “company may choose not to post a job when the following apply” and lists six situations in which the company may choose not to post a job. This is followed by the line “Managers who decide not to post a role based <span class="font-italic">on reasons listed above</span> should, following agreement with Human Resources, document their decision and record the justification for future reference” [emphasis added].

Tamara testified that she would have found Tess more suitable even if she had the opportunity to consider Praveen. She explained that Tess joined GSK in 1995 and had significant experience in GSK Consumer Healthcare’s largest and most successful division, Therapeutic Oral Health, which has footprints in more than 100 global markets.

We're talking 2 millions of pounds here. She was leading a very broad, 3 multi-functional team for about 12 months, in addition to her other work, to go do that because we were trying to ensure that that investment was working. It was highly visible. She was involved with also the integration planning when we went from GSK to Novartis, so she was seen as a real thought leader in the company. So it did not surprise me that she was selected. So think about it from a business perspective. She had the largest category, seen as the most developed expert strategist.

In forming the new Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture (“Consumer Healthcare JV”) between GSK and Pfizer, what was deemed to be fair and equitable was that individuals would only be allowed to apply for or be considered for roles in one geographic location (the “geographic pooling principle”). At the material time, Praveen was supporting both the Pain Relief Category and the NDH Category. In this regard, following the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV, it was intended that the NDH category would no longer exist, and a new Wellness category would be based in Warren (USA). On the “geographic pooling principle”, Praveen could only be considered for Wellness roles based in the USA. He was included in the pool of eligible candidates there for the LT-2 role of Expert Lead on Wellness, as he was then the Expert Lead for NDH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Rick and Tess interviewed Praveen for the position of the LT-2 role of Expert Lead on Wellness.

</div> The defendant objects to this as the breach of this document was never pleaded. Paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) sets out the Policies that the plaintiff relied on. The document “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” is not one of such documents. Furthermore, paragraph 16 of the SOC only refers to the defendant being bound by the ITMTC to abide by GSK “<span class="font-italic">Policies</span>” [emphasis in original]. This phrase “<span class="font-italic">Policies</span>” is defined at paragraph 13 of the SOC, which does not include the “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” document. It is trite law that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue: <span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 142 (“<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span>”) at [38]. <span class="font-italic">In Poh Lian Construction (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation) v Lauw Wisanggeni and others (Chia Quee Hock and others, third parties)</span> [2019] SGHC 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Poh Lian</span>”) it was held at [75] that it is only in very rare circumstances where “no prejudice is caused to the other party” or where “it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so” that a court should decide on the basis of unpleaded issues or claims, and that this is a high bar to meet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The plaintiff responds that <span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span> only applies where a party is advancing an entirely new case at trial. In <span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span>, it was found that the pleaded claim did not support a claim based on proprietary estoppel but one based on resulting trust. The claims involved significantly different factual underpinnings and involved more than pure issues of law. The plaintiff submitted that his pleading in relation to GSK policies is a general one, as he pleaded that GSK policies under cl 5.2 of the LOA “include all existing policies of GSK”. <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I note that the decision in <span class="font-italic">V</span><span class="font-italic"> Nithia </span>precludes matters “that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue”. The plaintiff has set out the GSK policies relied on at paragraph 13 of the SOC. His case on the breach of GSK policies in relation to the ITMTC, is stated at paragraph 16 of the SOC, which references paragraph 13 of the SOC. The "A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2" is not mentioned in paragraph 13 of the SOC. In my view, given the breadth of GSK policies, it cannot be said that all the GSK policies were put into issue with respect to all aspects of the plaintiff’s claim, simply because he pleaded that GSK policies under cl 5.2 of the LOA included all of GSK’s policies. That was in relation to the coverage of cl 5.2, and not his claim for breaches in relation to LT-2 roles. The plaintiff would have to specify which policy was breached by GSK for the LT-2 roles, in order for the defendant to know the case that it had to meet. That there was a breach of the processes set out in “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” in relation to LT-2 roles is effectively a new case, which was not made in the pleadings. The claim that GSK had breached the “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” was not even mentioned in Praveen’s affidavit of evidence in chief (“AEIC”). I hence agree with GSK that the unpleaded breach of “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” in relation to LT-2 roles should not be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In any event, I have also assessed the alleged breach of the “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2”, assuming that this claim was allowed, and find that it does not advance the plaintiff’s case. The document was enclosed as an attachment to an email in March 2019 from Paul Creedon to a small group of recipients within GSK.

</div>
</div> I note that the plaintiff’s pleaded case on LT-2 roles revolves around Tess’s alleged prejudice because of Praveen’s probe into her appointment, the other candidates being associated with Tess and of British nationality and systemic racial discrimination. The “geographic pooling principle” was not a material fact that directly responded to these claims. I accept the defendant’s submission that it supports the defendant’s further averment that the plaintiff is not suitable for the LT-2 roles, but it was not made in direct response to the plaintiff’s pleaded claims. Hence, the defendant should not be faulted for not pleading the “geographic pooling principle”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In any event, the plaintiff’s case is not advanced, even if the defendant is not allowed to rely on the “geographic pooling principle”. The plaintiff’s unpleaded case, is that there is a breach of the processes set out in “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2”. As I have found above, the “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” was only a planning document with limited circulation and not intended to apply as binding instructions for the LT-2 roles. Thus, GSK could not be said to be in breach of it. Given that the processes set out in “A&amp;S Approach LT-1 &amp; 2” are not a source of breach, whether there is a “geographic pooling principle” or not, becomes immaterial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiff further submits that if Tess’s evidence on the “geographic pooling principle” is accepted, that principle discriminated against Praveen. However, the evidence is that the “geographic pooling principle” did not result in the loss of roles that Praveen could apply for in Weybridge. Tess testified that the “geographic pooling principle” was a principle that GSK HR guided them on.

The notices of redundancy were issued to employees affected by the restructuring on different dates. The notice period would begin from the date of the issuance of the relevant notice of redundancy. The different dates on which the notices of redundancy were issued arose because GSK eliminated the roles in a gradual manner, rather than in one instance.

He then contended differently, that his complaint is that some were allowed to stay on longer for personal rather than operational reasons. However, Praveen himself was given an extension, from 14 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. GSK's staff, Jeen Sim, explained to him in her email that GSK gave him an extension to 30 June 2020 even if there was no business requirement, because of the Covid-19 situation. Beyond that, there would have to be business needs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Ultimately, Praveen did receive an extension to 30 June 2020, despite there being no contractual obligation or business need on the part of GSK to do so. Nor is there evidence that GSK treated Praveen unfairly in relation to his notice period, as retaliation for probing into GSK’s alleged improprieties regarding the LT-1 and LT-2 roles appointments.

MOM confirmed that “salary” under the Retrenchment Advisory is defined under s 2 of the Employment Act, which includes various other components of Praveen’s remuneration (including allowances) over and above the basic pay. GSK’s computation of the severance payment due to Praveen, which is based only on the Praveen’s base salary, is therefore a breach of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 GSK submits that there is no breach of the EA. In the first place, Praveen is not contractually entitled to any severance or redundancy payments. The EA does not contain any provisions which require GSK to make any severance payments to Praveen.

</div> It was provided that upon Praveen's signing and return of a “No Claims Acknowledgement and Undertaking” form which was enclosed with the February Redundancy Notice and Praveen's compliance with the terms in the February Redundancy Notice (read together with the January Redundancy Notice), he would be entitled to: (a) a severance payment of $144,716; and (b) pro-rated performance bonus of $35,781.70. The computation of the severance payment of $144,716 set out in the February Redundancy Notice was based on GSK's HR internal guidelines for Singapore, in particular, GSK’s redundancy policy for Singapore. This provided that severance payments to employees shall be based on the employee’s monthly basic salary (in particular, one month’s basic salary for each completed year of service). The formula would have been the product of the tenure of the employee's employment at GSK in years, and the monthly basic salary of the relevant employee. In Praveen's case, the severance payment of $144,716 was derived based on the number of years from 13 June 2014 to 30 June 2020 (6.05 years), multiplied by Praveen’s monthly salary of $23,920, which amounts to $144,716.40.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 GSK submits that Praveen's claim that he was entitled to a larger sum of severance payment based on Retrenchment Advisory is without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 First, there is no basis for Praveen to rely on Ruth's WA message for his allegation that GSK "abides" by the Retrenchment Advisory. Ruth's message does not create a contractual agreement or entitlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Second, the Retrenchment Advisory does not impose statutory obligations on employers in any manner. It expressly states that it is only meant to "assist and guide" employers: “The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment aims to assist and guide employers in managing their excess manpower, preserving jobs and conducting retrenchment exercises responsibly”. In <span class="font-italic">Han Hui Hui and others v Attorney-General</span> [2022] SGHC 141, the court held that an advisory issued by the Tripartite Alliance regarding COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces did not (a) have the force of law; (b) amount to a policy directive; or (c) carry any legal effect: [56]–[60]. In a similar vein, the Retrenchment Advisory does not amount to a policy directive or have legal effect. At its highest, the Retrenchment Advisory only provides guidance to employers regarding how they may (if they wished to) pay retrenchment benefits to their employees. Nothing in it directs or compels employers to pay retrenchment benefits to employees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Third, and in any event, GSK's computation of severance payment is aligned with the Retrenchment Advisory's benchmark for “2 weeks to one month salary per year of service, depending on the financial position of the company and taking into consideration the industry norm.” As explained in Ruth's WA message to Praveen dated 7 December 2019, GSK provides for the “top end” of the guidelines set out in the Retrenchment Advisory.

Ruth did not commit in any way to computing Praveen's severance in a particular way, or commit to what comprised the base compensation to be applied to the multiplier.

It is undisputed that GSK paid Praveen’s income taxes for YA2020 ($49,494.57) and YA2021 ($81,499) in the total sum of $130,993.57. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 This leaves the sum of $49,503.21 that is still withheld by GSK. There is no evidence that there were further taxes that GSK paid on behalf of Praveen.

This is because Praveen did not sign the No Claims Form, when it is a specific requirement of the Redundancy Notices that the GSK severance payment would be paid out only on Praveen’s signing of the No Claims Form.

The severance sum reflected in Praveen’s June 2020 pay-slip and the payment of $130,993.57 to the IRAS on Praveen’s behalf was a result of a mistake.

Even if GSK was mistaken in crediting the severance payment to Praveen, he has since changed his position and would be prejudiced if GSK’s claim for unjust enrichment is allowed.

To succeed in this, GSK must show that (a) Praveen had been enriched; (b) the enrichment was at the expense of GSK; (c) the enrichment was unjust; and (d) there are no relevant defences to the claim: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie</span> [2016] 3 SLR 845 (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming </span><span class="font-italic">Club</span>”) at [90]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 GSK relies here on mistake of fact, which is a well-established unjust enrichment factor.

</div>  She was Ruth’s manager and remained in GSK until June 2020.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Despite having notice about Praveen’s reservations about signing the No Claims Form, GSK proceeded to make two payments. First, the payment to IRAS for withholding tax in respect of Praveen’s severance payment. Second, to credit part of the severance payment to Praveen. There is no evidence that GSK was mistaken that Praveen had signed the No Claim Forms when it made the severance payment. In the absence of such evidence, it could also have been that GSK chose then to make such payment, and only decided to dispute the severance payment when Praveen brought his suit against GSK. I find that GSK has not proven that on the balance of probabilities, it made the payment under a mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Furthermore, even if GSK was mistaken that Praveen had signed the No Claim Forms, I am of the view that it unreasonably ran the risk of error by proceeding with payment of the severance sum without ascertaining if the No Claims Form had in fact been signed. I therefore dismiss GSK’s counterclaim against Praveen. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 In conclusion, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claims against the defendant for breach of the EA leading to Praveen not being able to secure roles in Unilever, or the LT-1 and LT-2 roles in GSK.
