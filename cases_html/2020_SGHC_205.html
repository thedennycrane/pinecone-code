Subsequently, RCMA and SEPPL entered into an agreement for RCMA to assume SEPPL’s market making obligations in exchange for a 70% share of all the incentive payments received by SEPPL from SP Services Ltd (“the Agreement”).

The COVID-19 Act was enacted in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it was intended “to give breathing space” to businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (see K Shanmugam, Minister for Law, “Second Reading Speech by Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, on the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill” (7 April 2020) at para 63, mlaw.gov.sg (accessed 10 September 2020)).

The said provision reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Definition of inability to pay debts</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) A company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a creditor by assignment or otherwise to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding $10,000 then due has served on the company by leaving at the registered office a demand under his hand or under the hand of his agent thereunto lawfully authorised requiring the company to pay the sum so due, and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It appeared from this provision that at the time the statutory demand is served on the company the debt must exceed $10,000. In this case, RCMA served the Statutory Demand on SEPPL for the payment of the debt sum of $11,568.88 which exceeded $10,000. Thereafter, SEPPL had three weeks from 21 November 2019 to pay this sum. However, SEPPL only paid $3,000 at the end of the three weeks (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 13 December 2019). Although the debt sum (including accrued interest) by then fell to $8,612.40 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, below the threshold amount of $10,000), it was not to the reasonable satisfaction of RCMA and RCMA thus lodged the present winding-up application on 18 December 2019. Therefore, RCMA had shown that s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act was satisfied notwithstanding that the amount of the debt fell below $10,000 at the time the present winding-up application was lodged. SEPPL was accordingly deemed to be insolvent under s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Regarding the Statutory Demand, I would like to mention that at the hearing where I allowed RCMA’s application to wind up SEPPL, I mistook the Statutory Demand to have included RCMA’s claim of $7,466,668.01 in Suit 191. Nevertheless, this was not a material error in my decision to grant RCMA’s application to wind up SEPPL.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">SEPPL was also insolvent under s 254(2)(c) of the Companies Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Section 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act states that a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]t is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts; and in determining whether a company is unable to pay its debts the Court shall take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This is a holistic and commercial inquiry into “the company’s position taken as a whole by reference to whether a person would expect that at some point the company would be unable to meet a liability” (see <span class="font-italic">Chip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi Mo and others </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 434 at [19]). It could involve the application of one or more of several tests, depending on the circumstances of the case. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong and another v Leow Boon Cher and others </span>[2011] SGHC 228 explained at [33], [36], [39] and [40]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 Despite the fact that no one single test is conclusive as a measure of solvency, it is commonly accepted that the two primary indicia of a company’s inability to pay debts are the cash flow test and the balance sheet test. For most purposes, it is the present inability to pay debts that is the crucial factor. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 The cash flow test deems a company insolvent when it cannot meet its obligations as and when they fall due.

It thus embraces both future debts, in the sense of liquidated sums due, and non-liquidated claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Similarly, Ang Cheng Hock J in <span class="font-italic">Seah Chee Wan and another v Connectus Group Pte Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 228 held at [63] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A company is unable to pay its debts, or insolvent, if it fails either the cash flow test or the balance sheet test … A company that has failed to meet a current demand for a debt already due fails the cash flow test, while a company which presents a deficit on an overall balancing of liabilities against assets fails the balance sheet test … No one test is dominant, and both tests may be relevant depending on the circumstances of the case.

</div> In an affidavit filed on behalf of SEPPL in respect of its JM application (“Mr Peloso’s JM Affidavit”), Mr Peloso stated that as at 31 July 2019, SEPPL’s cash balance amounted to $93,599.64 whereas its total current liabilities amounted to $1,845,662.12. Mr Peloso asserted unequivocally that this cash balance was “insufficient to satisfy [SEPPL’s] current third party liabilities”. This was supported by a copy of SEPPL’s unaudited management accounts (“the Management Accounts”).

In particular, it was undisputed that SEPPL owed a debt to RCMA in the form of the outstanding Costs and had been unable to fully discharge this debt. RCMA first requested for payment of the Costs in October 2019. In the 11 months between this initial request and the time of the hearing of the winding-up application, only $3,000 had been paid by SEPPL.

SEPPL’s failure to pay the outstanding Costs (and accrued interest) to RMCA amounted to a failure to meet a current demand for a debt already due. Based on SEPPL’s financial position in October 2019, this appeared to be one instance of a general inability to meet its financial obligations.

</div> In an affidavit filed on 21 October 2019, Mr Jotangia set out SEPPL’s balance sheet as at 30 September 2019 (“the September 2019 Balance Sheet”). The September 2019 Balance Sheet was only marginally more optimistic than the Management Accounts. SEPPL’s total assets had increased slightly to $377,342, whereas its total liabilities (excluding contingent liabilities) and total liabilities (including contingent liabilities) had decreased slightly to $2,021,530 and $10,263,369 respectively.

</div>  Since SEPPL’s business had been loss-making for the last seven months prior to 31 July 2019, it was dubious whether it could indeed achieve the profits projected by Mr Jotangia. Nevertheless, assuming Mr Jotangia’s projections were correct, by April 2020, SEPPL’s cash would increase by about $188,686. This number was obtained by subtracting from $216,708 (the amount of cash projected to be in SEPPL’s bank account in the week commencing on 12 April 2020) the sum of $28,022 (the amount of cash already in SEPPL’s bank account as at 30 September 2019).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It would mean that by April 2020, SEPPL’s total assets would have increased to approximately $566,028. This number was derived by adding $188,686 (the projected increase in cash assets) to $377,342 (the amount of SEPPL’s total assets as at 30 September 2019). Even then, SEPPL’s total assets would still be dwarfed by its total liabilities, both including and excluding contingent liabilities.

</div> Of course, this assumed there was minimal or no change in SEPPL’s total liabilities. This was a reasonable assumption given that about 70% of SEPPL’s total liabilities comprised RCMA’s contingent or prospective debt of $7,466,668.01.

</div> Since RCMA’s contingent or prospective debt remained unchanged till the date of the winding-up application, it was reasonable to conclude that there were no significant changes in SEPPL’s total liabilities up till the date of the winding-up hearing. Therefore, I concluded that even if SEPPL were to be profit-making in the period between September 2019 and April 2020, it would still be balance sheet insolvent in April 2020.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) SEPPL’s balance sheet after April 2020</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Thirdly, it was unlikely that this position changed significantly in the period between April 2020 and the hearing of the winding-up application. SEPPL had been loss-making in the seven months prior to 31 July 2019 and it was projected to make a modest profit at best in the months between September 2019 and April 2020. This was not likely to change significantly after April 2020. Rather, given the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was more likely that SEPPL suffered further financial losses. Therefore, I concluded that as at the date of the hearing of the winding-up application, SEPPL was balance sheet insolvent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Balance sheet produced by SEPPL</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In support of its contention that SEPPL was solvent, SEPPL produced a one-page balance sheet exhibited to Mr Peloso’s affidavit, purportedly showing SEPPL’s financial situation as at 30 June 2020 (“the June 2020 Balance Sheet”).

</div> However, I did not place much weight on this balance sheet for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 First, the provenance of the June 2020 Balance Sheet was unclear. Mr Peloso in his affidavit claimed that it had been prepared by a qualified chartered accountant, Edmund Ho (“Mr Ho”). Counsel for SEPPL emphasised that the June 2020 Balance Sheet was stated to be “[p]repared by” and signed by “Edmund Ho, CPA (Aust)”.

</div> The presence of a signature ostensibly belonging to Mr Ho was sorely insufficient. Neither could the court simply take the word of Mr Peloso and SEPPL’s counsel as a given. There was, thus, no evidence regarding how the June 2020 Balance Sheet actually came about. This lack of clarity on the origins of the June 2020 Balance Sheet undermined its reliability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Secondly, the court was not provided with any explanation of how the June 2020 Balance Sheet had been prepared, or what information had been relied on in its preparation. This was partly due to the lack of an accompanying affidavit by Mr Ho. Further, unlike the September 2019 Balance Sheet prepared by Mr Jotangia, the June 2020 Balance Sheet did not contain any notes to explain how the figures had been derived or what assumptions had been made in its preparation.

</div> This was especially concerning given several inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the June 2020 Balance Sheet, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  The June 2020 Balance Sheet did not reflect SEPPL’s current liabilities at all. It only set out non-current liabilities and there was no entry for current liabilities. This was unlike the balance sheet contained in the Management Accounts and the September 2019 Balance Sheet, which reflected total current liabilities of $1,845,662.12 and $1,702,982 respectively.

</div>
</div> In this respect, the June 2020 Balance Sheet appeared to be incomplete.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The June 2020 Balance Sheet also did not reflect contingent liabilities, including RCMA’s contingent or prospective debt of $7,466,668.01 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sum claimed in Suit 191). This was unlike the balance sheet contained in the Management Accounts and the September 2019 Balance Sheet, which reflected contingent liabilities of $8,241,838.55 and $8,241,839 respectively.

</div> If that was indeed the case, this sum should have been reflected as a current liability, given that it was a judgment debt already due and owing to Kashish pursuant to the default judgment Kashish obtained against SEPPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The aforementioned points in addition to the complete lack of explanation by Mr Ho, who apparently prepared the June 2020 Balance Sheet, led me to seriously doubt the veracity and reliability of the June 2020 Balance Sheet. In particular, the last point at [52(c)] was significant. If the sum of $927,594.61 was regarded as a current liability, it would mean that SEPPL’s total current liabilities exceeded its total current assets, assuming the other figures reflected in the June 2020 Balance Sheet were accurate. In other words, it would show that SEPPL was cash flow insolvent.

</div> While there may have been a reason for labelling the sum of $927,594.61 as “Other liabilities”, this was not made known to the court due to the lack of any accompanying explanation by Mr Ho, who allegedly prepared the June 2020 Balance Sheet.

Comparing the June 2020 Balance Sheet to the September 2019 Balance Sheet, in less than a year, SEPPL’s total liabilities (excluding contingent liabilities) had reduced from $2,021,530 to $1,214,337.48, and its fixed assets increased from zero to $934,058.77.

Instead, I concluded from the Management Accounts and the September 2019 Balance Sheet, as well as the affidavits filed on behalf of SEPPL in its JM Application, that SEPPL was balance sheet insolvent and had been balance sheet insolvent since at least July 2019. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on whether SEPPL was unable to pay its debts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the above reasons, I concluded that SEPPL was deemed to be insolvent under s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act due to its failure to satisfy the Statutory Demand.

</div> It was only in this present winding-up application that SEPPL made an about-turn on its financial position, based solely on the June 2020 Balance Sheet. However, I did not find the June 2020 Balance Sheet to be a reliable basis for assessing SEPPL’s financial situation. Rather, the documents and affidavits filed on behalf of SEPPL in its JM application suggested that it was insolvent at the time the JM application was made, and continued to be insolvent up till the hearing of the present winding-up application. If indeed SEPPL was solvent as shown by the June 2020 Balance Sheet, how was it that SEPPL could not pay the small outstanding sum of $8,973.41?

In <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 827, the Court of Appeal opined at [31] that “the notion of unfairness lies at the heart of the ‘just and equitable’ jurisdiction in s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)”. As Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Summit Co (S) Pte Ltd v Pacific Biosciences Pte Ltd </span>[2006] SGHC 190 (“<span class="font-italic">Summit</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>observed at [5], the objective test for unfairness is “whether a reasonable bystander observing the consequences of their conduct would regard it as having unfairly prejudiced the petitioner’s interests”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 One instance in which the court may grant a just and equitable winding-up is when there is a loss of confidence in the directors on account of their lack of probity in the conduct and management of the company affairs (see <span class="font-italic">Chong Choon Chai and another v Tan Gee Cheng and another </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 685 at [9], citing <span class="font-italic">Loch v John Blackwood, Ltd </span>[1924] AC 783). However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chow Kok Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi and another </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 held at [15] and [17] that grounds for the court to exercise its “just and equitable” jurisdiction are “not a closed list”. Rather, the “concept of ‘just and equitable’ is a dynamic one and [the court] should not circumscribe its scope by reference to case law”. In this vein, the Court of Appeal (at [14]) cited <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Blériot Manufacturing Aircraft Company (Limited) </span>(1916) 32 TLR 253, where Neville J remarked at 255 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The words ‘just and equitable’ are words of the widest significance, and do not limit the jurisdiction of the Court to any case.

Therefore, the withdrawals were made with the knowledge that they were, or could be, in breach of the Injunction. In respect of the withdrawal of $1.5m made on 24 September 2018, Mr Peloso admitted in his JM Affidavit that “this sum should not have been transferred out of the OCBC Account” and “the loan to SEEAPL in September 2018 should not have been made”.

He was conscious that removing the sum constituted a breach of the terms of the RCMA injunction. Still, he proceeded to withdraw the sum of money from the OCBC Account. Mr Peloso’s justification for defying a clear court order (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the RCMA Injunction) was that SEEAPL ‘urgently required monies to pay a contractor’ and that ‘the funds in SEPPL’s OCBC Account were the only option available at the time’. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I also found it significant that large sums of money were withdrawn from the OCBC Account not once, but at least four times in the period between 24 September 2018 and 17 December 2018. These evinced a blatant disregard for the Injunction. Further, the last three withdrawals transferred all of the moneys in the OCBC Account to the DBS Account, from which they were subsequently garnished by Kashish. In other words, these transfers ultimately led to the diminishing of the Funds despite the Injunction.

As I observed above, the series of events leading to the diminishing of the Funds began with Mr Peloso transferring over $6m from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account, in spite of the Injunction. Further, it was Mr Peloso who informed Kashish of the DBS Account by sending Kashish a copy of a bank statement for the DBS Account for the month of December 2018.

Further, this explanation was not even provided to the court in this winding-up application. It could only be found in Mr Peloso’s JM Affidavit.

Some inconsistencies highlighted by RMCA were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Kashish is a UAE-entity ostensibly engaged in general wholesale trade of commodities and products. As RCMA pointed out, it was “bizarre” that such a company would enter into CFDs with SEPPL in relation to wholesale electricity prices in Singapore.

They suggested that SEPPL had intentionally diverted moneys from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account in seemingly wilful breach of the Injunction. This appeared to be done in order to dissipate the moneys through a sham suit by Kashish, which was allowed in default of SEPPL’s appearance and enforced by a garnishee order against the DBS Account. The undisputed outcome of this series of events was that the Funds meant to be enjoined under the Injunction for RCMA’s benefit were ultimately diminished and dissipated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Most importantly, none of these conclusions were challenged by SEPPL, save for its submission that they were the subject of committal proceedings and Gill JC had made his decision in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>on incomplete evidence. If the evidence was indeed incomplete, SEPPL should have produced more evidence to satisfactorily explain the abovementioned suspicious circumstances. The failure to do so reinforced the conclusion that the dealings with the Funds were less than above-board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For these reasons, I considered this a case where the lack of probity in the conduct and management of the company’s affairs justified a winding-up of the company. Mr Peloso was SEPPL’s sole director and played a major role in the diminishing of the Funds. Further, SEPPL’s conduct in dealing with and diminishing the Funds unfairly prejudiced RCMA’s interests. RCMA had secured some degree of security for itself in the form of a court-ordered Injunction, only for the Injunction to be blatantly disregarded by SEPPL. Moreover, there was also an element of subterfuge and deception involved in the diminishing of the Funds. The evidence suggested that not only did SEPPL and Kashish withhold significant information regarding the garnishee application and the Injunction from the court and RCMA, the basis of the garnishee application (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the CFD trades) were themselves a sham intended to deceive the court into allowing the garnishment of the DBS Account. This was highly egregious and extremely unfair towards RCMA. In this context, it would be just and equitable to wind up SEPPL and appoint a liquidator to investigate any alleged wrongdoing on the part of SEPPL and/or its officers, as well as take any necessary action, in the interests of all of SEPPL’s creditors, including RCMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Therefore, I found that the ground for winding-up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act had also been established, and it was just and equitable for SEPPL to be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disputed debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 SEPPL submitted that the court should not exercise its power to order a winding-up because RCMA’s debt of $7,466,668.01 was a disputed debt and the subject of ongoing proceedings in Suit 191. SEPPL further submitted that RCMA had an ulterior motive in filing the present winding-up application, namely, to stifle SEPPL’s counterclaim in Suit 191 and facilitate the adjudication of RCMA’s claims against SEPPL through the liquidator nominated by RCMA.

</div> This was evident from the manner in which SEPPL conducted itself in respect of Suit 191, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The trial for Suit 191 had been fixed for hearing from 27 August 2019 to 30 August 2019. However, on 2 July 2019, the day that parties were expected to exchange affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”), SEPPL’s solicitors applied to discharge themselves from acting for SEPPL in Suit 191. This was notwithstanding the fact that solicitors from the same firm subsequently represented SEPPL in its JM and IJM applications in August and September 2019.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 10 July 2019, SEPPL applied for Mr Peloso to represent SEPPL in Suit 191. This application was granted on 24 July 2019, subject to certain conditions. However, neither Mr Peloso nor SEPPL complied with these conditions. Consequently, SEPPL is currently unrepresented in Suit 191.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Peloso informed the learned assistant registrar during a pre-trial conference on 25 July 2019 that he required six to eight weeks to file the AEICs on behalf of SEPPL. Hence, the trial dates were vacated. However, about four weeks later, on 21 August 2019, SEPPL filed its JM application. This further delayed the hearing of the trial of Suit 191. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Although SEPPL’s counsel contended that SEPPL had indicated to him that it would “likely appoint [him] or engage [him] to act for [SEPPL] in Suit 191”,

</div> all of this was yet again, evidence from the Bar. There was nothing from SEPPL to explain the above circumstances suggesting that it was not genuinely intending to dispute RCMA’s claim by way of a full trial in Suit 191. This was reinforced by the above conclusions regarding SEPPL’s dealings with the Funds in apparent breach of the Injunction (ordered as a temporary remedy for RCMA in Suit 191), which indicated a complete disregard for the court’s process. Thus, the circumstances in totality suggested to me that SEPPL was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in defending its dispute of RCMA’s debt and pursuing its counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For these reasons, I did not consider that there was a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute in respect of RCMA’s debt of $7,466,668.01.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the court should order a winding-up even if there was a substantial and bona fide dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Even if there was a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute regarding RCMA’s debt, I was of the view that exceptional circumstances existed justifying the winding-up of SEPPL. In this regard, several English authorities were instructive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The first case was <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Claybridge Shipping Co SA </span>[1997] 1 BCLC 572 (“<span class="font-italic">Claybridge</span>”), which concerned a disputed debt held by creditors seeking to wind up a company. In the English Court of Appeal case, Oliver LJ came to the conclusion that the disputed debt was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or of such substantiality to warrant the winding-up petition to be struck out. He went on to explain at 579 that the dismissal of winding-up petitions involving disputed debts was a rule of <span class="font-italic">practice</span>, rather than a rule of <span class="font-italic">law</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he refusal of the court to entertain cases where the underlying debt is said to be disputed is, in my judgment, a matter of practice only. It is not, in general, convenient that the very status of the petitioner to proceed with his petition should be fought out on a winding-up petition. But <span class="font-italic">the court must, I think, remain flexible in its approach to such cases</span>. There may well be cases where to compel the creditor to go off to another division of the court to establish his debt would <span class="font-italic">effectively deprive him of any remedy at all</span>. … The court must, I think, reserve to itself the right to determine disputes – even perhaps in some cases substantial disputes – where this can be done without undue inconvenience and where the position of the company … is such that <span class="font-italic">the likely result in effect of striking ou</span><span class="font-italic">t the petition would be that the creditor, if he established his debt, would lose his remedy altogether</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 This was approved in another English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Alipour v Ary and </span><span class="font-italic">Another </span>[1997] 1 WLR 534, a case involving a disputed debt of the creditor in an application to wind up a company.

(1) A creditor’s petition based on a disputed debt will normally be dismissed.

However, Warren J further considered at [136] that even if the debt was <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>disputed on substantial grounds, he would nonetheless make a winding-up order as exceptional circumstances existed in that case. The exceptional circumstances in that case were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The evidence showed that the company was clearly insolvent even if the debt were not owed to the petitioner (see <span class="font-italic">GBI Investments </span>at [160]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even if the petitioner was not a creditor by reason of the disputed debt, it would still be a creditor in relation to its unpaid costs (see <span class="font-italic">GBI Investments </span>at [161]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) No prejudice would be caused to the company if the winding-up order were made, as the company’s only function was to hold certain bearer shares and it was effectively dormant (see <span class="font-italic">GBI Investments </span>at [162]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The petitioner would be without an adequate remedy unless a winding-up order were made. Once the provisional liquidators were discharged, the controllers of the company would be able to deal freely with the company’s assets. Consequently, if and when the petitioner eventually established its claim, there would be no assets left to satisfy its claim in damages. Warren J considered this the most important factor in his analysis. While the petitioner could seek injunctive relief against the company’s controllers, Warren J opined that a winding-up order would achieve better justice for the company (see <span class="font-italic">GBI Investments </span>at [163] and [164]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) A practical advantage of winding-up was that the liquidator would be able and willing to assess the petitioner’s claims and resolve any outstanding issues within the context of a winding-up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The English position is that the court has the discretion to order a winding-up notwithstanding that there is a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute in respect of the debt. However, this discretion should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. In exercising this discretion, the English courts have emphasized the need to avoid injustice to the petitioner and the respondent company, in particular, by ensuring that the petitioner is not deprived of a remedy if it eventually establishes its debt against the respondent company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 This issue has yet to be canvassed by the Singapore courts. In my view, the English approach provides the court with the flexibility to deal with <span class="font-italic">exceptional </span>cases where the application of the general rule would lead to injustice. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 (“<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [5], the court’s power to order a winding-up is a discretionary one. This “discretion is a wide one and the cases interpreting it should not be allowed to fetter it by rigid rules nor detract from its generality” (see <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporation</span><span class="font-italic">s Law</span> (Walter Woon gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2019) at paras 755–800). In the exercise of this discretion, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case and do what is just and equitable in the interest of all the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In this case, I considered that there were exceptional circumstances justifying the winding-up of SEPPL, even if there was a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute in relation to RCMA’s debt. First, as in <span class="font-italic">GBI Investments</span>, I concluded that SEPPL was clearly insolvent, regardless of whether RCMA’s disputed debt of $7,466,668.01 was taken into account (see [41] and [49] above).

</div>
</div> In this regard, I considered that SEPPL itself had lodged JM and IJM applications just a year before, on the basis that it was insolvent and was unable to repay its debts. The outcome which SEPPL purportedly expected from its JM and IJM applications was that SEPPL would eventually wind down its business.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-3ecac19a-d622-4adf-b3d4-35217855fe19" data-toggle="modal" type="button">77</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> Thus, as far as SEPPL’s or its related companies’ reputations or businesses were concerned, there would be minimal impact given the recency of the JM application. There was also no evidence that a winding-up order would result in the drastic consequences alluded to in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [17]–[19], <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cross-defaults, pushing the business group into risk of insolvency, or serious impact on other economic and social interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Thirdly, there was a serious risk that if the winding-up application were dismissed and RCMA forced to continue with Suit 191, RCMA would eventually be left without a remedy even if it successfully proved its claim against SEPPL. A critical consideration was the fact that the Funds, which were the subject of a court-ordered Injunction, had already been completely diminished. In this regard, the diminishing of assets was no longer a mere risk – it had already eventuated in respect of most of SEPPL’s assets.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-c735df64-ebc7-4aa0-aacc-94f02cb9af05" data-toggle="modal" type="button">78</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> Further, the diminishing of the Funds occurred in highly suspicious circumstances and were occasioned by the actions of Mr Peloso through what appeared to be multiple wilful breaches of the Injunction. Moreover, SEPPL’s conduct of deliberate procrastination in Suit 191 as detailed at [78] above suggested that it had no genuine intention of going to trial to resolve RCMA’s disputed debt. This only served to reinforce my concern that RCMA should not be made to go through a drawn-out and fruitless trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Finally, the corollary of winding up SEPPL was that a liquidator could be appointed over SEPPL.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-c7957325-1f10-4ac4-b17e-8ff802fbe0ed" data-toggle="modal" type="button">79</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> The liquidator could conduct the relevant investigations into the dealings with the Funds and take further action, if necessary, in the interests of the creditors. Moreover, from a practical perspective, the liquidator would be able to assess the merits of SEPPL’s defence and counterclaim in Suit 191, and pursue the action, negotiate with RCMA, or take further action as required. The liquidator could also assess RCMA’s claims against SEPPL and determine the value to be attributed to RCMA’s contingent or prospective debt.

</div>
</div> Given the highly suspicious circumstances canvassed above, it was preferable for the liquidator, an officer of the court, to take over the reins of SEPPL in the abovementioned respects. For the same reason, SEPPL’s submission that the liquidator’s appointment would stifle SEPPL’s counterclaim in Suit 191 and facilitate the adjudication of RCMA’s claim against SEPPL was misplaced. Instead, the appointment of a liquidator would not only provide greater transparency for the benefit of SEPPL’s creditors, it would also be to SEPPL’s benefit in so far as it would be able to recover any moneys wrongfully dissipated by its previous controllers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For the above reasons, I found that even if SEPPL had shown that there was a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute in respect of RCMA’s debt of $7,466,668.01, there were exceptional circumstances justifying the winding-up of SEPPL.

Moreover, I was of the view that SEPPL’s dispute regarding RCMA’s debt of $7,466,668.01 was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. Furthermore, even if there was a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute in respect of RCMA’s debt of $7,466,668.01, there were exceptional circumstances that justified the winding-up of SEPPL.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Therefore, I granted RCMA’s application and ordered that SEPPL be wound up and a liquidator appointed over SEPPL. I further ordered costs to be fixed at $9,500 all-in to be paid to RCMA out of SEPPL’s assets.   </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohammed Reza s/o Mohammed Riaz, Kwek Yuan Justin and Victoria Katerina Jones (JWS Asia Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Chee San (TanLim Partnership) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The non-party absent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
