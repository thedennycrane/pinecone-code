</div>  This serves to reduce the sums prior to 7 March 2022 to some S$450,000 – in contrast to the sum of S$266,127 actually incurred prior to 4 January 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13  In any event, say the Defendants, since the Defendants have now provided a detailed costs schedule it is no longer appropriate to rely on estimates. So far as concerns pre-transfer costs, Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2013 (“Appendix G”) will serve to act as a regulator on any costs incurred above any estimate in the CMP and, in the case of post-transfer costs, Rule 46 proceeds on the basis of the costs actually incurred with the burden being placed at the outset on the successful party to demonstrate that its claimed costs are reasonable: <span class="font-italic">Senda</span><span class="font-italic"> International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd</span> [2023] 1 SLR 96<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Senda</span>”) at [72]–[73]. Once done, the evidential burden to show the extent to which the claimed costs are unreasonable will transfer to the losing party: <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> at [75]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In our judgment, the correct approach in the SICC where there is a significant difference between the costs actually incurred as set out in an appropriately detailed costs schedule and the anticipated future costs set out in a CMP is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The detailed costs schedule will be accepted as being accurate both as to the costs incurred and the date on which they were incurred. The burden will then be on the paying party to demonstrate that the detailed costs statement is inaccurate.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In so far as it is suggested by the paying party that the costs incurred are excessive, rather than inaccurate: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) in the case of an award of pre-transfer costs, any excess will be moderated both by reference to Appendix G and, if appropriate, by reference to the costs estimated in the CMP.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In the case of post-transfer costs, where reasonableness is the test, one of the factors that the court may take into account in the circumstances of any given case is the contrast between the costs actually incurred and the costs estimated in the CMP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In the present case the Costs Schedule shows that pre-transfer costs were S$266,127 and that post-transfer costs were S$921,903. For the reasons given it is these figures rather than the figures estimated in the CMP that form the basis of the assessment of both pre- and post- transfer costs. The Plaintiffs’ contention that a disproportionately large amount of fees had been incorrectly allocated to the post-transfer stage was based on the figure of S$850,000 originally stated in the CMP as being attributable to the pre-transfer stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 This has now been reduced to the figure of S$450,000 due to the erroneous inclusion of the striking out costs (see [12] above). This was a figure assessed as at 7 March 2022 whereas the figure of S$266,127 in the Costs Schedule were for pre-transfer costs assessed up to 4th January 2022, which suggests that the roughly the same amount of fees were incurred in the intervening period as had been incurred in the entire period from the commencement of the litigation until the date of transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Plaintiffs point to this as being an anomaly which serves to demonstrate that the Costs Schedule is inaccurate. This, they say, should be taken in conjunction with the fact that the ratio between the fees incurred pre-and post-transfer if the Costs Schedule is correct is 22/78% which they say “beggars belief”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 It is a feature of the litigation process which leads to an oral hearing, in this case a three-day hearing involving two different sets of Plaintiffs, separately represented, that the fees incurred would be likely to be back-loaded, more being spent later in the proceedings than in the former. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In assessing whether this was a case where fees were significantly back-loaded, the Court might have been assisted by being provided with a Costs Statement by each set of Plaintiffs which would serve to demonstrate the balance between the pre-transfer and post-transfer fees incurred by them: <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> at [75] and [90]. The Plaintiffs were asked by the Defendants to do this but declined, claiming for various reasons that their costs would not be comparable.

This is a means by which they might have sought to do so but they have elected not to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20  Taking all this into account, whilst we accept that the Plaintiffs’ submissions do raise some concerns as to the accuracy of the Costs Schedule, these are not sufficient for us to cease to place reliance on the Schedule as being an accurate analysis of when the fees were incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 We shall therefore proceed on the basis that the correct division of fees pre- and post- transfer is 22/78%.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assessment of pre-transfer costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22  Under Order 59 of the ROC 2014 the court applies an objective standard, based on what ought to be recoverable by a successful party in litigation of the nature in question regardless of the level of costs actually incurred. The underlying policy consideration is to ensure that litigants with meritorious claims are not deterred or prevented from seeking justice by the possibility, if the claim fails, of having to pay large sums by way of costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 With this in mind, Appendix G sets out guidelines as to the appropriate sums to be awarded in various cases unless a party successfully invites the court to depart from it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the present case the Plaintiffs assert that, if Appendix G is to be applied, the total award for pre-transfer costs should be S$50,000 with each set of Plaintiffs paying S$25,000.

Hence, at the top end of the range, had the matter proceeded in the High Court the maximum sum that could have been awarded under Appendix G would have been S$120,000.

</div>
</div>
</div> the Defendants put forward the following reasons for contending that this is a complex case justifying a departure from Appendix G:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The complexity of the case is demonstrated by the fact that a three-judge coram was constituted to hear the cases over three days.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The issues were complex requiring the consideration of some 20 interlocking agreements between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The factual matrix was complicated due to the long history of disputes between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Complex issues of both Singapore and Korean law arose which required submissions from both Singaporean and Korean counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As is clear from the Substantive Judgment, the matters raised, both factually and legally, were exceedingly complex and the arguments were wide ranging. Extensive written submissions were provided notwithstanding which three full days were required for oral arguments. In consequence we are satisfied that this is a case where, under paragraph 3 of Appendix G it would be appropriate to depart from a strict application of the guidelines. The actual fees incurred pre-transfer were S$266,127 and Appendix G would suggest that only S$26,400 should be awarded. Even having regard to the contention that these fees were in excess of those which should have been incurred, it can be seen that Appendix G would serve to give a very limited return to a party that was wholly successful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Applying the objective standard required by Order 59, we do not consider in the circumstances of this case that a return of less than 12% by way of an award over the costs actually incurred would be seen to be objectively reasonable. A figure of around 25% would seem to us to be more appropriate which leads to a conclusion that an award of S$50,000, as suggested by all parties would constitute a proper award for pre-transfer fees although for the reasons given, we reach this figure for different reasons from those proposed by any of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Each set of Plaintiffs shall therefore pay S$25,000 to the Defendants in relation to pre-transfer costs. We shall consider the question of pre-transfer disbursements after deciding the question of post-transfer costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assessment of post-transfer costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The correct approach to assessing post-transfer costs pursuant to Rule 46 has now been considered in a number of cases, particularly in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span><span class="font-italic">, Lao Holding NV v Government of Lao PDR</span> [2022] SGHC(I) 6 and <span class="font-italic">CBX v CBZ</span> [2022] 1 SLR 88. All the parties accepted that the starting point was a subjective enquiry into what costs were actually incurred by the successful party and then to apply a test of reasonableness to reach an appropriate award. The test of reasonableness is to be guided by the considerations outlined in Paragraph 152(3) of the Singapore International Commercial Court Practice Directions Part XXIII Costs which state: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) In relation to sub-paragraph (2)(b)(ii) above, the circumstances which the Court may take into consideration in ordering reasonable costs of any application or proceeding under Order 110, Rule 46(1) of the Rules of Court include: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the conduct of all parties, including in particular – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) conduct before, as well as during the application or proceeding; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) the manner in which a party has pursued or contested a particular allegation or issue; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the amount or value of any claim involved; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the complexity or difficulty of the subject matter involved; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the skill, expertise and specialised knowledge involved; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) the novelty of any questions raised; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) the time and effort expended on the application or proceeding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In a case such as the present, these considerations mandate a similar approach to those that have been considered in [25] above in relation to any departure from Appendix G. In our judgment, the Defendants did not act unreasonably in the manner in which they defended any of the claims made against them. These were high value claims of significant complexity which raised questions both of Singapore and Korean law and the manner in which the Korean law aspects were addressed by having Korean law experts addressing the Court was both proportionate and helpful. It is not surprising that the matters raised require three days of oral hearings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In such a case it is understandable that the costs incurred will be high and the correct approach is to have regard as a starting point to the sums actually incurred and then seek to identify any aspect of costs which could be said to be unreasonably incurred, the burden being on the losing party to do this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As indicated above at [9], the Plaintiffs’ primary contention is that the magnitude of fees incurred post-transfer (S$921,903) was almost three times higher than the sum estimated in the CMP (S$350,000). This is a factor which merits serious consideration in the case of an application to set aside an arbitral award where there is unlikely to be any oral evidence, and the route to and likely costs involved in a substantive hearing will be relatively clear from the outset. In these circumstances, experienced solicitors should be well able to assess future costs with a greater degree of accuracy than in the case of a witness trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 This contention would however carry far greater weight had the Plaintiffs themselves filed Costs Schedules showing that the fees that they had incurred more nearly reflected the sum projected by the Defendants in the CMP. The Defendants requested that they should do this but the Plaintiffs declined to do so. Without seeing any Costs Schedules from the Plaintiffs, it is impossible to assess what weight, if any, should properly be attributed to the suggestion that the costs they had incurred did not properly reflect the costs that the Defendants should reasonably have incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Senda</span>, the learned Sundaresh Menon CJ observed (at [75]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75 Once the successful party has adduced the requisite level of information in support of the contention that its claimed costs are “reasonable costs”, the evidential burden shifts to the unsuccessful party to adduce evidence to show that the claimed costs are not “reasonable costs”. An inquiry into “reasonable costs” under O 110 r 46 is a subjective one concerning the question of what level of incurred costs can be said to be appropriate in the particular case, and against that yardstick, whether and to what extent the successful party’s claimed costs can be said to be “reasonable costs” (see [52] above). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Hence, the best evidence that the unsuccessful party can adduce to discharge its evidential burden will often be information as to the costs that it had correspondingly incurred for the matter, which might well be a sound proxy by which the trial court can determine what the appropriate level of costs in the particular case is.</span> The court may of course do so in other or additional ways as well (see, for example, [79] below). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 We have accordingly been denied this “best evidence” and can therefore only conclude that the provision of Costs Schedules would not have supported the Plaintiffs’ case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Further, having made the submission that the better view of what constituted reasonable costs was the sum of S$350,000 quoted in Defendants’ CMP, the Plaintiffs went on to submit that even these figures should be reduced by 70% on the basis that such a reduction was in line with reductions which had been made in other equivalent cases. This is not a logically sound submission unless the Plaintiffs were able to demonstrate that there were elements of unreasonableness in the figure in the CMP. The purpose of referring us to that figure was to indicate what a reasonable figure might have been, not to indicate that even that figure would necessarily be unreasonably high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We therefore reject the Plaintiffs’ assertion that the figure in the CMP represents a reasonable figure for post-transfer costs – far less that there should be any deduction from that figure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The starting point must be the sums actually incurred. In their Reply Costs Submissions, the Defendants submitted that “they should be compensated 70% of their actual post-transfer fees, which amounts to S$645,332”.

</div> Whilst this deduction equates to that in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> at first instance, it has to be remembered that a discount of this magnitude in <span class="font-italic">Senda</span> was justified in part by the fact that the successful party has acted unreasonably in pursuing a particular argument: <span class="font-italic">Kiri Industries Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Senda International Capital Ltd and another</span> [2022] 3 SLR 174 at [90]–[93].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 There can be no justification under Rule 46 for applying a deduction in one case on the basis that this equates to a deduction given in a previous case unless the factual matrix is also equivalent.

Had it not been for the Defendants’ concession that they should be compensated for 70% of their post-transfer fees we would have approached the matter afresh. However we have concluded that it would be appropriate, where one party has made a concession of this nature so that the other parties have not had an opportunity to consider a different figure, to accept the concession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 70% of the Defendants’ post-transfer fees amounts to S$645,332.10 so each set of the Plaintiffs will pay S$322,666.05 in respect of the Defendants’ post-transfer fees.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disbursements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the normal course of events, it is usual for the losing party to pay the winning parties’ disbursements in full as they relate to unavoidable charges incurred in the course of litigation such as filing fees, translation fees, searches and photocopying.

Pre-transfer these were KRW30,000,000 for the fees of the Defendants’ Korean law expert, Professor Kwon, KRW85,683,400 in respect of the professional fees of the Korean counsel retained by the Defendants, KL, together with KRW24,058,650 in relation to translation and notary fees. In the case of post-transfer, these sums were KRW35,000,000 for Professor Kwon and KRW150,992,600 in fees for KL, plus KRW7,438,026 in relation to disbursements of the Korean lawyers and KRW1,654,500 for notary fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The parties did not deal separately with any issues over disbursements in their initial written submissions.

The purpose of engaging KL was for them to assist Professor Kwon prepare his report and submissions. Had this not been done, the Defendants’ Singapore Counsel would have had to perform that role.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We do not accept that the involvement of KL was a luxury. In some respects it must have taken the burden of preparing Professor Kwon’s reports and submissions off Singapore Counsel and reduced the overall costs owing to the absence of any language barrier but, having regard to Professor Kwon’s command of the English language, this would not have been ideal. Doing the best we can on the information available to us, we have concluded that only 25% of KL’s fees and disbursements should be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Dealing first with the pre-transfer fees, these amounted to KRW85,683,400, 25% of which is KRW21,420,850. (This equates roughly to S$22,000). However any allowance in relation to the fees incurred pre-transfer falls to be assessed on the basis of the uplift to the Appendix G award considered in [31] above, which in turn was 25% of fees incurred. This leads to a figure of KRW5,355,212 to be paid by each set of Plaintiffs in equal shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In relation to post-transfer fees, the sum involved is KRW150,992,600, 25% of which is KRW37,748,150 (equating approximately to S$40,000). For the reasons given in [44] above the Plaintiffs should pay in equal shares 70% of this sum, which is KRW26,423,705.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This leaves the sum of KRW7,438,026 claimed by way of disbursements. By parity of reasoning with [51] above, 25% of these should be paid in full, KRW1,859,506, again in equal parts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Each set of Plaintiffs, CNA and CND/CNE shall pay the Defendants the following sums by way of costs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Pre-transfer costs:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Fees owing to the Defendants’ Singaporean counsel: S$25,000.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Fees owing to the Defendants’ Korean counsel, KL: KRW2,677,606.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Post-transfer costs:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Fees owing to the Defendants’ Singaporean counsel: S$322,666.05.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Fees owing to the Defendants’ Korean counsel, KL: KRW13,211,852.50.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Disbursements: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) “Normal” disbursements in Singapore dollars for the entire period (including pre- and post- transfer): S$33,938.50.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Professor Kwon’s fees and attendant costs for the entire period (including pre- and post- transfer): KRW45,356,575.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Disbursements of Korean counsel and Professor Kwon post-transfer (to be divided equally): KRW929,753.25.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Simon Thorley<br/>International Judge</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Yuko Miyazaki<br/>International Judge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><br/></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cavinder Bull SC, Tan Yuan Kheng (Chen Yuanqing), Lea Woon Yee, Tan Jui Yang, Benedict and Kenneth Sean Teo Hao Jin (Drew &amp; Napier LLC), Junwoo Kim (alias Junu Kim) and Han Gil Lee (Bae, Kim &amp; Lee LLC) (Korean law) for the plaintiff in SIC/OS 2/2022 and SIC/OS 5/2022;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Toby Landau KC (Duxton Hill Chambers) (instructed), Rachel Low Tze-Lynn (Rachel Low LLC) (instructed), Zhuo Jiaxiang and Alston Yeong (Providence Law LLC), Sunyoung Kim and Yoo Lim Oh (Lee &amp; Ko) (instructed), Ing Loong Yang and Chi Ho Kwan (Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP) (instructing) (Korean law) for the plaintiffs in SIC/OS 3/2022 and SIC/OS 4/2022;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Hock Keng, Chen Chi and Tang Xi-Rui, Charlotte (WongPartnership LLP), Prof Kwon Young Joon (Seoul National University) (instructed), Lee Eun Ngyung (KL Partners) (instructing) (Korean law) for the defendants in SIC/OS 2 to 5/2022.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
