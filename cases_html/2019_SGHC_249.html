</div> However, as the Investor had not been paid the sums under those Certificates, it commenced the Arbitration proceedings on 23 February 2017 pursuant to the Bilateral Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules. On that same day, the Investor also nominated its party-appointed arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I pause here to note that it is of no small significance that the defendant in OS 685 (the Investor, and who is the party seeking to admit Mr Gearing) is the <span class="font-italic">claimant</span> in the underlying Arbitration, while the plaintiff in OS 685 (the State) is the defendant in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 1 May 2017, the Investor wrote to the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) to appoint the State’s party-appointed arbitrator and the presiding arbitrator of the arbitral tribunal. There were some difficulties with the State’s initial nominee for its party-appointed arbitrator. Eventually, on 31 October 2017, the PCA confirmed the State’s party-appointed arbitrator. On 3 November 2017, using the list procedure in Art 8(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed the presiding arbitrator (“the Presiding Arbitrator”) and the Arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”) was constituted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The State objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. It raised, among other things, four objections:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Tribunal was improperly constituted under the procedure prescribed in the Bilateral Treaty read with the UNCITRAL Rules (“the first objection”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Investor’s claims were barred under the Bilateral Treaty, as the Investor’s subsidiaries have raised similar claims in the foreign State’s court (“the second objection”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Investor’s claims are time-barred under the Bilateral Treaty (“the third objection”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the Investor’s claims are contractual in nature under the MOU and subject to an exclusive jurisdiction clause under the MOU that prevents it from commencing the proceedings in the underlying Arbitration (“the fourth objection”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Mr Gearing was the lead counsel before the Tribunal for the jurisdictional hearings. On 29 April 2019, the Tribunal rendered a 131-page decision (“the Decision”) unanimously rejecting the State’s objections and affirming its own jurisdiction to hear the Investor’s claims. In OS 685, the State applied to set aside the Decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The present application is for Mr Gearing to be admitted to represent the defendant in OS 685 (“the Investor”) and to urge the court in OS 685 to affirm the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ad hoc admissions regime</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In an application to admit a foreign senior counsel under s 15 of the Act, the court undertakes a two-stage sequential inquiry: see <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth, Samuel Sherratt QC</span> [2016] 5 SLR 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span>”) at [24]–[26].

At this juncture, the court is exercising its discretion with regard to s 15(6A) of the Act read with para 3 of the Legal Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) Notification 2012 (S 132/2012), which specifies four matters (“Notification matters”) for the court’s consideration. These are:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Matters specified under section 15(6A) of Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span> For the purposes of section 15(6A) of the Act, the court may consider the following matters, in addition to the matters specified in section 15(1) and (2) of the Act, when deciding whether to admit a person under section 15 of the Act for the purpose of any one case:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the nature of the factual and legal issues involved in the case;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the necessity for the services of a foreign senior counsel;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the availability of any Senior Counsel or other advocate and solicitor with appropriate experience; and</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior counsel for the purpose of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Although there may often be substantial overlap between the third mandatory requirement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the counsel in question has special qualifications or experience) and the Notification matters, the former is still a distinct analytical inquiry that has to be answered in the affirmative before the court considers whether to exercise its discretion with regard to the Notification matters: <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC</span> [2014] 3 SLR 424 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span>”) at [58].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The mandatory requirements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is relatively uncontroversial that Mr Gearing meets the first two mandatory requirements under sections 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. However, counsel for the State, Ms Koh Swee Yen (“Ms Koh”) and counsel for the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”), Mr Christopher Anand Daniel (“Mr Daniel”) took the position that Mr Gearing does not possess “special qualifications and experience for the purposes of the case” under the third mandatory requirement.

As I had observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers, Heather QC</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1064 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span>”) at [17] and [21], it is not sufficient for the applicant to have general expertise pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">particular </span>issues that will be before the court. There had to be a “clear nexus” between the <span class="font-italic">specific</span> issues as presented and the applicant’s qualifications and experience. Hence, whether the applicant’s qualifications are suitable for the purposes of the case would necessarily depend on the antecedent question of what the “purpose of the case” entails. If the target is framed too widely, the applicant’s qualifications would always satisfy the criteria. If, on the other hand, the issue is framed too narrowly, it would be an impossible target and no applicant would possess the requisite experience: see <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span> at [22]; see also <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [68].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the present case, the Law Society’s submission is of a slightly different cast.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Leaving aside the Investor’s framing of the issues, I do not find the arguments by Mr Daniel and Ms Koh to be persuasive. The underlying dispute appears to involve issues of public international law, investor-state treaties, and international obligations. However, the application before the court in OS 685 concerns the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction. Regardless of how the issues are framed, it is undisputed that the relevant issues would focus on the four objections raised by the State at [10] above. In this regard, it is difficult to see how it could conceivably be argued that Mr Gearing does not possess the relevant expertise. After all, Mr Gearing was the lead counsel who argued against the State’s four jurisdictional objections before the Tribunal and, I would add, argued them <span class="font-italic">successfully</span>. Given this, it would be exceedingly odd to suggest there is no clear nexus to the issues in OS 685, and that Mr Gearing does not possess the “special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Turning to the Law Society’s objection that the issues should be framed objectively, there is no doubt that this should be done: see <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span> at [22]. However, insofar as the Investor has framed the questions too <span class="font-italic">narrowly</span> so as to tailor it specifically to Mr Gearing’s expertise and buttress the necessity for his admission, or to thereby exclude other local counsel who do in fact have the necessary expertise, this is really a concern that falls to be determined during the second stage of the inquiry under the Notification matters. After all, as I have noted at [15] above, there is often a substantial overlap between the two stages of the inquiry. There is nothing prohibiting a court from returning to its analysis of how the issues are framed for the purposes of determining how its discretion should be exercised with regard to the Notification matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Accordingly, I find that Mr Gearing has satisfied the third mandatory requirement, and the mandatory requirements as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Notification matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The context of Mr Gearing’s application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Before examining the four Notification matters, it is important to recognise the unique context of this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Gearing is applying to be admitted to represent the Investor in resisting the State’s application in OS 685 to set aside the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction. The Decision did not deal with the merits of the underlying dispute. Hence, the nature of the issues in OS 685 (and the decision on jurisdiction) is the relevant inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mr Gearing, if admitted, would be representing the party for whom the Tribunal had rendered its Decision <span class="font-italic">in favour of</span>. Unlike other cases where admitted applicants were arguing <span class="font-italic">against</span> some pre-existing award (see <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Joseph David QC</span> [2012] 1 SLR 791 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Joseph David</span>”) at [12]), or even applicants who were <span class="font-italic">not</span> admitted even though they purported to be addressing<span class="font-italic"> </span>complex and novel issues of law (see <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [75] and <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span> at [51]–[54]), this is not a situation where the cards could be said to be stacked against the Investor. To the contrary, counsel for the Investor, Mr Thio Shen Yi <span class="font-italic">SC</span> (“Mr Thio”) accepts that in OS 685, it would be seeking to <span class="font-italic">defend</span> the Tribunal’s Decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I recognise that the mere fact of an underlying decision in a party’s favour does not necessarily mean that the issues it will face at the hearing will necessarily be simple. Such a defendant may well have to address complex and thorny issues raised by the plaintiff in order to uphold the Tribunal’s decision especially since OS 685 would be by way of a rehearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Be that as it may, there are unique features of <span class="font-italic">this </span>Decision and its context that weigh against admitting Mr Gearing. First, Mr Thio accepts that even if OS 685 is by way of rehearing, it is nonetheless the <span class="font-italic">State</span><span class="font-italic">’s</span> application and the burden would be on <span class="font-italic">it</span> to persuade the court in OS 685 to set aside the Decision. In this regard, Mr Thio could not point to any part of the Decision which he disagrees with, which is obvious since it is in his favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Second, even a cursory review of the Tribunal’s Decision would reveal that the Tribunal resolved several of the purportedly “complex considerations of public international law and investor-state arbitration principles”

</div> through a plain textual interpretation of the Bilateral Treaty and by relatively straightforward factual analyses. In this regard, I would also observe that the allegedly complex arguments would not be raised by the Investor (and for whom Mr Gearing would be assisting), but by the <span class="font-italic">State</span>. It is of some significance that despite this, the State is not seeking to admit foreign senior counsel to argue its application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Third, the crux of the Investor’s submission is that in addition to defending the Tribunal’s Decision, it would need to respond to any arguments that the State might raise.

</div>
</div> Hence, even though the Tribunal’s decision ultimately turned on a plain textual interpretation of the Bilateral Treaty, the Investor might need Mr Gearing’s assistance to respond to the novel and complicated arguments that the State would be raising in OS 685.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 While this submission appears attractive at first blush, I was ultimately not persuaded. Without in any way commenting on the merits of the Tribunal’s Decision, it is apparent the Decision was a thoroughly reasoned judgment carefully setting out its reasoning, <span class="font-italic">and the </span><span class="font-italic">arguments of the parties</span> on each of the four objections. Insofar as the issues that <span class="font-italic">potentially could arise</span> are novel and complex (and as shall be seen in a moment, they are not), the Investor could hardly be said to be taken by surprise by them. In fact, the Investor has <span class="font-italic">already</span> argued against those purportedly novel and complex objections before the Tribunal, and succeeded. I would imagine that it would be adequately prepared to address those same issues should they arise, with or without Mr Gearing’s assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30  Hence, the Investor has the additional benefit of the detailed and reasoned grounds rendered by the Tribunal which had considered and rejected the State’s four objections. This is not to say the Tribunal is necessarily correct in its decision, but the foregoing considerations must surely inform the backdrop upon which the Notification matters are to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first Notification matter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is helpful to set out the Notification matters which the court should have regard to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the nature of the factual and legal issues involved in the case (“the first Notification matter”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the necessity for the services of a foreign senior counsel (“the second Notification matter”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the availability of any Senior Counsel or other advocate and solicitor with appropriate experience (“the third Notification matter”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior counsel for the purpose of the case (“the fourth Notification matter”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Unlike the two-stage inquiry, the assessment of the four Notification matters is a holistic rather than sequential exercise: see <span class="font-italic">Re Harish Salve and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 345 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Harish Salve</span>”) at [42]. “[E]ach matter is a signpost pointing to the ultimate question of whether it is reasonable to admit the applicant”. The broad principle underpinning this exercise of ascertaining reasonableness is “need”, and each of the Notification matters allows the court to assess this “need” from different vantage points. That said, while the weight attributed to each Notification matter is a fact-dependent exercise that is “incapable of mathematical precision”, the court remains duty bound to consider all four Notification matters and to identify the relevant factors: <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span> at [27]–[28] and <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [21], [53], and [59]–[60]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, although the exercise is not necessarily sequential, the determination of the first Notification matter can be dispositive of the three remaining Notification matters. This is because the complexity of the issues in the application (rather than the underlying dispute), or the lack thereof will necessarily have an impact on the court’s assessment of the necessity for foreign senior counsel and consequently the relative availability of local counsel with the appropriate expertise. As the Court of Appeal had observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [61], the “more [the issues are complex or difficult, or novel, or of significant precedential value], the smaller might be the pool of local advocates able and available to deal with the case at hand and the greater might be the need for the admission of foreign counsel”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 With this in mind, I turn to consider the four objections to the Tribunal’s Decision through the lens of the first Notification matter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether they are complex, difficult, novel, or of significant precedential value. In examining the alleged complexity of these four objections (and indeed the complexity of the issues alleged in similar applications), the first port of call will necessarily be the decision-maker’s grounds. After all, the State’s task in OS 685 is to show that the Tribunal had erred in rejecting its objections. The corollary of this, which Mr Thio accepts, is that the Investor’s first line of argument would be to demonstrate that the Tribunal was correct in reaching their Decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The first objection</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Before the Tribunal, the State’s first objection was that in appointing the Presiding Arbitrator using the list procedure of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Secretary-General of the PCA had failed to follow the procedure prescribed in the Bilateral Treaty read with the Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The State submits that under Article 9, the appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator should have been made <span class="font-italic">30 days</span> after its party-appointed arbitrator had been appointed and provided the two arbitrators could not agree on the choice of the presiding arbitrator. The Secretary-General of the PCA, on the other hand, had pursuant to the Bilateral Treaty gone ahead and appointed the Presiding Arbitrator only days after the State’s party-appointed arbitrator was appointed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Tribunal was of the view although the default procedure for the Arbitration was governed by the UNCITRAL Rules, this was <span class="font-italic">to the extent</span><span class="font-italic"> modified by the Bilateral Treaty</span>. In other words, on a plain reading of the relevant Treaty provision, the Treaty would prevail in the event of any conflict between the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules.

Taken at its highest, the issue does not concern any unique issue of public international law or an investment treaty dispute. The subject-matter of the first objection is simply the dispute over the appointment of an arbitrator, which is a fairly common occurrence in commercial arbitration.

</div> Of course, investor-state arbitration is a different species from commercial arbitration, but the mere fact that public international law is now the focus does not necessarily elevate the complexity of the issues involved.

Insofar as an element of treaty interpretation was involved, this is also not alien to our courts. In fact, the VCLT has been applied in the context of investor-state treaty arbitration (see <span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments Ltd v Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic </span>[2016] 5 SLR 536 (“<span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments</span>”) at [125]–[149] and <span class="font-italic">Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd and others v Kingdom of Lesotho</span> [2019] 1 SLR 263 (“<span class="font-italic">Swissbourgh</span>”) at [60]) as well as in<span class="font-italic"> </span>contexts outside of treaty-based arbitration: see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd and another and another suit</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 453 and <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1129.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, I do not see any complexity in the first objection that is beyond the competence of any local senior practitioner, who may or may not be a senior counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The second objection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The State’s second objection is that the Investor’s claims were barred under the Bilateral Treaty because the Investor’s subsidiaries have commenced an action challenging the constitutionality of certain measures in the foreign State’s courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The State’s second objection before the Tribunal is partly predicated on a “fork-in-the-road” provision in the Bilateral Treaty.

Would the provisions of the Bilateral Treaty be engaged in a situation where the Investor’s subsidiaries have commenced a constitutional writ action in the foreign State’s courts? This necessarily depends on the construction of the relevant provision in the Bilateral Treaty. It entails elementary enquiries about whether a subsidiary is a “disputing investor” and whether the constitutional challenge amounts to an “investment dispute” within the meaning of the provisions in the Bilateral Treaty. Significantly, both key provisions <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “disputing investor” and “investment dispute” are <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> defined in the Bilateral Treaty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Hence, the essential exercise is one of treaty interpretation, governed by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, which states:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center">section 3. Interpretation of treaties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Article 31</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">General rule of interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1.

The Investor’s task is made much easier by the fact that the plain text of the provision is “unusually clear”. <span class="font-italic">If</span> it is necessary to go beyond questions of construction, it does not follow that the next forensic step would invariably engage peculiar rules of investment treaty law and public international law principles. All that may be required are basic principles of treaty interpretation, which any reasonably competent lawyer should have in his or her repository. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Even if I am prepared to take the Investor’s case at its highest, and to assume that the doctrinal debate on the “fork-in-the-road” provision would somehow arise for determination in OS 685, I am not persuaded the Investor would be left at a loose end without Mr Gearing’s representation for several reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 First, for the reasons set out at [23]–[30], it must be recalled that the Investor is defending against the State’s application to set aside the Tribunal’s Decision. The doctrinal debate is <span class="font-italic">not</span> an unforeseeable contingency; to the contrary, not only has the Investor <span class="font-italic">already argued</span> it before the Tribunal (and would therefore have all the necessary research and authorities at its disposal), the Tribunal itself also took the pains to set out the contours of the debate, the arguments made by the parties, and the relevant facts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, and inter-relatedly, even if Mr Gearing is not admitted, there is nothing preventing him from assisting with the Investor’s case in OS 685. In fact, given that the essential contours of the doctrinal debate and the parties’ positions have already been helpfully set out in the Tribunal’s Decision, this is an<span class="font-italic"> a</span><span class="font-italic"> fortiori</span> case where Mr Gearing’s assistance by way of contributing to written submissions could be brought to bear: see <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [84] in the context of setting-aside summonses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Third, even if Mr Gearing is somehow not inclined to offer his assistance specific to OS 685 (and I can see no reason why he would not be since he remains after all, the lead counsel in the Arbitration, for which the jurisdiction phase has not even concluded), local counsel representing the Investor would not be bereft of the extant research, or the Tribunal’s detailed grounds. Moreover, the relevant “fork-in-the-road” provision is also not unique to <span class="font-italic">this</span> Bilateral Treaty. As Mr Jeyendran aptly points out, that exact same provision in the context of a China-Laos treaty was considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments</span>. There, local senior counsel were clearly capable of arguing such issues, and I can see no reason why they would be left floundering here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Mr Thio suggests that <span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments</span> concerned the “fork-in-the-road” provision in the China-Laos treaty, whereas the State’s second objection had to do with the “fork-in-the-road” provision in the Bilateral Treaty, which is a different treaty that heretofore had not featured in any of the Singapore courts’ reported or published judgments.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It seems to me that this issue is a factual one. Whether the Investor had knowledge of harm within three years from 23 February 2017 (when it filed its statement of claim) is something to be determined at the merits hearing of the Arbitration (if any). I fail to see how such a fact-centric inquiry can be said to be “complex”, “difficult”, or “novel”. Such factual inquiries are done in every case which goes to trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In addition, time-bar issues are frequently encountered by local counsel in a wide variety of contexts, and the additional gloss of the time-bar arising from a treaty (as opposed to statute) does not render the matter beyond the comprehension or competence of local counsel. At most, the third objection would involve elementary issues of treaty interpretation. For the reasons I had canvassed above, this does not make the relevant issues sufficiently complex.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Investor’s task is made even simpler by the concession it made before the Tribunal that it is only pursuing claims based on Certificates issued <span class="font-italic">after </span>23 February 2014. In effect, the Investor’s concession would permit the Tribunal to deal with the third objection on a factual basis <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, only claims in relation to Certificates issued <span class="font-italic">post</span> 23 February 2014 will be pursued. Since there is no information before me that the Investor is backtracking from that concession, I can see no reason why such a straightforward issue will suddenly escalate in complexity in OS 685.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The fourth objection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Investor’s claims are premised on breaches of the FET clause and umbrella clause of the Bilateral Treaty. The State’s fourth objection essentially relates to the insufficiency of the Investor’s pleadings. If the Investor’s pleadings are insufficient, then the breach is not serious enough for the purposes of treaty-based breach under the FET clause and umbrella clause, and is simply a contractual breach under the MOU.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Tribunal considered that for the purposes of jurisdiction, the relevant test  is not whether the Investor’s claims as pleaded <span class="font-italic">would succeed</span> on the merits, but whether the facts as pleaded could present a treaty question for the Tribunal’s determination.

It would have to stand or fall based on its claims under the Bilateral Treaty. As for the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the MOU, which might take effect to preclude the Arbitration proceedings, this turns on the interpretation of the Bilateral Treaty in accordance with general treaty interpretation principles. As Ms Koh and Ms Jeyendran have observed, any analysis on this front would involve the same degree of complexity as analyses in stay of proceeding applications in favour of foreign arbitration, conflict of laws issues, and abuse of process arguments. This is certainly not beyond the competence of local counsel who commonly handle litigation with cross-border elements.

It did not indicate whether any local counsel had actually been approached, but floated the names of two local senior counsel, which it claimed the Investor had considered.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I hesitate to accept this submission. The foreign senior counsel in <span class="font-italic">Re Harish Salve</span> were experts in <span class="font-italic">Indian law</span> and Indian law was very much the focus in the underlying application. Unfamiliarity with foreign law was very different from public international law, and was one of kind rather than degree. It was obvious that local counsel were unlikely to be acquainted with the municipal law of a foreign jurisdiction, but here, the issues of public international law involve <span class="font-italic">basic</span> principles of treaty interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Hence, while I accept that Mr Gearing’s extensive experience would mean that he might be <span class="font-italic">better </span>placed than the average local counsel to argue these issues, that did not hew toward the touchstone of necessity, but is simply a matter of preference. The basis for the court’s determination from this vantage point of the inquiry (the second Notification matter) is to juxtapose the applicant’s experience against the complexity of the issues involved (the first Notification matter). Vast experience in a particular area of law would not make the counsel “necessary” if the issues were otherwise uncontroversial, which is why the determination of the first Notification matter can be dispositive of the considerations in the other Notification matters: see [33] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The availability and competence of local counsel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I cannot help but observe that the Investor’s search for counsel was sorely lacking. As the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC</span> [2013] 3 SLR 66 at [23], it is incumbent on the party supporting the application to provide “full details of the party’s efforts in securing local counsel”. The importance of reasonably conscientious efforts cannot be overlooked because until such efforts have been made to ascertain the availability of counsel in the local bar, the court would not be placed in the best position to assess the relative competence of local counsel against the applicant’s expertise. In this regard, it bears noting that in the initial affidavit accompanying Mr Gearing’s application, counsel for the Investor did no more than cursorily offer the names of two local counsel, one of which was Mr Yeo, who was already the opposing counsel in OS 685.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the reply affidavit dated 4 September 2019, counsel for the Investor listed reasons to reject each of the nine additional counsel suggested by the State. I note that these names were <span class="font-italic">proposed</span> by the State, and it does not appear as though the Investor even went to the trouble of searching for these counsel, still less approaching them. In any event, I am not impressed with the Investor’s reasons for rejecting the names proposed. For one, the Investor rejected several senior counsel on the basis that they are already sitting as a presiding arbitrator or party-appointed arbitrator in arbitral tribunals involving the State.

</div> However, any such conflict was for the <span class="font-italic">State</span> or the local counsel in question to declare. After all, it is the <span class="font-italic">State</span>’s interest in the other arbitral proceedings that is at stake.

</div> Presumably the State’s brief with those local counsel had already concluded. I could not see how there is any legal conflict of interest, but should there be any such conflict of interest, I would expect local counsel to uphold their ethical duties and to forthrightly declare them. In any event, the point is rendered moot since the Investor had not even approached said counsel to check.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To militate against the lack of effort on their part, Mr Thio relies on my holding in <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span>, where the applicant was admitted despite the applicant’s counsel having omitted to undertake a search for local counsel. However, my holding in <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span> has to be construed in context. In particular, I observed at [64]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…What constitutes a reasonably conscientious search would naturally depend on the nature of the issues in each case. Although this procedural requirement does not appear to have been fulfilled on the face of the supporting affidavit, I have already taken cognisance of the lack of available local counsel in the field of public international law…In these <span class="font-italic">unique</span> circumstances, there might have been little utility in formally approaching local counsel and recording the details of their inability or unavailability to accept the brief. This might have been an exercise in futility. That counsel for the applicant omitted to do so is hence understandable. I should, however, caution that the dispensation of the requirement to take steps to ascertain the availability of competent local counsel would only be permitted in exceptional circumstances of which the present case is one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79  The present case is plainly <span class="font-italic">not</span> an “exceptional situation”, precisely because the issues in the present case are fairly straightforward. In <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span>, the foreign senior counsel was admitted to argue against an arbitral award on the merits (<span class="font-italic">Kingdom of Lesotho v Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd and others</span> [2019] 3 SLR 12, and on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Swissbourgh</span>) which engaged many complex issues of public international law unlike the present award on jurisdiction which concerns issues arising from the plain text of the Bilateral Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I would close off my remarks by stating that approaching local counsel on the basis that the issues involved may be so complex as to be beyond their ability is a somewhat delicate proposition. However, if the issues of fact and law involved are really so esoteric and complex, I have every confidence that local counsel are open and candid enough to admit when this is so and to be willing to second chair or co-chair for learning purposes so they may take the lead the next time round.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fourth Notification matter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The fourth Notification matter is “whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior counsel for the purpose of the case”. This is described as laying down the ultimate question of whether in all the circumstances, considering both the mandatory requirements and the other three Notification matters, there are good and sufficient reasons to admit the applicant, or negative factors weighing in the opposite direction such that it would be unreasonable to do so: <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [64].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I have two remarks here. First, the Investor’s written submissions waxed lyrically and at length about Singapore’s ambitions to be a leading investor-state arbitration hub, citing speeches by several public figures.

</div> At the hearing, Mr Thio accepted that this is not strictly relevant. This concession was rightly made. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Harish Salve</span> at [50], “the promotion of Singapore as a venue for international arbitration cannot be a significant factor in applications for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admissions. The emphasis in such applications must always be on what will assist the court [for the case in question] rather than on achieving external and unrelated ambitions.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, the Investor’s written submissions raised the fact that OS 685 would be heard in the SICC.

<p>
<strong>
Decision of the High Court (delivered by Judge of Appeal Justice Steven
Chong):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome: The High Court dismissed an application by Mr Matthew Peter
Gearing <em>QC</em> for <em>ad hoc</em> admission to defend against a
setting-aside application in the context of an investor-State arbitration.
In doing so, the High Court elaborated on the mandatory requirements and
the considerations in deciding whether to admit a foreign senior counsel.
In particular, the High Court considered how the complexity of the issues
should feature in <em>ad hoc</em> admissions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1  Mr Matthew Peter Gearing QC (“Mr Gearing”) is a Queen’s Counsel who
applied to be admitted to the Singapore bar on an <em>ad hoc</em>
basis. Mr Gearing was the lead counsel for the Investor in an
investor-State arbitration (“the Arbitration”).
        <strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Procedural background</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2 In February 2017, an investor (“the Investor”) commenced the
Arbitration proceedings against a foreign State (“the State”).
Shortly after, the State filed several objections contesting the
arbitral tribunal’s (“the Tribunal”) jurisdiction to hear the
Investor’s claims. The State’s objections pertained to alleged
non-compliance with the 2013 Arbitral Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (“the UNCITRAL Rules”) and a
bilateral treaty (“the Bilateral Treaty”) in relation to the
appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator. The State further alleged
that several provisions of the Bilateral Treaty precluded
overlapping claims or imposed time-bars and that the Investor’s
Arbitration claim was also precluded on the basis of an exclusive
jurisdiction clause in another agreement.
       </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3  In its Decision, the Tribunal rejected the State’s objections and
affirmed its own jurisdiction to hear the Investor’s claims.
Dissatisfied, the State brought proceedings in the Singapore courts
to set aside the Decision (“the Setting Aside Proceedings”). The
Setting Aside Proceedings have since been transferred to the
Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”).
       </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4  In defending the Tribunal’s Decision in the Setting Aside
Proceedings, the Investor applied to the High Court to admit Mr
Gearing to represent it. The Investor contended that the underlying
issues in the Setting Aside Proceedings were “complex”,
“significant”, “completely novel” and of “potentially precedential
value”. The Investor argued that Mr Gearing’s assistance was
necessary, as there were no local counsel available with the
relevant expertise, or who were otherwise appropriate to act for it
in the Setting Aside Proceedings.
       </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The High Court’s decision</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5  The High Court remarked that this application for <em>ad hoc</em>
admission was unique in that the Investor was seeking to admit Mr
Gearing to defend a Decision that had been rendered in its favour.
Moreover, insofar as the issues were alleged to be complex and
novel, the Investor had already argued against those objections
before the Tribunal and succeeded (at <strong>[24]</strong> and            <strong>[29]</strong>).
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6  Moreover, the High Court considered that it would be the State (and
not the Investor) who would be making these allegedly complex
arguments in the Setting Aside Proceedings. In this regard, the
Tribunal had issued a thoroughly-reasoned decision resolving
several of these allegedly complex issues by a plain textual
interpretation of the Bilateral Treaty and relatively
straightforward factual analyses. This could not be said to be a
situation where the cards were stacked against the Investor (at<strong>[24]</strong>, <strong>[27] </strong>and            <strong>[29]</strong>).
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mandatory requirements</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7   The High Court accepted the Investor’s submission that Mr Gearing
fulfilled the mandatory requirements for <em>ad hoc</em> admission.
Mr Gearing had successfully argued the jurisdictional issues before
the Tribunal and it would be odd to claim he did not have the
special qualifications and expertise for the purpose of the Setting
Aside Proceedings (at <strong>[19]</strong>).
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Complexity of the issues</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8    However, the High Court was not persuaded the issues involved were
sufficiently complex. Although the underlying dispute between the
Investor and the State involved issues of public international law,
investor-State treaties and international obligations, the relevant
inquiry was the State’s objections to jurisdiction (at            <strong>[19]</strong> and <strong>[23]</strong>).
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9    In this regard, the High Court elaborated that:
       </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">      (a) The mere fact that public international law was the focus did not
necessarily elevate the complexity of the issues involved. These
simply concerned fundamental principles of statutory interpretation
and treaty interpretation, which were not alien to the Singapore
courts and which was not beyond the competence of local senior
practitioners (at <strong>[39]</strong>–<strong>[41]</strong>,            <strong>[47]</strong>–<strong>[49]</strong>, <strong>[59]</strong>
and <strong>[63]</strong>);
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">      (b) If complex doctrinal debates in public international law arose,
those arguments had already been made before the Tribunal. The
Investor had the benefit of previous research and authorities, and
would have the benefit of Mr Gearing’s written submissions. If the
court were to feel that further assistance was required, it was
open to it to invite an <em>amicus curiae</em> to assist (at<strong>[51]</strong>–<strong>[52]</strong> and            <strong>[56]</strong>);
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">      (c) Local counsel had encountered similar issues in dealing with
statutory time-bars, stay of proceeding applications in favour of
foreign arbitration, conflict of law issues, and abuse of process
arguments. These issues were not beyond the competence of local
counsel who commonly handled litigation with cross-border elements
(at <strong>[59]</strong> and <strong>[63]</strong>); and
        </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">      (d) The SICC’s bench comprised of experienced local and foreign Judges,
and the court itself would possess the necessary expertise (at            <strong>[85]</strong>).
        </p>
<p>
<strong><em>Search for, and availability of, local counsel</em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10    The High Court commented that the Investor’s search for local counsel was
sorely lacking. Initially, the Investor cursorily offered the names of two
local senior counsel, one of whom was opposing counsel representing the
State. When the State proposed the names of nine other local counsel, the
Investor rejected them despite not having approached any of them to ask if
they would be willing or able to represent it in the Setting Aside
Proceedings (at <strong>[75]</strong>–<strong>[77]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11  The High Court observed that if the issues involved were truly beyond
local counsel’s ability because they were too esoteric and complex, or if
there was a conflict of interest, local counsel should be expected to be
open and candid enough to declare their conflicts, or to admit that the
issues involved were too complicated. In that event, the High Court was
confident that local counsel would be willing to second-chair or co-chair
for learning purposes so they could take the lead the next time around (at    <strong>[77]</strong> and <strong>[80]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12  As a result of the foregoing, the High Court dismissed Mr Gearing’s
application and ordered the Investor to pay costs to the State (at    <strong>[89]</strong>).
