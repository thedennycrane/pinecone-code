        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran who is
                    also known as “Marsiling Baby” is charged that he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of July 2008, between 8.20 p.m.
                        and 9.30 p.m., at the pavement of SP Powergrid sub-station, which was
                        located opposite Block 154 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Singapore, did commit murder
                        of one Jeevitha d/o Panippan (F/18 years old), and [he has] thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code, Chapter
                        224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The deceased Jeevitha d/o Panippan was his girlfriend and lover. He
                    refers to her as “Jeev”, and she was also known as
                    “Ashley”. The accused was 22 years old at that time, and the
                    deceased was 18 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the trial before me, the Prosecution and the
                    Defence produced an Agreed Statement of Facts which set out the police
                    investigations, including the discovery of the body of the deceased, the
                    accused’s arrest and the recovery of the case exhibits including the knife
                    that the accused had used to inflict the injuries on the deceased. In addition
                    to that, a number of written statements of the accused were admitted in evidence
                    during the trial on the accused’s initiative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accused’s case was summed up in his
                    submissions at the close of the case:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Accused did cause injuries which were sufficient in the ordinary
                        course of nature to cause death to one Jeevitha D/o Panippan
                        (“Jeevitha”) on the evening of 7 July 2008. The central issue
                        is whether the Accused can rely on any of the exceptions under Section 300
                        of the Penal Code. The Accused is primarily contending that Exception 1
                        (Grave and Sudden Provocation) (“the Provocation defence”)
                        applies in this case. Further, the Accused contends that Exception 7
                        (Diminished Responsibility) (“DR”) applies as well. As the
                        trial unfolded, it became patently clear that the factors raised in support
                        of the DR were inextricably linked to the Provocation defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Exceptions 1 and 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    2008 Rev Ed) provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Exception 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the
                        power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of
                        the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person
                        by mistake or accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Exception 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such
                        abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or
                        retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or
                        injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and
                        omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The accused’s account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Eight written statements of the accused were
                    admitted at the trial on his initiative.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> These statements ran chronologically
                    from a statement recorded by SI Ang Ghim Sing on the day of arrest, <em>ie</em> 8 July 2008 at 8.25 pm,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> to a cautioned statement for the murder of
                    the deceased, recorded on 9 July 2008 by ASP David Ang,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> to a series of six investigation
                    statements recorded by the investigation officer SI Noorma’at Sawab on 11,
                    12, 14 and 16 July 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> with three statements being recorded on
                    the last day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the investigation statements to the
                    investigating officer the accused recounted that he came to know the deceased
                    sometime in November or December 2007. They became friends and were lovers by
                    April 2008 and had the intention to marry. In May 2008, they had a disagreement
                    over something which the accused could not now recall. That went on for several
                    days, and on 28 May 2008, the accused met the deceased and brought her to
                    his uncle’s house. They had a talk in the house, and reconciled. Then,
                    they engaged in sex, and he ejaculated into her over her objections. The
                    deceased was worried that she may become pregnant, and she made a police report
                    that he raped her. In spite of that, the accused and the deceased continued to
                    see each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The accused then described the events which led
                    to the deceased’s death. On the evening of 6 July 2008, the accused
                    spoke to the deceased over the telephone and learned that she was suffering from
                    a flu and cold. The next morning, he decided to send her for medical treatment.
                    He took time off work and went to the deceased’s flat which was on the
                    second floor of Block 157, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. He arrived at the flat at about
                    9.00 am, but instead of knocking on the door, he took a chair from a
                    neighbouring house, climbed onto it and looked into the deceased’s bedroom
                    through a window.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       He saw the deceased lying on her bed with a male
                    person wearing a red shirt. The man was lying on top of the deceased and they
                    were kissing. The accused was shocked and felt very angry. He went to the door
                    of the flat, and demanded that the deceased open the door. She came to the door,
                    but refused to let him into the flat. He asked her if she was hiding something
                    from him, but she denied that and she also told him that she was scheduled to go
                    with her mother for a medical check-up at Kandang Kerbau Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The accused went downstairs to the void deck and
                    waited in the hope that he would meet the deceased when she went for the medical
                    appointment. However, he fell asleep whilst waiting and did not see the
                    deceased. He decided to wait for the deceased to return from her medical
                    appointment. Subsequently he found out from a friend of the deceased that she
                    and her mother would be returning to Ang Mo Kio in about an hour and that the
                    deceased wanted him to wait for her at Block 155.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       To occupy the time, he made an appointment with
                    a friend, Bala, to meet him at Block 181 to keep him company while he waited for
                    the deceased. The accused made another decision at that time. In his words:
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I then decided to buy a knife. I wanted to use the knife to threaten Jeev.
                        I knew that she would not tell me the truth if I did not threaten her with a
                        knife. She is a better talker than me and she always has the final
                        say.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and after buying a knife from a shop: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I took out the knife from the new casing and threw the casing into a drain
                        together with the plastic bag. I then tucked the knife at the back of my
                        waist and covered it with my t-shirt. When I arrived at the void deck of Blk
                        181 Ang Mo Kio, I saw a lot of purple coloured flyers on the floor near to
                        the letter boxes. I picked up two or three flyers. I then went up the
                        staircase and took out the knife that I just bought. I rolled the flyers
                        over the knife and folded one end of the flyers over the sharp end of the
                        knife. I then tucked the knife with the flyer at my back and covered it with
                        my shirt. I did this because while I was walking with the knife tucked at my
                        back, I could feel the sharp part of the knife against my back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Having done that, he met up with some friends
                    at a coffeeshop, and they sat together. At about 8 pm, he received a call from
                    the deceased asking him to meet her at the void deck of Block 155. The accused
                    told his friends that he was going to meet the deceased, and would rejoin them
                    later with the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     He went to Block 155 and met the deceased and
                    her mother. The deceased’s mother had a talk with him, and then she left
                    him and the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The events that followed are best set out in
                    the accused’s own words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    I then asked Jeev to go to Ang Mo Kio West Garden.
                            As I had mentioned before, we used to go to Ang Mo Kio West Garden which
                            is nearby. However, this time, I intend to ask her about the man who was
                            with her this morning. To go to Ang Mo Kio West Garden, we have to walk
                            to Blk 154 Ang Mo Kio, before taking the staircase to the Ang Mo Kio
                            West Garden. While we were at the void deck of Blk 154 Ang Mo Kio, I saw
                            the bushes around the power station infront of Blk 154 Ang Mo Kio. I
                            knew that at that time there will be a lot of people at Ang Mo Kio West
                            Garden and when I saw the bushes behind the power station, I thought
                            that it is a better place to ask Jeev about the main. I knew that if I
                            were to threaten Jeev with the knife that I bought, people at the Ang Mo
                            Kio West Garden could see me but behind the bushes, no one could see
                            clearly because the bushes are quite high and thick.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    Immediately I told her that I wanted to talk to
                            her. She asked me that we are going up to the garden. I just replied no
                            and I wanted to talk to her and pulled her to the back of the power
                            station behind the bushes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    While we were behind the power station, she was
                            standing near to the wall of the power station and I was standing facing
                            her with the bushes behind me. I asked her in English saying “You
                            are not hiding anything from me right?”. She replied
                            “No”. I asked her again in English “You are not
                            lying to me anything?”. She replied “No”. I just
                            shouted at her in Tamil “Who the fuck was the man in the red
                            shirt in bed with you this morning?”. She was stunned. On seeing
                            her reaction, she knew then that I know what she had done. I cried and
                            asked her in Tamil “Why, why, what did I not do for you, I really
                            can’t understand, tell me?”. She replied in Tamil
                            “he is better than you in bed, that is why I am after
                            him”. At this juncture, I took out the knife from behind me with
                            my right hand and stabbed her on her stomach. The moment I stabbed her,
                            she was holding my hands with both her hands. When I pulled the knife
                            out from her body, I felt she scratched my right hand. I continued to
                            use the knife to stab Jeev several times. I could not remember where I
                            had stabbed her or which part of her body that I stabbed her. All this
                            while, Jeev was holding on to the lower part of my left hand just above
                            my wrist with her right hand and kept on shouting in English “I
                            love you, I love you.”. I stopped stabbing her when she released
                            her grip on my right hand. When she let go of my left hand, I realised
                            that Jeev was already lying on the ground. Her legs were nearer to Blk
                            154 and I was bending down looking at her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74    I saw that she was bleeding from the left side of
                            her neck. I squat down and kissed her right cheek and I removed the gold
                            chain which I had bought for her as a gift. As far as both of us are
                            concerned, it is a sacred matrimonial chain which I had bought for her

                    Along the way, he got out of the taxi and threw the knife into a drain. (After
                    his arrest he led the police to the drain from which the knife was recovered. It

                    her that he wanted to go to Malaysia, and asked her to bring him a pair of jeans
                    and a T-shirt. His mother met with him with the clothes, and he put them on.
                    Then they both went by taxi to the Woodlands Checkpoint where he applied for and
                    obtained a Document of Identity which enabled him to enter Malaysia. (He needed
                    the Document of Identity because his passport had expired.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     He then went with his mother to Johor Baru.
                    While they were there he got away from his mother, and she subsequently returned
                    to Singapore alone. He went to Danga Bay and spent the night there. The next
                    afternoon, he made a call to his house. He told his mother and other members of
                    his family that he was going to die. His mother told him to return home because
                    the police were there, and they would bring her to the police station if he did
                    not return. On hearing that, he decided to return home.</p>

                    9 July 2008, the day after his arrest, in answer to a charge of murder of
                    the deceased, the accused stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That day morning, I went to her house in Ang Mo Kio. I did not go to work.
                        I took a chair from a neighbour and placed it infront of her corridor
                        window. I got up the chair and looked inside. I saw her kissing someone on
                        the bed. I got down the chair and kicked her house door. I asked her whether
                        I could come in. She told me not to. I then told her that it was not the
                        first time I went to her place. She told me “Not today. I am not in
                        the mood”. On the same night, I confronted her about the guy in her
                        house. But she did not want to talk about it. I asked her about the guy in
                        the red shirt. She was stunned when I asked her about this. I asked her what
                        she found in him did not find in me. She said that he is better in bed than
                        me. That’s why I took out a knife and stabbed her in her stomach.
                        After that, I closed my eyes and blindly stabbed her a lot of times until
                        she released her hands from mine. Before leaving the place, I kissed her on
                        the right cheek and then pulled the chain on her neck which I had bought
                        her. That’s all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The post mortem findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Dr George Paul
                    (“Dr Paul”), Consultant Forensic Pathologist, undertook a
                    post mortem examination of the deceased and produced an autopsy
                        report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Paul listed 15 external injuries, and he found that three of those
                    injuries, <em>ie</em> an incised gaping larynx-deep wound
                    (injury no 1), an oblique incised stab wound on the lower part of the left
                    shoulder extending inwards and downwards to the upper outer part of the left
                    side chest (injury no 14), and an oblique incised stab wound in the middle
                    front and outer aspect of left side of the chest (injury no 15) were
                    sufficient individually and collectively to have caused death in the ordinary
                    course of nature. In his evidence in court, Dr Paul stated that the three
                    fatal wounds were directed wounds, in that they were inflicted with the intent
                    to wound, and were not accidental injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Injury no 1 was inflicted with
                    “quite a bit of force” and injuries nos 14 and 15 were
                    “very forceful injuries”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The accused had recounted in the written
                    statements the events leading to the death of the deceased. In his evidence in
                    court, his counsel Mr Subhas Anandan went through with him the aspects of the
                    events which were most relevant to the defences. Under examination by Mr Subhas,
                    the accused gave a detailed account of the exchange between him and the deceased
                    near the bushes. He recounted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I asked her in English, “You are not cheating on me, right?”
                        She replied, “No.” “You are not” --- I then
                        asked her, “You are not hiding anything from me, right?” Then
                        she replied, “No.” And then I used an expletive and then asked
                        her, “Who was the red guy? Who was the red shirt fellow with you in
                        bed in the morning?”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I cried. I asked her why and told her that I don’t understand:
                        “What is it not that I have not done for you that he has
                            done?<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">She used this word that “he climbs better than you, that’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Subhas asked the accused for his reaction
                    when he heard that, and his response was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my mind, I thought that she would ask me for my forgiveness like how
                        she had done previously. But at this---at that moment, I did not realise
                        that she would be using such hurtful words. It---it was shocking to me and
                        it broke my heart. I’ve never feel this sad.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I’ve never been this sad before in my life---whole life. I became
                        very angry and I became very frustrated. I became very, very angry. I
                        didn’t know what I was doing. I was such---I was in such frustration
                        that I did not know what I was doing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact, I closed my eyes and I stabbed her. And in my anger, I did not
                        know what I was doing. Not only that, what was going through my mind at that
                        time were images of her in bed with another man and what other things that
                        she has done to me previously. Those images were going through my mind, I
                        closed my eyes. She in fact made me a stupid man ...<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> [Which was corrected
                        to “made an idiot of me.”]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     When he was cross-examined by the Prosecution,
                    he was asked to elaborate on his statement to the defence psychiatrist
                    Dr Tommy Tan (“Dr Tan”) that his mind went blank, and he
                    clarified that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I stabbed her in anger, after that everything went blank ... I can’t
                        even remember pulling out the knife.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     When the Prosecution questioned him further on
                    this, he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But I had explained that I do not know what was going on. Doesn’t
                        that mean my mind went blank? And I told that something took control of me
                        and the scene came---took con---the scenes took control of me. I did not
                        know what was happening at that---at that moment. And that is considered to
                        men that my mind went blank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not know what exactly happened at that moment. After the first stab
                        until she was on the ground, I do not know what happened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There is something to be said about this part
                    of the accused’s evidence. If he did not know what happened when his mind
                    “went blank”, then it would be natural that he would very alarmed
                    and concerned when his mind re-activated and saw the girl he wanted to marry
                    lying on the ground bleeding, and he did not know if she was dead or
                        alive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> One would expect him to
                    do something to help her, <em>eg</em>, attend to her, or
                    call for an ambulance, but he did neither and just left her there. His conduct
                    was simply not consistent with his explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The psychiatric evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Besides the accused, the principal witnesses
                    in the case were the two psychiatrists, Dr Tan, a senior psychiatrist in
                    private practice for the Defence and Dr Joshua Kua
                    (“Dr Kua”), Consultant Psychiatrist, Institute of Mental
                    Health, for the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Dr Tan presented two written reports on
                    the accused, the first dated 2 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and the second dated 15 November
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The first report was
                    prepared after he had interviewed the accused on three occasions and his mother,
                    on one occasion. Dr Tan was told by the accused’s mother that he was
                    hyperactive as a toddler, and she could not control him, and had to send him to
                    his maternal grandmother. She also told him that his primary and secondary
                    school teachers had complained that he was hyperactive, that he could not sit
                    still for more than five minutes, that he kept disturbing other students, he
                    fought in class and ran away from school. She also said that the accused was
                    very hot-tempered and that his siblings were wary of his temper. (The
                    accused’s mother did not give evidence on his behaviour
                herself.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Dr Tan learned from the accused that he
                    was hyperactive, always hot-tempered, and that he could not control his temper
                    and sometimes he could not remember what he did when he lost his
                temper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the basis of information obtained in three
                    interviews, Dr Tan produced his first report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> in which he made his findings that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Mental state at the time of the alleged
                            offence</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pathip has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He has rage outbursts
                        that are easily provoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He was provoked by Jeevitha at the time of the alleged offence, who
                        taunted his sexual prowess.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He had a rage outburst. He said that his mind went blank and something
                        controlled him. He only remembered stabbing Jeevitha once. He was still
                        swinging his knife when he became conscious of what he was doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence according to
                        McNaughton Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Diminished responsibility</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pathip satisfies the criteria for the defence of diminished
                        responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He had an abnormality of mind. He was in a stage of rage. His mind was
                        blank. He acted impulsively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The abnormality of mind is caused by attention deficit/hyperactivity
                        disorder, a mental condition that Pathip had suffered since he was a young
                        child. It is a mental disorder that is associated with impulsivity and
                        rage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility
                        for the acts causing the death of Jeevitha. He could not control himself
                        when he is in a state of rage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Kua disagreed with these findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At the trial Dr Tan acknowledged that it
                    would be preferable if he had interviewed more persons who knew the accused and
                    had more information on the accused before he rendered his opinion.
                    Consequently, he interviewed the accused’s stepfather, sister and two
                    friends, and he also went through the accused’s primary and secondary
                    school records and National Service records. With the benefit of the additional
                    information, Dr Tan issued his second report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> where he stated that the accused satisfies
                    the criteria for hyperactive disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity
                    disorder (“ADHD”) in accordance with the Diagnostic and
                    Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, Text Revision) (“DSM”) and
                    that he satisfied the features of ADHD as a child, an adolescent and an
                    adult.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Dr Tan was of the view that ADHD is an
                    abnormality of mind which impaired the accused’s mental responsibility for
                    the act of causing the deceased’s death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> He referred to the
                        DSM<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> in support of his
                    conclusion. The DSM sets out five diagnostic criteria for ADHD. One criterion,
                    Criterion D is of particular relevance. It states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in
                        social, academic, or occupational functioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and the DSM states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There must be clear evidence of interference with developmentally
                        appropriate social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion
                        D).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">to support a diagnosis of ADHD. This is significant because there was
                    no clear evidence that the accused had this essential impairment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Prosecution questioned, with some
                    justification, the objectivity, consistency and veracity of the information
                    obtained from the interviews with the accused’s step-father, sister and
                    friends. However, besides their input, there were documentary records which were
                    from sources with no interest in the case and thus were free from such
                    criticism. The report on his conduct issued by his primary school<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> stated that he displayed
                    “isolated instances of anger management issues but there were no
                    significant trends to warrant referral”. The report issued by his
                    secondary school noted that he was playful and restless, easily distracted and
                    dreamy, and that his attitude towards teachers and school authority was
                    indifferent. While the records showed that he was not a model student, there was
                    no evidence of clinically significant impairment of social and academic
                    functioning during his schooldays.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Similarly, in the Certificate of Service on
                    the accused’s two years full-time national service attachment with the
                    fire service his reporting officer noted that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He is good at his work and will always be able to [illegible] task that
                        has been assigned to him. The negative point about him is that at times he
                        might take things lightly and tries to find the easy way out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Evidently, he did not manifest any significant impairment of social or
                    occupational functioning during those two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Prosecution had asked the accused about
                    his working life. The accused explained that he was working as a movement
                    operator and his work involved transferring oil from lorry to tank and tank to
                    tank. He was asked: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the course of your work, did you have any problems with your
                        colleague?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and he replied: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We did not have. Even if we had, we would forget about it there and
                        then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The evidence showed that the accused never had
                    any functional impairment. He made unremarkable progress through school and
                    national service, and at the time of the offence, he had a normal working life,
                    and he had his friends and a girlfriend. No one had thought that he needed
                    psychological counselling or treatment. The Defence has therefore not
                    established that the accused was afflicted with ADHD which substantially
                    impaired his mental responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The diagnostic criteria aside, the
                    accused’s state of mind at the time he attacked the deceased has to be
                    considered, and I will do that after I have dealt with the second line of
                    defence that the accused had attacked the deceased whilst he was deprived of the
                    power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     What was the provocation from the deceased? In
                    the first statement recorded on the day of arrest on 8 July
                        2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> the deceased is alleged
                    to have said “He’s better than you in bed”, the
                    “he” being the man in the red shirt. In his cautioned statement
                    recorded on 9 July 2008, it was that “She said that he is better in
                    bed than me”. In his statement to the investigating officer on
                    12 July 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> the
                    deceased had said in Tamil “[H]e is better than you in bed, that is why I
                    am after him.” In his evidence in court, it was “he climbs better
                    than you, that’s why I’m going for his body.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The requirements of Exception 1 are well
                    established. The Court of Appeal had pointed out in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Kwan Cin Cheng</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 at [44]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here are two distinct requirements for the provocation defence to
                        apply: first, a "subjective" requirement that the accused was deprived of
                        his self-control by provocation; and secondly, an "objective" requirement
                        that the provocation should have been "grave and sudden". The latter
                        requirement involves the application of the "reasonable man" test ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and the Court of Criminal Appeal explained in <em>Vijayan v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 373 at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In every case it depends on the effect of the provocative act on the
                        ordinary man, that is, an ordinary reasonable man belonging to the same
                        class of society as the accused. That is the test which must be applied to
                        ascertain whether or not there was provocation within the meaning of
                        Exception 1 of s 300 of the Penal Code. Whether an act which caused
                        death was done in the heat of passion caused by grave and sudden provocation
                        depends in our opinion on whether the provocative act was such as was likely
                        to cause a reasonable man to lose his self-control and to do the act in
                        question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Criminal Appeal also noted in <em>Ithinin
                        bin Kamari v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 547 that
                    the particular characteristics or circumstances of the person in question should
                    also be taken into account when it agreed with Lord Diplock’s judgment in
                        <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Camplin</em>
                    [1978] AC 705 at 717 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the gravity of verbal provocation may well depend upon the particular
                        characteristics or circumstances of the person to whom a taunt or insult is
                        addressed. To taunt a person because of his race, his physical infirmities
                        or some shameful incident in his past may well be considered by the jury to
                        be more offensive to the person addressed, however equable his temperament,
                        if the facts on which the taunt is founded are true than it would be if they
                        were not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Undoubtedly, the deceased’s words as
                    recounted by the accused had an impact on him. They were lovers, and she was
                    telling him not only that she was seeing another person, but she considered that
                    person to be a better lover than him. A reasonable man in his position would be
                    hurt by that, but not so enraged that he would lose his power of self-control.
                    It could be different if she had said something personal about him, <em>eg</em>, he was a poor lover or ridiculed him for any sexual
                    deficiencies that he might have. Yet all that she is alleged to have said was
                    that the other man was a better lover. On an objective review of that, the
                    second objective requirement in Exception 1 is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     That leaves the subjective requirement that
                    the accused be deprived of his self-control by the provocation. This requires an
                    examination of the accused’s state of mind at the time he attacked the
                    deceased, and this is also relevant to the defence of diminished
                    responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The accused told Dr Tan that his mind
                    went blank, but he had not said that until he saw Dr Tan. When he
                    surrendered himself at the Woodlands Checkpoint, he admitted that he had killed
                    his girlfriend because of jealousy. In the first written statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> he said that he stabbed the
                    deceased, then he closed his eyes and kept swinging the knife at her. There was
                    no mention of his mind going blank. In the cautioned statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> he said that he stabbed her, and
                    then he closed his eyes and “blindly stabbed her a lot of times”,
                    with no mention of his mind going blank. In his investigation
                        statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> he
                    gave an account of the stabbing without saying that he had closed his eyes or
                    that his mind went blank. In Dr Kua’s notes on his interview on
                    24 July 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> he recorded that the accused
                    “poked” the deceased with the knife, then he closed his eyes and
                    waved the knife at her, but he did not say that his mind went blank, and
                    Dr Kua set this out in his report on the accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It appears that the accused only talked about
                    his mind going blank when he saw Dr Tan in October 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> more than a year after the
                    event. When all his statements are examined, it is clear that his mental
                    processes did not cease during the attack. While he had closed his eyes, he felt
                    that the deceased was holding onto his hands, he knew that he continued to wield
                    the knife and that she scratched his right hand when he pulled the knife out of
                    his body. He heard her protestations of love for him. He remembered that he
                    knelt to kiss the deceased, and that he decided to remove her necklace or
                    “thali”, which was a symbol of their relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     When the accused saw Dr Tan, he told
                    Dr Tan about his mind going blank. Dr Tan recorded that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">His
                    “mind went blank, something took control of me, just
                    blank”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He remembered stabbing her once. “After that, I don’t
                        remember”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“When I come to conscious, I was still swinging the knife”.
                        “She was already on the ground”. “I kneel down, kissed
                        her on the cheek”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and from that Dr Tan concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Mental state at the time of the alleged
                            offence</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pathip has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He has rage outbursts
                        that are easily provoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He was provoked by Jeevitha at the time of the alleged offence, who
                        taunted his sexual prowess.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He had a rage outburst. He said that his mind went blank and something
                        controlled him. He only remembered stabbing Jeevitha once. He was still
                        swinging his knife when he became conscious of what he was doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence according to
                        McNaughton Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Diminished responsibility</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pathip satisfies the criteria for the defence of diminished
                        responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He had an abnormality of mind. He was in a stage of rage. His mind was
                        blank. He acted impulsively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The abnormality of mind is caused by attention deficit/hyperactivity
                        disorder, a mental condition that Pathip had suffered since he was a young
                        child. It is a mental disorder that is associated with impulsivity and
                        rage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility
                        for the acts causing the death of Jeevitha. He could not control himself
                        when he is in a state of rage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Insofar as it is clear that the
                    accused’s mind did not actually go blank, and the accused had not
                    disclosed to Dr Tan all that he had disclosed in the statements which have
                    been referred to, Dr Tan’s conclusions must be taken with
                    caution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When I take into account all the statements
                    the accused made to the police and to Dr Kua, I find that when the accused
                    inflicted the injuries on the deceased, he was not deprived of self-control by
                    grave and sudden provocation, and that he was not suffering from any abnormality
                    of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts. The
                    effect of that is that his defences of provocation and diminished responsibility
                    are not made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Consequently, I find the accused guilty of
                    murder as charged.</p>
