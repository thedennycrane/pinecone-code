It was also common ground that there was no relevant decision.  CES’s letter of 23 May 2014 to the TAC, if a request for review of IATA’s earlier money claim at all, had been out of time and rejected, and so far as the amount in the arbitration included a claim to more than was stated on 26 March 2013, it appears that there was no request for review at all. It should be noted, however, that the arbitration is a <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> review: that is, what is submitted to arbitration is the subject matter of the TAC’s decision, so far as remaining in dispute. The arbitration is not akin to an appeal from the TAC’s decision, leaving room for arbitration of the underlying dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The first issue is whether, notwithstanding the absence of a TAC decision, the Tribunal nonetheless has jurisdiction because the absence of a TAC decision should be attributed to CES’s failure to initiate a review by the TAC, such that CES cannot rely on its non-fulfilment of the pre-condition to deny the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (“the default question”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The second issue, arising only if the default question is answered against IATA, is whether CES is estopped from denying the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, or has waived fulfilment of the precondition, by reason of representations concerning arbitration made in the course of the Indian proceedings (“the estoppel/waiver question”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The default question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Clause 14 of the PSA is a submission to arbitration “[i]f any matter is reviewed by arbitration pursuant to the Sales Agency Rules”, and requires reference to when a matter can be reviewed by arbitration.

So, in <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> at [21], a decision of the TAC was described as a precursor to the arbitration and a pre-requisite step.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Delhi Express</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span>, however, it was held that there could be review by arbitration of the disputed matter even though there had not been a decision of the TAC.  In that case, the plaintiff was an accredited travel agent under a PSA incorporating Resolutions which, although differently expressed in some respects from those in the June 2012 edition of the Handbook, provided a like scheme for review by the TAC followed by arbitration.  Under the scheme, the plaintiff claimed a money sum and rendition of accounts against IATA.  IATA applied for referral to arbitration pursuant to s 8 of the ACA.  The plaintiff contended that there could be arbitration only against a decision of the TAC, and that the TAC had no jurisdiction to decide “on the matter of accounts”; implicitly, therefore, the plaintiff asserted that the subject matter of the dispute could not be referred to arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Court (Rajiv Sahai Endlaw J) held that the plaintiff could have requested review by the TAC (<span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> at [19]), a matter to which I will return.

Merely because the agreement between the parties provides for a precursor to the arbitration, arbitration cannot be avoided on the ground of the pre requisite step having not been taken.  A party cannot be permitted to renegate out of the Arbitration Agreement by contending that owing to its own default or otherwise the precursor event to arbitration has not occurred.  In the present case it was open to the plaintiff to have applied to the Travel Agency Commissioner for review of the decision of the Agency Administrator with which the plaintiff was aggrieved.  The plaintiff having not done has itself to blame for not adopting the course leading to arbitration and cannot maintain a suit on that basis. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Rameshwar and Raj both accepted <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> as good law in India.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I do not think <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> can be distinguished on either of the first two grounds.  For the principle in [21] of the judgment, it matters not which of the Agent or IATA is the plaintiff seeking to rely on the absence of a decision of the TAC.  Indeed, in that case, as in the present case, it was the Agent seeking to rely on the absence of a decision of the TAC, and it equally does not matter that the Agent happens to be the defendant in an arbitration rather than the plaintiff in court proceedings.  The principle is not affected by the contention that the dispute was not a subject matter of arbitration, which had been rejected by the court in <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> and so did not affect the decision to refer the parties to arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The third ground for distinction is not easy to understand.  I do not think the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> contended as suggested.  Within the suggested distinction, however, was that in the present case IATA could have approached the TAC for a decision, and that became the matter for debate in this application.  CES accepted at the hearing, in my view correctly, that if it alone could have initiated a review by the TAC and did not do so, it could not rely on the absence of a decision of the TAC in order to avoid an arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Could IATA have initiated a review?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 With that acceptance, the default question comes down to whether the present case is outside <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> because IATA could have initiated a review by the TAC, and so the absence of a decision by the TAC was not due to CES’s default alone. CES contended that IATA could have initiated, indeed was obliged to initiate, a review by the TAC. IATA contended that it could not have initiated a review.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is necessary to have well in mind the relevant decision or action to be reviewed.  IATA had declared CES’s agency in default, and had ultimately terminated the PSA.  But the actions relevant to the claim in the arbitration are its demands for payment of INR 46,43,37,605 and the other amounts making up the INR 124,31,69,623 claimed in the arbitration.  Any review by the TAC would be focused on whether the money was due.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Whether IATA could have initiated or was obliged to initiate a review of the demands is a question of construction of the Rules.

The preamble speaks of settlement in accordance with the Resolution, and the Resolution then provides for settlement in stated circumstances: on review initiated by (relevantly) the Agent, on the one hand, or on review initiated by IATA, on the other hand, and in either case in one or more of the stated circumstances.  The TAC’s jurisdiction depends on submission of a dispute to it, or more correctly initiation of a review by it, by an Agent in one of the circumstances in para 1.1, or by IATA in one of the circumstances in para 1.3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Three particular matters put by CES in support of its submission should be noted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, CES referred to <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express </span>for the observation at [19] that the preamble to Resolution 820e provides that the TAC shall conduct reviews with respect to all decisions affecting agents, which decisions would include in relation to the money sums there in issue.  It said, in effect, that the court endorsed jurisdiction of the TAC over all decisions regardless of who initiated the review.  That is not correct.  The court went on to hold that the Agent could have applied to the TAC, by virtue of the equivalent of sub-para 1.1.5: that is, it looked to the provisions dealing with who could initiate a review.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Secondly, CES cited a passage from <span class="font-italic">All India </span>at [20]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if we go through the clauses in the Agreement, Resolution and T A Handbook, I am of the opinion that the intention of the parties is that in case of any dispute, the same has to be referred to the Travel Agency Commissioner and on rendering a decision, the same has to be referred to the Arbitrator.  …  Therefore, I am of the opinion that the intention of the parties to the agreement at the time of entering into the contract is only to refer the disputes to the Travel Agency Commissioner and thereafter to the Arbitration proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 CES extracted the proposition that the parties intended that all disputes should be submitted to the TAC, in context meaning that either it or IATA could submit all disputes.  The passage does not support the proposition. It was dealing with a submission that there was no clear intention to refer disputes to arbitration at all.  It was not concerned with the particular provisions as to who could initiate a review by the TAC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Thirdly, CES adverted to para 1.4 in Resolution 820e, which states when the TAC shall decline to act (for example, claims under restraint of trade law).

</div>  It submitted that from the specific statement of cases which do not fall within the TAC’s jurisdiction, it followed that matters not falling under para 1.4 “were meant to be covered by the jurisdiction of the TAC”.  The reasoning is horrendously astray, particularly when sub-para 1.4.2 says that the TAC “shall decline to act … in any matter in relation to which [it] does not have jurisdiction”.

</div>  In any event, being within jurisdiction as a general proposition says nothing about whether the Agent or IATA could “initiate” an exercise of the jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, CES also submitted that the dispute came within sub-para 1.3.12 of Resolution 820e, or more correctly that IATA’s action in demanding the money from CES came within the circumstances in which IATA was obliged to initiate a review.

I will assume that the “and” in sub-para 1.3.12 is to be read disjunctively as  “or”.  The Resolution 832 paragraph was not in evidence, and presumably is not relevant.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Sub-paragraph 1.3.12 in Resolution 820e is a short-form incorporation of the Resolution 818g paragraph, picking up its obligation to request a review without itself having a wider operation. In my view, it is clear that the Resolution 818g paragraph did not oblige IATA to initiate a review.  It is for where the Agent’s viability, more specifically its ability to remit money to airlines, comes into doubt because of information outside the state of accounts between the Agent and IATA, as is evident from the trigger of receipt of written information which can be substantiated and the first step of notifying the Agent of the irregularity.  The sanction is withdrawal of STDs, not recovery of money.  No doubt because the step of withdrawal of STDs would significantly affect the Agent, in the Agent’s interests IATA must get a third party check from the TAC on the soundness of the written information and its belief and the appropriateness of any withdrawal of STDs.  But that is worlds away from where the Agent simply does not remit money, in which case as earlier described the Rules separately mandate that IATA must demand payment, must give notice of the irregularity, and must take Default Action (see [25] to [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 This is unsurprising.  If a creditor demands payment, it is for the debtor to protest.  Here, CES could protest by initiating a review pursuant to sub-para 1.1.5 of Resolution 820e, itself raising the question of its viability.  It would make no sense if each time an Agent failed to remit money, IATA was required to get a third party check on its demand for payment, particularly when the Rules required it to make the demand and take other actions inconsistent with the initiation of a review.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It follows that <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> is not to be distinguished.  CES alone was able to initiate a review by the TAC, and it cannot rely on the absence of a decision of the TAC to dispute the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> at [21]).  Accordingly, the Tribunal has jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I should note IATA’s further submission that even if the absence of a TAC decision was not due to the failure of CES alone to initiate a review by the TAC, the Tribunal still had jurisdiction.  The submission was founded on a passage in <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> at [21] immediately following that set out at [47] above (“Passage 2”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Even otherwise the only requirement of Section 8 is that the subject matter of the dispute brought before the court is the subject matter of an arbitration.  Once the court finds so, the court has no option but to refer the parties to arbitration.  The court is not to go into the question whether the party which has applied under Section 8 of the Act has been ready and willing to proceed with the arbitration or not.  That is one of the drastic changes made in the 1996 Act from the 1940 Act.  Thus even if there had been a default of the Travel Agency Commissioner not attributable to the plaintiff, the disputes raised by the plaintiff against the defendant No. 1 in the present suit would still be governed by the Arbitration Agreement and hence this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The submission misapprehends Passage 2.  The Court was not saying that the precondition to arbitration could be entirely ignored so that the arbitrator had jurisdiction.  It was saying no more than that the dispute was governed by the arbitration agreement and so, under the ACA, an order referring to arbitration had to be made: see the explanation of s 8(1) of  the ACA at [90]–[92] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I should also note IATA’s submission that CES’s failure to initiate a review by the TAC was a waiver of the precondition to arbitration, or alternatively estopped CES from relying on the absence of a decision by the TAC.  Waiver may be a different way of saying that CES cannot rely on its own default, see <span class="font-italic">M.K. Shah Engineers and Contractors v State of Madhya Pradesh </span>(1999) 2 SCC 594 at [17].  If the submission went further, there are difficulties with either alternative, but given my finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, it is not necessary to consider the submission.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Estoppel/Waiver Question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Since the arbitrator has jurisdiction, it is unnecessary to deal with the question of whether CES has waived or is estopped from disputing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by reason of the representations concerning arbitration made by it in the Indian proceedings.  However, there is the possibility of an appeal from my decision and I will therefore consider this point.  I return to the Indian proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 To begin, s 8(1) of the ACA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) A judicial authority, before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party to the arbitration agreement or any person claiming through or under him, so applies not later than the date of submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, then, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> no valid arbitration agreement exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 IATA began the Indian proceedings on 27 January 2016.

He said that the legislative purpose of an application under s 8(1) was to inform the court that an arbitration agreement exists and that the court should not assert its jurisdiction over the dispute as it was a subject matter of arbitration.  In this regard, he cited the SCI’s decision of <span class="font-italic">M/S Sundaram Finance Limited v T </span><span class="font-italic">Thankam</span> (2015) 14 SCC 444 at [15] for the observation that the approach of the court should not be to see whether it has jurisdiction, but to see whether its jurisdiction has been ousted; that is, taken away by the procedure under the statute.

In that case, the court went on to say (at [16]) that any objection to the applicability of the arbitration clause had to be raised before the arbitral tribunal and should be left to be determined by the tribunal.

From the previous two paragraphs, the answer is no. Looking at the position after referral, Raj said it was settled law that a question of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal could be raised and determined by the tribunal, and that CES could raise a jurisdictional challenge before the Tribunal even after the referral to arbitration.

</div>  Implicit in this is that the answer to the question is no, which is supported by <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> to which Raj rather obliquely referred in this respect.  It was there contended that the precondition of a decision by the TAC had not been satisfied.  The court put that aside because of the Agent’s default, but in Passage 2 set out at [71] above, it said that even if the absence of a TAC decision was not attributable to the Agent, referral to arbitration was mandatory because the dispute was governed by an arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The parties appear to have assumed that Indian law concerning estoppel or waiver applied.  There was scant evidence of that law, but the parties helpfully agreed on concise statements of the ingredients of each.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 For estoppel, it is sufficient to say that the parties’ agreement on the law included that there must be a clear and unequivocal representation by words or conduct on which reliance was placed. The representation put forward by IATA was the representation by CES that, despite the absence of a TAC decision, the claim should be referred to arbitration.  On the operation of s 8(1) described above, that would not suffice: it would leave open contesting the arbitrator’s jurisdiction after referral.  A better formulation would be representation by CES that despite the absence of a TAC decision, the arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine the claim.  However, particularly with regard to the operation of s 8(1), I do not think a clear and unequivocal representation to that effect can be found.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It was common ground that there was no estoppel simply because CES brought the Application.  The representation must be found elsewhere. Without going through them in detail, CES’s assertions in the documents filed in the Indian proceedings did not clearly go beyond that the dispute was the subject of an arbitration agreement. Where in the Reply it was said in various ways that the dispute was capable of arbitration, when read in context no more was meant than, as was sufficient for the Application, it was within s 8(1) in that respect.  There was certainly no clear acceptance that, despite the absence of a TAC decision, the arbitration could proceed with the arbitrator having jurisdiction to determine the dispute – and it was not necessary, on the state of the law, for the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to be accepted by the court or the parties in order that the Application succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The record of the court’s order is consistent with this.  The parties were referred to <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span>.  Counsel for IATA agreed that the matter was covered by it and that the action was the subject matter of an arbitration agreement.  In what way was the matter covered? By the reference to the action being the subject matter of an arbitration agreement, not because CES could not rely on the absence of a TAC decision: but because, being  the subject matter of an arbitration agreement, referral to arbitration was mandatory.  The record does not support that counsel was acting on the basis of a representation that, despite the absence of a TAC decision, the arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Raj accepted that CES was not estopped “on account of its representations in the Delhi HC suit or otherwise” from bringing a jurisdictional challenge before the Tribunal.

On the default question the Tribunal held that he has jurisdiction essentially because CES alone could have initiated review by the TAC, although he used the taxonomy of estoppel and waiver.

Putting that aside, in Singapore, foreign law is a matter of fact, which must be proved by evidence.  To an extent it can be proved by evidence of raw sources of foreign law; or it can be proved, and commonly needs to be proved, by the evidence of an expert in the foreign law: see generally <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v SY Technology Inc and another appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR (R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”) at [59]–[60].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In Pacific<span class="font-italic"> Recreation</span> at [76], the court adopted from <span class="font-italic">MCC Proceeds Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc</span> [1999] CLC 417 at [23] a summary of the function of an expert witness on foreign law:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) to inform the court of the relevant contents of the foreign law; identifying statutes or other legislation and explaining where necessary the foreign court’s approach to their construction;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) to identify judgments or other authorities, explaining what status they have as sources of foreign law; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) where there is no authority directly in point, to assist [the court] in making a finding as to what the foreign court’s ruling would be if the issue was to arise for decision there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In their affidavits, Rameshwar to some extent and Raj to a considerable extent went beyond this.  Rameshwar, for example, was asked to opine on whether CES could be prevented from relying on the lack of a TAC decision if it were found that the absence of a decision was its fault.  He answered by construing the Rules to the conclusion that IATA was obliged to initiate a review pursuant to para 1.8 of Attachment A to Resolution 818g.

Again, as examples, Raj was asked whether IATA was obliged by para 1.8 to request a review by the TAC; whether by its conduct in failing to apply for timely review by the TAC, CES had waived the precondition; and whether by the representations made and position taken by CES in the Indian proceedings, it was estopped from objecting to IATA bringing its claims in the arbitration.

These were matters for the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 No blame attaches to Rameshwar or Raj: they did what they were asked to do. There is no bright line edging the discharge of the functions in the summary set out above, and in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [78] it was said that the purpose of procuring expert evidence is not merely to place the contents of foreign law before the court but also to obtain the expert’s opinion as to the effect of the law.  But the experts were asked to go beyond their proper roles.  Both gave opinions on the conclusions which the court ought to draw, but those conclusions should be the subject of counsel’s submissions. It is appropriate to remind practitioners that the instructing lawyers should not ask the expert to opine beyond his or her proper role, and should bring to the expert’s attention the limits of that role (see <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [89]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 There was a similar problem in the affidavits of M and D’Cruz.  Evidentiary affidavits are there to place facts before the court, including disputed facts.  They are not there for submissions on conclusions of fact or legal argument, and should not include either: those are matters for counsel in written or oral submissions.  M’s first affidavit contained some factual material, but was largely argument in support of CES’s case.  D’Cruz began with factual material, but then descended into argument responding to M’s arguments.  The second and third affidavits of M replied in kind, the apparently self-written third affidavit being barely comprehensible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 This should not have happened.  Again, it is timely to remind practitioners of the function of evidentiary affidavits.

Section 23(2) provides for directions as to whether and what information relating to the proceedings may be published. By s 23(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the court must be satisfied that the information, if published, would not reveal any matter, including the identity of any party to the proceedings, that any party reasonably wishes to remain confidential. Section 23(4) makes further provision for possible publication in the law reports, implicitly when that publication would go beyond the information permitted by directions under s 23(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 It is common that in a case such as the present, in conformity with giving directions under s 23(2), an order is made restricting access to the court file and for redaction of the parties’ names, and that the judgment is written or redacted so as not to reveal the parties’ identities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In August 2019, CES and IATA applied for consent orders restricting access to the court file and for redaction of their names in the judgment. Perhaps by oversight, only the order restricting access was made. In preparing the judgment, I concluded that while the parties’ names could be redacted, the identity of IATA would nevertheless be apparent to a reader from the necessary references to the Handbook and provisions in it and to <span class="font-italic">Delhi Express</span> and <span class="font-italic">All India</span>. Accordingly, when the judgment was issued to the parties (as the dispositive judgment) on 25 March 2020, I directed that it not be released to the public or made available for possible publication until I had received submissions on whether and what steps should be taken so as not to reveal the identity of one or both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 On 6 April 2020, IATA wrote that it “does not wish to request for any redaction of the Judgment”. On 8 April 2020, CES wrote requesting that its name “be redacted for confidentiality”, giving reasons for that course. IATA then wrote, on 13 April 2020, saying that it did not object to CES’s request for confidentiality but asking that, if that were done, its name be redacted “in order to maintain consistency between the parties as to the level of confidentiality observed by each party in respect of the arbitration proceedings”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 CES’s name has been redacted, by the use instead of those letters, and the references to its Chairman and Managing Director have also been anonymised by use of the letter M. However, I did not accede to IATA’s request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 First, IATA had initially not wanted redaction of its name at all, and the change on 13 April 2020 was not for concern over knowledge of its identity, but for a reason to which it is difficult to give any weight: confidentiality is not a matter of equal treatment, but of IATA’s own interest in not having its identity revealed. Secondly, the request was pointless when IATA’s identity would be apparent even if its name was redacted in the same manner as that of CES; and IATA did not, having received the judgment, request redaction of the references to the Handbook and the Indian cases or anything beyond redaction of its name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Returning to s 23 of the IAA, CES did not ask for confidentiality as to IATA’s identity, and in the combination of circumstances described in the previous paragraph, I am not satisfied that IATA’s most recent wish for confidentiality by redaction of its name is reasonable. There could nonetheless be the redaction, but the court should not go through an empty exercise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The judgment has been amended for release beyond the parties by the redaction of the names of CES and M, and by the addition of this Addendum to explain why the name of IATA has not been similarly redacted.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"><img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, 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" style="width:78pt; height:58.5pt"/><br/>Roger Giles  <br/>International Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pateloo Eruthiyanathan Ashokan and Soon Meiyi Geraldine (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Toh Wei Yi, Leong Shan Wei Jaclyn, Lem Jit Min Andy and Ng Hua Meng Marcus (Huang Huaming, Marcus) (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

</span><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">CES v International Air Transport Association </span></em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">[2020] SGHC(I) 08</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p class="Body"><strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (delivered by International Judge Roger Giles):</span></strong></p>
<p class="Body" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Outcome:<em> </em>Court holds that an arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claim by the respondent against the applicant. </span></p>
<p class="Body" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Facts</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">1.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>CES entered into an agency agreement (“the Agreement”) with the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). Under the Agreement, CES was authorised to sell air passenger transportation on the services of airline carriers that were members of IATA. The Agreement further provided that CES’s and IATA’s relationship would be governed by rules in IATA’s Travel Agent’s Handbook (“the Handbook”). Its governing law was Indian law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">2.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Handbook contained a collection of “Resolutions”. Resolution 820e provided that certain disputes “shall be finally settled, subject to review by arbitration”, by the Travel Agency Commissioner (“the TAC”). The TAC’s jurisdiction could be “initiated” in different specified instances by CES or IATA. After the TAC’s decision had been rendered, pursuant to Resolution 818g, any party would then have the right to submit the TAC’s decision to <em>de novo </em>review by arbitration.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">Background to the parties’ dispute</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">3.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Under the rules in the Handbook, an agent such as CES was obliged to remit monies received from the sale of the tickets of member airlines of IATA by stated dates. For example, for domestic air tickets sold between the 1st and 15th days of the month, the money received by the agent had to be remitted by the 25th day of the same month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">4.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>CES failed to remit INR 46,43,37,605 for the period of 1 to 15 March 2013. IATA demanded payment of said sum by 28 March 2013. When payment was not made, according to CES due to a credit limit issue with its new bank, IATA wrote to CES on 28 March 2013, advising CES that its agency was declared in default, and that IATA’s member airlines would be notified of such default. CES’s ticketing facilities would also be withdrawn, and its agency would be terminated effective on 30 April 2013, subject to the payment of the money by that date or 50% of the money and an agreed firm schedule for repayment. CES did not reply to this, nor did it pay or agree to a schedule for repayment. Under the rules, IATA, as manager of the payment system, was required to make the demand and take the default action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">5.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 1 May 2013, IATA wrote to CES, advising that the agency agreement was terminated with immediate effect. CES was advised that it could seek review by the TAC if it disagreed with this decision. CES took no action at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">6.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Over a year later, on 23 May 2014, CES wrote to the TAC; while the letter was not in any clear way an initiation of review by the TAC of any action or decision of IATA, the TAC appears to have regarded it as an initiation of a review of the termination of the agency agreement. The TAC replied that the application for review was time-barred, as it was brought well in excess of the 30 day time limit in Resolution 820e. Accordingly, the TAC declined to intervene.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">Indian court proceedings and arbitration</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">7.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 27 January 2016, IATA began court proceedings in Delhi, India, claiming INR 124,31,69,623 for tickets sold by CES from 1 to 25 March 2013 (“the Indian court proceedings”). CES filed an application for the court to “reject the suit” for a variety of reasons, with one being that it was not maintainable and was to be referred to arbitration pursuant to s 8(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (India) (“the ACA”). CES’s application was allowed, and the Indian proceedings was disposed of, with the parties being referred to arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">8.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 29 March 2018, IATA began arbitration proceedings against CES, claiming the same amount it had claimed in the Indian proceedings. CES challenged the arbitral tribunal’s (“the Tribunal”) jurisdiction as, among others, there had not been a decision rendered by the TAC. The Tribunal issued its award on jurisdiction on 16 May 2019, holding that it had jurisdiction to hear the claim. CES applied to the Singapore court to set aside the Tribunal’s award on jurisdiction. By agreement, the arbitral proceedings was stayed pending the disposal of CES’s application. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Decision of the Court</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">9.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>A decision of the TAC was a precondition to arbitration. Two issues arose for the Court’s consideration. The first issue was whether, notwithstanding the absence of a TAC decision, the Tribunal nonetheless had jurisdiction because the absence of a decision should be attributed to CES’s failure to initiate a review (“the default question”). The second issue, which arose only if the first issue was answered in the negative, was whether CES was estopped from denying the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, or had waived the fulfilment of the pre-condition of having a TAC decision, by reason of representations concerning arbitration which it had made in the course of the Indian proceedings (“the estoppel/waiver question”).</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">The default question</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">10.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Resolutions 820e and 818g of the Handbook said in different language that what was reviewed by arbitration was a decision of the TAC. So, as held in <em>Delhi Express Travels Pvt Ltd v International Air Transport Association &amp; others [2009] 3 Arb LR 303 (“Delhi Express”) </em>at [21], a decision of the TAC was a precursor or pre-requisite step to arbitration: at <strong>[45]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">11.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Nonetheless, in <em>Delhi Express </em>it was held that the agent could not rely on the absence of a TAC decision when it could have initiated review by the TAC but failed to do so. At the hearing, CES accepted that if it alone could have initiated a review by the TAC and did not do so, it could not rely on the absence of a decision of the TAC in order to avoid an arbitration. With that acceptance, the default question came down to whether IATA could have initiated a review by the TAC, so that the absence of a decision by the TAC was not due to CES’s default alone: at <strong>[51] and [52]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">12.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>This was a question of construction of the rules contained in the Handbook. The evidence of IATA’s expert on Indian rules of interpretation was consistent with the familiar principles of interpretation at the common law, requiring that the parties’ intentions be discerned from the contractual document(s), and that the interpretation adopted be one which gave effect to all parts of the document(s) and did not reject any part of them: at <strong>[54] and [55]</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">13.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>While Resolution 820e provided that a TAC review could be initiated by either an agent (being CES) or by IATA, the initiation of a TAC review was premised on certain conditions. In this case, CES accepted that it could have initiated a review pursuant to Resolution 820e. Reviewing the relevant provisions in the Handbook, the Court concluded that IATA was unable to initiate a TAC review of the relevant decision. Accordingly, CES could not rely on the absence of a TAC decision to dispute the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Hence, notwithstanding the absence of a TAC decision, the Tribunal had jurisdiction to arbitrate the dispute: at <strong>[56]–[70].</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">The estoppel/waiver question</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">14.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The finding that the Tribunal had jurisdiction rendered the estoppel/waiver question moot. Nonetheless, the Court proceeded to consider the issue in case of an appeal. IATA submitted that the absence of a TAC decision and the fact that it was no longer possible to obtain such a decision had clearly been raised by IATA in resisting CES’s application pursuant to s 8(1) of the ACA to refer the Indian court proceedings to arbitration. IATA said that by its various assertions of arbitration nonetheless, and by maintaining the application for the claim to be referred to arbitration, CES was estopped from raising the absence of a TAC decision as a bar to arbitration. Alternatively, it said that in maintaining arbitrability in the Indian court proceedings although the absence of a TAC decision had been brought out, CES waived the need for a prior TAC decision: at <strong>[87]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">15.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>According to the experts on Indian law for both IATA and CES, in an application under s 8(1) of the ACA, the court looked only to whether <em>prima facie </em>there is a valid arbitration agreement. If the court was of the opinion that <em>prima facie </em>an arbitration agreement existed, it ought to refer the dispute to arbitration and leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to be finally determined by the arbitral tribunal. As held in <em>Hindustan Petroleum Corporation v M/S Pinhcity Medway Petroleums </em>(2003) 6 SCC 503, referral to arbitration was mandatory once there was an arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties, even though “the applicability thereof [was] disputed by the respondent”. Any objection to the applicability of the arbitration clause had to be raised before the arbitral tribunal, and was left to be determined by the tribunal: at <strong>[90] and [91]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">16.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Although the experts did not directly address the specific question of whether, in an application under s 8(1) of the ACA, referral to arbitration could be resisted by contending that although there was an arbitration agreement, a precondition to arbitration was not satisfied, from the expert evidence and the decision in <em>Delhi Express,</em> the answer was no: at [<strong>92]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">17.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>CES’s assertions in the documents filed in the Indian court proceedings, when read in context, simply said that the dispute was the subject of an arbitration agreement, and that it fell within s 8(1) of the ACA. There was no clear acceptance that, despite the absence of a TAC decision, the arbitration could proceed with the arbitrator having jurisdiction to determine the dispute. Hence, the estoppel ground, which required a clear and unequivocal represented by words or conduct on which reliance was placed, failed. For similar reasons, the waiver by election ground, which required an unequivocal representation in relation to the right or remedy being waived, also failed: at <strong>[94]–[95] and [99]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">Observations on the evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">18.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The function of an expert witness on foreign law is to inform the court of the foreign law, to identify relevant judgments or other authorities, and if there is no authority directly in point to assist the court in finding what the foreign court’s ruling would be if the issue arose for decision. The expert should not give opinions on the conclusions which the Court ought to draw, as those conclusions should be the subject of counsel’s submissions. It was appropriate to remind practitioners that the instructing lawyers ought not to ask the expert to opine beyond his or her proper role, and that they ought to bring to the expert’s attention the limits of that role: at <strong>[101]–[104].</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">19.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Similarly, evidentiary affidavits are there to place facts before the court, including disputed facts. They are not there for submissions on conclusions of fact or legal argument, and ought not to include either: those were matters for counsel in written or oral submissions. Practitioners were reminded to ensure that the proper bounds of evidentiary affidavits were not transgressed, and that they ought to restrain their client’s enthusiasm to take on the advocate’s role: at <strong>[105]–[106].</strong></span></p>
