font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 At the heart of the present proceedings is a tension that does not often arise but that inevitably generates considerable divisiveness when it surfaces. On one side of the divide is the impulse to see crime punished to the full extent of the harm that it causes and in accordance with the perceived culpability of its perpetrators. On the other end is the constitutional imperative that the court’s power to do justice does not include <span class="font-italic">legislative</span> power; in other words, the court cannot impermissibly add to or take away from statutory language because its law-making power does not extend to the statutory domain. In the overwhelming majority of disputes before the court, the tension simply does not arise because statute is reconsidered and revised to keep the criminal law and its penalties in line with modern conceptions and standards of right and wrong. But where a governing statutory provision fails to evolve with the times and becomes unable to effectively regulate its appointed area of socio-economic activity, the impulse to augment the statutory provision in a manner that will give effect to contemporary models of justice – or simply to do what the court perceives to be justice in the particular case before it – may become urgent and overwhelming. In such cases, the impulse strains against the borders of the judicial function. However, the court cannot give way to this impulse and must remain guided by statutory language and legislative purpose in determining the result in the case before it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 We begin by introducing the application before us. The present application by the Public Prosecutor is yet another in a series of proceedings concerning members of the City Harvest Church (“CHC”). At its heart, this application concerns a discrete point of law that centres on the interpretation of s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“s 409”). The provision provides for the enhanced punishment of any person who commits the offence of criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) in respect of property entrusted to him “in his capacity of a public servant, or in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent”. In full, it reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in his capacity of a public servant,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">in the way of his business </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">as</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">an agent</span>, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The provision just quoted is deceptively simple. As we will explain, its apparent simplicity belies the difficulty of the interpretive exercise required to determine its meaning. The present application raises a myriad of complex and closely related issues. As alluded to earlier, this includes the fundamental and overarching issue as to <span class="font-italic">where the line is to be drawn between judicial interpretation on the one hand and legislative action on the other</span>. As we shall also see, this is a case in which careful attention must be paid to <span class="font-italic">historical analysis</span> – in terms of the legislative history of CBT as a statutory offence and the socio-economic concerns that led to its promulgation – all the more so because s 409 was first enacted as part of the Indian Penal Code (Act 45 of 1860) (“the Indian Penal Code”) <span class="font-italic">more than a century and a half ago </span>and has, for all intents and purposes, remained in its original form until the present day. Indeed, both of the aforementioned issues are inextricably connected with each other given that the historical materials will serve either to <span class="font-italic">clarify </span>or to <span class="font-italic">confirm </span>the meaning of s 409, pursuant to s 9A(2) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Given the signal importance of the issues just mentioned, perhaps a few preliminary observations might be apposite – if nothing else than to ensure that the legal lenses through which s 409 is analysed are first cleared of any grit or fogginess that might otherwise lead to a distorted analysis of the provision itself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Some preliminary observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 It is axiomatic that legal analysis in general and statutory interpretation in particular must be approached in an objective manner. This may appear to be an obvious point but it is of special significance in the context of the present case. Let us elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>As already mentioned, s 409 was enacted more than a century and a half ago. It is accordingly a statutory provision of considerable vintage and, for this reason, may bear less relevance to present times than it did to the past. This is an issue that we will examine subsequently. For present purposes, we focus on the notion or proposal that it might be possible to adopt a “purposive approach” to statutory interpretation in order to take into account the changes (even sea changes) that have taken place since it was enacted, and thereby “modernise” the provision by robust “interpretive” means. In our view, this would be a misuse of statutory interpretation at best and potentially exceed the proper remit of the court at worst. It is essential to state at the outset that there are <span class="font-italic">limits</span> to the purposive interpretation of statutes, as the Singapore High Court described in unequivocal terms in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd v Oystertec plc and another suit </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 712</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [27]:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I pause at this juncture to note that a literal reading of the (indeed, any) statutory text could lead to a dry, brittle literalness that does no justice to the enterprise of the law in general and the text concerned in particular. On the contrary, the favoured approach nowadays (and rightly so, in my view) is a purposive approach that is exemplified not only by the case law but also by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act itself (Cap 1, 1999 Rev Ed). <span class="font-italic">Indeed, a purposive approach towards the statutory text does not ignore the literal meaning of the text by any means but, rather, complements it by ensuring that the purpose and intent of the statutory text itself is achieved and that any strained and, a fortiori, absurd result is avoided. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I should reiterate that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the court’s interpretation</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> should be consistent with, and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">should not either add to or take away from, or stretch unreasonably, the literal language of the statutory provision concerned</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">In other words, the literal statutory language constitutes the broad framework within which the purpose and intent of the provision concerned is achieved</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">It is imperative, to underscore the point just made, that this framework is not distorted as the ends do not justify the means</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Where, for example, it is crystal clear that the statutory language utilised does not capture the true intention and meaning of the provision concerned, any reform cannot come from “legal gymnastics” on the part of the court but, rather, must come from the Legislature itself</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In our judgment, when considering the issues in this case it is critical to bear in mind the observations set out in the passage just quoted. The reason is that, as the majority in the High Court below acknowledged, it is unsatisfactory that directors of companies and officers of charities and societies who commit CBT are not liable for a level of punishment that exceeds that for clerks, servants, carriers, wharfingers or warehouse-keepers. In our view, if the majority is correct in its interpretation of s 409, there would be a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">lacuna or gap </span>in the law in so far as the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">punishment</span> <span class="font-italic">of directors</span> of companies and officers of charities and societies who commit CBT is concerned – although it should be noted that there is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no lacuna</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in so far as <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conviction</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is concerned, given that such offenders would still be criminally liable for CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter </span>punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code. In the words of the majority (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other</span><span class="font-italic"> appeals </span>[2017] 4 SLR 474 (“the MA Judgment”) (at [112]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We agree with the Prosecution that directors, who occupy positions of great power, trust and responsibility, are more culpable than employees when they commit CBT offences against their companies or organisations. To that extent, we agree that it is intuitively unsatisfactory that a director would only be liable for CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter </span>under s 406 of the Penal Code while a clerk, servant, carrier or warehouse keeper would be liable for an aggravated offence under either ss 407 or 408 of the Penal Code. This does not, however, mean that we can ignore the wording of the section. Like the Malaysian Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Periasamy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([93] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), we are of the view that adopting the interpretation put forward by the Prosecution may be “tantamount to rewriting the section by means of an unauthori[s]ed legislative act” (at 575A). Such a task should be more properly left to Parliament. For instance, we note that the relevant expression of the equivalent provision in the Malaysian Penal Code was amended in 1993 to read “in his capacity of a public servant or an agent”. We further note for completeness that while <span class="font-italic">Periasamy </span>was decided <span class="font-italic">after </span>the amendment was made, the amended provision had no application to the appeals as the offences were committed before the amendment came into force. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 However, the issue that then arises is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">which</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> institution (</span><span class="font-weight-bold">ie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the court </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">or</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Parliament) </span>should fill this <span class="font-italic">lacuna or gap</span>. The view of the majority of the High Court was, in effect, that it had reached the limits of judicial interpretation and that it could therefore not fill the lacuna or gap <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">without becoming a “mini-legislature”</span> – hence, their view was that the “task should be more properly left to Parliament” (see the extract cited above). Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter </span>[2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span>”) this Court observed (in a similar vein) as follows (at [77]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is important to commence our analysis in this regard by referring to a fundamental proposition that constitutes part of the wider concept of the separation of powers. Put simply, the courts are <span class="font-italic">separate and distinct from</span> the Legislature. More specifically, whilst the courts do “make” law, this is only permissible in the context of the interpretation of statutes and the development of the principles of common law and equity. <span class="font-weight-bold">It is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">im</span><span class="font-weight-bold">permissible for </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the courts</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> to arrogate to themselves </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legislative powers</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> – to become, in other words, “</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">mini-legislatures</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”. </span>This must necessarily be the case because the courts have no mandate whatsoever to create or amend laws in a manner which permits recourse to <span class="font-italic">extra-legal policy factors as well as considerations</span>. The jurisdiction as well as the power to do so lie exclusively within the sphere of <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Legislature</span>. Indeed, the power of the Legislature to enact and amend laws is governed by quite a different procedure.

Before proceeding to describe the applicable principles of statutory interpretation and our analysis of the scope of s 409, it is useful to begin by setting out the relevant background as well as the two questions of law of public interest that arise therefrom and which are the subject of the present criminal reference.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Given that the disputed issue is a question of law of general applicability, the specific facts of the present case are of limited relevance to our decision. The facts are set out comprehensively in the first instance judgment of the Presiding Judge of the State Courts (“the Judge”), <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others </span>[2015] SGDC 326 (“the Conviction GD”), as well as the MA Judgment. They are also summarised in our grounds of decision on an application for leave to bring a criminal reference brought by the fourth respondent, <span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1130 (“<span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han</span>”) at [6]–[29]. For present purposes, it therefore suffices for us to only briefly recount the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 CHC is a Singaporean “mega-church” that embarked on what it called “the Crossover” project in 2002. This was a project that involved Ms Ho Yeow Sun (“Sun Ho”), a co-founder of CHC and wife of the second respondent, Kong Hee, recording secular pop music albums as a means of evangelical outreach. At the same time, the church was actively looking for suitable premises to accommodate its growing congregation and raised large amounts of funds for this purpose through a pledge campaign. These donations were aggregated in a Building Fund (“the BF”) and were meant to be used for the purchase of land, construction costs, rentals, furniture and fittings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Crossover was a controversial project that gave rise to allegations within the church that CHC was giving excessive attention to Sun Ho and misusing its funds to promote her career. In response to these allegations, the CHC management board announced – both publicly and to the church’s executive members (“the EMs”) – that church funds had not been used to purchase Sun Ho’s albums or to promote her career. This was untrue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Use of the BF to fund the Crossover through Xtron and Firna</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Following the denouncement of the allegations, the six respondents, who were leaders of CHC, decided that greater distance should be placed between CHC and Sun Ho’s music career to avoid further negative publicity. To this end, a separate company, Xtron Productions Pte Ltd (“Xtron”), was incorporated in June 2003. Xtron was, in appearance, an independent firm which was to provide artiste management services to Sun Ho. But the Judge, with whom the High Court agreed, found that Xtron was in substance no more than an extension of CHC and was controlled entirely by the church, and in particular by Kong Hee, who was the senior pastor of CHC, and the fifth respondent, Tan Ye Peng (“Ye Peng”), who was the deputy senior pastor. The directors of Xtron were no more than figureheads. From 2003, Xtron financed Sun Ho’s music career using monies from various sources including donations and revenue from CHC. But these proceeds were deemed to be insufficient after it was resolved that the Crossover, and therefore Sun Ho’s music career, should be extended to the USA. Eventually, a plan was hatched for Xtron to take a loan from CHC’s BF, notwithstanding that the BF was a restricted fund meant to be used for building-related expenses. This loan took the form of a bond subscription agreement (“the Xtron BSA”) under which a total of $13m was transferred from the BF to Xtron in exchange for Xtron bonds. The CHC board and the EMs of the church were led to believe that the monies from the BF were to be invested to generate financial returns, since the church was unlikely to acquire a building anytime soon. In reality, these monies were diverted to the Crossover. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In mid-2008, the respondents came under pressure from CHC’s auditors to disclose the true nature and purpose of the Xtron bonds, including the uncertainty of repayment (given that Xtron was consistently making losses) and the identity of Sun Ho as a “key player” in Xtron. Seeking respite from the auditors, they made a decision to take Sun Ho out of Xtron. This would be accomplished by transferring her to another company, Ultimate Assets, and by way of another bond subscription agreement, this time between CHC and another company, PT The First National Glassware (“Firna”). Under this bond subscription agreement (“the Firna BSA”), a further $11m was transferred from the BF to Firna. Firna was an Indonesian glassware manufacturing company. But the Firna bonds were never intended to be available for Firna’s glass factory business, nor was Firna’s revenue ever intended to go toward the redemption of the Firna bonds. Instead, as the courts below found, the respondents had complete control over the Firna bond proceeds and these monies were primarily used for the Crossover. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“Round-tripping” transactions to redeem the Xtron and Firna bonds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In late 2009, after CHC’s auditors raised further questions about the Xtron and Firna bonds, it was decided that the bonds had to be redeemed. Between October and December 2009, the respondents procured a series of transactions to redeem the Xtron and Firna bonds (“the round-tripping transactions”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The round-tripping transactions involved two broad components:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The transfer of funds totalling $11.4m from CHC’s BF and General Fund (“GF”) to companies controlled by the respondents, purportedly as investments in a Special Opportunities Fund (“SOF”). These funds were then routed to Firna and paid back to CHC in order to redeem the Firna bonds. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) CHC entering into an Advance Rental License Agreement with Xtron (“the ARLA”), under which Xtron set off $21.5m from the sum that CHC was to pay Xtron, in order to fully redeem the bonds it had issued to CHC. As part of the ARLA, CHC also transferred approximately $15.2m to Xtron as “prepayment” of advance rental. As the courts below found, the ARLA was not a genuine commercial agreement and its purpose was simply to facilitate the redemption of the Xtron bonds and the return of the monies owed to CHC under the SOF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 To record these transactions, the respondents inserted accounting entries in CHC’s General Journal. The courts below found that these entries were false as they did not capture the substance of the transactions, which were not genuine commercial transactions but were instead intended to create the false impression that the Xtron and Firna bonds had been redeemed through proper means.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The net result of the round-tripping transactions was that the Xtron and Firna bonds were redeemed, and the liabilities owed to CHC under the SOF were discharged. Subsequently, the ARLA was terminated and Xtron repaid CHC a total of $40.5m, comprising the unutilised advance rental and security deposit paid under the ARLA (including interest). Although it is not exactly clear where Xtron obtained these funds from, it appears that a number of loans were granted to Xtron by various individuals affiliated to the respondents and CHC so that the company could make the necessary repayment to the church.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Charges against the respondents </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Following investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department on the above facts, a total of 43 charges were brought against the six respondents. These have been characterised in the judgments below as the “sham investment charges”, the “round-tripping charges” and the “account falsification charges”: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The three sham investment charges, which were brought against all the respondents save for the third respondent, Tan Shao Yuen Sharon (“Sharon”), concerned the offence of conspiring to commit CBT as an agent punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. These charges arose from the use of the BF to purchase the Xtron and Firna bonds. The relevant “agents” stated in the charges are Kong Hee, Ye Peng and the first respondent, Lam Leng Hung (“John Lam”), who were entrusted with the funds in their capacity as members of the CHC management board. The first sham investment charge was brought under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)), and the second and third charges were under the 2008 revised edition of the same Act (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)). The only difference between the two versions of the Penal Code in relation to s 409 concerns the maximum non-life imprisonment term for the offence. This has no bearing on the present application, which concerns only the elements of the s 409 offence and not the sentences imposed, and all subsequent references to “the Penal Code” in this judgment are to both revised editions of the legislation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The three round-tripping charges were brought against all the respondents except Kong Hee and John Lam. These charges are also for the offence of conspiring to commit CBT as an agent punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, and they were brought on the basis that the BF and the GF had been misused in the round-tripping transactions. The relevant “agent” identified in these charges is Ye Peng, who was entrusted with the funds in his capacity as a member of the CHC management board. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Four account falsification charges were brought against all the respondents except Kong Hee and John Lam. These charges are for the offence of falsification of accounts under s 477A read with s 109 of the Penal Code and they arose from the recording of false entries in CHC’s General Journal (see [18] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">For convenience, we will refer to the sham investment and round-tripping charges as “the CBT charges”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decisions below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Judge found the respondents guilty on all the charges against them. His decision on conviction is succinctly summarised in the MA Judgment at [51]–[58], and a summary of his decision on sentence can be found at [344]–[360] of the MA Judgment. We will only briefly summarise his analysis of whether the requirement under s 409 of the Penal Code are satisfied, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the funds were entrusted to the relevant respondents “in the way of [their] business as … agent[s]” (Conviction GD at [119]–[123]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Judge rejected the respondents’ defence that the relevant respondents were not acting in the way of their business as agents within the meaning of s 409 of the Penal Code. The respondents had argued, relying on <span class="font-italic">Mahumara</span><span class="font-italic">kalage Edward Andrew Cooray v The Queen</span> [1953] AC 407 (“<span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>”), a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal of Ceylon, that it did not follow from the fact that they were directors of CHC that the entrustment to them of dominion over CHC’s property was therefore in the way of their business as agents. In reaching his decision, the Judge relied on the Singapore High Court judgment of <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah v Public Prosecutor</span> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 725 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span>”), which had distinguished <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. In the Judge’s view, <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> was binding on him and stood for the proposition that “if one is an agent, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a director, and one is entrusted with property in one’s capacity as agent, that would be entrustment in the way of one’s business as agent” (Conviction GD at [120]). Alternatively, he found that <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>could be read as adopting the reasoning of the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic"> K Dalmia v Delhi Administration</span> AIR 1962 SC 1821 (“<span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>”) that s 409 would operate “if the person be an agent of another and that other person entrusts him with property or with any dominion over that property in the course of his duties as an agent” (Conviction GD at [122]). On either reading of <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span>, s 409 applied to the relevant respondents since Kong Hee, Ye Peng and John Lam were unarguably agents <span class="font-italic">qua</span> directors of the CHC board, and had been entrusted with the funds of the BF and GF in the course of their duties as members of the board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In addition, the Judge rejected the submission that he was bound by <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>and should follow it instead of <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span>. It was not open to him, as a matter of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>, to find that <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>had wrongly distinguished <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>, as that would involve him sitting in judgment on a decision of a superior court (Conviction GD at [123]). We will describe the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>, <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>in greater detail subsequently. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The High Court’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Dissatisfied with the Judge’s decision, the respondents appealed. The appeal was heard by a specially convened coram of three Judges of the High Court. The High Court allowed the appeals against conviction and sentence in part, with a partial dissent by Chan Seng Onn J.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Again, in describing the High Court’s decision we will focus only on the requirement that the funds must have been entrusted <span class="font-italic">in the way of the respondents’ business as agents</span> within the meaning of s 409. This issue is analysed in the MA Judgment at [88]–[122] by the majority, and at [444]–[474] by Chan J. In respect of the other elements of the CBT charges, it suffices to note that the coram <span class="font-italic">unanimously</span> agreed that these elements – namely, that (a) the respondents were entrusted with dominion over CHC’s funds; (b) monies from CHC’s funds were misappropriated for various unauthorised purposes in pursuance of a conspiracy to misuse CHC’s funds; (c) the respondents abetted each other by engaging in the above conspiracy to misuse CHC’s funds; and (d) the respondents acted dishonestly in doing so – were satisfied in this case. We also leave aside the account falsification charges, which the High Court (also unanimously) found were made out and which are outside the scope of this criminal reference.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Majority’s analysis of s 409</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The majority of the High Court, comprising Chao Hick Tin JA and Woo Bih Li J, accepted that the position in Singapore since <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> is that directors who misappropriate property that has been entrusted to them by their respective companies or organisations are liable for the aggravated offence under s 409. However, the majority took the view that this position was wrong in law. It held that the expression “in the way of his business as … an agent” in the provision must necessarily refer to a <span class="font-italic">professional</span> agent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one who professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and from which he makes his living. The fact that an individual is a director of a company or a society does not mean that he is in the <span class="font-italic">business</span> of an agent within the meaning of s 409. The majority made the following findings which we will examine in further detail later:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the language of s 409, in particular the expression “in the way of his <span class="font-italic">business</span>” [emphasis added], indicates that the agent contemplated by the provision is a person who is carrying on a “business” as an agent. The natural reading of the word “business” is a <span class="font-italic">commercial activity done for profit</span>. This conclusion is buttressed by the contrast between the expressions “in the way of his business” and “in his capacity”, the latter of which is used only in relation to public servants (within the first part of s 409). The majority disagreed with the reasoning of the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>that a person who is acting “in the way of his business” as an agent is acting “in connection with his duties” as an agent. According to the majority, no distinction can be drawn between a person who is acting “in his capacity as an agent” and a person who is acting “in connection with his duties” as an agent. Since Parliament would not have used two different expressions in the same provision to mean the same thing, “in the way of his business” must mean something more than either “in the capacity of” or “in the course of his duties”. Thus the approach in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>could not be accepted (MA Judgment at [102]–[104]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the words “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” that precede the reference to “an agent” suggest that the wider interpretation of the phrase “in the way of his business” adopted in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>is incorrect. That phrase has to be applied to “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, [and] an attorney” and not merely to “an agent”. When read in the light of those preceding words, the phrase “in the way of his business” more sensibly means “in the occupation or the trade of” (MA Judgment at [104]–[105]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the existence of those preceding words also brings into play the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span> principle in relation to the interpretation of the word “agent”. Applying that principle, the meaning of the term “agent” must be restricted by, and inferred from, the words “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney”. Those words refer to persons who carry on businesses or trades of offering certain services to the public in the course of which the customer has to entrust property, or the dominion of property, with them, and who have an external relationship with the person entrusting property to them (MA Judgment at [106]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The majority also relied on <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. The majority read <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span> as holding that in order for an accused to be convicted of the aggravated offence of CBT as an agent, he must be in the <span class="font-italic">profession, trade or business</span> as an agent (what the majority referred to as a “professional agent”) and must be entrusted with property in that capacity (MA Judgment at [97]–[100]). Reference was also made to the English cases on s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 (c 96) (UK) (“the Larceny Act 1861”), which was worded similarly to s 409, as well as remarks made in the House of Commons on the UK provision. The majority found that these materials bolstered the conclusion that s 409 of the Penal Code must be interpreted to encompass only <span class="font-italic">professional</span> agents (MA Judgment at [107]–[108]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Applying the above analysis, the majority held that a director who has been entrusted with the property of the company or organisation by virtue of his capacity as a director does not fall within s 409. While a director may be an agent of the company or organisation and undoubtedly holds an important position in a company or organisation, he does not offer his services as an agent to the community at large. In addition, the relationship between a director and the company is an <span class="font-italic">internal </span>one and this stands in stark contrast to the <span class="font-italic">external </span>nature of the relationship that “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, [or] an attorney” shares with the customer who entrusts the property to him. The majority accepted that it may perhaps be intuitively unsatisfactory for a person holding the position of a director to be liable for CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and not a more aggravated form of the offence, but decided that it simply could not ignore the wording of the section. The task of re-writing the provision was more properly left to Parliament (MA Judgment at [110] and [112]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The majority also rejected the Prosecution’s argument that <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>should be followed because it has been followed for over four decades, during which period Parliament had amended the Penal Code four times but had left s 409 untouched. It emphasised that any erroneous interpretation of a provision, especially one that imposes criminal liability, must be corrected regardless of how entrenched it may have become. In addition, Parliament’s intention has to be discerned at or around the time the law is passed, and the fact that Parliament did not amend s 409 post-<span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> does not necessarily indicate that the position taken in that case was reflective of Parliament’s intention (MA Judgment at [111]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Finally, the majority rejected the respondents’ argument that the court was bound by <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. This was because <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>was an appeal from the courts of another jurisdiction and not the Singapore courts. The principle that the Singapore courts are bound by decisions of the Privy Council on appeals from jurisdictions other than Singapore, where such decisions concern statutory provisions that are <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with provisions in Singapore law, had been effectively rejected<span class="font-italic"> </span>by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang v Attorney-General </span>[2016] 1 SLR 992 (“<span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang</span>”) (MA Judgment at [113]–[121]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The majority therefore held that the charges under s 409 were not made out as the relevant respondents were not professional agents. The CBT charges were accordingly reduced to charges under s 406 of the Penal Code, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the offence of CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>, which provides for a much lower maximum term of imprisonment than s 409. Section 409 provides that the offender “shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years” while s 406 provides for a maximum imprisonment term of seven years. Consequently, the sentences imposed on the respondents were significantly reduced.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Minority’s analysis of s 409</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Chan J dissented from the majority’s analysis of s 409. His reasoning can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>in no way bears on the question of whether a director of a company or organisation, being in that capacity entrusted with the property of the company or organisation, can be liable for the aggravated offence of CBT as an agent. A full appreciation of the facts of <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span> reveals that the decision merely stands for the proposition that an accused would not satisfy the requirement of being entrusted with property “in the way of his business as … an agent” if he is acting as an agent only in a casual sense (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one who happens to be entrusted with property on an informal or <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> basis) (MA Judgment at [446]–[453]). The English authorities on s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 similarly indicate that s 409 is not intended to apply to persons who find themselves agents as a result of fortuitous reasons or as a result of a particular transaction, but only agents who are entrusted with property or with dominion over property “in the way of [their] business as … agent[s]” (MA Judgment at [454]–[458]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>rightly held that the expression “in the way of his business” in s 409 of the Indian Penal Code (which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> to s 409 of our Penal Code) connotes the entrustment of property to an accused in “the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade”. It was also noted in that case that there is a difference between an agent who acts merely in his capacity as an agent and one who <span class="font-italic">also</span> acts in the way of his business as an agent. The distinguishing factor is that the phrase “in the way of his business” connotes a sense of regular activity, <span class="font-italic">or</span> the inhabitation of a particular trade, profession, office or occupation. Thus, in order for one to be entrusted in the way of his business as an agent, the entrustment of property as an agent must have come about as a result of a certain trade, profession, office or occupation held by the accused (MA Judgment at [460]–[461]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The same analysis would apply to bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys, who can only be liable under s 409 if they are entrusted with property whilst in their trade, profession, office or occupation as a banker, merchant, factor, broker or attorney. One, who by the circumstance of a <span class="font-italic">particular</span> transaction, <span class="font-italic">happens</span> to become – for the purpose of that transaction – a banker, merchant, factor, broker or attorney and is entrusted with property would not be acting “in the way of his business” so as to fall within the scope of s 409 (MA Judgment at [462]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The term “agent” must be interpreted in the light of the common thread that unites persons such as bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>they act in a certain trusted trade, profession, office or occupation which the public relies on or utilises to facilitate the course of commercial dealings (MA Judgment at [463]–[464]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In the context of directors of companies and organisations, the argument that they are <span class="font-italic">only casually </span>entrusted with the company’s or organisation’s money or property is untenable. When directors are entrusted with the property of their company or organisation <span class="font-italic">in their role as directors</span>, they are entrusted with the property in accordance with that role and office. Like bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys, they hold a formal position in which they, in the usual course of that position, undertake to act on someone else’s behalf, and in the course of doing so, receive or hold property on that person’s behalf. The directorship of a company or organisation facilitates the course of commercial dealings, among others, between the public and the company or organisation, making the fictional legal entity of a company possible as a practical reality. Directors of a company or an organisation therefore fall within the class of persons contemplated under s 409 (MA Judgment at [465]–[467]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) This interpretation is also in line with the framework of the Penal Code, which provides for an increase in the scale of punishment according to the degree of trust reposed. In contrast, the analysis of the respondents would result in an anomalous situation wherein a director who committed the offence of CBT would only be liable for the maximum punishment of seven years’ imprisonment in the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code, whereas a clerk or servant who misappropriates the property of the company could be liable to a much heavier sentence of up to 15 years’ imprisonment under s 408 of the same edition of the Penal Code. This incongruity ought to be avoided as the court generally avoids interpreting statutes in a manner that produces absurd results (MA Judgment at [470]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The argument that an “agent” in s 409 only covers professional agents should be rejected as neither the case authorities nor the principles of statutory interpretation require that the section be interpreted in such a narrow manner (MA Judgment at [471]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) In the final analysis, whether a person has been entrusted with property “in the way of his business” whether as “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” depends on all the facts and circumstances, including the nature and scope of his duties arising from his trade, profession, office or occupation, the circumstances under which the property was entrusted to him, and the degree and nature of the connection that the entrustment has with the nature and scope of those duties, having regard to the type of trusted trade, profession, office or occupation that the person is in (MA Judgment at [472]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Chan J therefore found that the respondents had been properly convicted for the offences punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. The relevant respondents had, as members of the CHC management board, acted as agents <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> CHC and were entrusted with the church’s property by virtue of their positions. This entrustment was in their way of their business as agents (of CHC) under s 409 of the Penal Code (MA Judgment at [473]–[474]). Thus his view was that the sentences imposed at first instance ought to stand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Questions referred in the present criminal reference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 We now turn to the present criminal reference. There are two questions referred by the Prosecution under s 397(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). These are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic font-underline">Question 1</span>. For the purposes of s 409 of the Penal Code, does the expression “in the way of his business as ... an agent” refer only to a person who is a <span class="font-italic">professional</span> agent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one who professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and from which he makes his living?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic font-underline">Question 2</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>Is a director of a corporation, or governing board member or key officer of a charity, or officer of a society, who is entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, by the said corporation, charity, or society, so entrusted in the way of his business as an agent for the purposes of s 409 of the Penal Code?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Both questions concern the scope of s 409, and they are inextricably linked. The main issue of law, which is one of statutory interpretation, is what the phrase “in the way of his business as ... an agent” in s 409 means – does it refer only to a <span class="font-italic">professional</span> agent as the majority of the High Court held? Or should it be construed more broadly so as to encompass the persons identified in Question 2, namely, directors and board members of corporations, charities and societies?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 A separate issue which follows from the court’s determination of the questions referred is what consequential orders, if any, need to be made. The Prosecution’s position is that if it prevails in its interpretation of s 409, then the original convictions of the respondents under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code ought to be restored and orders enhancing their sentences accordingly ought to be made. Of course, if the majority’s interpretation of s 409 is upheld, then no such consequential orders need to be made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the parties’ arguments on the scope of s 409</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We now set out a summary of the parties’ submissions on the scope of s 409, which we will examine in greater detail in the course of our analysis below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prosecution’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Prosecution relies heavily on the principle that, in construing a statutory provision, the court should always avoid absurd results save in a situation where avoiding such results would involve a violation of the language of the provision. It submits that the majority’s interpretation of s 409 would produce absurd results since high-ranking directors who are in a position to misappropriate huge amounts of money would be subject to less severe punishment than low ranking employees – a result which the majority itself accepted was “intuitively unsatisfactory” (MA Judgment at [112]). The Prosecution argues that a broader interpretation of s 409, which would not require any re-writing of s 409, much less any violation of its language, should be adopted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On the language of s 409, the Prosecution argues as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The word “agent” has a specific legal meaning and refers to a person who agrees to act on a principal’s behalf, undertakes fiduciary obligations towards the principal and has the authority to affect the principal’s legal position. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The majority erred in applying the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>rule as the principle is used to cut down the meaning of words with wide or vague meaning whereas “agent” refers to a defined class. The principle also cannot be applied as no <span class="font-italic">genus </span>can be identified from the groups specified in s 409; these groups do not all share the characteristics of professional agents who have an external relationship to the person entrusting the property and who offer their services to the public at large. In addition, the absence of the word “other” before “agent” also indicates that the drafters of s 409 did not intend the word “agent” to be construed <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  The phrase “in the way of his business” can and should be construed as having the meaning of “in the course of one’s regular duties or functions”, thereby excluding agents who are entrusted with property on a casual or <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> basis. It does not necessarily refer to a commercial activity done for profit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Prosecution also submits that its interpretation is supported by the structure of the CBT provisions in the Penal Code and the legislative history. In particular, it points out that the CBT provisions are organised in a system of ascending severity, based on the role or position the offender occupied when he was entrusted with the property and the extent of trust and confidence reposed in him, rather than whether the offender stands in an internal or external relationship with the victim. This analysis, the Prosecution argues, is supported by the legislative history of the Penal Code and the English parliamentary debates on the law of embezzlement in the early 19th century, which show that the intention and purpose behind s 409 was to punish more severely persons who held positions of trust and confidence, and whose breaches of trust would have serious consequences, irrespective of whether they were engaged in profit making or offered their services to the community at large.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Prosecution then goes on to argue that directors and officers of companies, charities and societies should be construed as falling within s 409 as they are individuals subject to onerous fiduciary duties and in whom a high level of trust and confidence is reposed. The consequences of CBT committed by directors and officers of such corporate bodies are serious, given their ability to deal with their organisation’s property, the apex position which they hold and the fact that they act for non-human principals who are less able to supervise their activities as agents. There is thus a greater need to deter CBT committed by such persons through the imposition of harsher punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Finally, the Prosecution points out that the interpretation they have proffered is consistent with the long standing position in Singapore and India. They also submit that their interpretation is consistent with the English cases and <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>which merely indicate that s 409 only captures persons who regularly act as agents rather than casual agents who happen from time to time to act as such. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Respondents’ submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As a preliminary point, the respondents object to the inclusion of the references to a “governing board member or key officer of a charity” and an “officer of a society” in Question 2 of the present application (see [32(b)] above). They submit that the issue of whether such persons would fall within the scope of s 409 was never raised in the courts below and should not be belatedly raised through<span class="font-italic"> </span>a criminal reference. The respondents claim that the Prosecution is now effectively putting forward a new case which is broader than that which it ran at trial and in the appeal, and that there is no evidence as to whether the respondents were in fact “key officers of a charity” or “officers of a society”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the statutory interpretation of s 409 itself, the respondents rely on the reasoning of the majority of the High Court (see [26]–[29] above) and the Privy Council’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. In particular, they observe that s 409 draws a clear distinction between the phrase “in the way of his business”, used in relation to bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, attorneys and agents, and the expression “in his capacity”, which is used in relation to public servants. Given this distinction, they submit that the two phrases cannot be synonymous and that the phrase “in his capacity” must therefore require “something more” than the agent merely having acted “in his capacity” as such. This point, the respondents assert, indicates that the natural reading of “business” as referring to a commercial activity must be adopted. They contend that the Prosecution’s definition of the phrase as meaning “in the course of his duties” is untenable as there is no logical or meaningful distinction between acting “in his capacity” and acting “in the course of his duties”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The respondents also argue that the majority’s application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle in interpreting the word “agent” was correct and that “agent” refers to <span class="font-italic">professional</span> agents in whom the public have placed confidence. The various classes of persons identified in s 409 are all trusted agents who provide services to the community at large as part of a trusted trade. According to the respondents, this is the common thread uniting the various classes of persons identified in s 409 and provides the reason why they are subject to more severe punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Applying this analysis to directors, the respondents take the position that directors are not professional agents within the scope of s 409 because they do not carry on a business nor do they profess to offer to their services to the community at large. Even if s 409 could be read so broadly to include directors, the respondents submit that the relevant respondents in the present case should not be convicted under the provision as they were mere volunteers and were not remunerated for being board members of CHC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In addition, the respondents argue that the fact that <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>has been applied for the past four decades is not a good reason as a matter of principle for rejecting the majority’s analysis, since <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> has never been subject to extensive examination by the Singapore courts. In any event, even if <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>is entrenched law, that cannot stand in the way of the court taking the correct interpretation of a statutory provision which imposes criminal liability. The respondents also submit that any anomaly or intuitive unfairness arising from the majority’s decision can be explained on the basis that the drafters of the Indian Penal Code did not have directors or any other board members in mind when they drafted the CBT provisions. This gap should properly be left to Parliament to address. To do otherwise would be to disregard the separation of powers between the judicial branch and the legislative branch of government. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, the respondents rely on the principle that if any ambiguity over the ambit of s 409 persists (after all attempts have been made at a purposive reading), the rule of strict construction of penal provisions mandates that the court gives the benefit of doubt to the respondents as accused persons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues for determination </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Before we proceed with our substantive analysis of the issues before us, we will deal with two preliminary matters. The first is a procedural question as to whether the threshold conditions for the exercise of the court’s substantive jurisdiction under s 397 of the CPC are satisfied. As we will explain, if those conditions are not satisfied, it would be inappropriate for the court to proceed to determine the merits of the application. The second concerns the status of decisions of the Privy Council as allegedly binding authorities on Singapore courts save for the Court of Appeal. We deal with these procedural and methodological matters at the outset so as not to interrupt the flow of the subsequent analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As mentioned at [33] above, the core issue in this application is whether an “agent” within the meaning of s 409 of the Penal Code refers only to a <span class="font-italic">professional </span>agent – in the majority’s words, a person who professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and from which he makes his living (MA Judgment at [103]). Since this is ultimately a matter of statutory interpretation, it is appropriate for us to begin by setting out the applicable principles of statutory interpretation as described in <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng</span>”) and as more recently elaborated upon in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”). This will provide our methodology in determining the answer to the question posed. The first step of our analysis will be an examination of the text of the provision to determine its ordinary meaning, having regard not only to the disputed words but also s 409 as a whole and other sections on CBT within the Penal Code. In adhering to the interpretive methodology, our analysis will then extend to a consideration of legislative purpose, reviewing the legislative and historical material that, in our judgment, ultimately paints a clear and complete picture of what the draftsman intended and did not intend to include by the words that he used. It is this mutually-reinforcing interaction of text and context that has led us to our conclusion on this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the final part of our analysis, we consider the broader policy arguments that were raised by the parties and set out our observations on the limits of such arguments in the province of statutory interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary issues</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Threshold conditions for the exercise of the court’s substantive jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The first preliminary issue concerns the threshold conditions for the exercise of the court’s substantive jurisdiction under s 397 of the CPC, which governs criminal references to the Court of Appeal. It should be stressed that such criminal references are exceptional as, unlike a number of other jurisdictions, Singapore has a system of one-tier appeal in criminal matters. As this Court explained in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter</span> [2013] 2 SLR 141 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span>”) at [21], a liberal construction of s 397 so as to freely allow criminal references to be brought would “seriously undermine the system of one-tier appeal” as well as the principle of finality which “strongly militate[s] against the grant of such a reference save in very limited circumstances”. In addition, although the Public Prosecutor does not require leave to bring a criminal reference by virtue of s 397(2) of the CPC, it is well-established that this does not mean that the Court of Appeal is invariably bound to answer all questions referred to it under this section. In the exercise of its <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> jurisdiction under s 397, the Court of Appeal must be satisfied that the application properly falls within the scope of the provision, and this in turn entails a consideration of whether the requirements in s 397(1) are made out (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Yong Soon Bernard</span> [2015] 3 SLR 717 at [16]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Goldring Timothy Nicholas</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2014] 1 SLR 586 at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The only type of questions that can properly be referred to the Court of Appeal under s 397 are questions of law of public interest which have arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the High Court judge has affected the case. More specifically, the following four requirements must be satisfied (<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [15]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, the reference to the Court of Appeal can only be made in relation to a criminal matter decided by the High Court in exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, the reference must relate to a question of law and that question of law must be a question of law of public interest;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, the question of law must have arisen from the case which was before the High Court; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, the determination of the question of law by the High Court had affected the outcome of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19], this Court approved of the following approach articulated by the Malaysian Federal Court in <span class="font-italic">A </span><span class="font-italic">Ragunathan v Pendakwa Raya </span>[1982] 1 MLJ 139 at 141: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We think that the proper test for determining whether a question of law raised in the course of the appeal is of public interest would be whether it directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so <span class="font-italic">whether it is an open question in the sense that it is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not finally settled by this court</span> … <span class="font-italic">or is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternate views</span><span class="font-italic">. If the question is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">settled by the highest court</span><span class="font-italic"> or the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">general principles in determining the question are well settled</span><span class="font-italic"> and it is a mere question of applying those principles to the facts of the case the question would </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> be a question of law of public interest.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Notably, in order for a question of law to also be one of <span class="font-italic">public interest</span>, the question cannot have received a settled answer in the case law, either as a matter of directly applicable precedent or following the application of settled principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In this present reference, we are satisfied that all four conditions are met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The first, third and fourth requirements are made out as the scope of s 409 of the Penal Code is an issue which arose from the case before the High Court (which was exercising its appellate jurisdiction in the appeals brought by the accused persons) and its determination of that issue undoubtedly affected the outcome of the case. The only dispute on these requirements arises from the respondents’ objection to the inclusion of the references to a “governing board member or key officer of a charity” and an “officer of a society” in Question 2 (see [41] above). We are not persuaded that the inclusion of these terms is an attempt by the Prosecution to put forward a new case which is broader than that which it ran at trial. It must be recalled that the CBT charges against the respondents are premised on the entrustment of CHC’s funds to Kong Hee, Ye Peng and John Lam in their capacity as members of the CHC management board (see [20] above). This was the Prosecution’s case from the inception of these proceedings, and even the respondents accept that Question 2 may refer to “directors of a corporation, or management board members of a charity or society”. The Prosecution also clarified at the oral hearing that the sole reason why these terms are used in Question 2 is because this is the nomenclature utilised in the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed). In such circumstances, the references in Question 2 to a “governing board member or key officer of a charity” and an “officer of a society” neither prejudices the respondents nor expands the scope of the present criminal reference; these terms are merely alternative ways of describing the role which Kong Hee, Ye Peng and John Lam performed as members of the CHC management board. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In relation to the second condition, the questions are also general questions of<span class="font-italic"> law</span> concerning the interpretation of s 409, rather than questions of fact. In addition, they are, at least at first glance, questions of<span class="font-italic"> public interest</span> as there are conflicting High Court decisions on the legal controversy at hand, namely, <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>and the decision of the majority in this case. We observe that s 397(6) of the CPC expressly provides that “any question of law which any party applies to be referred regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest”. It is also undisputed that the Court of Appeal has not yet had the opportunity to speak definitively on the disputed issue. Accordingly, we do not consider the definition of an “agent” within the meaning of s 409 to be a settled issue. There is, however, one other factor which requires further consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In our recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Chew</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Han</span>, we held (at [46]–[50]) that the fact that a three-Judge coram of the High Court had been convened to hear the Magistrate’s Appeals was a matter of legal significance in relation to whether leave should be granted for the applicant in that case to refer questions to the Court of Appeal under s 397(1) of the CPC. In summary, we took the view that when a three-Judge coram of the High Court has ruled, its decision should generally represent a final and authoritative determination of the issues arising from the case, because a three-Judge coram is a<span class="font-italic"> de facto </span>Court of Appeal (although it is not one <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">jure</span>) and is convened precisely to deal with important questions affecting the public interest which require detailed examination. The result is that when a party to a criminal matter seeks to have the Court of Appeal reconsider a question that has already been determined by a three-Judge coram of the High Court, leave to do so will only be granted in exceptional situations. This general principle is of weaker application, however, where the determination of the question sought to be referred involves either: (a) an overturning or overruling of other decisions of the High Court; or (b) a departure from decisions of the Court of Appeal. These are outcomes that only the Court of Appeal, and not the High Court, can accomplish as a matter of authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In our judgment, the fact that a three-Judge coram of the High Court was convened to hear the appeal is likewise a relevant consideration in the Court of Appeal’s decision as to whether it should exercise its <span class="font-italic">substantive </span>jurisdiction to determine questions referred by the Public Prosecutor. This, of course, does not represent any limitation on the Public Prosecutor’s statutory right to refer any question of law of public interest without leave under s 397(2) of the CPC. Nevertheless, the fact that the reference was made from a decision of a three-Judge coram of the High Court is directly relevant to the Court of Appeal’s assessment as to whether the requirements under s 397(1) of the CPC are met, such that the case is a proper one for the exercise of the Court of Appeal’s substantive jurisdiction. We will briefly explain. As described at [51(b)] above, one of the requirements under s 397 is that the question of law referred is one of <span class="font-italic">public interest</span>, and this entails a consideration of whether the question (or the general principles governing it) has been <span class="font-italic">settled</span> by a court with the jurisprudential authority of the Court of Appeal (see [52] above). It follows that if the question referred by the Public Prosecutor has been considered and answered by a three-Judge coram of the High Court that is – as explained in <span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han </span>at [47] – a <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>Court of Appeal that has been convened precisely to deal with important questions affecting the public interest that require detailed examination, the result is that the question can properly be regarded to have been settled and is accordingly not one of “public interest” within the meaning of s 397. In such circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Court of Appeal to exercise its substantive jurisdiction under s 397 to answer the question referred by the Public Prosecutor, since the question does not fall within the scope of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the present case, we find that the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional to justify the exercise of our substantive jurisdiction under s 397 of the CPC even though a three-Judge coram of the High Court was convened to hear the appeal below. This is on the principal basis that a determination of the disputed issue would involve <span class="font-italic">overturning or overruling </span><span class="font-italic">High Court authority</span>, which – as explained in <span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han </span>at [49]–[50] (see [56] above) – can only be accomplished as a matter of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis </span>by a <span class="font-italic">de jure </span>Court of Appeal. That would be the logical consequence of any decision we might make on the question sought to be referred, given that the High Court decisions before us (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> on the one hand, and the decision of the majority on the other) have adopted diametrically opposite positions on the issue. We also note that the question sought to be referred arises not only from diverging local High Court decisions but also in the light of conflicting judgments of three superior courts of the common law – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>, the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>and the Malaysian Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Periasamy </span><span class="font-italic">s/o Sinnappan and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 2 MLJ 557 (“<span class="font-italic">Periasamy</span>”). In this last-mentioned regard, we note that in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span>, this Court held at [20] (albeit in the context of an application for <span class="font-italic">leave</span> to refer a question of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal) that a reference may be made “where the same question was answered differently (and not due to differences in statutory provisions) in another common law jurisdiction”. The inconsistent positions within both local and foreign jurisprudence therefore furnishes an additional reason for the exercise of our substantive jurisdiction in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The particularly vexing nature of the questions referred is further evidenced and amplified by the fact that the High Court coram was split on the result. In fact, the minority expressly approved of the established High Court authority which the majority sought to depart from (MA Judgment at [467]). This is an additional factor<span class="font-italic"> </span>which indicates that an <span class="font-italic">authoritative determination</span> on the scope of s 409 by the Court of Appeal, as the apex court of the land, is necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For these reasons, we are prepared to determine the questions referred to us. We emphasise, however, that this is an <span class="font-italic">exceptional case</span>, and that the Court of Appeal may <span class="font-italic">not</span> always exercise its substantive jurisdiction under s 397 of the CPC to consider questions referred to us by the Prosecution that have been answered by a three-Judge coram of the High Court. As we have explained, such a decision is intended, for all intents and purposes, to be an authoritative pronouncement on the issues of law, including the issues of law of public importance, arising from the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Doctrine of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">stare decisis</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and Privy Council decisions</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The second preliminary issue concerns the status of Privy Council decisions in Singapore law as a matter of the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>. The question can be put simply: are decisions of the Privy Council on appeal from the courts of different jurisdictions that precede the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council and which concern foreign statutory provision(s) that are <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with the relevant Singapore provision(s) binding on the Singapore courts? Strictly speaking, the issue does not arise in this criminal reference – as compared to the proceedings in the High Court below – since the <span class="font-italic">Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent)</span> [1994] 2 SLR 689 expressly states that “<span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span> should not hold itself bound by any previous decisions of its own or of the Privy Council” [emphasis added]. However, it is worth addressing as the allegedly binding nature of <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>on courts below the Court of Appeal was one of the arguments advanced in the High Court by the respondents. We therefore take this opportunity to put the issue to rest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We agree with the High Court that the principle that the courts of Singapore are bound by Privy Council decisions on appeal from other jurisdictions, if the decision in question considers a statutory provision <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with the relevant Singapore provision, is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no longer a part of our law</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">Chin Seow Noi and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 566 (“<span class="font-italic">Chin Seow Noi</span>”) – a case relied on by the Prosecution below – the Court of Appeal observed (at [82]) that in certain previous cases, “it <span class="font-italic">seemed to have been </span><span class="font-italic">accepted</span> that the courts of Singapore were bound by the Privy Council on appeals from jurisdictions other than Singapore, at least where the Privy Council was considering a statutory provision <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with the relevant Singapore provision” [emphasis added]. Crucially, however, the court <span class="font-italic">did not embark on any examination of the principle nor did it consider if it should continue to remain a part of Singapore law despite the abolishment of appeals to the Privy Council</span>. Indeed, the principle was not even actually applied on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Chin Seow Noi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>because the Court of Appeal found that there were “significant differences” between the relevant provisions of foreign law (Indian law) and the corresponding Singapore provisions. Given these differences, the court decided that it would be “neither realistic nor logically correct” to regard the Privy Council decision in question as being applicable to the interpretation of the relevant domestic statute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In contrast, the Court of Appeal in the more recent case of <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang </span>expressly observed on the same issue as follows (at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... [<span class="font-italic">Dhooharika</span> <span class="font-italic">v </span><span class="font-italic">Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth Lawyers’ Association intervening)</span> [2015] AC 875] is a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Supreme Court of <span class="font-weight-bold">Mauritius</span>. Put simply, it is a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">another jurisdiction</span> which was handed down <span class="font-italic">almost five decades after Singapore became an independent nation state</span>.

Such a decision may be persuasive, but the decision whether to follow it will depend on whether it is compelling, principled and in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision on the questions referred</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Principles of statutory interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ described the approach toward the purposive interpretation of statutes as set out in s 9A of the IA. Menon CJ explained the three steps of this exercise as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 … [T]he court’s task when undertaking a purposive interpretation of a legislative text should begin with three steps: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ascertaining the possible interpretations of the text</span>, as it has been enacted. This however should never be done by examining the provision in question in isolation. Rather, it should be undertaken <span class="font-italic">having due regard to the context of that text within the written law as a whole</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Second, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ascertaining the legislative purpose or object of the statute</span>. This may be <span class="font-italic">discerned from</span> <span class="font-italic">the language used in the enactment</span>; … it can also be discerned by <span class="font-italic">resorting to extraneous material in certain circumstances</span>. In this regard, the court should principally consider the general legislative purpose of the enactment by reference to any mischief that Parliament was seeking to address by it. In addition, <span class="font-italic">the court should be mindful of the possibility that the specific provision that is being interpreted may have been enacted by reason </span><span class="font-italic">of some specific mischief or object that may be distinct from, but not inconsistent with, the general legislative purpose underlying the written law as a whole</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">comparing the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute</span>. <span class="font-italic">Where the purpose of the provision in question as discerned from the language used in the enactment clearly supports one interpretation, reference to extraneous materials may be had for a limited function – to confirm but not to alter the ordinary meaning of the provision as purposively ascertained</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Crucially, Menon CJ went on to make two points of particular importance (at [60]–[61]). First, the level of generality at which the legislative purpose or object is articulated must be pitched correctly. This is important because <span class="font-italic">one could, by pitching the level of generality at a desired height, describe the objects or purposes of the statute in whatever terms as would support one’s preferred interpretation</span>. Second, the purpose behind a particular provision may be distinct from the general purpose underlying the statute as a whole. In appropriate cases, the specific purpose behind a particular provision should be separately considered. For instance, <span class="font-italic">different sections of a particular statute may target different mischiefs</span>, and to that extent the general object of a statute may cast little, if any, light on the meaning of specific provisions. For this reason amongst others, “[i]t should therefore <span class="font-italic">not be assumed that the specific purpose of a </span><span class="font-italic">particular provision does not need to be separately considered to ascertain the legislative intent</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>, Menon CJ elaborated (at [40]–[41]) on the methodology for the identification of legislative purpose, emphasising the importance of distinguishing between “the <span class="font-italic">specific purpose </span>underlying a particular provision and the <span class="font-italic">general purpose or purposes </span>underlying the statute as a whole or the relevant part of the statute” [emphasis in original]. Although there may be cases where it is the intention of Parliament that the specific purpose of a provision contradicts or undermines the more general purpose of a statute, the court must “begin by <span class="font-italic">presuming</span> that a statute is a coherent whole, and that any specific purpose does not go against the grain of the relevant general purpose, but rather is subsumed under, related or complementary to it”; “[t]he statute’s individual provisions must then be read consistently with <span class="font-italic">both </span>the specific and general purposes, so far as it is possible” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Menon CJ also explained in considerable detail s 9A(2) of the IA, which identifies the circumstances in which consideration may be given to material that does not form part of the written law, in situations where such material is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision. It is useful to begin by setting out s 9A(2) of the IA: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to subsection (4), in the interpretation of a provision of a written law, if any material not forming part of the written law is <span class="font-italic">capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision</span>, consideration may be given to that material –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">confirm</span> that the meaning of the provision <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is the ordinary meaning</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the written law and the purpose or object underlying the written law; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ascertain</span> the meaning of the provision when – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the provision is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ambiguous or obscure</span>; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the written law and the purpose or object underlying the written law leads to a result that is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">manifestly absurd or unreasonable</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As Menon CJ described (at [54]), s 9A(2) sets out three situations in which extraneous material can be applied, and each of these begins with the determination of the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision in question, understood in the context of the written law as a whole. In the first situation, pursuant to s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), extraneous material performs a <span class="font-italic">confirmatory </span>function, serving to endorse the correctness of the ordinary meaning. It is also “useful for demonstrating the soundness – as a matter of policy – of that outcome” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [49]). The second and third functions are essentially <span class="font-italic">clarificatory </span>in nature. Under s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i), resort to extraneous material can be had where the provision on its face is ambiguous or obscure. Under s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii), extraneous material can be referred to where the ordinary meaning of the text is absurd or unreasonable in the light of the underlying object and purpose of the written law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 If the court has referred to extraneous material in construing the provision, the last step in the process is to determine the appropriate <span class="font-italic">weight </span>to be placed on that material. The court’s decision in this regard is guided by s 9A(4) of the IA, which establishes that the court must have regard to (a) <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">desirability of persons being able to rely</span><span class="font-italic"> on the ordinary meaning </span>conveyed by the text of the provision, taking into account its context in the written law and the purpose or object underlying the written law; and (b) <span class="font-italic">the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng, </span>Menon CJ made two additional points on the approach to be taken in determining the weight to be placed on extraneous materials (at [70]–[71]). The first is a requirement that <span class="font-italic">the material in question must be </span><span class="font-italic">clear</span>, in the sense that it must “disclose the mischief aimed at [by the enactment] or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words” (citing <span class="font-italic">Pepper</span><span class="font-italic"> (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart </span>[1993] AC 593 at 634). The court must “guard against the danger of finding itself construing and interpreting the statements made in Parliament [which are such extraneous material] rather than the legislative provision that Parliament has enacted” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [52(b)]). The second is a requirement that the material must be “<span class="font-italic">directed to the very point in dispute</span> between the parties” [emphasis added]. In brief, the extraneous material must be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">clear in meaning and directly pertinent to the disputed issue</span> for it to be appropriate for the court to place substantial weight on it as an interpretive aid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ordinary meaning of the disputed phrase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The interpretive methodology outlined by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>is not only entirely consistent with s 9A of the IA but also lays the ground for a holistic but targeted analysis of disputed statutory provisions. In <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng, </span>the majority held at [18] that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">when construing a statutory provision, both its text and its context are of the first importance; what is crucial in this exercise is the “integration of text and context</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">”</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in bold italics]. Menon CJ’s elaboration of this approach is neatly structured according to s 9A of the IA and provides a useful framework of analysis that we adopt in answering the questions posed to us in this criminal reference. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Determining the ordinary meaning </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The first step in this process involves setting up the following question for consideration: what is the <span class="font-italic">ordinary meaning</span> of the disputed phrase “in the way of his business as … an agent” in s 409? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is easier to speak of an “ordinary meaning” of a word or phrase rather than to explain precisely what “ordinary meaning” refers to and how it may be ascertained. As observed in Oliver Jones, <span class="font-italic">Bennion on Statutory Interpretation: A Code </span>(LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Bennion</span>”) at p 1058, paraphrasing Mummery LJ’s observation to like effect in <span class="font-italic">Football Association Premier League Ltd and others v Panini UK Ltd </span>[2003] 4 All ER 1290 (“<span class="font-italic">Football </span><span class="font-italic">Association</span>”) at [39]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question of a word’s meaning is normally to be answered directly, not by rushing to dictionaries, or by searching the Internet for substitute words and expressions, or by the use of a non-statutory check list; or by recourse to Hansard, or by working through a range of hypothetical situations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The author of <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>observes at p 1058 that a wide variety of expressions have been used by judges in describing what the “ordinary meaning” of a word or phrase entails, such as “<span class="font-italic">uti loquitur vulgus</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“how it is spoken by the people”), “as they are understood in common language”, “the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used”, “their ordinary natural meaning” and “ordinary English meaning as applied to the subject matter with which they are dealing”. <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>itself prefers the phrase “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proper and most known signification</span>” [emphasis added in bold italics], which was coined in the 16th century by Samuel Freiherr von Pufendorf in <span class="font-italic">Of the Law of Nature and Nations </span>(4th Ed, 1729) at p 535. We think that Pufendorf’s definition provides a useful starting point – while it is difficult and perhaps not necessarily a useful endeavour to enact a complete definition of “ordinary meaning”, we are of the view that “proper and most known signification” suitably conveys the idea that the ordinary meaning of a word or phrase is that which <span class="font-italic">comes to the reader most naturally</span> by virtue of its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">regular or conventional usage</span><span class="font-italic"> in the English language</span> and in the light of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">linguistic </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">context</span><span class="font-italic"> in which that word or phrase is used</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is useful at this juncture to set out s 409 again. The provision reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant, or agent </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">409. </span>Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, <span class="font-italic">in his capacity of a public servant, or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the way of his business</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as</span><span class="font-italic"> a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an agent</span>, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In our judgment, it is of the first importance to note the following two points about the structure of s 409 and the disputed phrase: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">two limbs</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">to s 409</span>, pertaining to two different groups of potential offenders and the manner in which property or the dominion over property has been entrusted to them. The first limb concerns a person who has been entrusted “in his capacity of a public servant”. The second limb applies to a person who has been entrusted “in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent”. The disputed phrase (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“in the way of his business as … an agent”) is contained within this second limb. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">two parts </span><span class="font-italic">to the disputed phrase</span>. The first part is the phrasal verb “in the way of his business as”, and the second is the noun “an agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We observe that both the majority and the minority in the High Court analysed both parts of the disputed phrase separately and later in conjunction, and that the parties have essentially adopted the same method of analysis in their submissions before us. We agree that this approach promotes a closer reading of s 409, but would reiterate that in doing so, one should not forget that, in the final analysis, the disputed phrase must be read and understood in its entirety. Put another way, breaking down the disputed phrase into its constituent parts for individual analysis will be useful (and indeed appropriate) <span class="font-italic">only </span><span class="font-italic">in so far as this exercise helps to shed light on the disputed phrase and the provision </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as a whole</span>. It bears emphasising that s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA requires the court to ascertain the ordinary meaning “conveyed by the text of the provision <span class="font-italic">taking into account its context in the written law</span> and the purpose or object underlying the written law” [emphasis added]. Bifurcation of the disputed phrase and magnification of its components should not cause one to lose sight of the whole and to ignore its context within the written law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The expression “in the way of his business”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 We begin with the first part of the disputed phrase, “in the way of his business”. As described at [26] and [30] above, the meaning of this expression was the subject of considerable disagreement between the majority and the minority in the High Court. In brief, Chan J agreed with the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span> that the expression means “in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade” (MA Judgment at [460]). The majority however rejected <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>, reasoning that the expression cannot simply mean that such a person has to be acting “in connection with his duties as” an agent since that is basically indistinguishable from the meaning of “in his capacity” as an agent (“in his capacity” having been used in the first limb of s 409), and there was no reason why Parliament would have used two different expressions in the section to mean the same thing (MA Judgment at [102]). The majority preferred the reading of “in the way of his business” as “in the occupation or the trade of” (MA Judgment at [105])). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Prosecution and the respondents have essentially aligned themselves with the positions of the minority and the majority, respectively. We first turn to consider the ordinary meaning of the expression “in the way of his business”, read alongside the preceding expression “in his capacity of” which forms part of its context in the written law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The parallel expression “in his capacity of” </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) A contextual reading</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 When one reads s 409, one immediately observes that in relation to <span class="font-italic">public servants</span>, the phrase “in his capacity of” is used rather than “in the way of his business as”. The latter is employed only in relation to bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, attorneys and agents (in the second limb of s 409). Evidently, the drafters did not deem the expression “in the way of his business” to be suitable for use in relation to public servants. This provides an important clue as to the meaning of “in the way of his business”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In our judgment, the<span class="font-italic"> plainest and most intuitive reason</span> for the drafters’ decision not to use “in the way of his business” in relation to public servants is that they used the word “business” within that expression as a reference to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">commercial activity</span>. As public servants are not, as a general matter, engaged in commercial activity, they are therefore not a class of persons in respect of whom the expression “in the way of his business” is apposite. We pause to note that public servants have a unique “capacity” given that they hold appointments in which the public trust and confidence is vested and may also, when acting in such “capacity”, possess the authority and wield the powers of the state. Hence, when such persons are acting in their “capacity” as public servants, any CBT on their part is – rather unsurprisingly – to be treated with <span class="font-italic">the utmost seriousness</span> since such misconduct represents not only a dismal failure on their part to carry out the responsibilities owed to their employer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the civil service or other relevant public body) but also a betrayal of the trust reposed in them by the public, which fully and rightfully expects public resources to be used for public (and not personal) good. Such acts serve only to tarnish the community’s perception of the public service and undermine the moral authority of the state. In our view, this is why public servants – although not individuals who typically carry out commercial activities – are nevertheless singled out for enhanced punishment under s 409. The majority adopted a similar line of reasoning when it held that “<span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">natural reading</span><span class="font-italic"> of the word ‘business’ is that it refers to a commercial activity done for profit</span>, where the person in that business offers a service or product that another can employ or purchase” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (MA Judgment at [104]). In other words, the ordinary meaning of the phrase “in the way of his business” suggests that the “agent” referred to in s 409 must be carrying on a <span class="font-italic">commercial activity </span>as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 At minimum, one discerns that the drafters did not intend “in the capacity of” within the first limb of s 409 to have the <span class="font-italic">same meaning</span> as “in the way of his business” in the second limb. If the drafters had intended those phrases to mean exactly the same thing, they would simply have chosen to adopt one of these expressions or the other, and not two differing expressions in <span class="font-italic">the same provision</span>. For instance, the drafters could have applied this formulation of s 409: “Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">his capacity of</span> a public servant, a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent…” But they did not. The fact that the drafters chose to use two distinct expressions in the same provision signifies that they had a <span class="font-italic">different understanding</span> of each expression, and that they did not consider “in the way of his business” to be suitable for application in relation to public servants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 This brings us neatly to the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>. <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>is an important decision not only because of the Indian Supreme Court’s observations on the expression “in the way of his business” in s 409 of the Indian Penal Code, but also for its reading of two other significant decisions that came before <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>– <span class="font-italic">R v Portugal </span>(1885) 16 QBD 487 (“<span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. We will discuss <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>at a more suitable juncture below and, for present purposes, will focus on what the Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>had to say with regard to the expression “in the way of his business”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The Indian Supreme Court’s interpretation of “in the way of his business”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span> was the first case in India where the scope of s 409 of the Indian Penal Code was considered in detail. There were earlier Indian authorities in which it was assumed, without any reasoning, that the word “agent” could refer to non-professional agents. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Muthusami</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillay alias Kunja Pillay and others v The Queen-Empress</span> (1896) 6 Mad LJ 14, the Madras High Court held that a trustee or manager of a temple who misappropriates temple jewels is an “agent” subject to the temple committee’s control and would be guilty of the offence under s 409 of the Indian Penal Code. Following the Indian Supreme Court’s full examination of the issue in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>, its judgment<span class="font-italic"> </span>is presently the leading case in India on the definition of the phrase “in the way of his business as … an agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Dalmia was Chairman and Principal Officer of an insurance company. The Board of Directors of the insurance company passed a resolution to authorise one Chokani to operate the account of the company with the Chartered Bank at Bombay. That account was to be used for the keeping of certain government securities held by the company in safe custody with the bank. For this purpose, Chokani was appointed as agent of the company. Subsequently, the Board of Directors also permitted the account to be operated jointly by Chokhani and one Raghunath Rai. In practice, however, Chokhani operated the bank account alone. Raghunath Rai would simply provide blank cheques to Chokhani, which Chokhani would only sign when the cheques were actually issued. This led to the use of the company’s funds for unauthorised purposes. Chokhani, who was not authorised to use the monies in the account to purchase and sell securities, nevertheless went ahead to apply the monies in that manner. He would purchase securities from a company controlled by him using those monies, and keep the purchase price of the securities without actually delivering the securities contracted for. Eventually, the monies reached a separate company which was owned by Dalmia, and was used to pay off debts owed by that company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Several charges under s 409 of the Indian Penal Code were brought against Dalmia, Chokhani and other accused persons. Raghubar Dayal J, delivering the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court, referred to <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span> which, in the court’s view, approved what was said in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>. After a discussion of these two authorities, the court proceeded to observe as follows (at [96]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What S. 409 [of the Indian Penal Code] requires is that the person alleged to have committed criminal breach of trust with respect to any property be entrusted with that property or with dominion over that property in the way of his business as an agent. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The expression ‘in the way of his business’ means that the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">property is entrusted to him ‘in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade’</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.</span> <span class="font-italic">He should get the entrustment or dominion in his capacity as agent</span>. In other words, the requirements of this section would be satisfied if<span class="font-italic"> the person be an agent of another and that person entrusts him with property or with any dominion over that property in the course of his duties as an agent</span>. <span class="font-italic">A person may be an agent of another for some purpose and if he is entrusted with property not in connection with that purpose but for another purpose, that entrustment will not be ent</span><span class="font-italic">rustment for the purposes of S. 409 [of the Indian Penal Code] if any breach of trust is committed by that person. </span>This interpretation in no way goes against what has been held in [<span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>] or in [<span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>], and finds support from the fact that the section also deals with entrustment of property or with any dominion over property to a person in his capacity of a public servant. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A different expression ‘in the way of his business’ is used in place of the expression ‘in his capacity</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">,’ to make it clear that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">entrustment of property in the capacity of agent will not, by itself, be sufficient</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> to make the criminal breach of trust by the agent a graver offence than any o</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">f the offences mentioned in Ss. 406 to 408 [of the Indian Penal Code].

Dalmia, as a director and Chairman of the company, was likewise an agent of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It is necessary to unpack the reasoning of the Indian Supreme Court in the passage quoted above. The court took the view that entrustment “in the way of his business” means entrustment “in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade”. This is to be contrasted to entrustment that <span class="font-italic">does not occur</span> in the course of the recipient’s ordinary duties as an agent – for instance, if the recipient is entrusted with property for a purpose that is different from the purpose for which he typically acts as an agent, or on an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>basis. The point can be put more simply. In order for a recipient to be entrusted with property or dominion over it “in the way of his business as … an agent”, <span class="font-italic">the entrustment must occur </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as part of his ordinary or regular responsibilities as an agent</span>. In other words, such a recipient is <span class="font-italic">already an agent</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>given the nature of “the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade”. The entrustment of the property (or dominion over it) on the particular occasion in issue before the court is simply an ordinary <span class="font-italic">consequence </span>of, and not the <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of, his identity as an agent. This explanation of the phrase “in the way of his business” as referring to the recipient’s pre-existing status as an agent, and the need for him to have received the property as part of his ordinary or regular responsibilities as such, represents the first part of the Indian Supreme Court’s analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The second part of the analysis, which flows from the first, concerns the Indian Supreme Court’s attempt to distinguish the expression “in the way of his business” from “in his capacity of”. The court reasoned that the drafters of the legislation used the former rather than the latter expression because entrustment of property “in the capacity of” an agent was insufficient to attract criminal liability; the accused must also have been entrusted with property “in connection with his duties” as an agent – which presumably means that he must have been entrusted with the property (or dominion over it) “in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade” as an agent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the characteristic of <span class="font-italic">regularity </span>described in the first part of the court’s analysis. The Prosecution suggests that this can be juxtaposed with a “casual” agent, which refers to “someone entrusted with property on an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>basis and who is caught under s 406 of the Penal Code if he commits CBT”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 We accept that the position preferred in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>has some initial attraction. The reading of “in the way of [one’s] business” as a reference to acting in the course of one’s regular duties does appear, at first glance, to be a <span class="font-italic">plausible</span> ordinary meaning of the expression. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, it is our respectful view that this understanding of the expression is quickly proven to be unsustainable when it is read <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contextually</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>alongside the parallel expression “in his capacity of a public servant”. The reason is that <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">characteristic of regularity is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">just as crucial</span> to this first limb of s 409. The public servant who is the subject of the first limb <span class="font-italic">must also be acting “in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation” or “in connection with his duties” </span>(whichever is the phraseology preferred) <span class="font-italic">as a public servant</span> in order for him to become liable for an offence under s 409. It is only when the public servant is acting <span class="font-italic">qua </span>public servant – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the purported discharge of his responsibilities and exercise of his powers as a public servant – that his culpability will be enhanced (as explained at [83] above) and his liability under s 409 triggered accordingly. The regularity of conduct needed before an individual can properly be characterised as a “public servant” is also the reason why it is conceptually unsatisfactory to speak of a “casual” or “<span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span>” public servant. In order to understand the point, one must bear in mind the fact that the regularity that is at issue in s 409 does not pertain to the <span class="font-italic">entrustment</span> of property (or dominion thereof); what must be regular are the <span class="font-italic">duties or </span><span class="font-italic">the occupation, profession or trade</span> of the particular individual. That is evident from the manner in which s 409 is phrased. Regardless of whether either or both the expressions “in his capacity of” and “in the way of his business as” connote the characteristic of regularity, it is clear that the subject of both these expressions is the <span class="font-italic">occupation</span> of the particular individual (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether that of a “public servant” or “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker or an attorney”), and not the fact of <span class="font-italic">entrustment</span>. Consequently, given that the notion of regularity and connection to duties is <span class="font-italic">just as</span><span class="font-italic"> central</span> to the (first) part of s 409 that targets public servants as it is to the (second) part of s 409 that targets bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, attorneys and agents, this <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be the distinguishing factor between the meanings of the expressions “in his capacity of” (which applies to public servants) and “in the way of his business as” (which does not). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In addition, the argument that the expression “in the way of his business” is required so as to make clear that the specific act of entrustment of property (or dominion over it) that is the subject of the criminal proceedings is not what <span class="font-italic">renders</span> the accused an agent – since the accused must already be an agent by virtue of his ordinary duties or habitual occupation or trade or profession – is impossible to square with that part of the second limb that refers to bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys. It makes little sense to say that these persons <span class="font-italic">are rendered as</span> bankers, merchants, factors, brokers or attorneys because of the single act of entrustment in issue. In other words, it is trite that these persons <span class="font-italic">must already be </span>bankers, merchants, factors, brokers or attorneys in order for them to fall within the scope of the second limb of s 409; there is no need for the regularity of their occupations to be further pronounced by way of what would be an entirely superfluous separate declaration to this effect (if “in the way of his business as” really does have the meaning that the Prosecution suggests). The Indian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>and the Prosecution in the present case have, with respect, erred in focusing on the regularity of the entrustment rather than the regularity of the ordinary duties or occupations, trades or professions of the individuals in question. This is just another way of saying – consistently with what has been discussed in the preceding paragraph – that the regularity that is relevant in s 409 necessarily pertains to the <span class="font-italic">ordinary duties or the habitual occupations, trades or professions</span> of these persons <span class="font-italic">as bankers, merchants, factors and attorneys</span>. For these reasons, it is likewise erroneous to speak of “casual” or “<span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span>” bankers, merchants, factors, brokers or attorneys. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For these reasons, we reject the interpretation of the expression “in the way of his business” adopted in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>and by the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The sole use of “in the way of his business” in the Penal Code </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Our second observation is that “in the way of his business” is an expression that does not appear anywhere else in the Penal Code. It is employed <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only</span> in s 409. This can be contrasted to the use of “in the capacity of” or its close equivalents in other parts of the Penal Code, including ss 381 and 477A of the Penal Code, which read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">381.</span> Whoever, being a clerk or servant, or being employed <span class="font-italic">in the capacity of a clerk or servant</span>, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Falsification of accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">477A.</span>  Whoever, being a clerk, officer or servant, or employed or<span class="font-italic"> </span>acting <span class="font-italic">in the capacity of a clerk, officer or servant</span>, wilfully and with intent to defraud destroys, alters, conceals, mutilates or falsifies any book, electronic record, paper, writing, valuable security or account which belongs to or is in the possession of his employer, or has been received by him for or on behalf of his employer, or wilfully and with intent to defraud makes or abets the making of any false entry in, or omits or alters or abets the omission or alteration of any material particular from or in any such book, electronic record, paper, writing, valuable security or account, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In our judgment, the ordinary meaning of “in the capacity of” in these provisions is that the offences enacted by those provisions are intended to apply only to accused persons who commit theft while acting <span class="font-italic">in the course of their </span><span class="font-italic">regular duties or functions</span> as a clerk or servant (in the context of s 381) or who falsify accounts while acting <span class="font-italic">in the course of their regular duties or functions </span>as clerk, officer or servant (in the context of s 477A). The phrase “in the capacity of” is therefore essentially <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">synonymous</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>with the expressions “in the course of one’s regular duties or functions” and “in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade”, which are respectively used by the Prosecution and in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>(see [88] above) to define “in the way of his business”. In the preceding analysis, we have shown that this also applies in relation to <span class="font-italic">the first limb</span> of s 409 – the phrase “in his capacity of a public servant” must mean that the accused has received property (or dominion over it) <span class="font-italic">in the course of his regular duties or functions</span> as <span class="font-italic">a public servant</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The fact that “in the way of his business” is not used anywhere else in the Penal Code therefore provides a powerful indication that it has a definition that is <span class="font-italic">not shared</span> by other phrases in the Penal Code, including “in the capacity of”. When one takes this together with the fact that the phrase “in the capacity of” (and its equivalents) is used in other provisions of the Penal Code to mean “in the course of one’s regular duties or functions”, one is led to the logical conclusion that “in the way of his business” simply <span class="font-italic">does </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> possess that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">same</span><span class="font-italic"> meaning</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Inference from “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As we have explained at [83] above, we are of the view that when one is acting “in the way of his business”, one is engaged in a <span class="font-italic">commercial activity</span> that one carries out as one’s occupation or trade. Corroboration of the majority’s interpretation of the phrase “in the way of his business” arises as a matter of inference when one turns one’s attention to the subsequent references to “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” in s 409 (leaving aside the final reference to “an agent” which is the subject of dispute in the present case). These are all <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">particular trades or professions</span><span class="font-italic"> that are performed or undertaken as livelihoods</span>. As the majority found, “when read in the light of these words, the phrase ‘in the way of his business’ more sensibly means ‘in the occupation or the trade of’. Read holistically, s 409 of the Penal Code can logically apply only to persons who are entrusted with property when carrying on a business or trade as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” (MA Judgment at [105]). We agree with this reasoning. As the <span class="font-italic">chapeau </span>to this list of persons, the expression “in the way of his business” must be understood contextually in the light of the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the persons described within the list.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The result is that the second limb of s 409 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent”) will not encompass persons who are either (a) <span class="font-italic">not engaged in these occupations or trades altogether</span>; or (b) engaged in these occupations or trades but who are entrusted with the property or dominion over it in circumstances that are <span class="font-italic">unrelated to their being in those occupations or trades</span>. By way of example, where a banker by trade or profession is asked by a friend to safe-keep a car in his garage for a few days, the banker cannot be said to have been entrusted with his friend’s car “in the way of his business as a banker”. This would be a situation of “casual” or “<span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span>” entrustment, and there is no dispute between the parties that a person who is entrusted in such circumstances will not fall within the scope of s 409. The obvious reason is that the trade or profession of the individual as a banker would be <span class="font-italic">wholly incidental </span>to the entrustment of the car (or dominion over it) to him; in such a situation his particular trade or profession would not furnish a reason to punish him more severely under the aggravated offence in s 409. As we have explained, this has nothing to do with the fact that the expression “in the way of his business” is used rather than “in his capacity of”; a person who is entrusted with property (or dominion over it) but who happens, on a completely incidental and separate basis from the entrustment, to be a banker obviously cannot be said to have been entrusted with such property (or dominion over it) “in his capacity of” a banker. In other words, whether casual or <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>entrustment falls or does not fall within the scope of s 409 is a matter that does not turn on the distinction between the expressions “in the way of his business” and “in his capacity of”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Summary of the expression “in the way of his business”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The meaning of “in the way of his business” was a hotly contested issue before the High Court and in the present criminal reference because it sheds light on the proper definition of “an agent” within the meaning of s 409. This is because as the <span class="font-italic">chapeau </span>to the second limb of s 409, the phrase governs and draws a common thread through the list “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ordinary meaning</span> of the expression “in the way of his business” is that the individuals who fall within the scope of the second limb of s 409 are performing <span class="font-italic">commercial activities </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the conduct of their trades or professions</span>. We reach this conclusion following a <span class="font-italic">contextual </span>reading of the written law, having had due regard to the phrase “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” that follows the expression “in the way of his business”, as well as the juxtaposition of that expression with “in his capacity of” in the preceding limb which applies only to public servants (persons who are evidently <span class="font-italic">not</span> engaged in commercial activity) who are acting in such “capacity”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 We have also observed that, unlike “in the way of his business”, the expression “in his capacity of” is not unique to s 409 and – as used in this and other provisions in the Penal Code – expresses the idea that one must be acting in the course of one’s regular duties and functions. We therefore do not accept the argument that the expression “in the way of his business” merely connotes, without more, a sense of regularity in the performance of one’s ordinary duties. The argument that “in the way of his business” rather than “in his capacity of” was used by the drafters so as to exclude “casual” or “<span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span>” agents within the scope of s 409 is flawed not only because the need for regularity of conduct applies to public servants just as much as it does to bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, attorneys and agents, but more fundamentally because the need for such regularity is so central to the proper characterisation of any of those roles that one finds it intuitively inappropriate to speak of “casual” or “<span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span>” public servants or bankers, merchants and so on. As we have explained, that intuition is backed by sound conceptual reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The word “agent”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 We turn to the second part of the disputed phrase. As we have explained, the expression “in the way of his business” provides a guide to the proper interpretation of “agent”. Applying the ordinary meaning of that expression as we have described, when one acts “in the way of his business as … an agent”, one is acting in the conduct of his trade or profession as an agent (or “in the occupation or the trade of” an agent, to use the majority’s words (MA Judgment at [105])). Therefore “an agent” is a reference to a particular trade, profession or occupation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In this part of the analysis, however, we focus on a separate aspect of the majority’s reasoning, that is, its reliance on the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle in reaching its conclusion as to what “an agent” means. As described at [26(c)] above, the majority took the view that “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” brought into play the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle in construing the words “an agent”. It considered that each of the persons in that phrase carries on a business or trade of offering certain services to the public in the course of which the customer has to entrust property, or the dominion of such, with them (MA Judgment at [106]). This should therefore also apply to “an agent”. The Prosecution argues that the majority should not have applied the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to ascertain the meaning of the disputed phrase for four main reasons, which we will describe and evaluate subsequently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Preliminarily, we observe that Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>explained (at [38]) that the court’s effort to determine the <span class="font-italic">ordinary meaning</span> of a provision <span class="font-italic">may be</span> <span class="font-italic">aided by the rules and canons of statutory construction</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>itself, the court considered and applied two such interpretive canons, that Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain, and that Parliament is presumed not to have intended an unworkable or impracticable result. The <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is one such interpretive tool. We begin by describing the principle and how it may properly be applied to ascertain the ordinary meaning of “an agent” as used in s 409. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span> principle</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 <span class="font-italic">Bennion</span> provides the following introductory description of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle (at p 1105): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Latin words <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>(of the same kind or nature), have been attached to a principle of construction whereby wide words associated in the text with more limited words are taken to be restricted by implication to matters of the same limited character. The principle may apply whatever the form of the association, but the most usual form is a list or string of genus-describing terms followed by wider residuary or sweeping-up words. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is a principle of statutory construction with distant and venerable origins (recognised and applied across at least the past four centuries of the history of the common law). Over the course of its application, the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle has developed into a complex and nuanced linguistic canon with its own network of sub-rules. We point out three important aspects of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle that are relevant for present purposes, beginning with the principle of <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis</span> that forms the broader rubric of which the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is described as a “detailed application”, “precept” or “branch” of the <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle (<span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>at pp 1100 and 1108). When translated into English from the original Latin, “<span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis</span>” means “it is recognised by its associates”. It establishes that a word or phrase is not to be construed as if it stood alone but in the light of its surroundings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Viscount Simmonds in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General</span><span class="font-italic"> v Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover </span>[1957] AC 436 provided (at 461) a useful and vivid summation of the <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle: “words, and particularly general words, cannot be read in isolation: their colour and content are derived from their context”. Diplock LJ (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Letang v Cooper</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1965] 1 QB 232 remarked (at 247) that the <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle may be applied only if one “know[s] the <span class="font-italic">societas </span>to which the <span class="font-italic">socii </span>belong” – in other words, the nature of the intended society (or <span class="font-italic">societas</span>) can only be gathered from the words used. Shortly put, the principle emphasises the relevance and importance of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">context </span>in determining the intended meaning of a word or phrase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle has been employed to determine the meaning of an otherwise neutral word; as <span class="font-italic">Bennion</span> describes it (at p 1101), “[w]here an enactment includes a word which in itself is neutral or colourless, the context provides the colouring agent”. For instance, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Lee-Verhulst (Investments) Ltd v Harwood Trust</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[1973] 1 QB 204 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee-Verhulst</span>”), the question before the court was whether the tenant company “occupied” the premises for the purposes of its business within the meaning of that word in s 23 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (c 56) (UK). Stamp LJ held (at 217) that “the words ‘occupation’ and ‘occupier’ are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not words of art having an ascertained legal meaning applicable</span>, or prima facie applicable, wherever you find them in a statute, but <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">take their colour from the context of the statute in which they are found</span>” [emphasis added in bold italics]. Given the context of statutory provisions to furnish security of tenure to business tenants, Stamp LJ decided that he would not give the word “occupied” a construction which would exclude a part of the house (which the tenant leased for its letting business) in which the business was carried on day by day, and the whole of which was used by the tenant for the purposes of its business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The principle has also been used to reach a finding that the context of the expression in question indicated that a <span class="font-italic">restricted or less usual meaning</span> was intended instead of the literal or usual meaning, or even that a <span class="font-italic">special meaning</span> was intended (<span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>at pp 1102–1104). By way of illustration as to how linguistic context may indicate that a particular term has a less usual meaning, <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>remarks (at p 1103) that the well-understood meaning of the word “whisky” is “obviously displaced when the word is found in a provision such as the local Act which was the subject of inquiry in [<span class="font-italic">Simpson v Teignmouth</span><span class="font-italic"> and Sheldon Bridge Co </span>(1903) 72 LJKB 204]”. The provision in that legislation authorised the laying of a toll on any “coach, chariot, hearse, chaise, berlin, landau and phaeton, gig, whisky, chair or coburg and every other carriage hung on springs”. Given the context, the word “whisky” in that provision certainly could not be understood as a reference to a particular alcoholic beverage, but rather to “a light two-wheeled one-horse carriage”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The point we wish to make is that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle, as an elaboration or a more detailed application of the <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle, likewise emphasises the <span class="font-italic">overriding importance of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">linguistic context </span>in statutory construction.

The court held that a sum due as damages was not within the class indicated by the string “dividends, profits”, the court having been aided in arriving at this conclusion by the words in parenthesis, which preceded the generic string.

The principle is relevant whenever a genus can be identified from the generic string and that genus extends to the disputed term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Indeed, as <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>observes (at pp 1111–1112), the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle has been applied to infer the meaning of a disputed term even where the generic string consists only of a single other word or term; “[t]he question is invariably one of the <span class="font-italic">intention conveyed by the entirety of the passage</span>, and there can be no absolute rule.

In our view, this is really another indication that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is not a distinct technical rule of interpretation but is simply an aspect of the broader precept that a word or phrase is not to be construed as if it stood alone but must be read in the light of its surroundings – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as an expression of the <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In the final analysis, it must be remembered that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is simply a tool to ascertain the ordinary meaning of a disputed term or phrase as part of the purposive approach to interpretation laid down in s 9A of the IA. It has no independent purpose from this and should not at any point be allowed to override or veer away from legislative intent.

We begin by considering whether there was any error in the majority’s application of the principle. We will then consider the objections raised before us by the Prosecution that it was inappropriate to apply the principle and that in any event the way in which the majority applied it was incorrect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Evaluation of the majority’s approach</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The majority’s reasoning concerning the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is succinct and can be set out here in full (MA Judgment at [106]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">106 Second, on a related though separate note, the existence of the preceding words also bring into play the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle in relation to the interpretation of the word “an agent”. <span class="font-italic">Applying that principle, the meaning of the words “an agent” must be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">restricted by, and implied from, the words ‘a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney’.</span> <span class="font-italic">Each and every one of these persons carries on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a business or</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> a trade</span><span class="font-italic"> (in the sense of a type of commercial activity) of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">offering certain services to the public in the course of which the customer has to entrust property, or the dominion of such, with him</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Further, each of those capacities refers to <span class="font-italic">an </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">external relationship </span><span class="font-italic">between the person who is entrusting the property and the person who is being entrusted the property</span>. [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In our judgment, the majority’s reasoning represents a proper and sound application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle and cannot be impugned. As a preliminary matter, we note that the fact that the phrase “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” does not contain (or does not obviously contain) a residuary phrase is irrelevant. As explained at [117]–[121] above, the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is <span class="font-italic">independent from the form of the statutory provision</span> in question. Likewise, the fact that the drafters did not include the word “other” before “an agent” does not preclude the application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to determine what “an agent” means (see [119] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 We break down the majority’s reasoning in order to demonstrate more fully that its application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle was correct. The majority recognised that the words “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” are <span class="font-italic">genus-defining terms</span> and, together with “an agent”, constitute the <span class="font-italic">generic string</span> (although the majority did not use these particular technical terms of reference). It then sought to ascertain the <span class="font-italic">common </span><span class="font-italic">and dominant feature </span>possessed by these genus-defining terms, and found that each element of the generic string referred to a particular “business or trade (in the sense of a type of commercial activity) of offering certain services to the public in the course of which the customer has to entrust property, or the dominion of such, with him”. The majority then reasoned that this common quality, or genus, therefore also had to apply to “an agent”, which formed part of the generic string. This yielded the conclusion that “an agent” must likewise refer to a person in such a “business or trade”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a professional agent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 We do not see any ground on which the majority’s interpretive approach or conclusion can be faulted. We agree that each of the items in “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">particular trades or professions</span>, involving the conduct of particular types of commercial activities, by which persons occupying those trades or professions make their living. When this is applied to “an agent”, one reaches the conclusion that “an agent” must refer to a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">professional agent</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a person who offers, as his trade, profession or business, agency services to interested clients in return for remuneration. It would cover persons such as freight forwarders (or forwarding agents), ship’s agents, insurance agents, housing or property agents, mortgage brokers, and auctioneers, among others (<span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</span> (Peter Watts gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Bowstead and</span><span class="font-italic"> Reynolds</span>”) at paras 3-023–3-030 on the usual authority which such professional agents have “where employed in the course of business as agent”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In addition, as explained at [116] above, it is legitimate to have regard to <span class="font-italic">other parts of the context</span> beyond the generic string in order to identify the genus. In relation to s 409, this includes <span class="font-italic">the expression “in the way of his business” </span>immediately preceding the generic string. For the reasons set out at [82]–[101] above, that phrase affirms the majority’s interpretation of “an agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 It is also worth noting that in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>, the English High Court employed reasoning that was extremely similar to that of the majority. <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>concerned an accused person who was employed by a British firm of railway contractors, for commission, to use his influence to obtain for them a contract for the construction of a railway and docks in France. The railway contractors entrusted the accused person with a cheque for this purpose, which he then misappropriated for his own use. The issue was whether he had been entrusted with the cheque as an “agent” for the purposes of s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861, which penalises “a Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or other Agent” for embezzlement of money, security or proceeds entrusted to him. The Queen’s Bench Division of the English High Court, comprising Mathew and Smith JJ, held in favour of the accused person and acquitted him. The court’s reasoning is worth setting out in detail (at 490–492): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was contended by the Crown, that, although the prisoner was not either a banker, merchant, broker, or attorney, and although he was not intrusted with either sum of money in any of those capacities, yet he came within the term, ‘other agent intrusted with money or valuable security’ within the meaning of s. 75. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To this it was answered that, if that contention of the Crown be correct, the section should have said, ‘whosoever, having been intrusted as agent with any money,’ &amp;c. ; that no interpretation or effect would be given to the words ‘banker, merchant, broker, or attorney ;’ and that, <span class="font-italic">it was obvious that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">some effect must be given to those words, if possible, in construing the section</span><span class="font-italic">, for otherwise the section might be held to apply to everybody intrusted with money to be applied as by the section is provided. In this we agree. </span>We notice that the Larceny Act, a portion of the 75th section of which we are called upon to construe, after in earlier sections classifying various places and things from and of which larceny may be committed,-see ss. 31, 38, 40, 50, 60, 62, and 63,-proceeds to specify certain classes of persons who may be guilty of the offences therein described; for instance, from s. 67 to s. 73, clerks, servants, or persons in the public service are classified; in s. 74, tenants and lodgers are classified; and in s. 75 and afterwards the class aimed at is that of agents, bankers, factors. In our judgment <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">75 is limited to a class</span>, <span class="font-italic">and does not apply to everyone who may happen to be intrusted as prescribed by the section, but </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only to the class of persons therein pointed out</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Moreover, the words of the section are not ‘banker, merchant, broker, attorney, or agent,’ but ‘or other agent,’ pointing, in our opinion, to some agent, of like kind with the class before enumerated</span>. <span class="font-italic">In our judgment, the </span><span class="font-italic">‘other agent’ mentioned in this section means </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">one whose business or profession it is to receive money, securities, or chattels for safe custody or other special purpose</span><span class="font-italic">; and that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the term does not include a person who carries on no such business or profession, or the like</span><span class="font-italic">.

The court, agreeing with the accused’s argument, placed particular store on the fact that the words “banker, merchant, broker, or attorney” preceded the reference to “an agent” and that the court had to place weight on these words in determining the definition and scope of “an agent”. This is, <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">substance</span>,<span class="font-italic"> an application of the </span>ejusdem generis<span class="font-italic"> principle</span>. As Romer LJ remarked in <span class="font-italic">Brownsea</span><span class="font-italic"> Haven Properties Ltd v Poole Corporation </span>[1958] Ch 574 at 610, the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is an aspect of the wider principle that “where reasonably possible, some significance and meaning should be attributed to each and every word and phrase in a written document”. The court in <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>reached its decision on what “an agent” meant by reading those words in the light of the preceding part of the generic string. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 As a final matter, we find that if one were to apply even the broader principle of <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis</span>, one would reach the same conclusion that the majority did. The colour and content of the words “an agent” are derived from their <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">context</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the governing expression “in the way of his business” and the immediately proximate phrase “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney”.

To use the words of Stamp LJ in <span class="font-italic">Lee-Verhulst</span> (see [109] above), once one reads the phrase in context and divines the relevant <span class="font-italic">societas</span>, one finds that the words “an agent” are “not words of art having an ascertained legal meaning applicable, or prima facie applicable, wherever you find them in a statute, but take their colour from the context of the statute in which they are found” – in this case, the <span class="font-italic">trades or professions </span>found in the phrase “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Evaluation of objections to the application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The Prosecution suggests that “an agent” in s 409 has a “clear legal meaning”. That meaning is the definition of an “agent” <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the law of agency</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a person who (a) agrees with another person (the principal) to act on his behalf; (b) undertakes fiduciary obligations towards the principal; and (c) has the authority to affect the principal’s decision. For ease of reference, we will refer to the Prosecution’s definition as that of a “legal agent” (as opposed to a “professional agent”). As will be examined below, the Prosecution advances four arguments in support of its interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 We respectfully disagree with the arguments proffered by the Prosecution. As elaborated above, when the governing phrase “in the way of his business” is read <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contextually</span> – in the light of the other parts of s 409 and the other provisions in the Penal Code – it becomes clear that the subsequent reference to “an agent” should be specifically understood as a reference to a person in a particular trade or profession and is engaged in commercial activity, and not merely to a general definition of an “agent” in agency law. The application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle further clarifies and consolidates the majority’s understanding of “an agent”. The genus-defining terms “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” are particular professions or trades carried out as livelihoods, and therefore “an agent” – which belongs in the very same generic string – must be understood to be a term with this common quality. Merely attributing to “an agent” a definition found in the law of agency simply does not suffice to capture this quality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(I) Determining if the ordinary or technical meaning of a term applies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Before we proceed to describe and provide our views on each of the Prosecution’s four arguments, we think it useful to begin by briefly setting out some general rules of thumb that apply where the disputed word or phrase has <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">both</span> <span class="font-italic">an ordinary and a technical meaning</span>. This is plainly relevant in the present case given that the definition of “an agent” that the Prosecution urges upon us is a <span class="font-italic">technical legal term</span> that is found within the law of agency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The key determinant is, once again, the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">context</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>of the disputed word or phrase. <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>explains (at p 1081) that <span class="font-italic">if the surrounding words are technical</span>, it is a reasonable assumption that the term is intended to bear its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">technical</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>meaning. However, <span class="font-italic">if the term is used in a non-technical context</span>, then it is presumed to have its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ordinary</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>meaning. The English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">R v Dudley Crown Court, ex parte Pask and Moore </span>(1983) 147 JP 417 is provided as an example. The question in that case was whether the applicants, who sought a justices’ license for a community block, had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>as “persons interested” in those premises within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Licensing Act 1964 (c 26) (UK). It was argued that in order to be a person “interested” in the premises, one had to have either a legal or an equitable interest in the property. Taylor J rejected the submission, finding that there was “<span class="font-italic">no reason why one should import automatically</span> any requirement of an interest in property, legal or equitable, nor any requirement of any actual contractual right to operate on the premises” [emphasis added]. He held that the phrase had to be construed “looking broadly at the circumstances of the individual application and what was proposed to be carried out and by whom”. On the facts, Taylor J concluded that the applicants were in fact persons “interested” in the premises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The more recent decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Burton v Camden London Borough Council </span>[2000] 2 AC 399 furnishes an even clearer example of the court’s contextual preference for the ordinary meaning of a word in a statute over its technical legal definition. The appellant was a co-tenant of a flat under a joint tenancy. Her co-tenant subsequently signalled her intention to move out, leaving the appellant with a financial difficulty because she currently enjoyed housing benefit only in respect of her one-half of the rent payable for the flat. With the departure of her co-tenant, she feared that her housing benefit would continue to be assessed at one-half – and not the whole – of the rent for the flat, which meant that she would have to pay the other half of the rent. The appellant therefore wanted her co-tenant to transfer her tenancy into the appellant’s sole name. The difficulty for the appellant was that under s 91(1) of the Housing Act 1985 (c 68) (UK) (“the Housing Act”), a periodic secure tenancy was “not capable of being assigned”. Somewhat ingeniously, the appellant decided to enter into a deed of release, as opposed to a deed of assignment, with her co-tenant, under which the co-tenant purported to release her interest to the appellant as sole tenant. The House of Lords, with Lord Millett dissenting, held that the deed of release was ineffectual. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, delivering the principal judgment of the court, held (at 404–406) that the “ancient distinction” between a release and an assignment “[did] not provide the answer to the issue”; it would make “no sense” for the effectiveness of s 91(1) of the Housing Act to depend on which of these two conveyancing modes was used. Lord Nicholls found that “as a matter of <span class="font-italic">ordinary usage</span>” [emphasis added], a transfer of a lease under which the identity of the tenants was changed would be regarded as an assignment within the meaning of s 91(1) of the Housing Act, and that this was so “whatever form of words was used: release, surrender, transfer, assign, convey, grant. In colloquial terms, this tenancy bore a label ‘not transferable’”. Hence, the technical meaning of the word “assigned” was rejected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>also explains (at p 1084) that where a term has both an ordinary and a technical meaning, the court will also consider whether the term is accompanied in the legislation by <span class="font-italic">other related technical terms</span> in construing the term. This, like the other guidelines to ascertaining the meaning of a word that has both an ordinary and a technical meaning, emphasises again the need to pay heed to the linguistic context of a word or phrase and not to assume, simply because the word or phrase when read in isolation may have a well-known definition in law, in a particular technical field, or in common parlance, that that meaning must have been within the drafter’s intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 We will now describe and assess each of the Prosecution’s four arguments on their merits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(II) Argument 1: The word “agent” refers to a well-defined class of persons and should not be construed </span>ejusdem generis</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The Prosecution submits that the word “agent” refers to a “well-defined class of persons” and hence should not be construed <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span>. According to the Prosecution, the majority had misapplied the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle. It argues that “[t]he <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is used to cut down the scope of a word where <span class="font-italic">its ordinary meaning is so wide and vague that giving effect to it would lead to absurd or unacceptable results, or </span><span class="font-italic">would otherwise frustrate the legislative purpose</span>. Words that are properly subject to the application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle <span class="font-italic">would typically take the form of general phrases such as </span><span class="font-italic">‘other place’ and ‘any other goods’, which potentially have unlimited scope</span>. In such cases, there is a need to limit the scope of these words (and the potential reach of the statute) by applying the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle, or some other canon of interpretation” [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added]. The Prosecution suggests that in the present case, “had s 409 been drafted as referring to ‘a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney <span class="font-italic">or other person’</span>, the application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to restrict the interpretation of the phrase ‘other person’ to persons of the same type as the preceding specific terms may have been justified” [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 For the following reasons, we are of the view that this is not an accurate description of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle. To begin, it is incorrect to say that the <span class="font-italic">ejudem generis </span>principle may <span class="font-italic">only</span> be applied where the ordinary meaning of a word is “so wide and vague that giving effect to it would lead to absurd or unacceptable results, or otherwise frustrate the legislative purpose”. No authority was cited for this proposition. As explained at [110] above, the application of the principle is not restricted to such restricted scenarios, but can be used broadly to resolve ambiguity or uncertainty perceived in the statutory provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Second, while it is <span class="font-italic">generally</span> correct to say that words that are properly subject to the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle “typically take the form of general phrases such as ‘other place’ and ‘any other goods’”, this is only a <span class="font-italic">partial</span> but not the <span class="font-italic">complete</span> truth. We have explained at [117]–[121] above that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is not tied to any particular formula and does not apply only in cases where there is a string of genus-describing terms followed by wide residuary or sweeping-up words. Nor is the term “other” (or “any other”) a necessary component of an expression that is properly subject to the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle. And for the reasons explained in the preceding paragraph, there is no need for a phrase to “potentially have unlimited scope” for the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to become relevant as an interpretive tool. For the same reasons, we think that it is incorrect as a matter of principle to argue that the application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle by the majority “may have been justified” only if s 409 had “been drafted as referring to ‘a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney <span class="font-italic">or other person’</span>” [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added]. The applicability of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is independent of form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The Prosecution also suggests that “agent” is “plainly not” a term “of a similar vague or general character”, but instead refers to “a well-defined class of persons” defined according to the law of agency, and “therefore, should not be construed <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>with the other specified terms in s 409”. This argument assumes what it seeks to prove. It presupposes that the applicable definition of “an agent” is that found in the law of agency, and then takes this as the basis for its subsequent assertion that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle therefore cannot have any application as that principle is relevant only where there is definitional ambiguity. Put another way, the argument is circular – it begs the question as to the correct understanding of “an agent”. Hence, with respect, it adds little that is of value to the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(III) Argument 2: Bankers and merchants cannot be considered to be mere enumerations of agents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The Prosecution further argues that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle “should only be applied to construe <span class="font-italic">a general term</span>, when the string of specified terms in the statutory provision can be regarded as <span class="font-italic">mere enumerations</span> of the type of persons/objects/species that the general term was meant to include” [emphasis added]. Thus the term “agent” “should only be construed <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>with the five specified persons in s 409, if these five specified persons can be regarded as <span class="font-italic">mere enumerations of the type of agents that </span><span class="font-italic">s 409 was meant to cover</span>” [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added]. This, the Prosecution argues, is not so – in particular, bankers and merchants cannot be considered to be mere enumerations of agents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In our judgment, this argument merely compounds the problems caused by its earlier erroneous account of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle. As<span class="font-italic"> </span>we have explained, the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is applicable not only in situations where one seeks to construe “general terms” that are preceded by “specified terms”. The principle is of broader application than that. It may be applied in situations where the term sought to be construed is likewise a “specified term” (to use the Prosecution’s language), as long as the <span class="font-italic">genus-defining terms</span> in the generic string appropriately shed light on its meaning. Examples where the term sought to be construed cannot by any means be considered to be a residuary or sweeping-up term have been provided in the extract from <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>at [118] above. Therefore, the Prosecution, with respect, errs when it suggests that in order for the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to be relevant in determining the meaning of “an agent”, the expression “an agent” must be a “general term” in relation to which “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” are “mere enumerations”. Its argument therefore ought to be dismissed on this basis alone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 On a more fundamental level, however, we think it important also to highlight that the Prosecution’s argument appears to be based on a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">misreading</span> of the majority’s reasoning. The majority <span class="font-italic">never</span> sought to demonstrate that bankers, merchants, factors (and so on) are “mere enumerations” of agents. Rather, the majority applied the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle in order to demonstrate that because bankers, merchants, factors (and so on) are <span class="font-italic">professions or trades</span>, so must the reference to an “agent” refer to a <span class="font-italic">profession or trade</span>. The majority’s analysis in the MA Judgment at [106] puts this beyond any doubt: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the existence of the preceding words also bring into play the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle in relation to the interpretation of the word ‘an agent’. Applying that principle, <span class="font-italic">the meaning of the words </span><span class="font-italic">‘an agent’ must be restricted by, and implied from, the words ‘a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney’.</span> Each and every one of these persons carries on <span class="font-italic">a business or a trade</span> <span class="font-italic">(in the sense of a type of commercial activity) of offering certain services to the public</span> in the course of which the customer has to entrust property, or the dominion of such, with him. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Thus, in our view, the Prosecution’s arguments, advanced at some length, as to why bankers and merchants “do not share the core characteristics of agents” and “can be entrusted with property in capacities other than as agents” simply miss the mark and are accordingly irrelevant to the analysis. It was <span class="font-italic">never</span> the majority’s intent to demonstrate that bankers and merchants (and factors, brokers and attorneys) are all subspecies of “an agent”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(IV) Argument 3: No genus can be identified from “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We turn to the Prosecution’s argument that there is <span class="font-italic">no genus</span> that can be identified from the “specified terms” in s 409. The Prosecution submits that factors and attorneys are, contrary to the majority’s view, not persons who carry on a business or trade of offering certain services to the public at large and who are in an external relationship with the person entrusting the property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 We find that this is plainly incorrect with regard to a <span class="font-italic">factor</span>, who “is an agent whose ordinary course of business is to sell or dispose of goods, of which he is entrusted with the possession or control by his principal” (<span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds </span>at para 1-035). The Prosecution also relies on an article on the legal history of factors (Roderick Munday, “A Legal History of the Factor” (1977) 6 Anglo-Am LR 221 (“<span class="font-italic">Munday</span>”)) in an attempt to show that some commentators and courts in the 18th and 19th century treated the factor as “simply an employee or <span class="font-italic">clerk</span> entrusted with the management and conduct of business” [emphasis added]. But there is no indication, on a plain reading of s 409, that this broad characterisation was intended to apply to the word “factor” in s 409, particularly given the limiting expression “in the way of his business”. More importantly, when <span class="font-italic">Munday </span>is read with care, it becomes clear that the article does not support the historical proposition for which it is cited. According to <span class="font-italic">Munday </span>(at p 223)<span class="font-italic">, </span>from at least the 16th century, the factor in England was “an agent chiefly engaged in foreign trade”, described at the time as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Factors are Persons appointed by written Commissions from private Merchants or commercial Companies to reside in foreign Countries, to transact the Business of selling the Commodities exported by their Principals and consigned to them, to purchase other Merchandize in the Countries where they reside, to be sent home to their Principals; and to negotiate Bills of Exchange and Remittances in Money, for the Sale, or Purchase of such Merchandize, or the Balance of Accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although <span class="font-italic">Munday </span>does observe (at p 226) that in the 17th century – a considerable period before the enactment of the Penal Code or its predecessors – the factor was regarded largely as a species of servant, he notes that the 17th century “marked the beginning of the <span class="font-italic">commercial middlemen’s </span>great rise to prominence” [emphasis added] (at p 227). As <span class="font-italic">Munday </span>explains (at p 228), “[f]rom the decisions and statutes there emerges a picture of an agent fulfilling an increasingly dominant financial role in international and, to a certain extent, domestic commerce” [emphasis added]; in all of the factor’s financial activities, “the importance of the factor as <span class="font-italic">an essential mercantile financier</span> is important” [emphasis added]. In fact, the commercial influence of the factor grew to such an extent that the UK Parliament thought it necessary to enact legislation to protect third parties who dealt with the factor. The Factors Acts of 1823 (c 83) (UK) and 1825 (c 94) (UK) (“the early Factors Acts”) were passed essentially to preserve security of transactions between factors and third party purchasers and pledgees (at pp 246–250). It was only toward the turn of the 20th century – after the enactment of the Indian Penal Code – that the commercial world witnessed the decline of the factor due to improved means of communication and speedier methods of transport that meant that buyers and sellers could deal with each other directly (at p 250).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The crucial point for present purposes is that while the factor <span class="font-italic">originally</span> occupied “an important but subordinate position as a species of servant”, <span class="font-italic">by the 18th </span><span class="font-italic">century</span> the factor “came to assume <span class="font-italic">an independent status, often of great financial strength</span>, buying and selling on commission on behalf of his various principals” [emphasis added] (at p 259). In the circumstances, we find that there is little historical basis to support the Prosecution’s submission that a factor is merely a species of an employee or clerk. On the <span class="font-italic">contrary</span>, the historical material demonstrates that by the time the Penal Code was drafted, a factor was regarded as a <span class="font-italic">commercial tradesman </span>engaged in the <span class="font-italic">trade or profession</span> of dealing with foreign merchants on behalf of his principal, and who simultaneously also carried out a number of other important financial functions such as giving advances to his principal and granting credit to purchasers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In relation to “attorney”, the Prosecution relies on the definition of the word as referring to both a “private attorney” and a “public attorney” as stated in the Oxford English Dictionary Online (3rd Ed) and <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Hari Singh Gour’s Penal Code of India </span>vol 4 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Gour</span>”) (which was cited by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Cheng Yew and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1095 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Yew</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [98]–[99]). It argues that this definition shows that not all the classes of persons enumerated in the second limb of s 409 are professional agents who offer their services to the community at large for reward. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 We are reminded, first of all, that the meaning of a word as used in a statute should not be ascertained by “rushing to dictionaries” (see Mummery LJ’s remark in <span class="font-italic">Football Association </span>quoted at [75] above). The ordinary meaning of the disputed word or phrase is to be ascertained through the examination of the disputed word or phrase within its linguistic context. Turning to the Prosecution’s argument, we find that the difficulty that argument encounters is that even if the word “attorney” does include a “private attorney” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a person who holds a power of attorney and who is appointed by another to transact any business for him out of court – this does not necessarily mean that <span class="font-italic">all </span>private attorneys, professional or otherwise, will be caught under the ambit of s 409. It must still be proved that such a person was <span class="font-italic">acting “in the course of his business” </span>as a “private attorney”. Therefore, even accepting that a “private attorney” falls within the scope of s 409, only a “private attorney” who is exercising powers of attorney given to him by his clients <span class="font-italic">as part of his </span><span class="font-italic">business or trade</span> would fall within the scope of s 409. The ruling of the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Yew </span>at [103] that s 409 refers to “trusted agents employed by the public in their various businesses”, <span class="font-italic">including attorneys</span>, supports this analysis. Crucially, we note that <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Yew </span>was a case concerning a solicitor, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a “<span class="font-italic">public</span> attorney” who was clearly acting in the course of his <span class="font-italic">professional</span> activities. And, in any event, the High Court simply did not have to consider the proper scope of the expression “in the way of his business” and its impact on the definition of “attorney”, as the question did not arise in that case. In the circumstances, we find that <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Yew</span> is therefore <span class="font-italic">not</span> authority for the proposition that “private attorneys” do necessarily fall within the scope of s 409.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(V) Argument 4: The absence of the word “other” suggests that the draftsman did not intend the word “agent” to be construed </span>ejusdem generis</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The Prosecution’s final argument is that the fact that s 409 uses the phrase “or an agent” rather than “or other agent” is a matter of some significance. It suggests that “[t]he use of the term <span class="font-italic">‘other’</span> after a string of specific terms suggests that the drafters <span class="font-italic">intended the preceding specific terms to be examples of the general term</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… Conversely, the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of the word <span class="font-italic">‘other’</span> suggests that the drafters were <span class="font-italic">referring to distinct categories</span> when drafting the provision, and did not intend the general term to be construed <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Once again, this reflects a misunderstanding of the circumstances in which it is appropriate to apply the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle. We have explained that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle is form-independent – even if the statutory provision does not include the word “other”, the principle may still properly be applied to determine the meaning of the expression in question (see [117]–[121] above). On a more fundamental level, the argument reflects a persistent flaw in the Prosecution’s submissions – the argument erroneously assumes that the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle ought only be applied to a “general term” in contrast to “specific terms”. As discussed above, this is neither correct in principle nor reflective of the courts’ practice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The Prosecution submits that the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span> and the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>“placed heavy emphasis on the presence of the word ‘other’ before the word ‘agent’”. It reproduces, in its written submissions, the following sentence in the extract from <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>set out<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [128] above: “Moreover, the words of the section are not ‘banker, merchant, broker, attorney, or agent,’ but ‘or other agent,’ pointing, in our opinion, to some agent, of like kind with the class before enumerated.” The Prosecution surmises that “[i]t is therefore clear that the court in <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>regarded the existence of the word ‘other’ as significant in showing that the drafters of s 75 of the UK Larceny Act 1861 intended the provision to apply to similar classes of persons”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 However, when that sentence is read in <span class="font-italic">context</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as part of the entire the paragraph), it becomes clear that the English High Court’s decision was reached <span class="font-italic">primarily</span> because it agreed with the accused’s submission that if he was to be regarded as coming within the term “other agent intrusted with money or valuable security” (as the Crown argued), this would mean that “no interpretation or effect would be given to the words ‘banker, merchant, broker, or attorney;’ and that, <span class="font-italic">it was obvious that some effect must be given to </span><span class="font-italic">those words, if possible, in construing the section</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>at 491). Second, the court noted that the other relevant sections in the Larceny Act 1861 “specif[ied] certain classes of persons who may be guilty of the offences therein described”, such as clerks, servants, persons in the public service, tenants, lodgers, and thereafter, in s 75, “agents, bankers, factors”. The court surmised that “s. 75 is limited to a class” and applies “only to the class of persons therein pointed out”. It was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only then</span> that the court stated, “Moreover, the words of the section are not ‘banker, merchant, broker, attorney, or agent,’ but ‘or <span class="font-italic">other</span> agent,’ pointing, in our opinion, to some agent, of like kind with the class before enumerated” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>at 491). In other words, this was merely an <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">additional and supporting </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ground </span><span class="font-italic">that the English High Court identified</span><span class="font-italic"> in support of the conclusion, that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it had already reached</span>, on the proper interpretation of the phrase “or other Agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 We note that the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>adopted <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the very same</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> analysis</span> in considering the relevant provision of the Ceylon Penal Code (which <span class="font-italic">did not</span> contain the word “other” as s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 did) in light of <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>. The Privy Council held that while “[i]t [was] true that the judges who tried [<span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>] went on to place some reliance on the fact that the [Larceny Act 1861] uses the words ‘banker, merchant, broker, attorney, or <span class="font-italic">other </span>agent’ and to draw the inference therefrom that the agent must, like the preceding types, form one of a class” [emphasis in original], the Privy Council found that “<span class="font-italic">this [was] only an </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">additional ground</span><span class="font-italic"> for their decision</span> and [was] <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">merely used as a support</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">of the view which they already entertained</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (<span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>at 418). We will describe the facts and decision in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>in more detail at [248]–[253] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In summary, we find that the Prosecution’s reliance on the absence of the word “other” in s 409 of the Penal Code in criticising the majority’s application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle must be rejected as a matter of principle. Its assertion that the absence of the word “other” ought to be determinative of the proper interpretation of “an agent” is also unsupported by <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>(not to mention a line of consistent English authority to the same effect, which we will describe subsequently).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Summary on the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For the foregoing reasons, we are satisfied that the majority’s application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to determine the meaning of “an agent” in the light of the generic string “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” is sound in its method and correct in its conclusion. The conclusion yielded is that “[e]ach and every one of these persons carries on a business or a trade (in the sense of a type of commercial activity) of offering certain services to the public in the course of which the customer has to entrust property, or the dominion of such, with him” (MA Judgment at [106]). We do not accept the Prosecution’s submission that the majority’s application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle was flawed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 It is also worth highlighting that the result that the majority reached following its application of the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle was <span class="font-italic">entirely </span><span class="font-italic">consistent </span>with its understanding of the preceding expression “in the way of his business”. As we have explained earlier, we agree with its reading of that expression. This means that definitions of “in the way of his business”, “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” and “an agent” are <span class="font-italic">coherent </span>and <span class="font-italic">mutually reinforcing</span>. This is a result of the contextual approach to statutory interpretation that we have adopted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Schema of the CBT provisions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Finally, we turn to the general structure of the CBT provisions in the Penal Code. This schema, in our view, further supports our view that the ordinary meaning of the second limb of s 409 only encompasses persons who are acting in the course of a certain trade, profession or occupation. It indicates that the word “agent” cannot be read as referring to any agent under the general law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 To be clear, these are the various specific classes of persons who fall within aggravated CBT provisions in the Penal Code:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Carriers, wharfingers and warehouse-keepers (s 407);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clerk or servant (s 408); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Public servants (first limb of s 409); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, attorneys and agents (second limb of s 409).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 It is plain that these are all references to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">specific trades or professions</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>rather than general legal categories. For instance, in so far as s 407 is concerned, even though carriers, wharfingers and warehouse-keepers are all clearly enumerations of bailees, there is no reference in s 407 to “bailee”. Similarly, clerks, servants and public servants are specific occupations, not categories that have received definitions in law. The same is true of bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, and attorneys, as we have explained above. In the circumstances, it is implausible that the word “agent” was intended to refer, <span class="font-italic">quite exceptionally</span>, to a general category in law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The Prosecution submits that the CBT provisions in the Penal Code are on a “sliding scale of severity of offences”. It argues that the scheme of these offences indicates that the majority’s reading of “agent” was wrong, given that not all the persons falling within ss 407–409 stand in an “external relationship” with the victim or offer their services to the public at large. Section 408 also suggests that it does not matter whether, and how much, the accused person is remunerated, since a clerk or servant can have a nominal salary. In the Prosecution’s analysis, there are three key considerations underlying the legislature’s choice of the specific classes of persons listed in s 409: (a) the position occupied by such persons; (b) the high level of trust and confidence reposed in them; and (c) the responsibilities they discharge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 These arguments are, in our view, neither here nor there. It is true that there are normative distinctions between the various classes of persons identified in the aggravated CBT provisions. However, this is only natural given that they are <span class="font-italic">distinct </span>classes of persons falling within different aggravated CBT provisions. So the fact that some of these classes may not share the characteristics of a professional agent <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be used as a basis for construing “agent” within s 409 more broadly. That would, with respect, be a <span class="font-italic">non sequitur. </span>What <span class="font-italic">is</span> relevant upon an examination of the scheme of the CBT provisions are the <span class="font-italic">similarities </span>between the various classes. And here, the Prosecution is correct, at a high level of abstraction, in noting that these are all persons in whom a considerable level of trust and confidence is reposed. But that is only one similarity. It is <span class="font-italic">also</span> clear, as noted above, that these are all <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">specific trades or professions</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">rather than general legal categories</span>. That is the critical point for present purposes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the ordinary meaning of the disputed phrase </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Two competing interpretations of the disputed phrase “in the way of his business as … an agent” were put before us. The Prosecution contends that it refers to acting in the course of one’s regular duties or functions as a legal agent, and the respondents submit that the phrase refers to acting in the profession, trade or occupation of a professional agent. At this stage of the interpretive exercise, the court’s aim is to ascertain the possible interpretations of the disputed phrase and it does so not only by examining the provision in question but also by having due regard to the context of the statutory provision within the written law as a whole (<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>at [59]; see [67] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Taking the disputed phrase alone, we have examined its constituent parts, applying the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle (and the broader <span class="font-italic">noscitur a sociis </span>principle) to “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney” to identify the genus that is to be applied to “an agent”. We have also considered the disputed phrase in the context of the other part of s 409, comparing the expression “in the way of his business” in the second limb of s 409 to “in his capacity of” within the first limb. The disputed phrase was then viewed within the wider context of the remaining CBT provisions in the Penal Code, comparing the targeted classes of persons in those provisions with “an agent” in the disputed phrase. Through this telescopic exercise of statutory interpretation, transitioning from a granular focus on s 409 to the broader statutory landscape, we have concluded that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ordinary meaning</span> of the disputed phrase is that which the majority had identified, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that <span class="font-italic">when a person is acting </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“in the way of his business as … an agent”</span><span class="font-italic">, he is engaged in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">commercial activity in the conduct of his profession or trade</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, which </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the offering of his agency services to the community at large, through which he makes his living</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Hence, we do not accept that the definition of the disputed phrase offered by the Prosecution can be adopted, having regard to the language of the provision as a whole and its broader statutory context. On this basis alone, we <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">reject</span> the Prosecution’s submission on Question 1. Furthermore, as we will set out in the next two sections of our judgment, the broad interpretation of s 409 argued for by the Prosecution is also not in line with the legislative purpose of the provision, both as gleaned from the text itself as well as from the extraneous material on the provision’s legislative history and background. Instead, the legislative purpose of s 409 entirely supports the ordinary meaning of the provision that we have just elucidated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legislative purpose of s 409 as gleaned from the text </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 As Menon CJ explained in <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>(at [59]) (see [67] above), after ascertaining the possible interpretations of the text having due regard to the context of the text within the written law as a whole, the court must then ascertain the <span class="font-italic">legislative purpose or object</span> of the provision. This may be discerned from the language used in the provision and from extraneous material where appropriate (this is discussed subsequently). We now turn to consider the legislative purpose of s 409 as ascertained from the language of the provision and the schema of the CBT provisions in the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 In our judgment, the legislative purpose of the second limb of s 409 as derived from the language of the provision is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to punish more severely</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> the commission of CBT by persons who are engaged in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">certain trusted trades</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline"> or professions</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in circumstances where they are entrusted with property or dominion over it in the course of their commercial activity</span>. One of the trusted trades or professions identified in s 409 is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">business of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">agency, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">ie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">, professional agents</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> We reach this finding from our earlier examination of (a) the concurrent use of the phrases “in the way of his business” and “in the capacity of” by the drafters of the Penal Code; (b) how the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle ought properly to be applied to ascertain the meaning of “an agent”; and (c) the statutory context provided by the other CBT provisions in the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 In contrast, we find that there is simply <span class="font-italic">no indication </span>that s 409 is intended to broadly capture “persons of higher station in whom great trust and confidence is reposed and who discharge heavy responsibilities”, including all legal agents (except <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>or casual agents), as the Prosecution submits. This vague and abstract statement of legislative purpose is unsupported by the actual text and statutory context of the provision. More problematically, the Prosecution’s articulation of legislative object is set at <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">too high a level of generality</span>. This has serious implications because, as Menon CJ expressly cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>(at [60]) (see [68] above), one can, by pitching the legislative purpose at too high a level of generality, essentially derive support for whatever interpretation of the disputed word or phrase that one subjectively desires. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Extraneous material on legislative history and background to s 409</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 We now turn to the extraneous material on the legislative history and background to s 409 of the Penal Code. In order to present a complete picture of the history of the offence of CBT as an agent, it will be necessary to review on a broader canvas how the offence of CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter </span>and its associated provisions came to be enshrined in statute. We will focus, of course, on the legislative developments that occurred at or around the time these provisions were promulgated (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the 19th century), since this is the relevant timeframe for ascertaining the Parliamentary intention (<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Having carefully reviewed the historical material, we are of the view that the legislative history of s 409 provides clear support for the majority’s finding that an “agent” within the meaning of s 409 of the Penal Code means “a professional agent” and does <span class="font-italic">not</span> include persons who are not in the <span class="font-italic">business</span> of agency, such as directors. In other words, this is a case where the extraneous material <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">confirms</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">that the meaning and purpose of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision</span> (s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA; see [71] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Introduction to the legislative history of s 409</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Section 409 of the Penal Code was first enacted as a provision within the Indian Penal Code in 1860, which was thereafter brought into force in Singapore by the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements in 1872 as Ordinance 4 of 1871 (Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">The Development of Singapore Law: Historical and Socio</span><span class="font-italic">-legal Perspectives </span>(Butterworths, 1990) at p 180). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 As originally enacted, s 409 of the Indian Penal Code read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, <span class="font-italic">in his capacity of a public servant, or</span>,<span class="font-italic"> in the way of his business as a banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney, or agent</span>, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with transportation for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extent to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.

In the next two sections, we will outline the development of the UK embezzlement provisions and explain the historical connection between those earlier provisions and s 409 itself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Early embezzlement provisions in the UK</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Under the old English common law, there was a requirement that to constitute larceny or theft at common law that there should be a felonious “taking,” which was understood to mean a “taking out of the possession of some person entitled to [the property]”. Thus fraudulent misappropriation of property was not a crime if the possession of the property was originally acquired honestly (Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, <span class="font-italic">A History of the Criminal Law of England</span> vol III (Macmillan and Co, 1883) (“<span class="font-italic">Stephen</span>”) at pp 150–151 and 158). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In 1529, the Embezzlement Act (c 7) (UK) was passed, making it a felony for any <span class="font-italic">servant</span>, not being an apprentice or under 18 years of age, to embezzle any money or chattel entrusted to him by his master to be kept for his use. This was followed by the first general enactment which altered the old common law rule extensively – the Embezzlement Act 1799 (c 85) (UK), which criminalised embezzlement by any <span class="font-italic">clerk</span> or <span class="font-italic">servant</span> in the UK. The catalyst for this development was a case involving one Bazeley, who was a clerk in a bank and had applied a note for £100 for his own purposes rather than putting it to the credit of the customer who had paid it in (<span class="font-italic">Stephen </span>at pp 152–153).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Embezzlement Act 1812</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 In 1812, the Embezzlement Act 1812 was passed by the UK Parliament. The Embezzlement Act 1812 introduced a further statutory exception to the strict common law rule by criminalising embezzlement by any “Bankers, Merchants, Brokers, Attornies and other Agents of any Description whatsoever” (s 1). This was the <span class="font-italic">first time</span> that embezzlement by bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys and other agents was established as a crime in the UK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 This legislative intervention was once again prompted by a case that had, in the words of Mr Henry Drummond (“Mr Drummond”), who moved the 1812 Bill, “made much noise in the country” (United Kingdom, House of Commons, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates </span>(25 February 1812) vol 21 at col 943). This was the case of <span class="font-italic">R v Walsh</span> (4 Taunton 258), in which a stockbroker who misappropriated moneys entrusted to him had been acquitted on the basis that he was neither a clerk nor a servant (<span class="font-italic">Stephen </span>at pp 154–155). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The Prosecution refers to certain comments by the English Members of Parliament who welcomed the 1812 Bill, remarking that the legislation, among other things, fixed the “singularly disgusting anomaly” in the law that that masters and employers were not criminally liable for fraudulent breaches of trust although their servants were. In our view, these comments cannot be taken out of context. The Embezzlement Act 1812 was merely an <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">incremental</span> extension of the previous law to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">specific mercantile persons</span> identified in the Act. Mr Drummond, in moving the 1812 Bill, specifically stated that the legislation “<span class="font-italic">could hardly be said to be an addition to the criminal code of the country</span>; it was more properly <span class="font-italic">an extension of an act already in existence</span>, by which it was made felony for servants or clerks to embezzle or misapply the property of their masters entrusted to them” [emphasis added] (United Kingdom, House of Commons, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates </span>(25 February 1812) vol 21 at col 943). In other words, the Embezzlement Act 1812 was <span class="font-italic">not</span> intended to be a radical overhaul of the law such as to <span class="font-italic">generally</span> capture “masters” or anyone in a higher status or position of trust.

The purpose of the Larceny Act 1827 was essentially to <span class="font-italic">consolidate</span> the provisions of the Embezzlement Act 1812, with some minor modifications. It criminalised embezzlement by “any Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or other Agent” entrusted with money for any special purpose (s 49). In addition, it introduced a provision relating to “any Factor or Agent” who fraudulently pledges for his own use any goods or documents of title entrusted to him for the purpose of sale (s 51). These provisions “only put fraudulent breach of trust by agents, and in particular by merchants, bankers, brokers, attorneys, and factors, on the same footing as embezzlement by servants. The old common law principle still protected all other fraudulent breaches of trust” such as those by bailees (<span class="font-italic">Stephen </span>at pp 155–156).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Passage of the Indian Penal Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 In this section, we outline the passage of the Indian Penal Code and the connection between s 409 and the UK embezzlement provisions discussed above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) First draft of the Indian Penal Code – 1837 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Although the Indian Penal Code was enacted in 1860, the drafting of the code started more than 20 years before that.

This was because it was considered that the English Law Commissioners would “not be justified in making any material alteration in so modern a law [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Larceny Act 1827], which was expressly founded on defects made apparent by Walsh’s case … [and] one so material to the interests of the commercial classes” (Note to Art 92 of the <span class="font-italic">Fourth Report</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Second, in so far as the specific provisions dealing with bankers, merchants, brokers, factors, attorneys and other agents were concerned, the English Law Commissioners in the <span class="font-italic">Fourth Report</span> made the important observation that the “<span class="font-italic">the term ‘Agents,’ as used in this law, is somewhat indefinite, even when construed, as probably it would be, in reference to the context</span>” [emphasis added] (Note to Art 92 of the <span class="font-italic">Fourth Report</span>).

Section II of the Act states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">II. Bankers, &amp;c. fraudulently selling, &amp;c.

There is very little to commend an interpretation of s II that renders s V otiose.

The legislative background to the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 makes this point even clearer.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Background to the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 As can be seen from the historical account that we have provided above, the CBT provisions in England were products of particular social concerns that were in the public eye at the relevant points in time. The catalyst for the enactment of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 was no different. This is a matter of significance to the present analysis because it demonstrates that the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 was enacted in order to target a social menace that had not previously come to attention, and that therefore had to be dealt with by way of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">new</span><span class="font-italic"> legislation</span> containing <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">new</span><span class="font-italic"> offences</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 The origins of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 can be traced to one of the most notorious financial scandals of the 19th century (see the illuminating article by Sarah Wilson in “Tort Law, Actors in the ‘Enterprise Economy’, and Articulation of Nineteenth-century Capitalism with Law: The Fraudulent Trustees Act 1857 in Context” in <span class="font-italic">Tort Law and the Legislature</span><span class="font-italic">: Common Law, Statute and the Dynamics of Legal Change </span>(TT Arvind<span class="font-italic"> </span>&amp; Jenny Steele eds) (Hart Publishing, 2013) at ch 17 (“<span class="font-italic">Wilson</span>”)). This was the collapse of the Royal British Bank in 1856. The Royal British Bank had acquired a considerable reputation in London, and from this it had also accrued a substantial body of business from mercantile and private clients. The bulk of these customers did not know, however, that the directors of the Royal British Bank had a secret ledger of advances for clients who were keen to avoid publicity in their dealings. The directors also helped themselves to the bank’s money as it suited them and made advances to their friends from the bank’s funds without regard to security. The result of this misappropriation was the eventual collapse of the bank, leading to financial ruin for thousands of clients including numerous small traders and private individuals of limited means. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Following the collapse, a raft of litigation ensued together with an upwelling of public outrage demanding a response by the criminal law. The directors of the Royal British Bank were subsequently prosecuted and convicted for the common law offences of conspiring falsely and fraudulently to represent that the bank was sound and prosperous during 1855, knowing this to be untrue, and with intent to deceive shareholders and to induce the Queen’s subjects to become customers (<span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">egina v Esdaile and others </span>(1823) 1 F&amp;F 212 (“<span class="font-italic">Esdaile</span>”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The following observations in <span class="font-italic">Wilson </span>at pp 367–368 about the events leading up to the enactment of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 are illuminating: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…there was recognition that existing legal responses were found to be outdated whether they were coherent or otherwise. This is evident from the way that, a short time prior to the collapse of the Royal British Bank, there was the trial and conviction of Strahan, Paul and Bates for embezzlement of money entrusted to them by clients. In this latter trial, it had been remarked by counsel that embezzlement had only been a crime since 1812, but <span class="font-italic">by the time of the Royal British Bank collapse, it was clear that</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the criminal law would need to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">evolve to accommodate misconduct</span><span class="font-italic"> on the part of bankers which fell short of this</span>. Furthermore, the enterprise economy would increase the extent to which <span class="font-italic">those other than bankers undertook the safe custody of property belonging to others, and who would come face to face with opportunities for its misuse including misappropriation</span>, but also other types of impropriety.

The relevant extract of Sir Richard’s speech is as follows (United Kingdom, House of Commons, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> (21 May 1857) vol 145 at cols 679–681): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There were other breaches of trust of a more dangerous character, because of more extended influence, committed by persons who did not stand in exactly the relation of a trustee, but which <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">required the introduction of some particular law, in order to meet delinquents who at present might remain untouched. He alluded to those persons who, in the prosecution of those great undertakings which were almost peculiar to this country, had formed companies and had placed themselves in the position of directors or managers of those companies.</span> <span class="font-italic">The next set of clauses which he proposed to introduce into the Bill had been framed to meet the delinquencies</span>, which he regretted to say were so frequent and so gigantic, of persons standing in that situation. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In those cases in which such persons fraudulently and openly appropriated sums of money, there could, of course, be no doubt as to their liability to prosecution</span><span class="font-italic">; but</span> <span class="font-italic">these appropriations were for the most part much too cleverly executed to render it necessary that they should have recourse to a proceeding so clumsy and common as a direct and manifest fraud.</span> Their appropriations of money were, as the House was well aware, effected through the medium of false accounts and fraudulent representations. He had therefore introduced into the Bill a series of clauses under whose operation, if they should pass into a law, the act of keeping false accounts, of making false entries, or disguising the nature of those transactions, by means of untrue representations, should be made criminal. He had also framed two other clauses, which would embrace in their operation that extensive system of fraud which was produced through the medium of false representations, coupled with acts to give a colour to those representations, such as fraudulent statements of the affairs of a company, the payment of dividends out of a fictitious capital, or other wrongful acts which went to the perpetration of great public cheats. <span class="font-italic">Whether the law, as it stood, was or was not sufficient to meet such cases, there could be no harm whatsoever in making the particular mode of robbery to which he referred the subject of a direct criminal enactment.</span> While speaking upon that point, he might perhaps be allowed to advert to an answer which he had a few evenings before given to a question of an hon. Gentleman who had asked him to inform the House whether he would not institute criminal proceedings against certain persons, who were concerned in transactions by which the public mind had of late been much occupied. … <span class="font-italic">[H]e had no hesitation in saying that he would try, without a moment</span><span class="font-italic">’s delay, whether the law as it now stood was not strong enough to meet that case.</span> He trusted, therefore, the House would feel that in giving the answer to which he had just alluded he had been guided by his own conscientious convictions, and that he would not permit himself, as first law officer of the Crown, to be dictated to by a newspaper, nor adopt its suggestions, unless they happened to be such as to command his individual assent. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But <span class="font-italic">to proceed to the provisions of the Bill: he had further to state that it proposed to deal not merely with the trustees, directors, and managers of companies</span>, but also with the numerous class of persons who came under the designation of assignees of bankrupts and insolvents, to whose case the same principle would be extended. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">With reference to bankers and agents the law now stood in the position which he was about to state.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The jurisprudence of the country was greatly indebted to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the hon.

[<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Larceny Act 1827], but which, while it introduced certain Amendments into the wording of the Act, made but little substantial alteration—so far as related to the particular subject of his remarks—in its provisions.

First, the offences relating to directors of companies in the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 were enacted to counteract <span class="font-italic">a new evil</span>. This is evident from the language that Sir Richard employed. He explained that breaches of trust by such persons “<span class="font-italic">required </span><span class="font-italic">the introduction of some particular law, in order to meet delinquents </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">who at present might remain untouched</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. The clauses “which he proposed to introduce into the Bill had been <span class="font-italic">framed to meet those delinquencies</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Second, Sir Richard’s statement that “[i]n those cases in which such persons <span class="font-italic">fraudulently and openly appropriated sums of money</span>, there could, of course, be no doubt as to their liability to prosecution; but these appropriations were for the most part much too cleverly executed to render it necessary that they should have recourse to a proceeding so clumsy and common as <span class="font-italic">a direct and manifest fraud</span>” [emphasis added] is a reference to cases of direct and manifest fraud <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">under the common law</span><span class="font-italic">, and </span><span class="font-italic">not to any existing statutory offence such as that those under the Larceny Act 1827</span>. Indeed, it was for fraud under <span class="font-italic">the common law</span>, and not any sort of statutory offence (such as that under s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827), that the directors of the Royal British Bank were prosecuted in <span class="font-italic">Esdaile</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 Third, Sir Richard drew a clear distinction in his speech between, on the one hand, the new provisions of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 that targeted directors and officers of body corporates, and on the other hand, the existing offence in s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827 concerning bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys and agents. He referred to the “provisions of the Bill”, which dealt with “trustees, directors and managers of companies” and also “the numerous class of persons who came under the designation of bankrupts and insolvents”. He immediately went on to say, “With reference to <span class="font-italic">bankers and agents</span> the law now stood in the position [as reflected in the Embezzlement Act 1812] … That Act, however, so far as <span class="font-italic">agents, brokers, and bankers were concerned</span>, was limited altogether to meet the case in which the instructions to the agent happened to have been given in writing” [emphasis added]. He then informed the legislature that “the Bill which he had framed proposed to extend the law to all cases of property committed to the charge of agents,<span class="font-italic"> although they might not have received any instructions in writing</span>” [emphasis added]. In other words, the Bill was intended to<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only remo</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ve the writing restriction in s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827</span>, as reflected in s II of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 (see [196] above). It was <span class="font-italic">not</span> intended to otherwise affect the <span class="font-italic">scope</span> of the phrase “Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or Agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 On the other hand, it is clear that Sir Richard regarded the provisions on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">directors</span> in the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 as being part of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">new law</span>, <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> <span class="font-italic">from the existing law</span> (in s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827) which governed bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys and agents. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Wilson</span> (at pp 376–377), “[t]here was some awareness of the ‘special’ position of company directors, whereby such persons sat ambiguously and somewhat uncomfortably between trustees and ‘agents for hire’”. Indeed, when the House of Commons deliberated on the Punishment of Frauds Bill, the phrase “agents for hire” was expressly used by Sir John Rolt. He expressed a concern that one of the new provisions (a prohibition on fraudulent conversion or appropriation by trustees (later enacted as s I of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857)) would prevent persons of character and responsibility from accepting the office of trustee, and asked the Committee to “draw a distinction between trustees and agents for hire – as <span class="font-italic">bankers or others</span>” [emphasis added] (United Kingdom, House of Commons, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> (26 June 1857) vol 146 at col 495).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Drawing these strands of analysis together, one is led to the conclusion that <span class="font-italic">the UK Parliament intended the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 to address a problem that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">did not find a solution under the law as it stood prior to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the introduction of that Act</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> In so far as the law <span class="font-italic">did </span>apply to the conduct of directors, it was the common law of fraud that was relevant, but this was a blunt tool that could not effectively regulate the sophisticated machinations of misbehaving directors. And to the extent that the Bill also addressed bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys and agents – or “agents for hire” – this was <span class="font-italic">only</span> to remove the requirement of writing that unnecessarily hindered the existing prohibition in s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827. There was nothing to suggest that s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827, or the new s II of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857, encompassed directors within its scope.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 All of this is consistent with the historical reason for the introduction of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857. The collapse of the Royal British Bank sparked public concern about the need to place directors under regulation. Hence a suite of new provisions, ranging from the prohibition on fraudulent taking or applying of the money or property of a company (under s V) to the publication of fraudulent statements or accounts with intent to deceive or defraud members, shareholders or creditors of companies (under s VIII), were introduced in the legislation to allay and alleviate the concerns of the public.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Parties’ submissions on the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 As the respondents did not deal in detail with the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 in either their written or oral submissions, we will focus on the Prosecution’s submissions on the same Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 In brief, the Prosecution argues, relying on Sir Richard’s speech, that the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 was introduced “not because directors were not caught under the existing law”, but because there was a need to respond to the ability of directors to “misuse their position to cover up their embezzlement by clever disguises and falsehoods” [emphasis in original removed] and circumvent evidential difficulties. The Prosecution suggests that the provision that already made directors liable “<span class="font-italic">may</span> have been s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827, which punished embezzlements by ‘any Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney or other Agent’” [emphasis in original removed; emphasis added]. It also submits that “[t]he provision in the [Punishment of Frauds Act 1857] on the misappropriation of company property by directors [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s V] was <span class="font-italic">presumably</span> inserted as a <span class="font-italic">consolidating provision</span> given the subject matter of the Act” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 In our judgment, there are three reasons why the Prosecution’s understanding of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be accepted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The first is derived from <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sir </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Richard’s explanation</span> <span class="font-italic">of the Bill</span> leading up to the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857. The Prosecution is, with respect, in error in suggesting that s V of the Act was “presumably inserted as a consolidating provision”. This assertion is purely speculative and runs contrary to Sir Richard’s speech that s V was intended to criminalise something that <span class="font-italic">had not previously been criminalised before</span> (see [202]–[203] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The second is based on a reading of <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">text</span><span class="font-italic"> of </span><span class="font-italic">the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</span>. Alongside s V of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 is s II, which is the provision targeting bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys and agents. We have explained at [197] above that it is simply implausible that the UK Parliament would enact two parallel provisions in the same statute if one provision already encompassed the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The third is based on the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">historical background</span><span class="font-italic"> to </span><span class="font-italic">the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</span>. Section V of the Act was introduced because the common law offence of fraud was not sufficiently sophisticated to effectively target and deter CBT by directors. As described at [204] above, Sir Richard was referring to the <span class="font-italic">common law</span> offence of fraud when he mentioned that directors were liable to be prosecuted under the existing law (as was done in <span class="font-italic">Esdaile</span>); he was not, as the Prosecution suggests, referring to <span class="font-italic">s </span><span class="font-italic">49 of the Larceny Act 1827</span>, which he separately addressed in the same speech (see [205] above). The submission that s 49 of the Larceny Act 1827 “may” have covered directors is thus not only <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">entirely speculative</span>, but also <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ahistorical</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Disconnect between the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 and the Indian Penal Code</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Finally, we reiterate that, although the Indian Penal Code of 1860 was passed only after the introduction of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 and the socio-historical context leading up to its enactment did </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">not</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> form part of the material on which the Indian Penal Code was based</span>. This is because, as explained above at [194], <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the CBT provisions in the Indian Penal Code were based on a review of the embezzlement provisions in the English Digest in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">1846, which was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">more than a decade before</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> the enactment of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 This historical disconnect between the two statutes explains <span class="font-italic">the complete absence of s </span><span class="font-italic">V of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 or any equivalent provision in the Indian Penal Code</span>. Indeed, it is telling that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is no reference to directors of companies anywhere in the Penal Code</span>. In our judgment, in so far as legislative intent is to be discerned “at or around the time the law [was] passed” (<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng </span>at [18]), it is clear that the drafters of the Indian Penal Code would not have considered CBT by directors – <span class="font-italic">which was penalised only </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">subsequently</span><span class="font-italic"> through the introduction of new legislation in </span><span class="font-italic">the UK</span> – as falling within the scope of s 409. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Put simply, it was never intended that directors and other officers of body corporates were to fall within </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s 409 as “agents”.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Subsequent legislative developments in the UK</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Although this is not directly relevant to the interpretation of s 409 as such, we briefly describe, for completeness, the development of the embezzlement provisions in the UK <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 and the subsequent enactment of the Indian Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 One year after the enactment of the Indian Penal Code, the Larceny Act 1861 was passed in the UK. This was another consolidating statute which brought together, amongst others, the Larceny Act 1827 and the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857. It reproduced the separate provisions criminalising embezzlement by “a Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or other Agent” (ss 75 and 76) and fraudulent misappropriation by “a Director, Member, or Public Officer of any Body Corporate or Public Company” (s 81). It should be emphasised that these two prohibitions therefore existed as <span class="font-italic">separate and</span> <span class="font-italic">parallel</span> provisions within the Larceny Act 1861. In addition, breaches of trust by factors (s 78) and bailees (s 3) were also criminalised, in line with the provisions of the previous acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 We conclude in the early years of the 20th century, when the UK Parliament finally departed from the old common law rule by passing the Larceny Act 1901 (c 10) (UK) (“the Larceny Act 1901”). The Larceny Act 1901 amended and generalised the relevant provision on breach of trust by “a Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or other Agent” in ss 75 and 76 of the Larceny Act 1861 to breach of trust by anyone “entrusted, either solely or jointly with any other person, with any property”. It did not, however, effect any changes to s 81 of the Larceny Act 1861 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the separate offence of fraudulent misappropriation by <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">directors</span>), which continued to <span class="font-italic">separately </span>exist alongside the amended ss 75 and 76. We will return to the 1901 amendment later (see [247] below). At this juncture, it suffices to note that the amendment was prompted by a dissatisfaction with the state of UK law under the Larceny Act 1861.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Professional agents in the 19th century</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Finally, to round up the historical analysis, we consider the status of agents as a class of persons in the 19th century. In our view, a proper appreciation of the history of agents as a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">profession</span> is crucial to understanding the <span class="font-italic">context</span> in which the statutory provisions discussed above were enacted, in particular s 409.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The essence of legal agency, as traditionally understood, is the power of the agent to affect the principal’s legal relations with third parties (<span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds </span>at para 1-004). It developed from the relationship of master and servant, and emerged as a “single and significant” subject at the turn of the 19th century (S J Stoljar, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span><span class="font-italic">: Its History and Present Principles </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell Limited, 1961) (“<span class="font-italic">Stoljar</span>”) at p 14 and more generally at pp 3–17). Its growth was sparked in many ways by the development of commercial life, such as the growth of trading companies, from the 17th century onwards (G H L Fridman, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency </span>(Butterworths, 7th Ed, 1996) at<span class="font-italic"> </span>p 7).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 From the beginning, it was recognised that “agents” were not a homogenous category and that there were different classes of agents. <span class="font-italic">Stoljar</span> notes as follows (at p 2):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there are professional middlemen like the factor and broker mainly concerned with market exchanges, and there are organisational agents such as a manager, a director or a salesman who help in the functioning of larger commercial concerns, whether a firm or a company, a shop or an office.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 <span class="font-italic">Stoljar</span> also makes clear that the “<span class="font-italic">professional middlemen</span> like the factor and broker” [emphasis added] were among the “most important agents” (at p 2). Other historical commentators were of the same view. For instance, William Paley wrote an early treatise on the law of agency in 1819 which “chiefly concern[ed] mercantile affairs” (William Paley, <span class="font-italic">A Treatise on the Law of Principal and Agent</span><span class="font-italic">: Chiefly with Reference to Mercantile Transactions </span>(Joseph Butterworth and Son, 2nd Ed, 1819) at p viii). He noted, at p 13, that “[i]n addition to the … general duties, which affect all descriptions of agents alike, there are distinct duties depending upon their respective employments: of which the present treatise chiefly concerns such as regard mercantile affairs”. Paley then went on to describe “mercantile agents” and, in particular, factors and brokers as examples of such mercantile agents. Similarly, Harold Greville Hanbury in <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Agency</span> (Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, 2nd Ed, 1960) (“<span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span>”), at p 13, identified five “important classes” of agents – factors, brokers, commission agents, <span class="font-italic">del credere </span>agents and auctioneers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 The reason for the importance of professional agents was the central role which they, and in particular factors and brokers, played in commerce. Factors were mercantile agents who, in the ordinary course of business, were entrusted with the possession of goods or the documents of title thereto (<span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span> at p 13). Brokers were analogous to factors save that they were mercantile agents who were employed to make contracts for the purchase or sale of personal property of which they <span class="font-italic">were not entrusted with possession</span>, or documents of title thereto (<span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span> at p 13). The terms were fluid, but what is clear is that these professional agents played an important role not just in facilitating the transactions of their principals, but also in providing finance and were therefore crucial to all aspects of commerce. <span class="font-italic">Munday</span> gives the example of the “Blackwell Hall factor”, in reference to factors who facilitated sales at the cloth market at Blackwell Hall. He notes that “[t]he Blackwell Hall factor of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries … presents a good example of an agent whose dominant position within his own branch of commerce led him to adopt the role of a financier” (<span class="font-italic">Munday</span> at p 231). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Likewise, when Singapore was still within the Straits Settlements, professional agents in the form of commission agents played a central role in the flourishing entrepot trade of the colony right from its founding in 1819. As chronicled by George Windsor Earl, these mercantile agents “receive[d] consignments of goods from merchants in Great Britain and [made] returns in oriental produce purchased in the settlement” (George Windsor Earl, <span class="font-italic">The Eastern Seas </span>(Wm H Allen and Co, 1837; Oxford University Press, Reprint, 1971) at p 415). They also handled the transhipment of goods between East and West, operating through the great merchant and agency houses of Singapore such as those established by Alexander Guthrie, John Purvis and Edward Boustead (Peter Drake, <span class="font-italic">Merchants, Bankers, Governors: British Enterprise in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore and Malaya 1786–1920 </span>(World Scientific, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Drake</span>”) at pp 5–14; see also the detailed academic exercise by Loh Wen Fong, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Agency Houses: 1819–1900</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1958) (unpublished academic exercise, University of Malaya in Singapore, archived at the National University of Singapore). <span class="font-italic">Drake </span>emphasises that these Singapore mercantile houses were not “mere subsidiaries or extensions of London firms or Calcutta agency houses”. Instead, they were independent and important, having strong commercial relationships with numerous Asian traders and producers in the Straits Settlements and, following the growth of banks in the Straits ports in the 1840s, frequently dealing with banks for the discounting of bills of exchange and promissory notes or seeking overdraft accommodation. Due in no small part to the influence and entrenchment of these mercantile agents, Singapore’s entrepot trade continued to flourish even after the East India Company’s monopoly in China was abolished in 1833 (<span class="font-italic">Drake </span>at pp 7–10). This stands testament to the nature of mercantile agents in the 19th century as an independent, powerful and wealthy professional class.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Focussing in greater depth on the class of “mercantile agents”, it is worth noting that, in the early 19th century, a special common law exception to the <span class="font-italic">n</span><span class="font-italic">emo dat quod non habet </span>principle was carved out for this category of agents to allow mercantile agents who, in the customary course of business as agents, had the authority to sell goods, or to consign goods for the purpose of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of goods, to give good title to a third party (<span class="font-italic">Pickering v Busk </span>(1812) 15 East 38 as cited in <span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span> at pp 14–15). As alluded to earlier at [147], this common law exception was supplemented by the enactment of the early Factors Acts which covered “agents entrusted” with property. <span class="font-italic">Despite the ostensibly wide terminology used in the early Factors Acts, the phrase “agent entrusted” was construed as </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">referring </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only to mercantile agents</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Notably, in construing the term “agent entrusted” in the Factors Act 1823, Willes J in <span class="font-italic">Heyman v Flewker </span>(1863) 143 ER 205 held that “the term ‘agent’ does not include a mere servant or care-taker, or one who has possession of goods for carriage, safe custody, or otherwise, as an independent contracting party; <span class="font-italic">but only persons whose employment correspond</span><span class="font-italic">s to that of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">some known kind of commercial agent, like that class (factors) from which the act has taken its name</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (at 209). This construction was later incorporated into the Factors Act 1889 (c 45) (UK) which was expressly limited to the “mercantile agent”. There is a telling parallel between the way in which the courts construed the wide phrase “agent entrusted” in the early Factors Acts as referring to <span class="font-italic">mercantile agents</span>, and the judicial interpretation of the similarly broad phrase “other agents” in the Embezzlement Act 1812 and the Larceny Act 1827 as referring only to <span class="font-italic">professional</span> <span class="font-italic">agents</span> (see [239]–[246] below). These cases indicate that it was well understood at the time that the word “agents”, in the commercial or business context, referred to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">professional or mercantile agents</span><span class="font-italic"> who provided services to the public as part of the emerging market economy of that era</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Our brief review of the history of professional agents therefore reveals that professional agents – which included factors, brokers and the like – were already a <span class="font-italic">recognised and distinct class of persons</span> throughout the Commonwealth when the Larceny Act provisions were first enacted by the UK Parliament in the early 19th century, and certainly by the time the Indian Penal Code was passed in 1860. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusions to be drawn from the historical material </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 From a review of the above historical material, three vital points can be distilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 <span class="font-italic">First</span>, the history of the early embezzlement provisions in the UK indicates that these provisions were <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legislated in a piecemeal fashion to capture</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">particular professions and trades</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">in response to specific cases which </span><span class="font-italic">brought about widespread public concern. </span>There is no indication from the legislative debates or the historical material that the UK Parliament intended to inculpate persons based on broad legal categories. These specific classes found their way into the provisions on aggravated CBT in the Penal Code, including s 409, through the English Digest. And it was expressly presumed by the English Law Commissioners who drafted the English Digest that the “somewhat indefinite term” “agent” used in the aggravated offence of CBT would be interpreted in its statutory context and “restrained to other agents, <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>with those specified” (see [189] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 <span class="font-italic">Second</span>, CBT by <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">directors</span> was only first criminalised in the UK when the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</span> was enacted. However, as we have explained at [215]–[216] above, there was a sharp historical disconnect between the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857 and the Indian Penal Code. Accordingly, it could not have been intended by the Indian Law Commissioners that directors and other officers of body corporates were to fall within s 409 as “agents”. This is also evident from the lack of any reference to company directors in the Penal Code. There was also no reference in the English Digest or in the earlier UK statutes to directors. All of this was merely a corollary of the fact that the special position of company directors, and the “new evil” arising from the misuse and abuse of the joint-stock company, had not yet surfaced in the public consciousness. As described at [198]–[208] above, this became a public concern only in 1856, following the collapse of the Royal British Bank. The Indian Penal Code, in contrast, was based on the state of English law <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prior to</span><span class="font-italic"> the enactment </span><span class="font-italic">of the Punishment of Frauds Act 1857</span>, at a time<span class="font-italic"> </span>when only CBT by “agents for hire” was covered by statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 <span class="font-italic">Third</span>, the Indian Penal Code and the earlier UK Embezzlement Act provisions were enacted at a time when professional agents, which included factors, brokers and the like, were a<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> recognised and distinct class of persons</span><span class="font-italic"> who provided agency services to the public</span>. Therefore, as the English cases on the early Factors Acts as well as on the Embezzlement Act 1812 and the Larceny Act 1827 indicate (see [239]–[246] below), it was readily understood at the time that the ostensibly broad references to “agents” in these Acts had to be construed purposively as referring to professional or mercantile agents who provided commercial services to the community at large as part of the emerging market economy of that era. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 These points, both individually and taken together, support the textual analysis of s 409 set out in the earlier part of our judgment. In other words, the extraneous material <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">confirms</span><span class="font-italic">, pursuant to </span><span class="font-italic">s 9A(2)(</span>a<span class="font-italic">) of the IA, that the meaning of </span><span class="font-italic">s 409</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is the ordinary meaning</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">conveyed by the text of the provision</span>, taking into account its context in the CBT provisions of the Penal Code and the purpose or object underlying the provision. The history also readily explains why the phrase “in the way of his business” is employed in s 409 (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as a reference to commercial activity), and reinforces the need for the term “agent” to be read <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span>. Finally, on the crucial issue of legislative purpose, the historical material on s 409 and the related embezzlement provisions unequivocally indicate that the provision was intended to capture not any legal agent, but <span class="font-italic">only</span> professional agents, who played an important role in commercial life by providing services to the public at large, and who were entrusted with property in the way of their businesses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Principle against doubtful penalisation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The respondents advocated the application of the “strict construction rule” (also known as the principle against doubtful penalisation) in the event that ambiguity persisted in the proper interpretation of the disputed phrase, arguing that the application of the rule “would mandate that the Court gives the benefit of [the] doubt to the accused”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The principle against doubtful penalisation and its applicability as an interpretive canon in Singapore law was fully discussed by V K Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng</span>”) at [30]–[38] (which was endorsed by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Nam Hong Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 604 (“<span class="font-italic">Nam </span><span class="font-italic">Hong</span>”) at [28]). Rajah JA reviewed the historical origins of the principle and how the rule has been regarded in more recent times, observing (at [33]) that in the modern era “[c]ourts have often declined to apply the strict construction rule in its absolute form, and have instead adopted a purposive and broader interpretation of penal statutes, even when such an interpretation proves to be detrimental to an accused”. While the principle “remains an integral part of the collective principles and policies which the courts draw upon in the construction of penal provisions”, its application is subject to one important constraint – it applies only as <span class="font-italic">a “tool of last resort”</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng </span>at [35] (citing <span class="font-italic">Forward Food Management Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 443 at [26])).

The court’s first duty is to interpret the statutory provision purposively as a means to give effect to Parliament’s intention. Any other principle or canon of statutory interpretation in the common law, no matter how well-established or how distinguished its pedigree, can only be of secondary importance in comparison to this statutory duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In the present context, we have explained our finding that the phrase “in the way of his business as … an agent” not only has a <span class="font-italic">clear ordinary meaning</span> (see [165] above) but that the historical background of s 409 and the other CBT provisions in the Penal Code also <span class="font-italic">confirms</span> that the drafters intended those words to convey that ordinary meaning (see [232] above). In the circumstances, we are of the view that there is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> “genuine ambiguity” </span>(to use the language of <span class="font-italic">Nam Hong</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the proper construction of the disputed phrase.

As Rajah JA emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng </span>at [35], the rule against doubtful penalisation is “by no means purely a relic of the past”; “in its qualified and less rigid form, [the rule] remains an integral part of the collective principles and policies which the courts draw upon in the construction of penal provisions”. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Bennion </span>describes the rule as “a principle of legal policy” that “belongs to the common law and prevails in all common law countries” (at p 749). It is a rule with ancient origins, introduced in order to alleviate the heavy punishments for serious crimes in the 15th century following the legislative ousting of the benefit of clergy defence (see <span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng </span>at [32]). Although the historical justification of the rule has since faded into oblivion, it continues to exert a strong pull on the mind of the court given the gravity of penal consequences for accused persons. In the context of the present case, these penal consequences consist of the significantly higher maximum sentence for the offence under s 409 as compared to that under s 406 (see [29] above<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">). Accordingly, if we had found that the principles of statutory interpretation discussed above yielded no clear answer, we would have been satisfied that the rule against doubtful penalisation thereby assumed primacy as the governing interpretive principle and that it militated in favour of the narrower interpretation of an “agent” advocated by the respondents.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judicial interpretation of s 409 and analogous provisions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 Having analysed both the text and context of s 409, we turn to consider how the courts have construed the provision, including the related UK embezzlement provisions outlined above.

The accused person was charged under s 1 of the Embezzlement Act 1812 which (it will be recalled) covered “Banker or Bankers, Merchant or Merchants, Broker or Brokers, Attorney or Attornies, <span class="font-italic">or Agent or Agents of any Description whatsoever</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 It is significant that despite the extreme width of the statutory language (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the phrase “Agents of any Description whatsoever”) – which is far wider than the language in s 409 of the Penal Code – Lord Abbott CJ considered that it was of the first importance to have regard to the<span class="font-italic"> specific references to bankers, merchants and so on </span>in construing the provision. He held that “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if [the section] had been intended to comprehend… deposits for any purposes … all the preceding words, “banker, merchant, &amp;c.” would have been unnecessary, and might have been omitted</span>” [emphasis added]. Lord Abbott CJ therefore found that legislature intended to confine the statute to “persons who, in the exercise of their functions, receive securities and afterwards embezzle them” (at 22). In particular, the provision did not include the parties in the case who were merely friends, accustomed to accommodate each other. Consequently, the accused person was acquitted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 <span class="font-italic">Prince </span>is therefore a case that buttresses the view that the term “agent” must be construed in the light of the preceding words “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney”. The importance of applying<span class="font-italic"> </span>a contextual approach to statutory interpretation, having regard to the language of the provision as a whole, was not lost on Lord Abbott CJ. Indeed, as will be seen, this interpretive technique was employed consistently thereafter by the English courts in construing the provision and its equivalents. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 The next significant case is <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>, in which the case of <span class="font-italic">Prince </span>was applied to s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861. The decision has already been discussed above at [128]–[129]. As explained, the English High Court applied the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle to the word “Agent” in the phrase “a Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or other Agent”. It was thus held that the word was intended to include only agents who carry on the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">business or profession</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">of receiving property for safe custody or other special purpose</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span>Once again, this is a decision that supports the majority’s analysis of s 409.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 We have explained at [151]–[156] above that the English High Court’s reliance on the words “or other agent” within s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 was <span class="font-italic">only an additional ground</span> for reaching its decision that the accused did not fall within the scope of the provision. It relied primarily on the fact that “Banker, Merchant, Broker or Attorney” preceded the reference to “or other Agent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 For similar reasons, we reject any attempt to rationalise <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span> and the other relevant UK cases on the basis that those cases <span class="font-italic">merely concerned casual or </span>ad hoc<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">agents</span>. While we may accept that the accused persons in those cases may be described as casual agents, this is a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">factual</span> observation which does <span class="font-italic">not</span> affect the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">reasoning</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>. As elaborated upon above, the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span> applied the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>principle and surveyed the other relevant embezzlement provisions on clerks, servants and the like and concluded that the word “agent” in s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 “<span class="font-italic">means </span><span class="font-italic">one whose </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">business or profession</span><span class="font-italic"> it is to receive money, securities, or chattels for safe custody or other special purpose</span><span class="font-italic">; and that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the term does not include a person who carries on no such business or profession, or the like</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (see passage cited at [128] above). We acknowledge that toward the end of that passage, the court did refer to casual agents “who may happen from time to time to undertake some fiduciary position, whether for money or otherwise”. But this reference was made only to contrast casual agents with <span class="font-italic">professional</span> agents. It was immediately preceded by the court’s pronouncement that s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 “<span class="font-italic">is aimed at </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">those classes who carry on the occupations or similar occupations to those mentioned</span><span class="font-italic"> in the section, and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not at those who carry on no such occupation</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. In other words, the English High Court emphasised that the focus of the analysis was on <span class="font-italic">whether the accused was engaged in the particular trades, professions or occupations</span> identified in the provision. The language and reasoning of the court simply could not be any clearer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Finally, we note that the court in <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>construed the word “agent” in s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 as referring to professional agents <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">even though s</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> 75 did not contain the phrase “in the way of his business” when referring to bankers, merchants and so on, unlike s 409 </span>(and likewise the corresponding provision in the Indian Penal Code). As the majority of the High Court in the present case noted, the fact that the phrase “in the way of his business” was expressly included in s 409 by the drafters of the Penal Code demonstrates, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, that “agent” in s 409 was intended to refer only to professional agents, given that the English courts drew a distinction between professional and casual agents even without the need for the phrase (MA Judgment at [108]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) <span class="font-italic">Kane</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span> was cited and applied later in <span class="font-italic">The Queen</span><span class="font-italic"> v Kane</span> [1901] 1 QB 472 (“<span class="font-italic">Kane</span>”). That was a case in which the accused person was a conjuror and thought-reader by trade. He received a cheque from the victim for the purpose of paying a deposit for shares in a railway company, but cashed the cheque and misappropriated the proceeds. He was also charged under s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861. Lord Alverstone CJ held (at 475), in his favour, that the section “does not apply to any person who happens to act on behalf of another; it applies only to <span class="font-italic">agents of the class indicated in the preceding words of the section</span>” [emphasis added]. Once again, the focus was on the <span class="font-italic">specific classes of persons</span> identified within the provision. The accused person, who was engaged in an <span class="font-italic">unrelated business or profession</span>, did not fall within any of those classes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Amendments to the Larceny Act 1861 in 1901</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 The above was the established position under the Larceny Act 1861. Over time, it led to dissatisfaction and, eventually, the passing of the Larceny Act 1901, which we briefly referred to earlier (at [219] above). As we have explained, the Larceny Act 1901 generalised the crime of embezzlement in the UK and removed the requirement, in ss 75 and 76 of the Larceny Act 1861, for the offender to have acted as “a Banker, Merchant, Broker, Attorney, or other Agent”. In introducing the proposed amendments in Parliament, the then UK Attorney-General, Sir Robert Finlay, made the following observations (United Kingdom, House of Commons, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> (3 May 1901) vol 93 at cols 621–623): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law on the subject is at present contained in Sections 75 and 76 of the Act [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Larceny Act 1861], and I do not think I am using language too strong when I say that these sections have long been the opprobrium of our criminal law. Confused and overlapping as they are, they are unable to deal with the worst cases. <span class="font-italic">This may be explained by the fact that these enactments have gradually grown; they have been passed to meet particular cases, instead of being prepared on a principle.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are three principal blots in the statute. In a great many cases there can be no conviction unless there have been directions in writing, and in cases which have unfortunately been so frequently before the public, where solicitors are concerned, it often rested with the solicitors to say whether directions should be so drawn up. If there were none, the solicitor would appropriate the money with impunity. In the second place, it has been held that the sections do not apply to the cases of those who are agents to receive as distinguished from agents to pay. <span class="font-italic">Thirdly, it has been held </span><span class="font-italic">[that] the sections, which enumerate a number of specific cases of agents, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only apply to persons who are agents </span><span class="font-weight-bold">ejusdem generis</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> There was a case</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>]<span class="font-italic"> in which a conjuror by profession induced a woman to invest in shares, and he misappropriated the money, but escaped conviction on the ground that his ordinary business was that of a conjuror, and that he only casually acted as an agent.</span> This Bill proposes to repeal the sections altogether, and to substitute a short and clear enactment rendering punishable all classes of fraudulent misappropriation of property entrusted to or received by an agent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">During the second reading of the Bill, Sir Robert similarly noted that the amendments were necessary “to remove the blots upon that portion of the law which dealt with the offence of misappropriation by persons entrusted with property by others” and that “no good reason could be given for <span class="font-italic">the state of the law which declared that only </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">agents by profession</span><span class="font-italic"> should be amenable</span> to the provisions of the sections” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (United Kingdom, House of Commons, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> (10 June 1901) vol 94 at cols 1544–1545). So it is clear that the UK Parliament was cognisant of, and prompted by, the deficiencies in the earlier provisions of the Larceny Act 1861 which were brought to light by cases such as <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>and <span class="font-italic">Kane</span>. <span class="font-italic">It is critical, however, to note that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">this change in the law </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">required legislative amendment</span><span class="font-italic"> to the language of s </span><span class="font-italic">75 of the Larceny Act 1861.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decisions from other jurisdictions on s 409 and its equivalents</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Privy Council on appeal from Ceylon – <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 The first case in which the language of s 409 was considered in detail by an appellate court was the decision of the Privy Council, on appeal from the Ceylon courts, in <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. The appellant in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>was the president of the Salpiti Korale Union, a body which supplied goods to retail stores of the Union through wholesale depots. He was also president of the sub-committee which controlled one of the depots, and vice-president of the bank which provided advances to member business societies to enable them to buy the goods. The normal practice was for the bank to receive weekly repayments for those advances by the member business societies, and for the bank then to pay in the money orders, cheques or cash received to its account with the Bank of Ceylon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 The appellant secured the appointment of a certain individual to be the manager of the depot controlled by his sub-committee. According to the prescribed routine, the manager was to collect payments of sums due from that depot and deposit those monies with the bank. Instead, the appellant instructed the manager to collect large sums from the retail stores in cash and hand them directly to him to be transmitted to the bank. Thereafter, rather than paying those sums to the bank, the appellant appropriated the cash and substituted for it his own cheques for the amount due. In addition, the appellant, acting as vice-president of the bank, ensured that in many instances (35 in total) those cheques were not forwarded to the Bank of Ceylon for collection. In the result, the appellant was found to have misappropriated a sum of Rs 57,500. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 The appellant was convicted by the Supreme Court of Ceylon of the offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent under s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code (which carries the same language as s 409). The Court of Criminal Appeal of Ceylon dismissed the appeal, and the appellant brought a further appeal to the Privy Council. The appellant argued that the offence under s 392 was “limited to the case of one who carries on an agency business and does not comprehend a man who is casually entrusted with money either on one individual occasion or, indeed, on a number of occasions, provided that the evidence does not establish that he carries on an agency business”. He submitted that the phrase “in the way of his business” within s 392 excluded the possibility of anyone who does not carry on an agency business from coming within the section. Further, such a reading was in conformity with the general scheme of similar offences found in ss 390–392 of the Ceylon Penal Code, each of which referred to particular classes of persons such as carriers, wharfingers, clerks, servants, bankers, merchants and so on (<span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>at 415–416).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 The Privy Council allowed the appeal. Lord Porter, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, noted (at 417) that the issue was “fully argued” before the Court of Criminal Appeal in Ceylon, which rejected the appellant’s argument. Lord Porter referred with approval to <span class="font-italic">Prince, Portugal </span>and <span class="font-italic">Kane</span>, and relied in particular on the reasons given in <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>in allowing the appeal. He went on to find (at 419) that the Privy Council should adopt the construction put upon those words by the English courts, given that that construction reflected “a long-established decision as to a particular section of an Act of Parliament, and even more so where there has been a series of decisions over a period of years”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 Finally, Lord Porter observed (at 419–420) that the appellant was “in no sense entitled to receive the money entrusted to him in any capacity, nor, indeed, had [the manager] authority to make him agent to hand it over to the bank”. In the circumstances, the Privy Council allowed the appeal, discharged the conviction under s 392, and substituted it for a conviction under s 389 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the offence of<span class="font-italic"> </span>CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 The majority of the High Court in the present case explained that, from its reading of <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>, “the Privy Council’s holding was that in order for an accused to be convicted of the aggravated offence of CBT as an agent, the accused <span class="font-italic">must be in the profession, trade or business as an agent</span> (which [the majority] hereinafter refer[red] as a “<span class="font-italic">professional agent</span>” in short) and must be entrusted with property in that capacity” [emphasis added] (MA Judgment at [97]). It noted at [98] that the courts in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> considered that the reason why the Privy Council acquitted the accused in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>was “<span class="font-italic">not</span> because the accused was not a <span class="font-italic">professional </span>agent but was instead because the accused had not been entrusted with the moneys in any capacity and certainly not in the course of the duties that he had to discharge as the office-bearer of the various institutions he was in charge of” [emphasis in original]. The majority then expressed its disagreement (at [99]) with such a reading of <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. It took the view that “the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>had applied its mind to – and was addressing – the question of <span class="font-italic">whether an accused had to be a professional agent</span> before he could be caught under s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code” [emphasis added]. The Ceylonese courts in <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span> had convicted the accused because they took the position that the accused did not have to be a professional agent in order to be liable under s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code. The arguments of counsel before the Privy Council centred on this issue, as did the Privy Council’s eventual analysis. The majority surmised that “the holding [of the Privy Council] in <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>was that s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code applied only to <span class="font-italic">professional </span>agents in the sense of agents who are engaged in a <span class="font-italic">business </span>of agency, and not persons who only casually acted as agents” [emphasis in original]. The Privy Council “might have gone further when it observed (at 419–420) that factually, the accused was ‘in no sense entitled to receive the money entrusted to him in any capacity’ nor was he made an agent to hand over the moneys to the bank, but this did not detract from or undermine its earlier holding in respect of the legal requirements of the section”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 We agree with the majority’s reading of <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>. The Privy Council’s decision was <span class="font-italic">primarily</span> based on its agreement with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>, from which Lord Porter (who delivered the judgment of the Board) quoted extensively (<span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>at 418). Lord Porter considered the reasoning in that case to be “<span class="font-italic">directly applicable</span> <span class="font-italic">to the case under consideration</span>, subject to such immaterial variations as the provisions of the [Ceylon Penal Code and the Larceny Act 1861] require[d]” [emphasis added]. He further observed that <span class="font-italic">Portugal </span>was “a long-established decision as to a particular section of an Act of Parliament”, and that there was indeed “a series of decisions over a period of years” to the same effect. It was only toward the end of the Privy Council’s grounds that Lord Porter found that the accused was “in no sense entitled to receive the money entrusted to him in any capacity, nor, indeed, had [the manager] authority to make him agent to hand [the cash] over to the bank”. In the circumstances, we have little doubt that the Privy Council had fully considered the question of whether s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code applied only to persons engaged in certain specified businesses or professions, and expressed unreserved agreement with the conclusion of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Portugal</span>, which answered that question in the affirmative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 The corollary is that the minority of the High Court in this case was, with respect, incorrect to state that “when the full facts of <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>are considered, … the issue before the Privy Council was whether the accused could be sentenced under s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code when the charge against him was for misappropriating moneys entrusted to him <span class="font-italic">by the manager of the </span><span class="font-italic">depot </span>in circumstances where, according to the prescribed procedure, the manager should not have done so” [emphasis in original] (MA Judgment at [451]). As explained above, this misses the main thrust of the Privy Council’s reasoning and instead focuses on a tangential and secondary finding made only towards the end of the Privy Council’s judgment. For these reasons, we likewise disagree with the Prosecution’s argument that the minority’s reading of <span class="font-italic">Cooray </span>should be accepted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) India – <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 We briefly turn again to <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>, the facts and decision of which we have described at [86]–[90] above and which we have also discussed at various points in the preceding analysis. We have explained in full at [91]–[93] above why we respectfully disagree with the Supreme Court of India’s <span class="font-italic">textual</span> analysis of the expression “in the way of his business” as “in connection with his duties”, and we do not propose to reiterate our analysis here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 In addition, it should also be noted that the Supreme Court of India in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span> did not consider the relevant <span class="font-italic">context</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the legislative history and background of s 409), which plainly runs contrary to the interpretation of the provision which was adopted in that case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Malaysia – <span class="font-italic">Periasamy</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 This was a decision of the Malaysian Court of Appeal. The first appellant was chief executive and a member of the board of directors of a co-operative society. The first appellant approved a loan to a certain individual. One of the conditions for the grant of the loan expressed in the offer was that the borrower was to deposit, by way of a pledge, four million shares in a particular company. It transpired that those shares were not deposited when the loan was released. After the release of the loan, the bank’s management committee met and decided to dispense with the condition that required the deposit of the shares. The first appellant was charged for committing criminal breach of trust as an agent under s 409 of the Malaysian Penal Code (FMS Cap 45) (“the Malaysian Penal Code”). That provision was <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 409 of our Penal Code, but was amended in 1993 to replace the relevant part of the section from “in his capacity of a public servant, or in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” to simply “<span class="font-italic">in his capacity of a public servant o</span><span class="font-italic">r an agent</span>”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 A separate section, s 402A, was also enacted in the Malaysian Penal Code to provide definitions to various terms used in the Penal Code, including the word “agent”. The definition of “agent” in the provision expressly included a broad range of classes of persons, <span class="font-italic">including directors</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>The word “director” itself was also given a specific definition. Section 402A of the Malaysian Penal Code provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Definition of “agent”, “company”, “director” and “officer”</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">402A. </span>For the purposes of sections 403, 404, 305, 406, 407, 408, 409 … of this Chapter, unless the contrary appears from the context:<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“agent”</span> includes any corporation or other person acting or having been acting or desirous or intending to act for or on behalf of any company or other person whether as agent, partner, co-owner, clerk, servant, employee, banker, broker, auctioneer, architect, clerk of works, engineer, advocate and solicitor, accountant, auditor, surveyor, buyer, salesman, trustee executor, administrator, liquidator, trustee within the meaning of any Act relating to trusteeship or bankruptcy, receiver, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">director, manager or other officer of any company, club, partnership or association</span><span class="font-italic"> or in any other capacity either alone or jointly with any other person</span>, and whether in his own name or in the name of his principal or not; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“director” includes any person occupying the position of director of a company, by whatever name called, and includes a person who acts or issues directions or instructions in a manner in which directors of a company are accustomed to issue or act, and includes an alternate or substitute director, notwithstanding any defect in the appointment or qualification of such person; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 <span class="font-italic">Periasamy</span>, however, was based on s 409 as it stood <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">before</span> the 1993 amendment to the Malaysian Penal Code. In construing the pre-amendment provision, the Malaysian Court of Appeal remarked as follows (at 571): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The amendments made by Parliament to the section in 1993 have no application to these appeals as they came into force well after the alleged commission of the offences with which the appellants were charged.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It may be seen at once that the section [<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>s 409] is in two parts. The first part applies in cases where there has been entrustment of property or its dominion to a person – to quote the words of the section – ‘in his capacity of a public servant’. The second part of the section applies to cases of entrustment to a category of persons, including an agent – again to quote the section – ‘in the way of his business’. Thus, <span class="font-italic">the word ‘capacity’ applies to a public servant but not to an agent</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That <span class="font-italic">the bifurcation we have alluded to existed in the section as it was previously cast</span> [<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>prior to the 1993 amendments] was given judicial recognition by the (then) Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Yap Sing Hock &amp; Anor v PP </span>[1992] 2 MLJ 714.

Sin Chew held 3,000 shares in Modern Housing Development Pte Ltd (“Modern Housing”), a company in which the appellant was also a subscriber. The subscribers and directors of Sin Chew and Modern Housing reached an agreement with the Income Tax Department to pay $7.5m including penalties in exchange for the Comptroller’s undertaking not to prosecute the subscribers and directors and the two companies for tax evasion. Thereafter, the board of directors of Sin Chew passed a resolution that the 3,000 shares in Modern Housing be sold at par value, but without stating the names of the purchaser or prospective purchaser. Those shares were then sold at par and transferred to the appellant’s nephew and family. The appellant was convicted of three charges for the offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent under s 409 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 One of the submissions made by counsel for the appellant was that the Prosecution had failed to prove that the appellant carried on business as a mercantile agent, and therefore the appellant had not been entrusted property “in the way of his business as an agent”. F A Chua J referred to <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span> before turning to <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>. Chua J expressed his agreement (at [25]) with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span> and held (at [27]) that “[t]he reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>’s case makes it clear that <span class="font-italic">Cooray</span>’s case can be and was accordingly distinguished”. He did not, however, provide any further elaboration. He proceeded to state at [30] that the appellant was “at all material times a director and agent of both the companies, Sin Chew and Modern Housing” and that the appellant “received the 3,000 Modern Housing shares in his capacity as agent”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 On the facts, Chua J found (at [59]) that the appellant knew at the time he sold the Modern Housing shares that those shares were worth substantially more than par value, and concluded that the district judge rightly found the appellant guilty on all three charges against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Although <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>is a longstanding decision, we note, with respect, that its sole basis as authority on this point of law was Chua J’s agreement with the views expressed in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>. This<span class="font-italic"> </span>means that the correctness of the decision stands or falls with that of <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span> which, as we have explained, is flawed both as a matter of interpretation of the language of the provision as well as its compatibility with the legislative history. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 Indeed, we should point out that the Judge at first instance in the present case found that there was some room for speculation as to the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>(see [22] above).<span class="font-italic"> </span>He noted, rightly in our view, that the case could be read as authority for the extremely broad proposition that “if one is an agent … and one is entrusted with property in one’s capacity as agent, that would be entrustment in the way of one’s business as agent” (Conviction GD at [120]). The broad interpretation of s 409 preferred in <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span>, if accepted, would mean that <span class="font-italic">even </span>ad hoc<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">and casual agents will fall within the provision</span>, which is a position that even the minority in the High Court and the Prosecution saw as untenable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 We agree with the majority of the High Court that the longstanding nature of the interpretation of s 409 adopted in <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> is simply <span class="font-italic">not</span> a justifiable reason for upholding that decision. First, <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah </span>has never been considered in detail by this Court, until the present. In fact, it was not scrutinised in any subsequent High Court authority until the present case. Hence, limited weight can be given to its longstanding nature. In any event, and as the majority held in the MA Judgment at [111], “if an interpretation of a statutory provision is erroneous, <span class="font-italic">especially where the provision imposes </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">criminal liability</span>, <span class="font-italic">it must be corrected </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">notwithstanding how entrenched it may have become</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. This is a point of the first importance and we pause to highlight its significance. To persist in applying an incorrect interpretation of a statutory provision, particularly a penal provision, because that error has not been rectified for a long time, in circumstances where the court’s eyes have been opened to the error, is not only to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">perpetuate</span><span class="font-italic"> error without proper basis</span>, it would also involve the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conscious</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">compounding</span><span class="font-italic"> of such error </span>and – perhaps even more crucially – amount to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">judicial usurpation of legislative decision-making</span>, given that the court is deliberately preferring an interpretation of the provision that it knows does not reflect Parliament’s intention in enacting that provision. Accordingly, the court <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> close its eyes to an erroneous interpretation of a statutory provision. We thus agree with the majority of the High Court that <span class="font-italic">Tay Choo Wah</span> was wrongly decided, and should no longer be followed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Yew</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Yew </span>is another decision of the Singapore High Court. The accused was charged under s 409 of the Penal Code for committing CBT “in the way of his business as an attorney”, essentially for using some sums of money entrusted to him for his own purposes. His defence at trial was that the term “attorney” in s 409 referred to a person who was “delegated to do something in the absence of the appointer” and did not include an advocate and solicitor. Lee Seiu Kin J observed that s 409 of the Penal Code was <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 409 of the Indian Penal Code and decided (at [96]) that the meaning of “attorney” in the latter Code might be instructive in determining the meaning of the same word in the former Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 Lee J referred to <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Dhirajlal’s The Indian Penal Code </span>(V R Manohar gen ed) (LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur, 33rd Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span>”), which defined “attorney” (at p 883) as “one who is appointed by another to do something in his absence, and who has authority to act in the place and turn of him by whom he is delegated”. He also noted (at [99]) that in <span class="font-italic">Gour</span>, the author adopted a “twofold” definition of “attorney”:<span class="font-italic"> </span>(a) a “private attorney” who is “one who holds a power of attorney and who is appointed by another to transact any business for him”; and (b) a “public attorney” who is an “attorney-at-law [which] connotes one who is a practitioner in a court of law, who is among a class of lawyers”. The author also remarked that in England, since 1873, “attorneys are by statute called solicitors”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 Lee J found (at [99]) that since the term “attorney” was “broad enough to encompass <span class="font-italic">both </span>the ‘private’ and ‘public’ aspects” [emphasis in original], the accused, as an advocate and solicitor, would be caught within the ambit of s 409. He further held (at [100]) that given that prior to 1873, the understanding of the word “attorney” in England would correspond to that of a “solicitor”, and the Indian Penal Code was enacted before 1873, the drafters would have relied on the pre-1873 understanding of “attorney” as including a solicitor. Finally, he found (at [101]) that this view of “attorney” is “consistent with the framework of the Penal Code”, and proceeded to observe as follows (at [103]–[104]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">103 In my view, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the mischief that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s 409 targets is the commission of CBT by persons who perform certain trusted trades, when they act in the way of their business</span>. As stated in Gour at p 4037: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">‘Banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent’</span>: All these persons are trusted agents employed by the public in their various businesses. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Where it is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">normal for the public to rely on a person’s trade as a mark of his trustworthiness and integrity</span><span class="font-italic">, and where such trust facilitates commercial transactions</span>, it is important that such transactions are above board. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A commission of CBT </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by a person in the performance of his trade would shake the confidence of the public in those trades and impede the ability of persons in such trades to serve the public</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> A breach of trust in such circumstances “may have severe … public repercussions” (see Butterworth’s commentary at p 621). Therefore, s 409 provides that CBT committed in the capacity of a public servant or in the way of business of a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent, would be punished more severely than CBT committed by persons who are trusted on an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>basis under s 406.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">104 The practice of law has long been held to be <span class="font-italic">an honourable profession</span> in which absolute trust in the integrity of its practitioners is essential not only for the administration of justice but also to the smooth operation of the wheels of commerce.

The only decision which is out of step with this clear line of authority is that of the Supreme Court of India in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia</span>. But as we have elaborated in detail at [89]–[93] above, the Indian Supreme Court’s superficially attractive interpretation of “in the way of his business” ultimately proves to be unsustainable and consequently cannot be accepted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The limits of the purposive approach to statutory interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 The final part of our analysis concerns the Prosecution’s arguments based on fairness and public policy. In essence, the Prosecution focuses on what it deems to be the absurdity and injustice which would result if directors and officers of charities and societies, including the respondents in the present case, are not inculpated under s 409. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 Specifically, the Prosecution argues that the majority’s analysis would result in illogical and absurd situations such as where a chairman or managing director of a company would be subject to a lower maximum punishment for committing CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter </span>(under s 406) than a secretary or office boy who would be liable for the aggravated punishment prescribed in s 408 of the Penal Code. Another example provided is a professional liquidator who is appointed as the company’s legal agent in a members’ or creditors’ voluntary winding up. The professional liquidator would fall within the scope of s 409, unlike a director who is appointed to act as a liquidator in a voluntary winding up, despite the fact that the professional liquidator exercises the very same powers as the board of directors. Put simply, it is argued that a narrow reading of s 409 would produce a lacuna in the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 As we mentioned at the beginning of this judgment (see [7] above), we readily acknowledge that in the modern context, where directors of companies and officers of charities and societies play key roles in the lives of companies and the economy as a whole, there does not appear to be a good policy reason to ignore their heightened culpability and the enhanced potential for harm were they to commit CBT. To use the language that we adopted in our introduction to this judgment, there is a <span class="font-italic">strong and urgent impulse</span> to ensure that persons in such positions of responsibility are made to undergo a sentence that reflects the full measure of their harm and culpability. But we have also explained that the court <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">cannot</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">arrogate to itself the legislative function</span> <span class="font-italic">that belongs exclusively to Parliament</span> by adding to or taking away from language in a statutory provision in a manner that goes beyond the boundaries of what is permissible in statutory construction. The impulse to see crime punished to what the court considers to be the appropriate extent <span class="font-italic">cannot</span>, within the tenets of our constitutional framework, be permitted to surge beyond the borders of the judicial function. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 In the present context, the key question for this Court<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>is whether this perceived lacuna in the CBT provisions of the Penal Code can and ought to be plugged by adopting the Prosecution’s suggested interpretation of s 409 of the Penal Code, or whether this Court should leave the task of law reform to Parliament. As a matter of constitutional principle and public policy, we are firmly of the view that, in the present case, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the shaping of a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> remedy </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">should be left to Parliament</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 In so far as the Prosecution’s submission is concerned, we begin by cautioning against reasoning backwards from specific (and, in particular, extreme) hypothetical examples. As the Prosecution accepts, the <span class="font-italic">objective</span> and <span class="font-italic">purposive</span> approach to statutory interpretation must take precedence. More importantly, a closer examination of s 409 indicates that the perceived injustice and “gaps” in the law arising from the dated nature of the provision will not only remain but will even be exacerbated if it is construed as liberally as the Prosecution proposes. The reason is that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s 409</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">will</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> remain both </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">over-</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">inclusive</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">under</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">-inclusive</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> even if the Prosecution's wide definition of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s 409 as referring to any legal agent is adopted</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 This is a consequence of the fact that there are limits to how effectively the “purposive approach” to statutory interpretation can be used to achieve desired outcomes. More fundamentally, it highlights that there are real constraints on the institutional ability of the courts to give effect to preferred policy outcomes through the means of statutory interpretation, even if an overly liberal approach to such interpretation is adopted. Put another way, <span class="font-italic">there are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">limits</span><span class="font-italic"> to statutory interpretation as a technique to fashion and promote policy. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 The reason why the wide definition of s 409 would be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">over-</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">inclusive</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is because legal agents (even excluding <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>and casual agents) constitute an extremely broad category that encompasses not only directors and officers of body corporates, but <span class="font-italic">also </span><span class="font-italic">low level workers</span> who are, for instance, given regular responsibilities to buy office supplies for the company. We think it most unlikely that the legislature would have intended that persons of such varying stature be subject to the same potential enhanced penalties under s 409, the maximum of which is <span class="font-italic">life imprisonment</span>. The extreme breadth of the category of legal agents would also mean that there would be a substantial overlap between the persons who are liable for the aggravated offence in s 409 and those who are liable merely for the offence of CBT <span class="font-italic">simpliciter </span>under s 406, since the class of persons who are entrusted with property or dominion over it but not on a casual or <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>basis is a very wide one. Consequently, if such a broad reading were taken, it would become critical as a matter of policy to reconsider the punishment provisions provided in s 409, in particular whether the maximum term of life imprisonment is warranted for <span class="font-italic">all</span> persons falling within the provision. This recalibration of the punishment provisions is plainly something that the courts cannot do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 On the other end of the spectrum, we consider that even if s 409 were read as broadly as the Prosecution proposes, its inculpatory scope would still be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">under</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">-inclusive</span> as there remain many significant categories of persons deserving of greater punishment who would not come within the provision. Trustees are the most notable example. It is well-established that although agents and trustees have many similarities, the two roles are conceptually distinct. An agent acts for another while a trustee holds property for another as principal, not as agent, but subject of course to equitable obligations (see <span class="font-italic">Bowstead </span><span class="font-italic">and Reynolds </span>at para 1-028). Hence, in a future case, if offenders in the respondents’ position are entrusted with funds, not as board members of their organisation, but as trustees, then the problem of a lacuna in the law would once again arise. This problem, however, does not arise in other jurisdictions such as Malaysia where the legislature has reformed their equivalent of s 409 by specifically enacting a broad provision, tailored for the modern commercial context, which targets (amongst others) trustees, directors and managers or other officers of any company, club, partnership or association (see [259] above). A sweeping reform that is carried out following a careful and comprehensive evaluation of the classes of persons who are deserving of enhanced criminal punishment is an outcome that a court simply <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> achieve through the exercise of statutory interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 Accordingly, we are of the view that even a broad interpretation of “in the way of his business as … an agent” in s 409 would leave the law in an unsatisfactory state. This is a consequence of the dated nature of the provision and the piecemeal fashion in which CBT by various classes of persons was criminalised, leading up to the enactment of s 409 as part of the Indian Penal Code in 1860. Filling the specific lacuna in relation to directors, which has been brought to light in this case, through a strained application of interpretative principles would only represent a proverbial papering over of part of the conceptual cracks and shortcomings in s 409 that have accrued over the last century and a half, and which continue to widen as socio-economic conditions evolve. This is an endeavour that simply <span class="font-italic">cannot be sustained</span> as disputes arising from the increasingly inadequate nature of s 409 continue to come before the courts. We therefore conclude that the best course to take is to allow Parliament rather than the courts to intervene. The courts are ill-suited, and lack the institutional legitimacy, to undertake the kind of wide-ranging <span class="font-italic">policy </span>review of the various classes of persons who deserve more or less punishment for committing CBT in the 21st century. In our view, such a review is not only essential but it is also long overdue. Nor is it appropriate or realistic for the court to calibrate the ranges of punishment to which these various classes of persons ought to be subjected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 Having said that, it should be remembered that the respondents in the present case are not getting away unpunished. They are facing <span class="font-italic">substantial terms of incarceration</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>which the majority of the High Court saw fit to impose after its consideration of the harm and culpability associated with the respondents’ conduct. Our fundamental consideration is that a hard case should not be allowed to make bad law – in this case, to <span class="font-italic">undermine the</span> <span class="font-italic">principle of separation of powers</span><span class="font-italic"> which is one of the very bedrocks of our Constitution</span>. The text, context, and legislative history of s 409 all support the majority’s interpretation of the provision and for this Court to now generalise “an agent” within the meaning of s 409 to encompass all legal agents would be a radical departure from legislative intent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 We end our analysis by reiterating the following cautionary words of this Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang </span>(at [189]), which we began (see [9] above), and now close, this judgment with:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">cannot – and must not</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> – assume </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legislative</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> functions which are necessarily beyond its remit. To do so would be to efface the very separation of powers which confers upon the court its </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legitimacy </span><span class="font-weight-bold">in the first place. </span>If the court were to assume legislative functions, it would no longer be able to sit to assess the legality of statutes from an<span class="font-italic"> objective </span>perspective. Worse still, it would necessarily be involved in expressing views on extra-legal issues which would – in the nature of things – be (or at least be perceived to be) <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> in nature. This would further erode the <span class="font-italic">legitimacy</span> of the court, which ought only to sit to administer the law in an<span class="font-italic"> objective </span>manner. [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the interpretation of the disputed phrase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 In conclusion, we accept and affirm the majority’s ruling that an “agent” within the meaning of s 409 of the Penal Code refers to “a professional agent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>one who professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and from which he makes his living” (MA Judgment at [103]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 First, this interpretation is supported by the language and structure of s 409 itself, which not only makes a clear distinction between the phrase “in the capacity” and “in the way of his business” but also identifies five other trades or professions alongside that of an “agent”. Second, the legislative history of the provision amply indicates that the provision was intended to be read <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>and only capture professional agents. The fact that the UK Parliament saw it fit to enact an offence specifically targeting CBT by directors is also a compelling indication that such persons were not intended to fall within the scope of the early provisions on embezzlement by bankers, merchants, brokers, factors, attorneys and other agents on which s 409 was based. Hence,<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> both the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">text</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">context</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s 409 indicate that “in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">only</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> encompasses </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">persons who are entrusted with property or dominion over it in the course of the commercial activities of their </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">trusted trades</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline"> or professions</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">–</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">including those who are in the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">business of agency</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> (</span><span class="font-weight-bold">ie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">professional agents</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.</span> In addition, an examination of the relevant authorities reveals a coherent and well-established line of authority that an “agent” within the meaning of s 409 must be an individual who is in the <span class="font-italic">business or profession</span> of providing agency services, and who receives money and other property in the way of that business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 The next question is whether the classes of persons identified in Question 2, namely directors of corporations, governing board members or key officers of a charity, and officers of a society, fall within the scope of s 409 as “agents”. This question must be answered in the <span class="font-italic">negative</span>. Following from the above analysis, such persons are not in the <span class="font-italic">business</span> of agency. Nor do they provide their services to the community at large. We accept that company directors do play a vital role in corporate governance, and consequently have a significant impact on commerce and enterprise. However, a director of a company has only one principal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>his company, and it would be a stretch to argue that he is in the <span class="font-italic">business</span> of agency even if he does receive remuneration for his services. In other words, a company director, while clearly a legal agent with onerous fiduciary duties, is not a <span class="font-italic">professional </span>agent within the object of s 409. As we have explained, this is the reason why legislative amendment was found to be necessary both in the UK and Malaysia to specifically target CBT by directors. The same difficulties arise, but <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in relation to governing board members or key officers of a charity, and officers of a society given that these persons are not even engaged in any commercial activity or business, let alone the business of agency. We are therefore led to the conclusion that directors of corporations, governing board members or key officers of a charity, and officers of a society are <span class="font-italic">not</span> “agents” within the scope of s 409. The majority of the High Court thus correctly found that the respondents cannot be convicted under s 409.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion: Our answers to the questions referred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 For the foregoing reasons, we answer the questions referred to us in the present criminal reference as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic font-underline">Answer to Question 1</span>.

Criminal Reference No 1 of 2017</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal
(delivered by Justice Andrew Phang Boon Leong):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Outcome: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Court of Appeal upholds High Court’s decision that the six leaders of City Harvest Church charged for having conspired to commit the aggravated offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent cannot be convicted of that offence.  </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>This was a reference by the Public Prosecutor of two
questions of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal for its
determination. The application arose from the prosecution of six leaders of
City Harvest Church (“CHC”), who were convicted after trial in the State Courts
in 2015. Their appeal to the High Court was decided in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Background to the application </span></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>In 2002, CHC embarked on “the Crossover”, which was a
project involving the recording of secular pop music albums as a means of
evangelical outreach. At the same time, the church was seeking suitable
premises for its activities and solicited donations for this purpose. These
donations were segregated in a Building Fund (“the BF”). After public
allegations about misuse of church funds for the Crossover, the six
respondents, who were leading members of CHC, decided to place greater distance
between the church and the Crossover by financing the Crossover through an
independent company, <span class="SpellE">Xtron</span> Productions Pte Ltd (“<span class="SpellE">Xtron</span>”), which was controlled entirely by the respondents. </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>In 2006, a decision was made to expand the scope of the
Crossover, which necessitated more funding. This was accomplished by using
monies from the BF to purchase <span class="SpellE">Xtron</span> bonds.
Subsequently, through similar arrangements, more funds from the BF were used
for the purchase of bonds of <span class="SpellE">Xtron</span> and another
company, PT <span class="GramE">The</span> First National Glassware (“<span class="SpellE">Firna</span>”), in order to finance the Crossover. In 2009, after
questions were raised by CHC’s auditors about the bond purchases, the relevant
respondents redeemed the bonds through a series of round-tripping transactions
which were not genuine commercial transactions but were, instead, intended to
create the false impression that the <span class="SpellE">Xtron</span> and <span class="SpellE">Firna</span> bonds had been redeemed through proper means.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>In 2010, the Commercial Affairs Department commenced
investigations into the transactions. The respondents were charged with having
conspired to commit the aggravated offence of CBT as an agent under s 409
of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”), for the
dishonest use of the BF to purchase the <span class="SpellE">Xtron</span> and <span class="SpellE">Firna</span> bonds as well as the subsequent round-tripping
transactions to redeem those bonds, among other charges. Section 409 of
the Penal Code (“s 409”) provides for the enhanced punishment of any
person who commits the offence of CBT in respect of property entrusted to him “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in his capacity of a public servant, or in
the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an
attorney or an agent</em>”. The charges against the respondents under s 409
were premised on the fact that three of the respondents were entrusted with the
funds in their capacity as members of the CHC management board, and were thus
“agents” of CHC.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>At first instance, the Presiding Judge of the State Courts
(“the Judge”) convicted the respondents of the charges against them at trial,
including the charges under s 409. The Judge held that the relevant
respondents were unarguably “agents” given that they were directors of the CHC
board, applying the previous decision of the High Court in in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Tay Choo <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> v Public
Prosecutor</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 725 (“<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Tay
Choo <span class="SpellE">Wah</span></em>”). Dissatisfied with the decision, the
respondents appealed. The appeal was heard by a specially convened <span class="SpellE">coram</span> of three Judges of the High Court. </span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>On appeal, a majority of the High Court (“the majority”),
with one dissent, ruled that the expression “in the way of his business as … an
agent” in s 409 must necessarily refer to a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">professional</em>
agent, <span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>,
one who professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and
from which he makes his living. It did <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">not</em>
encompass </span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN;">directors
of corporations, or governing board members or key officers of charities, or
officers of societies. The majority </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">therefore held that the
charges against the six respondents under s 409 were not made out as the
relevant respondents were not professional agents. The CBT charges were
accordingly reduced to charges under s 406 of the Penal Code, <span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>,<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>for the offence of CBT <span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">simpliciter</em></span>,
which provides for a much lower maximum term of imprisonment than s 409.
Section 409 provides that the offender “shall be punished with
imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
20 years” while s 406 provides for a maximum imprisonment term of
seven years. Consequently, the sentences imposed on the respondents were
significantly reduced.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN;"> </span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN;"></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN;">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">In
this application, the Prosecution, seeking to restore the respondents’ original
convictions under s 409 as well as orders enhancing their sentences,
referred two questions under s 397(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code
(Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) to the Court of Appeal. The main issue
of law arising from these questions was the meaning and scope of the phrase “in
the way of his business as ... an agent” in s 409 – specifically, whether
it refers only to a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">professional</em>
agent as the majority held, or if should it be construed more broadly so as to
encompass directors and board members of corporations, charities and societies.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Decision
of the court</span></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>The Court of Appeal affirmed the majority’s ruling that an
“agent” within the meaning of s 409 refers to a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">professional</em> agent, <span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>,<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>one who
professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and from which
he makes his living. Therefore, the Court of Appeal ruled that the </span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG;">majority of the High Court had correctly found that
the respondents could not be convicted under s 409. Accordingly, t</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">he
sentences meted out to the respective respondents by the majority were ordered
to remain.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; page-break-after: avoid; mso-list: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Threshold
conditions for the exercise of the court’s substantive jurisdiction</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>As a preliminary matter, the Court of Appeal laid down
guidance on the principles which apply when the Public Prosecutor brings a
criminal reference in circumstances where the Magistrate’s Appeal was heard by
a specially convened <span class="SpellE">coram</span> of three Judges of the
High Court.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>Although the Public Prosecutor does not require leave to
bring a criminal reference by virtue of s 397(2) of the CPC, it was
well-established that this did not mean that the Court of Appeal was invariably
bound to answer all questions referred to it under this section. In the
exercise of its substantive jurisdiction under s 397 of the CPC, the Court
of Appeal must be satisfied that the application properly falls within the
scope of the provision. In this regard, the fact that a three-Judge <span class="SpellE">coram</span> of the High Court was convened to hear the appeal
below was a relevant consideration. When a three-Judge <span class="SpellE">coram</span>
of the High Court has ruled, its decision should generally represent a final
and authoritative determination of the issues arising from the case.
Accordingly, if the question sought to be referred has been considered and
answered by a three-Judge <span class="SpellE">coram</span> of the High Court,
the result is that the question can properly be regarded to have been settled
and is therefore not one of “public interest” within the meaning of s 397
of the CPC. (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[50], [56]–[57]</strong>)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>In the present case, the Court of Appeal found that the
circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to justify the exercise of the
Court of Appeal’s substantive jurisdiction under s 397 of the CPC even
though a three-Judge <span class="SpellE">coram</span> of the High Court was
convened to hear the appeal below. This was on the principal basis that a
determination of the disputed issue would involve overturning or overruling
High Court authority, given that there were two High Court decisions (<span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>,<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> Tay Choo <span class="SpellE">Wah</span></em>,
and the decision of the majority in the present case) which had adopted
diametrically opposite positions on the issue. The particularly vexing nature
of the questions referred was further evidenced and amplified by the fact that
the High Court <span class="SpellE">coram</span> was split on the result. This
indicated that an authoritative determination on the scope of s 409 by the
Court of Appeal, as the apex court of the land, was necessary. (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[58]–[60]</strong>)</span></p>
<p class="Hdg-1" style="text-align: justify;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Decision on the
questions referred </span></em></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>On the main issue, namely the scope of s 409, the Court
of Appeal held that the majority’s interpretation of s 409 – that an
“agent” within the meaning of the provision refers to a professional agent, <span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>,<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>one who professes to offer his agency
services to the community at large and from which he makes his living – was
supported by the language and structure of s 409 itself, which not only
made a clear distinction between the phrase “in the capacity” and “in the way
of his business” but also identified five other trades or professions alongside
that of an “agent”. In addition, the legislative history of s 409, which
was first enacted in 1860 as part of the Indian Penal Code (Act 45 of
1860), also indicated that the phrase “an agent” was intended to be read in the
light of the preceding words “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an
attorney” in the provision, and only capture professional agents. Accordingly,
both the text and context of s 409 indicated that the phrase “in the way
of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an
agent” only encompassed persons who are entrusted with property in the course
of the commercial activities of their trusted trades or professions – including
those who are in the business of agency (<span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>, professional agents).
Finally, even if genuine ambiguity and uncertainty had persisted as to the
scope of s 409, the rule against doubtful penalisation would have
militated in favour of the narrower interpretation of an “agent” advocated by
the respondents. (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[237], [285]–[286]</strong>)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">13<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>The Court of Appeal acknowledged that in the modern context,
where directors of companies and officers of charities and societies play key
roles in the lives of companies and the economy as a whole, there did not
appear to be a good policy reason to ignore their heightened culpability and
the enhanced potential for harm were they to commit CBT. But the Court of
Appeal was of the view that the task of law reform should be left to
Parliament. The courts were ill-suited, and lacked the institutional
legitimacy, to undertake the kind of wide-ranging policy<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>review of the various classes of persons who, having regard to
modern conditions, deserve more or less punishment for committing CBT. It
observed that such a review was not only essential but also long overdue owing
to the dated nature of the provision. The Court of Appeal noted that in any
event, the Prosecution’s proposed definition of an agent in s 409 as referring
to any legal agent would only exacerbate any perceived inadequacy in the law.
That proposed definition was not only <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">over-inclusive</em>,
as it would inculpate not only directors but also low-level workers entrusted
with small amounts of money needed to carry out their regular responsibilities,
but was also <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">under-inclusive</em>, given
that there remained many significant categories of persons deserving of equal
or greater punishment (such as trustees) who were not legal agents. (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[276]–[282]</strong>)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">14<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>The Court of Appeal also stressed that the respondents in the
present case were not getting away unpunished. They were facing substantial
terms of incarceration, which the majority of the High Court saw fit to impose
after its consideration of the harm and culpability associated with the
respondents’ conduct. The fundamental consideration was that a hard case should
not be allowed to make bad law – in this case, to undermine the principle of
separation of powers which is one of the very bedrocks of the constitution. The
text, context, and legislative history of s 409 all supported the
majority’s interpretation of the provision and for the Court of Appeal to find
otherwise would be a radical departure from legislative intent. (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[283]</strong>)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="text-align: justify; mso-list: none;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span></span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG;">For these reasons, the
Court of Appeal concluded that directors of corporations, governing board
members or key officers of a charity, and officers of a society do not fall
within the scope of s 409 as “agents”. Such persons are not in the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">business</em> of agency, nor do they provide
their services to the community at large. The Court of Appeal accepted that
company directors do play a vital role in corporate governance, and
consequently have a significant impact on commerce and enterprise. However,
since a director of a company had only one principal, <span class="SpellE"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ie</em></span>,<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>his company, it would be a stretch to argue that he was in </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">the
<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">business</em> of agency even if he did
receive remuneration for his services. In other words, a company director,
while clearly a legal agent who bore onerous fiduciary duties, was not a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">professional </em>agent within the object of
s 409. The same difficulties arose, but to an even greater extent,<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> </em>in respect of </span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-SG;">governing board members or key officers of a charity,
and officers of a society, since these persons were not even engaged in any
commercial activity or business, let alone the business of agency. The Court of
Appeal thus ruled that the majority had correctly found that the respondents
could not be convicted under s 409. Accordingly, t</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">he
sentences meted out to the respective respondents by the High Court were
ordered to remain. (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">[287], [289]</strong>)</span></p>
