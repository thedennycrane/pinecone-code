<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.The plaintiffs, Cosmos Shipping Co Ltd, are a Korean

Corporation. Their core business is ship-management.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>2.On 30 June 1999 the plaintiffs entered into a ship management

agreement (the "management agreement") with a Hong Kong company called Best Luck

Shipping Ltd ("Best Luck"). By the management agreement Best Luck retained the

plaintiffs to manage the ship "CRYSTAL" of the Port of Belize. The ship was a

chemical tanker. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>3.Under the management agreement the plaintiffs were required to

attend to "the matters of the vessel/manning, all kind of vessel supplies including

bunkers, marine insurance, claims for seamen and vessel, marine research and consultation,

supervision for the vessel repair and new building, service of incoming and outgoing

vessel etc."

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>4.The management agreement contained elaborate provisions about

manning, maintenance and repairs, survey inspection, bunkering, shores and inventories (in

Korean port only) and insurance. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>5.The management agreement further provided that the Best Luck

(the owner) shall pay the manager (the plaintiff) US$2,500 per vessel per month. The

duration of the management was infinite over a minimum calendar year from the commence

date.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>6.On 1 July 1999, the plaintiffs entered into another agreement

also with Best Luck Shipping Ltd. This agreement was called the Ship Management Agreement

for Crew Manning (the "crew manning agreement"). One Capt. Hsiao Tong Long

signed the agreements for Best Luck Shipping Ltd.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>7.On 19 February 2000 the name of the ship was changed to

"SEA LEADER B". The ownership of the vessel also changed. The new owners were

Sea Leader Shipping Co Ltd with an address in Belize. It was not clear if Sea Leader was

incorporated in Belize. The ship retained the Belize registration. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>8.The change of name and ownership of the ship was effected by

the plaintiffs. So they knew all about the changes. And they remained the managers and

continued to act as usual notwithstanding the changes.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>9.From the documents placed before the Court it appeared that

the plaintiffs discharged their functions as managers from July 1999. They paid the crew

and supplied goods and materials to the ship. The plaintiffs clearly considered Best Luck

as the party liable to pay them for the simple reason that Best Luck was the owner of the

ship and Best Luck signed the agreements with them. The plaintiffs presented a document

called "CRYSTAL WAGE SCALE" bearing the name "BEST LUCK SHIPPING". The

plaintiffs rendered a statement dated 28 July 1999 for US$43,266.58 to Best Luck Shipping

Ltd (vessel : "CRYSTAL"). There was another statement of account dated 6

September 1996 for US$53,816.77 also Best Luck Shipping Ltd (vessel: "SEA LEADER

B" ex "CRYSTAL"). 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>10.Then there was a change in rendering statements from October

1999. A statement of account dated 8 October 1999 for US$44,078.26 was issued to Manson

Marine Pte Ltd, Name of Vessel : Sea Leader and Sea Pirncess B.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>11.On 3 November 1999 another statement was issued to Manson

Marine Pte Ltd for a balance of US$49,097.02. This statement gave credit for US$43,293.64

"Received from You to US on 16<sup xmlns="">th</sup> Oct 99". The "You" was

Manson Marine Pte Ltd.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>12.Thereafter for the months December 1999 to April 2000

statements were rendered to Manson Marine Pte Ltd. The statements rendered in December

1999, January, February and March 2000 gave credit to Manson Marine Pte Ltd for

substantial amounts received from "You", (that is Mansion Marine Pte Ltd). The

biggest item in each statement was crew wages for the "SEA LEADER B" under the

crew manning agreement and scale of charges submitted to Best Luck Shipping.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>13.Why the statements were sent to Mansion Marine Pte Ltd and

not the owners of the ship was not made clear. It, however, appeared that Manson Marine

Pte Ltd was a medium between the plaintiffs and the owners. The moving spirit of Manson

Marine was Capt. Hsiao In that sense Manson Marine Pte Ltd was another manager or agent of

the owners of the ship. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>14.Then a fax was sent on 29 December 1999 from Manson Shipping

(S) Pte Ltd (the defendants) to the plaintiffs by Capt. Hsiao. It read as follows :

<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify">DATE: 29 Dec 1999</p>
<p align="justify">Re renewed Co name and move new office</p>
<p align="justify">Dear Sirs</p>
<p align="justify">Good day, our company "MANSON MARINE PTE LTD" had change name

  to "MANSON SHIPPING (S) PTE LTD". With effect from 25<sup>th</sup> November

  1999, we have move to the following new office.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Address: 3 Shenton Way, #20-09 Shenton House, Singapore 068805<br/>

  Telephone:(65) 2229888<br/>

<p align="justify">Kindly update your records accordingly and send all correspondence to

<p align="justify">Best Regards<br/>

  Capt. Hsiao/Sonny Wee</p>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>15.From then on Manson Shipping’s name was used to deal

with third parties in respect of the "SEA LEADER B". This was done mainly by

Captain Hsiao or SunnyWee. The plaintiffs rendered debit notes to Mansion Shipping but the

statements of accounts were rendered to Mansion Marine Pte Ltd as usual. One of the

payments was made by Mansion Shipping Pte Ltd.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>16. In February or March 2000 something happened to the ship

"SEA LEADER B". The plaintiffs in a letter dated April 22, 2000 addressed to

Manson Shipping (S) Pte Ltd explained what happened. 

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">TO: Manson Shipping (S) Pte Ltd</p>
<p align="justify">DATE: April 22, 2000</p>
<p align="justify">ATTN: Capt. Hsiao/Managing Director<br/>

              Sonny Wee/Operations

  Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">SUBJECT: M.T. "Sea Leader B"</p>
<p align="justify">As you did accept acknowledge very well, above-mentioned vessel was

  arrested by U.S. Navy and sold by auction on the date of April 15<sup>th</sup>, 2000

  because of loading illegal cargo. By the way, crews have been staying on board by waiting

  ship-owner’s instruction. And also this company, Cosmos Shipping Co Ltd have been

  requested your company to repatriate all crew many times. Nevertheless, ship-owner, Manson

  Shipping Co Ltd never worked out count measure for crew repatriation since vessel to be

  arrested by U.S. Navy till now.</p>
<p align="justify">And so, this company of Cosmos Shipping Co Ltd had requested with

  courtesy for your good company to repatriate all crew immediately. That is why Captioned

  vessel was already sold and maintained by new buyer, and so previous Korean Crew and

  Myanmar Crew could not be on board further and had to be repatriated.</p>
<p align="justify">And so we request strongly once again that your company repatriate all

  crews within today, and inform us your action to be done or not. If you don’t take

  action till today, in the meanwhile you don’t inform us, we will arrange local agent

  to repatriate all crews tomorrow at once.</p>
<p align="justify">And then we will claim expenses of crews’ repatriation and others

  additionally to last claim of US$193,574.44 via our lawyer in Singapore accordingly. That

  is why your company is under an obligation to repatriate all crews as ship-owner.</p>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>17.So the vessel was arrested and sold at Dubai, United Arab

Emirates for illegal activities. At Dubai the plaintiffs attempted to recover their

charges from the proceeds of the sale of the ship that is to say from the owners. That was

a clear indication that the plaintiffs considered that the party legally liable to them

was the shipowner. They failed to recover anything.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>18.So they cast about and brought these proceedings against

Manson Shipping Pte Ltd, the defendants. This action was brought on 20 April 2000. The

statement of claim read as follows :

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants is for

  US$193,574.44 being the price of goods and materials supplied at the request of the

  defendants, their servants or agents, full particulars of which have been rendered to the

  defendants and short particulars of which are contained in the plaintiffs’ statement

  of account for February to April 2000 annexed hereto.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Despite the plaintiffs’ various requests, the defendants have

  failed, refused and/or neglected to pay the said sum of US$193,574.44 or any part thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">And the plaintiffs claim :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) The sum of US$193,574.44 or alternatively damages;<br/>

    (ii) Interest; and<br/>

    (iii) Costs.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>19.The statement of account annexed to the statement of claim is

annexed to this judgment. It is to be noted that it was addressed to Manson Marine Pte Ltd

and not Manson Shipping (S) Pte Ltd. Furthermore the statement of claim refers to

"the price of goods and materials supplied at the request of the defendants".

The goods and materials supplied according to the statement of account consisted of 4 out

of 11 items. The bulk of the items was in respect of crew wages amounting to more than

US$160,000. Payment to the crew was not part of the statement of claim.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>20.During the trial, it emerged from the evidence of the

plaintiff’s witness that the crew related items and the management items all emanated

from and founded on the crew manning agreement and the scale of charges submitted to Best

Luck Shipping. The defendants had nothing to do with them. The defendants were not the

owners of the ship nor were they the contracting parties. Additionally there were no

requests for the payment of the crew wages and supply of goods from the defendants. They

were all governed by the manning and management agreement between the plaintiffs and Best

Luck Shipping. At all times they dealt with Capt. Hsiao.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>21.The defendants filed a defence stating that (a) they never

made any request for the goods and services from the plaintiffs; (b) they never entered

into any contracts with the plaintiffs; (c) the request emanated from Best Luck Shipping

Ltd through its Managing Director, Captain Hsiao Tong Long; (d) Captain Hsiao was not an

employee, agent or servants of the defendants; (d) They never represented Capt Hsiao as

their employee, agent or servant; (e) they were not the owner sof the ship "SEA

LEADER B"; (f) they made some payments, it was for the account of Best Luck.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>22.The plaintiffs filed a reply to the defence. They said that

the defendants conducted themselves as principals. They further relied on the payment made

by the defendants. They said that the statements of accounts were "for all intents

and purposes for the accountant of the defendants". They also relied on the letter

about the change of name of Manson Shipping Pte Ltd to Manson Shipping (S) Pte Ltd.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>23.At the trial the plaintiff’s witness said that all

requests came from "Capt Hsiao". That made sense because that would be the usual

and natural conduct since he was the mind behind the owners. Some natural person had to

speak for Best Luck Shipping or the actual owners of the ship. In the circumstances of

this case the requests made by Capt Hsiao can be attributed to the owners of the ship

only. The use of the communication facilities of a non-contracting, non-owner party who

derives no benefit from the transaction at all, cannot ordinarily make that party a

contacting party or liable on a contract with another party. This is particularly so

because there was an elaborate written contract with the owners of a ship. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>24.In this case the plaintiffs were aware of the particulars of

the owners and in fact entered into detailed contracts with them. The plaintiffs witness

said that the defendants were part of a group of companies. He knew that because the

plaintiffs handled the change of ownership. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>25.There was uncontradicted evidence that Manson Shipping was

never the owner of the ship in question. It was also untrue that Manson Shipping

(Singapore) Ltd was a new name for Manson Marine Pte Ltd. Capt Hsiao falsely and

deceitfully made that statement. Additionally, neither Capt. Hsiao nor Sunny Wee was an

employee, office holder or shareholder of Mansion Shipping (S) Pte Ltd.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>26.The defendants have always been a separate legal entity. It

was Capt Hsiao who misrepresented to the plaintiffs about the change of name. 

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>27.The true reason why the plaintiffs sued the defendants is

because they have an asset in Singapore. That asset is #20-09 Shenton House. It was bought

by a Taiwanese couple in the name of Mansion Shipping to acquire permanent residence in

Singapore. They entered into a some form of "joint-venture" with Capt Hsiao.

That was the purpose of Manson Marine Pte ltd. Manson Shipping (S) Pte Ltd was an agency

company. A letter written on 3 November 1999 to the Controller of Immigration signed by

Sonny Wee mentioned that Manson shipping (S) Pte Ltd was "agents". Best Luck and

Manson Marine Ltd had no assets. The plaintiffs contention that the defendants were liable

because they were part of the same group has no legal basis. A group of companies is not a

legal entity. In any event a member of a "group" of companies is not liable for

the debts of other members of the "group". That is a legal fundamental.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>28.It was argued for the plaintiffs that an agent may in law be

personally liable if he personally contracts. That in deed is the law. It has the support

of very high authority, namely the Privy Council : see <i xmlns=""><b>Stanley Yeung Kai Yung v Hong

Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation</b></i> [1981] AC 787. It is illustrated by <i xmlns=""><b>The

Swan</b></i> [1968] 1 Lloyds LR 5. The latter case is an important authority. It laid down

a principle on the intention of contracting parties. Brandon J said at p 12 :

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Where A contracts with B on behalf of a disclosed principal C, the

  question whether both A and C are liable on the contract or only C depends on the

  intention of the parties. That intention is to be gathered from (1) the nature of the

  contract, (2) its terms and (3) the surrounding circumstances: see Bowstead on Agency,

  (12th ed.) (1959), at pp. 257 and 258, par. 113, and the authorities there cited. The

  intention for which the Court looks is not the subjective intention of A or of B. Their

  subjective intentions may differ. The intention for which the Court looks is an objective

  intention of both parties, based on what two reasonable businessmen making a contract of

  that nature, in those terms and in those surrounding circumstances, must be taken to have

  intended. </p>
<p align="justify">Where a contract is wholly in writing, the intention depends on the

  true construction, having regard to the nature of the contract and the surrounding

  circumstances, of the document or documents in which the contract is contained. Where, as

  in the present case, the contract is partly oral and partly in writing, the intention

  depends on the true effect, having regard again to the nature of the contract and the

  surrounding circumstances, of the oral and written terms taken together.</p>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>29.The principles stated above do not help the present

plaintiffs. In this case there was no objective evidence at all that the plaintiffs

transacted or interacted with the defendants in relation to the payments to the crew and

the supply of goods. All the evidence before the Court pointed to, and pointed only to,

the plaintiffs contracting with Best Luck Shipping or the owners of the ship. On an

objective assessment of all the evidence the plaintiffs’ intention was to contract

with the owners.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>30.Next, the plaintiffs relied on the principle of past course

of dealings. They relied on <i xmlns=""><b>Maritime Stores Ltd v H. P. Marshall &amp; Co Ltd</b></i>

[1963] 1 Lloyds LR 602. Neither the case nor the principle state in it helps the present

plaintiffs. All the evidence before the Court pointed to there being no past course of

dealings between the plaintiffs and the defendants. There was an express and elaborate

contract between the plaintiffs and Best Luck Shipping. There was also a course of

dealings as evidenced by the statements of account with Manson Marine but not Manson

Shipping.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>31.After all the evidence was given, the plaintiffs sought to

amend the statement of claim to include the payments to the crew. I disallowed it because

all the evidence had already been given and it did not support the proposed amendment. It

was fundamentally out of tune with the oral and documentary evidence which had already

been adduced. The proposed amendment served no useful purpose.

<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>32.In the result, the plaintiffs’ claim is dismissed with

costs.
