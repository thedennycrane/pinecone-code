        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the judgment creditor
                    to enforce a Malaysian judgment in Singapore under the Reciprocal Enforcement of
                    Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, Rev Ed 1985) (“RECJA”). The
                    third defendant/ judgment debtor (the appellant in this registrar’s
                    appeal) in the Malaysian suit applied to have the registration order set aside.
                    The parties were heard before the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”),
                    who subsequently dismissed the application for setting aside. The third
                    defendant is now appealing the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The third defendant is the main shareholder and
                    director of both the first and second defendants. Under the Malaysian judgment
                    (“the judgment”), a settlement sum of RM750,000.00 (or
                    S$304,383.12) was to be paid by the first defendant. The second and third
                    defendants gave personal guarantees to pay the settlement sum. The terms were
                    recorded in a consent judgment dated 26 February 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Timothy Tan (“Mr Tan”), counsel
                    for the third defendant offered a plethora of reasons why the registration
                    should be set aside: First, the English version of the judgment sought to be
                    enforced is unenforceable in Malaysia; second, the judgment was procured by
                    fraud; third, registration under the RECJA is not permitted where there is no
                    admission of liability; fourth, the judgment creditor is not a judgment creditor
                    as he is not the payee; fifth, the third defendant judgment debtor is not a
                    judgment debtor as he is only a guarantor of the first defendant; sixth, the
                    Malaysian Court had no jurisdiction over the matter as it required non-parties
                    to the suit to make payment of and guarantee the judgment sum; seventh, the
                    judgment was not a money judgment as it contained a penal notice; eighth, there
                    was material non-disclosure during the <em>ex parte</em>
                    application for enforcement of the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       None of these reasons are sufficient to set
                    aside the registration of the judgment. The process of registration under
                    s 3(1) of the RECJA and O 67 of the Rules of Court is a formal one;
                    whether it is “just and equitable” for a judgment to be registered
                    does not depend on the correctness of the judgment. Thus, s 3(2) of the
                    RECJA provides for a judgment <em>not</em> to be registered
                    in situations where certain formal elements of the judgment are lacking. The
                    court’s approach toward registration is a light touch approach. In
                    practice, the default is to permit registration of foreign judgments unless
                    certain formal features are missing. As observed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Yong Tet Miaw v MBF Finance Bhd</em> [1992]
                    2 SLR(R) 549 (AT [31]) and Woo Bih Li J in <em>Global
                        Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie Investindo</em>
                    [2013] 2 SLR 228 (at [20]), the court will set aside the registration of a
                    foreign judgment “only where it is practicable and required by the
                    interests of justice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I now refer to the grounds for setting aside
                    raised by the third defendant. First, whether the judgment is a judgment for the
                    purposes of s 2(1) of the RECJA. If the judgment is indeed unenforceable,
                    then it does not fall within the definition of a judgment in s 2(1) of the
                    RECJA. Both the English and Malay version were sealed by the Malaysian Court and
                    registered in Singapore. At the invitation of the AR, the judgment
                    creditor’s Malaysian solicitors deposed an affidavit on 31 July 2013
                    verifying that both versions were equally binding on the judgment debtors under
                    Malaysian law. The third defendant obtained his own expert. The third
                    defendant’s expert deposed that an enforceable judgment is one which bears
                    the court seal and an English version “by itself” will not be
                    enforceable as it is a translation which does not bear the court seal. Upon
                    closer examination, it was apparent to me that <em>both</em> judgments bore the Malaysian court seal and both were
                    registered together. There is nothing in either expert opinion that indicates
                    that this was an unenforceable judgment. Accordingly, the enforceability of the
                    English version is not a ground for setting aside the registration
                order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It was also clear to me that both the Malay and
                    English versions refer to the same payee. The word “DHL” was
                    omitted from the Malay version, which named the payee as “Global
                    Forwarding (Singapore) Pte Ltd” instead of “DHL Global Forwarding
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd”. There is no company known as “Global
                    Forwarding (Singapore) Pte Ltd”. The judgment creditor’s Malaysian
                    solicitors had also deposed that this was a typographical error and this was not
                    disputed in the hearing before me. This is the only purported discrepancy
                    between the versions. It is not a material discrepancy as described by Mr Tan.
                    This error does not make the English version unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Second, whether the judgment was procured by
                    fraud. This would disqualify it from being registered under s 2(3)(d) of
                    the RECJA. There was no evidence before me that the judgment was procured by
                    fraud. Counsel for the third defendant, Mr Tan argued that the original
                    settlement agreement reached between the parties (“the terms
                    document”) was different from the judgment eventually extracted and this,
                    he claimed, meant that the judgment creditors had tampered with terms of
                    settlement and extracted a materially different order. Both documents were in
                    evidence before me. The only differences between the judgment and the terms
                    document were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_1"></a>1.     the exact SGD equivalent of the RM
                        money sum is included in the judgment but is only stated in the terms
                        document as an SGD sum equivalent to the RM sum; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_2"></a>2.     the payee name is stated in the judgment
                        but not in the terms document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Neither of these is a
                    material discrepancy, nor are they sufficient evidence of fraud on the judgment
                    debtors. The payment of a sum of RM750,000 would be required under both the
                    terms document and the judgment. This was the core of what was agreed between
                    the parties. Moreover, the third defendant’s Malaysian solicitors were
                    present when the judgment was extracted from the Malaysian court and would have
                    been able to object to anything which differed from the parties’
                    agreement. Their failure to object indicates to me that there was no fraud.
                    Fraud is a serious allegation that requires a high standard of proof in the
                    average case. This is no different; the third defendant bears a heavy burden of
                    proof in an allegation of fraud and he has not discharged this
                burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Third, whether registration under the RECJA is
                    not permitted where the judgment is a consent judgment. This argument is a clear
                    non-starter. Section 2(1) of the RECJA permits registration of “any
                    judgment or order… enforceable in the same manner as a judgment given by
                    a court in that place.” It does not distinguish between a consent
                    judgment without admission of liability and any other type of judgment. Section
                    2(1) was clearly intended to adopt a broad interpretation of the word
                    “judgment”. It may be that the judgment creditor is not permitted
                    to rely on the judgment to argue that the issue of liability is <em>res judicata</em> between the parties. However, this does not
                    affect registration which is a purely formal process. Registration may be
                    refused under s 3(2)(b) of the RECJA if a party has not agreed to submit to
                    the jurisdiction of that court. In this case, the third defendant has not only
                    agreed to submit to the Malaysian court’s jurisdiction but has in fact
                    consented specifically to the terms of the judgment extracted. The fact that the
                    judgment was obtained by consent only strengthens the case for registration. The
                    third defendant cannot be permitted to agree to terms before a Malaysian court
                    only to resist its enforcement in the place where his assets are
                found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Fourth, whether the judgment creditor was really
                    a judgment creditor. The definition of judgment creditor in s 2(1) of the
                    RECJA is also clear. It means “the person by whom the judgment was
                    obtained” and his successors. The judgment creditor was the plaintiff in
                    the Malaysian suit. It is not disputed that the judgment was obtained by him
                    with the consent and agreement of the defendant in the Malaysian suit. Who was
                    to be paid the settlement sum was a term of the judgment rather than an attempt
                    to change the parties in the suit – it does not change the nature of the
                    judgment creditor’s claim for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Fifth, whether the judgment debtor was really
                    a judgment debtor. A judgment debtor, as defined in s 2(1) of the RECJA, is
                    any person “against whom the judgment was given”. The third
                    defendant personally guaranteed the settlement sum and took notice that he would
                    “be liable to the process of execution for the purpose of compelling you
                    to obey the same”. The judgment was clearly directed at the third
                    defendant. Whether or not his liability under the judgment was conditional or
                    unconditional does not change the fact that judgment was given against him. In
                    my view, there is no doubt that the third defendant was a judgment
                    debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Sixth, whether the Malaysian court acted
                    without jurisdiction. Mactus Pte Ltd and Mactus International Pte Ltd are liable
                    under the judgment to pay the settlement sum, along with the third defendant.
                    The third defendant claims that these two companies are non-parties to the
                    Malaysian suit and that the Malaysian court had no jurisdiction over them. The
                    third defendant is the sole shareholder and director of Mactus Pte Ltd and
                    Mactus International Pte Ltd (directly and through another of his Mactus
                    companies). It is clear on the face of the judgment that the third defendant was
                    being made liable in the judgment and there is no dispute that the Malaysian
                    court had jurisdiction over the third defendant. The payment through Mactus Pte
                    Ltd and Mactus International Pte Ltd can more properly be described as the
                    vehicle through which the third defendant must make payment and not an example
                    of the Malaysian court acting outside of its jurisdiction. Even if this were not
                    so, the judgment is presently sought to be enforced against the third defendant,
                    in relation to whom there is no question of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Seventh, whether the penal notice attached to
                    the judgment changes its nature from a money judgment to a penal judgment. I do
                    not think the inclusion of the penal notice changes anything. In fact, I do not
                    think that the description “penal notice” is even an accurate one.
                    This notice reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>INDORSEMENT PURSUANT TO ORDER 45 RULE 7 OF THE RULES
                            OF COURT 2012</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you, Tan Swee Leon (Singapore Passport No. [xxx]), the abovenamed
                            3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, disobey this Judgment, you
                        will be liable to the process of execution for the purpose of compelling you
                        to obey the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Order 45 rule 7 of the Malaysian Rules of
                    Court 2012 is <em>in pari materia</em> with O 45 r 7 of our
                    Rules of Court. It governs the service of copy of judgment or order prerequisite
                    to enforcement under O 45 r 5. In other words, it governs the formal
                    requirements of an order which, if disobeyed, may lead to committal for contempt
                    of court. Every person who does not obey a court order opens himself up to
                    committal proceedings for disobeying a court order regardless of whether such a
                    notice is indicated in the judgment. The inclusion of this notice does not
                    provide any additional penalties. The judgment still remains a money judgment
                    and is thus enforceable under the RECJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Eighth, whether there was material
                    non-disclosure. The alleged non-disclosure related to the fact that the terms
                    document was not disclosed before the AR. I find that the non-disclosure of the
                    terms document was not material; it is the judgment that is material and not the
                    discussions or negotiations leading up to it. Moreover, as I have already
                    observed, there were no material discrepancies between the judgment and the
                    terms document. Both versions of the judgment were before the AR and that was
                    what was important.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It seems to me that the judgment debtor was
                    attempting to use the court process to avoid his obligation to pay. Counsel for
                    the judgment creditor pointed out that the third defendant evaded Malaysian
                    court process until he was threatened with committal proceedings. He then signed
                    this consent judgment and now seeks to renege on it. I think it would be unjust
                    and inequitable to permit the judgment debtor to rely on technical arguments
                    which do not affect the validity of the judgment in order to set aside the
                    registration of that judgment. It is beyond doubt that permitting registration
                    is the “just and equitable” thing to do. Mr Tan submitted an
                    affidavit after the last hearing deposing to an application being made in
                    Malaysia to set aside the Malaysian judgment. In response, Mr Ian Lim
                    (“Mr Lim”), counsel for the judgment creditor filed an
                    affidavit to support his submission that the application in Malaysia is doomed
                    to fail because it was out of time. Further, Mr Lim submitted that an
                    application to set aside is not a relevant ground unlike a stay pending appeal.
                    I agree with Mr Lim that the proposed application is irrelevant. The third
                    defendant can similarly apply to set aside the order in Singapore if he is
                    successful in Malaysia. For the above reasons, I dismiss the application and
                    will hear parties on cost.</p>
