        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The facts of this case are set out in my written
                    judgment handed down on 20 January 2014 and I need not repeat them here. On
                    the facts, counsel for the prosecution and defence made submissions on the
                    sentence. DPP Anandan Bala, assisted by Ms Seraphina Fong and Mr Marcus Foo,
                    submitted that both accused should be sentenced to death. Mr Ramesh Tiwary
                    (“Mr Tiwary”), assisted by Mr Josephus Tan and Mr Keith Lim
                    submitted on behalf of Micheal Anak Garing (“Micheal Garing”), and
                    Mr Amarick Gill (“Mr Gill”) assisted by Mr Justin Tan submitted on
                    behalf of Tony Anak Imba (“Tony Imba”). Counsel for both
                    defendants argued that the death penalty should not be imposed in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Until the law was changed, anyone convicted of
                    murder punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“Penal Code”) shall be punished with death. But murder is defined
                    in the Penal Code to include not only killing with an intention to kill
                    (s 300(a)) but also killing with the intention of causing such bodily
                    injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death (s 300(b)),
                    killing by inflicting a wound that was sufficient in the ordinary course of
                    nature to cause death (s 300(c)) and killing with the knowledge that it is
                    so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death
                    (s 300(d)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Section 302 was amended in 2012 so that the
                    death penalty is retained for murder with the intention to kill (s 300(a)),
                    but murder under ss 300(b) to (d), namely, without an explicit intention to
                    kill, is now punishable with either imprisonment for life and caning, or with
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       When a court refers to sentencing principles, it
                    would be referring explicitly or implicitly to principles such as utilitarian
                    principles or retributive principles. When it is determining how harsh or
                    lenient it would be, those principles remain relevant but the actual sentence
                    meted out is always a matter of the court’s discretion. That has to be so
                    because the facts of each case will always be different even if the more
                    outstanding facts may appear similar. Hence, one accused who punches another may
                    be jailed for a week whereas another might be jailed for a month. The
                    circumstances of the two cases may be sufficiently different to justify the
                    different terms of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Consistency in sentencing is also regarded as a
                    principle and thus, courts set broad precedents so that the discretion of the
                    courts is not applied so diversely that lawyers and the public have no
                    indication what the accused may face. That will lead to far too many contested
                    prosecutions. Clarity and consistency in sentencing has the greater utility of
                    warning the public of the punishment in store, and thus, in that sense, has a
                    deterrent value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       When Parliament removed the mandatory death
                    penalty for cases in which the accused has no explicit intention to kill, it
                    conferred a discretion to impose a term of life imprisonment (with caning) as an
                    alternative to the death penalty to the court. Judicial discretion is exercised
                    by taking all relevant factors into account. In the case of sentencing in
                    ss 300(b) to (d) cases, the discretion is not one in which the judge can
                    impose life imprisonment just because he is personally not in favour of the
                    death penalty. I do not think that Parliament amended this section to give the
                    courts a discretion that is so broad and absolute. Whether the death penalty
                    should be removed entirely is a question for the legislature and not the courts.
                    The question before me is whether on the facts should the death penalty be
                    imposed, and if so, whether on one or both of the convicted accused. It is a
                    question that must be answered by a consideration of the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Courts that have discretionary powers to impose
                    the death penalty have used various descriptions when they justify their
                    decisions. The Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kho
                        Jabing</em> [2015] 2 SLR 112 (“<em>Kho
                        Jabing”)</em> did not find the description “rarest of
                    the rare” that has been used by the Indian Court in <em>Bachan Singh v The State of Punjab</em> (1980) 2 SCC 684
                    appropriate, because it is of the view that reserving the death penalty only for
                    the “rarest of the rare” or the “worst of the worst”
                    cases “would mean that it is only in the most extreme of circumstances
                    and the narrowest of cases that the death penalty would be imposed” (at
                    [38]). The Court of Appeal in <em>Kho Jabing</em> preferred
                    to use “outrage the feelings of the community” to determine
                    whether the death penalty should be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Phrases like “rarest of the rare”
                    and “worst of the worst” are general terms intended to convey the
                    sort of cases that would place the crime at such a high level of opprobrium that
                    would justify the penalty of death since no one can tell which is the worst of
                    the worst until the worst has occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       What conduct is likely to “outrage the
                    feelings of the community” requires some elaboration because not everyone
                    who outrages the feelings of the community should be sentenced to death. Thus,
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Kho Jabing</em> further held at
                    [45] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In determining whether the actions of the offender would outrage the
                        feelings of the community, we find that the death penalty would be the
                        appropriate sentence when the offender has acted in a way which exhibits
                        viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life. Viewed in this light, it
                        is the <em>manner</em> in which the offender acted
                        which takes centre stage. For example, in the case of a violent act leading
                        to death, the <em>savagery of the attack</em> would be
                        indicative of the offender’s regard for human life. The number of
                        stabs or blows, the area of the injury, the duration of the attack and the
                        force used would all be pertinent factors to be considered. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Court of Appeal was clearly of the view
                    that the phrase “rarest of the rare” might lead judges at first
                    instance to shove discretionary death penalty into a remote corner of legal
                    material where it may rarely be heard of again. It therefore prefers a
                    description that will admit more than the rare case. But when we take into
                    account the viciousness or savagery of the attack we are not far from the
                    “worst of the worst” and “rarest of the rare”. How
                    vicious or savage must the act be? Ultimately, the sentencing court must not
                    take such a lenient view that one would need to strain the imagination to find
                    what facts deserve the imposition of the death penalty. There is no scientific
                    or mathematical formula that determines what conduct deserves the imposition of
                    the death penalty. Linguistic descriptions can be helpful but can sometimes
                    confuse and mislead. The court has to find the facts, and then decide whether on
                    those facts the conduct of the accused and the circumstances of the case merit
                    the punishment of death. If the answer is “yes”, then one can
                    garnish the judgment with descriptive adjectives such as
                    “heinous”, “savage”, or “outrageous”;
                    but when the facts speak for themselves, these descriptions are
                    unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In this case, Mr Tiwary, realising that the
                    deceased victim was only one of four and the other three were close to death
                    themselves, submitted that I should ignore the three other victims because those
                    three were the subject of offences that were not part of the charge in the
                    present case. That may be true, but they were relevant to the
                    prosecution’s narrative as to what the gang had planned to do that evening
                    and how it carried out that plan. The facts concerning the three other victims
                    cannot be ignored. The assault on each of them was as violent as the one that
                    killed the last victim. The plan was to rob and the method was through violence
                    with a deadly weapon. All victims suffered severely and one lost his life. I am
                    of the view that the conduct of Micheal Garing justified the death penalty and I
                    so sentence him to suffer death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The prosecution similarly argued that Tony
                    Imba too ought to be punished with death. Counsel for Tony Imba, Mr Gill
                    submitted that his client did not wield the weapon that caused the injuries of
                    the four victims and death. In that sense, Tony Imba was no different from the
                    other members of the gang. There was an attempt by Micheal Garing at trial to
                    show that it was Tony Imba who carried out the physical assault, but I found
                    that that was against the evidence. The weapon was wielded by only one man
                    – Micheal Garing. Tony Imba was guilty of murder under s 300(c) only
                    by the application of s 34 of the Penal Code, namely, that he and the other
                    members of the gang shared the common intention to rob their victims by violent
                    means. In reply, Mr Anandan Bala submitted that “it is certainly not
                    unprecedented for co-accused persons convicted of a common intention to cause
                    death to receive similar sentences”. That may be true before the law was
                    amended. But now, that is not necessarily so because the court has the
                    discretion to impose a different sentence other than death for co-accused
                    persons charged with a common intention to murder under ss 300(b) to
                    (d).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the circumstances, can the same degree of
                    blameworthiness be ascribed to Tony Imba? The fact that he did not use the
                    weapon is important. Tony Imba knocked the deceased victim off his bicycle and
                    held him whilst Micheal Garing began his assault. But the fatal wounds were not
                    inflicted by Tony Imba and there is no evidence to show that he ever wielded the
                    weapon to cause deadly injuries. Is this a sufficient distinction? I do not
                    think that in common intention cases only the principal actor would suffer the
                    death penalty. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The sentencing
                    court must be satisfied, after considering the facts and the circumstances, that
                    the convicted offender deserves to be punished with death, and I am not
                    satisfied that the facts sufficiently warrant it so far as Tony Imba is
                    concerned. If none of the victims were killed, Tony Imba’s sentence would
                    probably be lower than that of Micheal Garing. The question now is whether that
                    difference is sufficiently great for him to escape the gallows? If none of the
                    victims had died, even Micheal Garing would have escaped the gallows. Tony
                    Imba’s culpability in this case is still significantly less than Micheal
                    Garing’s, and in my view, sufficiently different to be sentenced to life
                    imprisonment rather than to suffer death. I therefore sentence him to
                    imprisonment for life with effect from 20 January 2014, the date of his
                    conviction, and also to 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
