<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In July this year, I heard three applications
                    involving, basically, the same subject matter which was the Final Award dated 29
                    December 2014 (“the Award”) made by the tribunal in the
                    arbitration known as SIAC No XXX of 2013 (“the
                    Arbitration”) and the decision dated 24 February 2015
                    (“the Decision”) which clarified the Award. The parties to
                    the applications were identical and comprised one individual and two companies.
                    The individual, AYH, was the plaintiff in these proceedings and I shall refer to
                    him as “Mr AA”. The two companies, AYI and AYJ, were the
                    defendants in the proceedings and I shall refer to the first defendant as
                    “BB PLC” and to the second defendant as
                    “PT BB”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The three applications before me were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     These proceedings, HC/Originating
                        Summons No 349 of 2015 (“OS 349”), in which
                        Mr AA who had been the respondent in the Arbitration applied to set
                        aside the Award and the Decision;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     HC/Summons No 2438 of 2015
                        (“Sum 2438”) which was taken out in HC/Originating
                        Summons No 98 of 2015 (“OS 98”) by BB PLC and
                        PT BB against Mr AA for a Mareva injunction in respect of property
                        up to the value of US$173m, £1,342,823.48 and $963,626.81;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     HC/Summons
                        No 2752 of 2015 (“Sum 2752”) which was taken out in
                        OS 98 by Mr AA seeking to set aside orders granting BB PLC
                        and PT BB leave to enforce the Award and the Decision and, further,
                        seeking to restrain BB PLC and PT BB from taking enforcement
                        action pending the disposal of OS 349.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The grounds of OS 349 were the ones that
                    are commonly encountered in setting aside awards, <em>viz</em>, that there was a breach of natural justice in connection
                    with the making of the Award and, secondly, that the Award dealt with an issue
                    which was not contemplated by nor fell within the terms of the submission to
                    arbitration. I found no merit in either ground and, consequently, dismissed the
                    application. This meant that I also dismissed Sum 2752. I then heard
                    Sum 2438 and granted BB PLC and PT BB an injunction restraining
                    Mr AA from disposing of his assets in the terms prayed for. Mr AA has
                    appealed against my decisions. This judgment contains my reasons for dismissing
                    OS 349.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The following account of the background facts
                    leading to the arbitration and the present proceedings comes from the
                    parties’ submissions and the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The relationship between Mr AA, on the one
                    part, and BB PLC and PT BB, on the other, is governed by a Deed dated
                    26 June 2013 (“the Deed”) between the parties. The Deed was
                    intended to settle disputes between the parties relating to the operations of an
                    Indonesian mining company (“PTX”) which Mr AA had previously
                    been running and which was owned as to 90% of its shares (albeit indirectly) by
                    PT BB which Mr AA also directed. PT BB and all companies in its
                    group (“The Group”) are now owned by BB PLC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After BB PLC took over PT BB,
                    investigations were carried out into certain transactions that had been
                    undertaken by The Group. Mr AA vacated his executive posts in The Group in
                    March 2013. Thereafter, there were meetings between him and members of the new
                    management and its auditors at which Mr AA was asked to explain certain
                    capital expenditure undertaken by The Group and, in particular, PTX. The new
                    management took the view that much of this expenditure should not have been
                    undertaken and asked Mr AA to repay the same to The Group. Mr AA did
                    not accept that he was responsible for such repayment. The position taken by
                    Mr AA then, and which he maintains now, was that all the impugned payments
                    and transactions had had proper business purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Between the end of May and 26 June 2013, the
                    parties exchanged numerous drafts of a settlement deed. All were represented by
                    solicitors. Finally, on 26 June 2013, the parties executed the Deed. By the
                    Deed, Mr AA agreed to transfer assets and cash to PT BB in accordance
                    with the schedule of payments set out in cl 1.11 of the Deed. According to
                    the schedule, the first payment was due on 26 September 2013 while the second
                    was due on 26 December 2013. Mr AA did not make any payment on either
                    of those dates. Nor did he transfer any of the assets as promised. The aggregate
                    value of assets and cash to be transferred under the Deed by Mr AA was
                    US$173m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Clause 6.1 of the Deed provides that it and any
                    non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Deed are to
                    be governed by and interpreted according to English law. Under cl 6.2,
                    disputes arising out of or in connection with the Deed are to be finally settled
                    under the Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
                    (“SIAC”) (5th Ed, 1 April 2013) (“SIAC Rules”) by
                    three arbitrators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 8 November 2013, BB PLC and
                    PT BB gave Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Rule 3 of the SIAC Rules.
                    This led to the Arbitration and the appointment of the tribunal by the SIAC. The
                    hearing of the Arbitration took place in August 2014 and both sides adduced oral
                    as well as documentary evidence. Parties then exchanged several sets of
                    submissions and the Arbitration was declared closed on 6 November 2014. The
                    Award was issued on 29 December 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Arbitration and Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     BB PLC and PT BB (whom I shall
                    sometimes collectively refer to as the “Claimants”) commenced the
                    Arbitration seeking, <em>inter alia</em> orders for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the specific performance of
                        Mr AA’s obligations under the Deed and/or for the payment of sums
                        due under it; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     without prejudice to the foregoing, orders that Mr AA transfer
                        or procure the transfer to PT BB of assets equal in value to, in
                        aggregate, US$173m, including transfer of a 49% shareholding in another
                        subsidiary company, or to pay or transfer to PT BB such amount in cash
                        as equals the difference between US$173m and the value of the said
                        shareholding in that subsidiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr AA disputed the claim. He filed a
                    Defence and Counterclaim in which he averred that he was not in breach of his
                    obligations under the Deed because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Deed was void for common
                        mistake;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     further, or in the alternative, it must be rescinded for misrepresentation;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     further, or
                        in the alternative, his obligations under the Deed had not yet fallen
                        due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>He also counterclaimed for,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, a declaration that the Deed
                        was void for a mistake or, alternatively, rescission of the Deed for
                        misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In order to follow the arguments, it is
                    necessary to bear in mind two additional facts. First, during the discussions
                    between the parties, Mr AA was shown a table entitled “Expenditures
                    outside normal course of business”. This table was amended subsequently
                    and the last version of it was given to Mr AA on 20 June 2013
                    (“Exceptional Costs Table”). The Exceptional Costs Table listed
                    the transactions that were being questioned. Most of these transactions
                    comprised payments made by PTX. The second fact to remember is that PTX is not a
                    party to the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is also necessary to bear in mind
                    cl 2.1 of the Deed, which provides that in relation to any transfers of
                    cash or assets made by Mr AA in accordance with the terms of the
                    Deed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Mr AA’s] liability to the Companies [<em>ie</em>, BB PLC and PT BB] in respect of
                        Potential Claims [as defined in the Deed] shall be reduced by an amount
                        equal to the value of the Assets transferred pursuant to clause 1 (as
                        determined by the reputable independent third party appointed by the Parties
                        or as otherwise agreed between the Parties), such reduction being on a
                        dollar for dollar basis and shall only be effective following receipt of the
                        valuation referred to above, until the value of the Assets transferred
                        pursuant to clause 1 (as determined by the reputable independent
                        third party appointed by the Parties or as otherwise agreed between the
                        Parties) equals no less than US$173,000,000 whereupon [Mr AA’s]
                        liability to the Companies in respect of Potential Claims shall be
                        extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the Arbitration, the arguments made on
                    Mr AA’s behalf on common mistake were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Deed was void for common mistake
                        because the parties shared a common mistaken belief that the payments
                        classified in the Exceptional Costs Table were all made by PT BB
                        (“the First Common Mistake”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Alternatively, the Deed was void for common
                        mistake because the parties shared a common mistaken belief that the Deed
                        contained a self-executing release—that Mr AA would be
                        automatically released from all Potential Claims in relation to the payments
                        upon the transfer of assets referred to in the Deed (“the Second
                        Common Mistake”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr AA noted that the terms of the Deed,
                    in particular cl 2.2 thereof, expressly refer to the payments classified in
                    the Exceptional Costs Table as having been made by PT BB. However, only
                    US$38.4m of the payments were made by PT BB – the bulk of the
                    payments were made by PTX, an entity which is not party to the Deed. This meant
                    that the transfer of assets to PT BB and BB PLC pursuant to the Deed
                    would not effectively reduce Mr AA’s liabilities in respect of the
                    Potential Claims (as defined in the Deed) that PTX would have against him in
                    respect of the payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In response, the Claimants argued the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no shared belief that
                        PT BB had made all the relevant payments, and at all times Mr AA
                        was aware that the majority of the payments were made by
                    PTX.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The fact that
                        not all the payments were made by PT BB did not render the performance
                        of the contract impossible or make it different from what was
                        anticipated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On or about 18 August 2014, with less than a
                    week to go before the hearing of the Arbitration commenced, Mr AA’s
                    lawyers were informed that an agreement dated 18 August 2014 had been entered
                    into between BB PLC, PT BB and PTX (“the August 2014
                    Agreement”). A copy of the August 2014 Agreement was sent to
                    Mr AA’s lawyers and Mr AA was asked to confirm that he would not
                    object to the Claimants producing this agreement at the hearing.
                    Mr AA’s lawyers subsequently responded that he did not object to the
                    admission of the August 2014 Agreement as a document the Claimants wished to
                    adduce. However, Mr AA did not admit its validity or legal
                effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The August 2014 Agreement refers to the Deed
                    and to the obligation of Mr AA thereunder to transfer legal and beneficial
                    title to various assets and/or cash in return for the release of Potential
                    Claims. The essence of this agreement is that each of the Claimants undertakes
                    that, in the event that Mr AA transfers cash or assets to PT BB, they
                    will transfer the same onward to PTX. In return, PTX undertakes that it will
                    release Mr AA from Potential Claims by an amount equal to the value of the
                    assets transferred until the value of such assets equals no less than US$173m
                    whereupon Mr AA’s liability to PTX in respect of the Potential Claims
                    shall be extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     By the time the August 2014 Agreement was
                    concluded, the Agreed List of Issues in the Arbitration had been settled. It
                    had, in fact, been submitted to the tribunal on 29 July 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Arbitration went ahead as scheduled.
                    Closing submissions were filed by the Claimants and Mr AA on 8 September
                    2014. The Claimants then filed Rebuttal Submissions on 23 September 2014 and
                    Mr AA’s lawyers submitted a Note on the Claimants’ rebuttal on
                    2 October 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Award was issued on 29 December 2014. It
                    is important to emphasise that in considering the parties’ arguments on
                    whether there was common mistake under English law that rendered the Deed void,
                    the tribunal adopted the test put forward by both parties being that enunciated
                    in <em>Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage
                        (International) Ltd</em> [2003] QB 679 (“<em>Great Peace Shipping</em>”). Under this test, the following
                    elements must be present if common mistake is to avoid a contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     There must be a common assumption as
                        to the existence of a state of affairs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     There must be no warranty by either party that
                        that state of affairs exists;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     The non-existence of the state of affairs must not be
                        attributable to the fault of either party; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     The non-existence of the state of affairs must
                        render performance of the contract impossible (see <em>Great
                            Peace Shipping</em> at [76]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It was the last requirement, impossibility of performance, which was
                        central to the arguments and to the decision of the
                tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The tribunal found in favour of the Claimants,
                    rejecting Mr AA’s arguments on both the First Common Mistake and the
                    Second Common Mistake. It held that the misdescription in the Deed could be
                    corrected by way of construction, implication or rectification. The tribunal
                    then ordered specific performance of the Deed as amended in accordance with the
                    Schedule to the Award. The main amendment made was to introduce the name of PTX
                    into cl 2.1 of the Deed so that the clause also provided for the reduction
                    of Mr AA’s liability to PTX upon the transfer of assets and for the
                    complete satisfaction of such liability when the value of the assets transferred
                    reached US$173m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In respect of the Second Common Mistake, the
                    tribunal found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no such common assumption
                        of a self-executing release; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was no impossibility of
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These findings are embodied in
                        [161] to [163] of the Award. These read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">161.  It is apparent from Mr Connerty’s note that
                            the form of a release was not discussed on 12 June 2013. That discussion
                            related to the scope of the release which continued to occupy the
                            parties and their solicitors until the final version of the Deed was
                            signed on 26 June 2013. As mentioned, the Deed referred to waiver of
                            Potential Claims (as defined) and to the possibility of extinguishing
                            them, but it does not state in terms that the release should be
                            self-executing. Having construed the Deed against the background on
                            which evidence was adduced, the Tribunal is unable to find that the
                            parties intended that [Mr AA’s] release would only be
                            executed by the Deed. In particular, the review of their witness
                            testimony and the contemporaneous documents convinces the Tribunal that
                            what concerned [Mr AA] and Mr Connerty was the scope of the
                            release rather than how it would be executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">162.  On 18 August 2014, the Claimants entered into an
                            agreement with [PTX]. That agreement which is expressed to be governed
                            by English law provides that in consideration for the transfer of any
                            Assets pursuant to the Deed, [PTX] would release [Mr AA] from
                            liability on a dollar for dollar basis in respect of Potential Claims by
                            an amount equal to the value of the Assets transferred. [Mr AA] has
                            not yet transferred any Assets to the Claimants, but he has been given a
                            copy of the 18 August 2014 agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">163.  In order to establish a common mistake,
                            [Mr AA] must satisfy the Tribunal that, among other things, the
                            non-existence of the state of affairs, that is, a self-executing
                            release, renders performance of the contract impossible. Even though
                            [PTX] is not a party to the Deed, the Claimants have procured by the
                            agreement of 18 August 2014 that [PTX] will give [Mr AA] a full release
                            of any Potential Claims that it may have against him. Accordingly, the
                            Claimants have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that
                            they are able to perform their obligations under the Deed if and when
                            [Mr AA] transfers the Assets. For the reasons stated, the Tribunal
                            finds that the second mistake as well as the first mistake alleged by
                            the Respondent are not common mistakes and thus the Deed is not
                            void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Award should be set aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The two grounds which Mr AA put forward
                    as warranting the setting aside of the Award were both focussed on the validity
                    and effect of the August 2014 Agreement. He argued that the tribunal had found
                    (when it should not have) that the legal effect of the August 2014 Agreement was
                    that it validly granted him release from Potential Claims (as defined in the
                    Deed) by PTX and:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     that this was not an issue that was
                        contemplated by and/or fell within the terms of the submission to
                        Arbitration and/or was a decision/matter beyond the scope of the Arbitration
                        – see Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the
                        UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985
                        (“Model Law”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     the tribunal did not afford him a reasonable opportunity
                        to be heard on the issue of the legal effect of the August 2014 Agreement
                        and this was a breach of the rules of natural justice under
                            Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Model Law and
                            s 24(<em>b</em>) of the International
                        Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the
                    IAA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the award dealt with a dispute beyond the scope of the
                Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     All parties accepted that when a court has to
                    determine whether an arbitral award ought to be set aside under
                        Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), it must undertake a
                    two-stage enquiry. The court will have to decide first, what matters were within
                    the scope of the submission to the arbitral tribunal; and, second, whether the
                    Award involves such matters, or whether it involves a new difference outside the
                    scope of the submission to arbitration and, accordingly, irrelevant to the
                    issues requiring determination (<em>PT Asuransi Jasa
                        Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [44]).
                    They also agree that the parties’ pleaded cases and the issues of law and
                    fact raised in the pleadings are generally looked upon as delineating the
                    matters which are within the scope of submission to arbitration. However, in
                        <em>PT Prima International Development v Kempinski
                        Hotels SA and other appeals</em> [2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<em>PT Prima</em>”), the Court of Appeal, while
                    affirming that the pleadings are central in the arbitration context, also stated
                    that a new fact arising after submission to arbitration, which would affect the
                    remedies recoverable in the proceedings must fall within the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration and, therefore, need not be
                    specifically pleaded (at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In his submissions before me, Mr AA made
                    the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The August 2014 Agreement did not
                        form part of the pleaded issues and was not referred to in the
                        parties’ opening skeletal submissions nor in the Agreed List of Issues
                        jointly submitted to the tribunal. This list was set out in full by the
                        tribunal at [71] of the Award which demonstrated that the tribunal had
                        accepted it as delimiting the scope of issues to be decided in the
                        arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The effect of the August 2014 Agreement and whether it provided Mr AA
                        with a valid release under the Deed was not placed before the tribunal as an
                        issue to be determined at any point during the course of the oral
                        hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        tribunal fell into error when it made a substantive finding that the August
                        2014 Agreement validly granted Mr AA the necessary release under the
                        Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        tribunal’s findings had caused Mr AA prejudice because he did not
                        have the opportunity to make submissions on the validity and enforceability
                        of the August 2014 Agreement and he was not given notice that he was
                        required to address the tribunal on the legal effect that it had on the
                        release mechanism provided for under the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the August 2014 Agreement properly put forward before the
                tribunal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I will take the first two points together.
                    This requires an examination not only of the pleadings and the Agreed List of
                    Issues but also a consideration of what occurred during the Arbitration. Whilst
                    it is correct that the August 2014 Agreement was not mentioned as such in either
                    the pleadings or the Agreed List of Issues, that does not mean that the matters
                    dealt with in the August 2014 Agreement were not within the scope of the
                    submission to the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Claimants did not seek by their claim in
                    the Arbitration to enforce the August 2014 Agreement. When their original claim
                    was filed, the August 2014 Agreement did not exist but, even after it was
                    concluded, they did not seek to amend the claim to include a reference to this
                    document. The Claimants’ position, when they produced the August 2014
                    Agreement, was that it was a piece of evidence which they were adducing in the
                    Arbitration to support their contention that there was no impossibility of
                    performance of cl 2.1 of the Deed. They said that the August 2014 Agreement
                    showed that they were able to procure that PTX would release Mr AA from
                    Potential Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Whilst the August 2014 Agreement was not
                    mentioned in the pleadings, those pleadings show clearly that the issue of
                    whether the Claimants had the ability to procure a release from PTX and
                    therefore to perform cl 2.1 of the Deed so that the Deed could not be void by
                    reason of mistake, indeed fell squarely within the submission to the
                    Arbitration. In the statement of claim in the Arbitration (“SOC”),
                    the Claimants sought specific performance of Mr AA’s obligations
                    under the Deed and/or of the payments of sums due under it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In his statement of defence and counterclaim
                    (“D&amp;C”), Mr AA averred that he had agreed by the Deed to
                    transfer assets to PT BB equal to US$173m to extinguish the Potential
                    Claims and in return for such transfer he was to receive a waiver of the
                    Potential Claims from the Claimants. However, the Potential Claims had been
                    defined as payments made by PT BB whilst in fact most of the payments
                    comprising the Potential Claims had been made by PTX. The Deed was void for
                    common mistake because the parties had a shared but mistaken belief that all the
                    relevant payments had been made by PT BB and this mistake made the contract
                    impossible to perform because any payment made under the Deed by Mr AA to
                    PT BB would not extinguish by satisfaction, his liability, if any, in
                    respect of the Potential Claims arising from earlier payments made by
                    PTX.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     To me, one of the issues that arose clearly
                    from the SOC and the D&amp;C was whether the Deed could be performed in such a
                    way that Mr AA’s liability to PTX could be extinguished. Whilst the
                    issue was not phrased in this way in the Agreed List of Issues, it was inherent
                    in the wording of the second issue under the heading “Mistake”
                    which was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    In particular
                            whether the Deed is void because the parties entered into the Deed in
                            the common mistaken belief that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(1)    The payments classified as “<em>other exceptional costs</em>” in the
                                [Exceptional Costs Table] had all been made by [PTX];
                            and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    [Mr AA] would obtain a release from all
                                potential claims for those payments by reducing and extinguishing
                                his liability in respect of them upon the transfer of the assets
                                referred to in the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It was apparent from the wording of issue 2(2) that one of the
                        disputes was whether the parties believed, in common, that the Deed provided
                        a self-executing release or whether it had been contemplated that some
                        external form of release could be provided by the relevant party when
                        Mr AA complied with his obligations under the
                Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The question of whether common mistake under
                    the <em>Great Peace Shipping</em> test (which both parties
                    accepted as the test applicable to the issues raised in the Arbitration) had
                    been established encompassed the legal effect/enforceability of the August 2014
                    Agreement. The parties had corresponded on adducing this agreement as evidence
                    in the Arbitration and Mr AA’s solicitors, by letter dated 20 August
                    2014, had expressly reserved his right to deal with its validity at the hearing.
                    In that letter, they highlighted that he did not admit its validity or legal
                    effect and did not agree that it addressed and redressed the parties’
                    common mistake as to the party that made the payments which were the subject of
                    the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The fact that the August 2014 Agreement was
                    entered into only after the submission to Arbitration did not preclude its
                    admission in the Arbitration proceedings. In the case of <em>PT
                        Prima</em>, the Court of Appeal held (at [47]) that any new fact which
                    arises after submission to arbitration, which is ancillary to the dispute
                    submitted for arbitration and which is known to all the parties to the
                    arbitration is part of that dispute and need not be specifically pleaded. It may
                    be raised in the arbitration proceedings as long as the other party is given
                    sufficient notice of it and the opportunity to meet it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I agreed with the submission that the
                    requirements set out in <em>PT Prima</em> were
                    satisfied in this case. The Claimants made the existence of the August 2014
                    Agreement known to Mr AA almost as soon as it was concluded and also
                    notified him of the use that they were going to make of it. The August 2014
                    Agreement was ancillary to the dispute on common mistake because the Claimants
                    were using it as evidence that cl 2.1 of the Deed could be performed by
                    them and that the contractual obligation contemplated by the Deed was not
                    impossible of performance. The Claimants did not contend that the August 2014
                    Agreement itself granted Mr AA the necessary release. Mr AA also had
                    sufficient opportunity to consider the validity and effect of the August 2014
                    Agreement. Although it was concluded less than a week before the start of the
                    hearing, there was ample time for consideration and submission thereafter.
                    Indeed, the last submission made by Mr AA’s lawyers was only given to
                    the tribunal on 2 October 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Apart from considering that, in general terms,
                    the August 2014 Agreement fell within the submission to arbitration, I also
                    accepted the submission on behalf of PT BB and BB PLC that rule 24(n)
                    of the SIAC Rules permitted the tribunal to consider the legal effect of the
                    August 2014 Agreement. Rule 24(n) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Rule 24: Additional Powers of the
                        Tribunal</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.1  In addition to the
                            powers specified in these Rules and not in derogation of the mandatory
                            rules of law applicable to the arbitration, the Tribunal shall have the
                            power to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">n.    decide, where appropriate, any issue not
                                expressly or impliedly raised in the submissions filed under
                                Rule 17 provided such issue has been clearly brought to the
                                notice of the other party and that other party has been given
                                adequate opportunity to respond;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I accepted that the legal effect of the August
                    2014 Agreement was not separately an issue and was merely one aspect of the
                    broader issue of whether the Second Common Mistake rendered performance of the
                    Deed impossible. Even then, what was in issue was not whether the August 2014
                    Agreement itself contained the release by PTX but whether it demonstrated that
                    the Claimants could obtain such a release when required. As I pointed out
                    several times in the course of argument to counsel for Mr AA, there was no
                    dispute that PTX was controlled by PT BB. As a matter of practicality it
                    could not be denied that PT BB therefore had the power to compel PTX to
                    release Mr AA from Potential Claims to the extent that he transferred
                    assets or paid cash satisfying the same. The August 2014 Agreement was a sample
                    of what PT BB could procure from PTX. I was also satisfied that the issue
                    regarding what the August 2014 Agreement meant had been brought to
                    Mr AA’s notice and that he was given an opportunity to
                    respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The transcripts of the hearing before the
                    tribunal were adduced in evidence before me. These show that during the course
                    of the hearing, the tribunal had specifically queried the legal effect of the
                    August 2014 Agreement with the Claimants’ counsel, Mr Pymont. In answer,
                    Mr Pymont informed the tribunal that he was putting that agreement forward as a
                    piece of evidence which said that PT BB was able to deliver a release
                    because it was in charge of PTX. Mr AA’s counsel, Mr Moriaty,
                    responded to this point when he submitted to the tribunal shortly afterwards,
                    that the August 2014 Agreement was a separate agreement between BB PLC,
                    PT BB and PTX to which Mr AA was not a party and therefore he did not
                    have, ultimately, a right to ensure that he would get the release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It was clear from the transcript that the
                    issue of the legal effect of the August 2014 Agreement was raised during the
                    course of the Arbitration as part of the broader issue of whether the Deed could
                    be performed and that Mr AA’s counsel had made arguments on that in
                    the opening submissions. After the hearing, both parties made submissions on the
                    effect of the August 2014 Agreement. The Claimants’ submission was that
                    that agreement was a binding commitment from PTX to grant the required release
                    in the event that Mr AA made the payment he was obliged to make. In his
                    closing submission, Mr AA argued that neither the Deed nor the August 2014
                    Agreement granted Mr AA an automatic self-executing release. He also said
                    that contrary to what the Claimants had suggested, the UK Contracts (Rights of
                    Third Parties) Act 1999 (c 31) did not assist Mr AA to enforce the
                    obligation of PT BB to transfer assets to PTX under cl 2 of the August
                    2014 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the tribunal find that the August 2014 Agreement granted him a
                release?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr AA submitted that the tribunal fell
                    into error when it made a substantive finding that the August 2014 Agreement
                    validly granted him the necessary release under the Deed. In this respect,
                    Mr AA relied on the following portion of para 163 of the Award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Even though [PTX] is not a party to the Deed, <u>the Claimants have procured by the agreement of 18 August 2014 that
                            [PTX] will give [Mr AA] a full release of any Potential Claims that
                            it may have against him</u>. Accordingly, the Claimants have
                        demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that they are able to
                        perform their obligations under the Deed if and when [Mr AA] transfers
                        the Assets. [emphasis added by Mr AA]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It was Mr AA’s position that the above paragraph
                        contained the finding of the tribunal and that that finding clearly exceeded
                        the scope of the submission to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I was not able to accept this argument. It
                    ignored the first sentence of para 163 (and the context set out in the preceding
                    paragraphs) and thereby cast a slant on the succeeding sentences which the
                    tribunal obviously (to my mind at least) never intended them to have. The first
                    sentence of para 163 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to establish a common mistake, [Mr AA] must satisfy the
                        Tribunal that, among other things, the non-existence of the state of
                        affairs, that is, a self-executing release, renders performance of the
                        contract impossible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Thus, it was clearly within the context of
                    whether Mr AA could satisfy the tribunal that the non-existence of a
                    self-executing release renders the performance of the Deed impossible that the
                    tribunal went on in the second sentence to consider the evidence that the
                    Claimants had adduced showing their ability to perform the contract. The August
                    2014 Agreement showed to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the Claimants had
                    the power to compel PTX to release Mr AA from Potential Claims when he
                    transferred the assets. With this evidence before them, the tribunal was not
                    able to find that performance of the contractual obligations of the Claimants
                    under the Deed was impossible. When para 163 of the Award is read as a whole
                    together with the preceding paragraphs (see [23] above) it is impossible to find
                    support in it for the interpretation which Mr AA contended for. The
                    tribunal did not consider the August 2014 Agreement to be an actual release.
                    Indeed, how could it be since Mr AA had not transferred the requisite
                    assets or cash? All that the August 2014 Agreement showed was that an actual
                    release would be granted by PTX when it was necessary to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     To repeat, the tribunal considered the August
                    2014 Agreement as evidence that cl 2.1 of the Deed could be performed (<em>ie</em>, there was no impossibility of performance under limb
                    (d) of the <em>Great Peace Shipping</em> test). That was
                    the only finding by the tribunal in relation to the August 2014 Agreement. This
                    finding related to the pleaded issue of the Second Common Mistake and therefore
                    was well within the submission to arbitration. The tribunal held that the Deed
                    itself did not need to effect a release and that Mr AA could be given the
                    release to which he was entitled if and when he transferred the assets. There
                    was no mistake as to the nature of the release and no impossibility of
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was Mr AA prejudiced?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The fourth point which Mr AA made
                    regarding how he was prejudiced by the tribunal’s finding in relation to
                    the August 2014 Agreement had also to be rejected. That argument of prejudice
                    was premised on my agreeing that the tribunal had made a finding that the legal
                    effect of the August 2014 Agreement was to provide an actual release by PTX.
                    Since I did not agree with that proposition, the assertion that Mr AA was
                    prejudiced by having no opportunity to deal with the validity and legal effect
                    of the agreement also fell away. In any case, it was not correct factually to
                    say that he had no opportunity to make submissions on the August 2014 Agreement.
                    As stated above, Mr AA and his counsel were aware of the Agreement from 18
                    August 2014 and had the opportunity before, during and after the hearing of the
                    arbitration to make whatever submissions they wanted to on its nature, effect
                    and validity. Indeed they made use of this opportunity though perhaps not as
                    extensively as they could have. The Note on the Claimants’ rebuttal which
                    was served on 2 October 2014 contained no reference to the August 2014 Agreement
                    though there was nothing to prevent Mr AA’s lawyers from dealing with
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a breach of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr AA submitted that the tribunal had
                    breached the rules of natural justice by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     making a finding that the August
                        2014 Agreement provided Mr AA with a valid release from Potential
                        Claims by PTX, an issue which was outside the scope of submission to the
                        Arbitration and which Mr AA had not been given an opportunity to
                        address; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     relying on the August 2014 Agreement as a valid release mechanism in
                        determining the issue of common mistake, without giving Mr AA an
                        opportunity to submit on the effect of the August 2014 Agreement on the
                        Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I had no hesitation in dismissing both these
                    contentions. First, as I have already mentioned, the tribunal did not find that
                    the August 2014 Agreement itself constituted a release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Second, the documents put before me indicated
                    that Mr AA was afforded ample opportunity to be heard on the issue of the
                    legal effect of the August 2014 Agreement (so far as it was an issue) but simply
                    chose not to pursue that point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     To reiterate the facts briefly, when
                    Mr AA was first informed of the existence of the August 2014 Agreement and
                    that the Claimants wished to adduce it in evidence, he did not object to this.
                    He was satisfied to put in a caveat that he did not admit the validity or legal
                    effect of the document. During the course of the hearing, his counsel elaborated
                    on his concerns about the enforceability of the August 2014 Agreement and the
                    tribunal itself raised queries on this point. As I have stated above, after the
                    hearing was concluded the parties made submissions on the legal effect and
                    nature of the August 2014 Agreement. In fact, during the tribunal’s
                    closing remarks on 28 August 2014, the tribunal specifically directed parties to
                    submit on how the August 2014 Agreement was to be treated. The parties were thus
                    notified that the tribunal was interested in how that agreement was to be
                    handled in the context of the issues to be decided in the Arbitration. Both
                    parties had experienced and competent counsel who would have considered this
                    point and how it should be dealt with in the course of their respective
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Counsel for PT BB and BB PLC
                    submitted before me that Mr AA did not pursue the question of the legal
                    effect of the August 2014 Agreement further simply because it was a dead-end
                    point for him: the real issue before the tribunal was whether the Claimants
                    could procure a release by PTX. The Claimants had openly said that if there was
                    a genuine problem with doing so by way of the August 2014 Agreement, they could
                    address that by way of an amended or further document. Mr AA had argued
                    that he could not himself enforce the August 2014 Agreement because he was not a
                    party to it. However, in response, the Claimants had offered to make him a party
                    to it if he wanted this; but he did not take up this offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I was satisfied on the facts that Mr AA
                    had a full opportunity to be heard on the issue of the August 2014 Agreement. If
                    he now thinks that he did not make full use of that opportunity, that is not a
                    ground on which to allege a denial of natural justice. Mr AA had every
                    opportunity to make further submissions or adduce further evidence in relation
                    to the August 2014 Agreement but he chose not to do so. He also had the
                    opportunity to file rebuttal submissions but he did not do so. Where a party has
