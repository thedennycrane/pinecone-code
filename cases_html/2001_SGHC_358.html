<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.

        The plaintiffs, Ong &amp; Co, a firm of

stockbrokers, instituted this action to recover from their former dealer, Ms Vivien Lai

Siew Ping, losses arising from transactions handled by her on behalf of three of her

clients. Ms Lai, who contended that she was not obliged to indemnify the company for the

losses, also asserted that the bulk of the losses would not have occurred had Ong &amp; Co

not released to one of her clients money which she had arranged to be put into the

company’s clients’ account as collateral for that client’s transactions.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. BACKGROUND</font></p></b><u xmlns=""><i>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        By a letter of appointment dated 9 September

1996, Ong &amp; Co offered to employ Ms Lai as an Assistant Dealing Director (Dealer

Grade). One of the terms of the letter of appointment was that she would indemnify the

company for losses resulting from her own clients’ trading activities. On the same

day, Ms Lai accepted the terms and conditions set out in the letter of appointment. Until

31 May 2000, she was a dealer at Ong &amp; Co. However, from 1 June 2000 to 8 October

2000, Ms Lai traded as a remisier pursuant to an agency agreement dated 1 June 2000 with

Ong &amp; Co. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        Ong &amp; Co’s claim concerns losses

incurred while Ms Lai was a dealer. As at 30 September 2000, an amount of $720,062.00 in

contra losses was owed by three of her clients. The first, Mr Yuan Xu, owed the company

$7,835.31. The second, Mr Tay Kong Kiong, owed the company $1,152.80. The third, Mr New

Aik Keong, owed the company $711,073.89. Ong &amp; Co failed to recover its losses from

these clients. Not having been indemnified by Ms Lai, who resigned from the company on 8

October 2000, the company instituted this action and claimed the sum of $720,062.00 plus

interest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        In her counterclaim against Ong &amp; Co, Ms

Lai sought to recover, inter alia, unpaid bonuses, her salary for May 1999 and damages.

During the trial, she withdrew her counterclaim as well as her assertion that she had been

promised a letter of release from her obligation to indemnify the company for the losses

in question upon her resignation from the company. Her counsel, Mr Chia Ti Lik, also

confirmed that she accepted that the three clients in question were her own clients even

though they were initially "walk-in clients", who opened trading accounts with

the company. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">B. WHETHER THE INDEMNITY IS VALID</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        Ms Lai’s assertion that the indemnity

furnished by her to Ong &amp; Co is invalid will first be considered. The relevant part of

clause 10 of Ms Lai’s letter of appointment, which concerns her obligation to

indemnify the company for her clients’ losses, states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You shall be answerable and

    responsible to the Company and will keep the Company fully indemnified and harmless

    against any and all losses or damage the Company may sustain as a consequence of or in

    connection with or howsoever arising from any and all transactions dealt by or through you

    (hereinafter called "the Losses" which expression shall not include losses

    arising from or in connection with transactions by institutional clients as defined and

    excluded hereinafter) except where such transactions are pursuant to instructions of and

    for such clients as are designated by the Company as Institutional Clients, i.e banks,

    financial institutions, stockbroking companies and firms public listed companies and its

    subsidiary companies government related companies Statutory Boards Venture Capital Funds

    Licensed investment Advisors and insurance companies so long as such Institutional Clients

    trade within the trading limits approved by the Company in writing and notified to you

    from time to time. If any Institutional Client trades over the trading limit approved by

    the Company, you shall be answerable and responsible to the Company and will keep the

    Company fully indemnified and harmless for all Losses incurred under such …

    transactions which were entered into in excess of the trading limit.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        Ms Lai’s position on the effect of the

indemnity furnished by her to the company is summed up in para 2 of her amended Defence as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Defendant, however, avers

    that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to rely on clauses 10 to 15 of the said contract on

    the reason that the Defendant was employed as a dealer and not a remisier. The Defendant

    further avers that under the Rules and Bye-Laws of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES),

    the SES intended that dealers:-</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">a. be treated as employees by

    their broking houses;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">b. be distinguished from

    remisiers who were not employees but were independent agents; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">c. not be held liable to

    indemnify their employers for any losses whatsoever.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        No evidence was tendered as to how the rules of

the Stock Exchange forbade dealers from indemnifying their employers for losses arising

from the handling of their own clients’ transactions. Ms Lai merely said that when

she signed the letter of appointment containing the indemnity clause, she thought it

"weird" that a dealer had to indemnify a broking house for losses. In her

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she claimed that her former general manager at Lum Chang

Securities told her that an indemnity clause is inapplicable to dealers because they are

different from remisiers. However, the general manager in question, Mr Yeung Pak Nang,

testified that what Ms Lai said was untrue. He said that he did not hold the view that an

indemnity clause is not applicable to dealers. He added that in the past, dealers at Lum

Chang Securities were orally informed that they were required to indemnify the company

against losses incurred by their own clients and that this is now a written rule.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        It is evident that there are differences

between dealers and remisiers. Some of the differences were referred to by Yong Pung How

CJ in <i>Associated Asian Securities Pte Ltd v Lee Kam Wah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6798&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 1 SLR 585</a>. All the

same, it must be borne in mind that apart from dealing with institutional clients, a

dealer may also act on behalf of his or her own clients. In paras 14 and 15 of his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Charles Tan, Ong &amp; Co’s credit manager,

explained:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14. Apart from institutional

    clients of the firm, the Dealers are also allowed to service certain other individual

    clients who open an account with them. These clients are usually the Dealer’s own

    contacts and are <u>not </u>institutional clients of the Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15. As these non-institutional

    clients are essentially the Dealer’s own contacts who are individuals, the

    stockbroking company will require the Dealers to keep them <u>fully indemnified</u>

    against any loss or damage which the stockbroking house may sustain as a consequence of

    any transactions dealt with by the Dealer concerned for such non-institutional clients.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        The indemnity clause in Ms Lai’s contract

clearly distinguishes institutional clients from her own clients. In respect of

institutional clients, such as banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, fund

managers, statutory boards and public listed companies, who are recognised as

creditworthy, the company’s risk is lessened and Ms Lai is not held responsible for

losses arising from their transactions so long as the approved trading limits for the

institutional clients have not been exceeded. On the other hand, Ms Lai, who benefits

financially from her own clients’ transactions, is expected to ensure that her own

non-institutional clients’ transactions do not cause loss to the company. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        Contrary to what Ms Lai asserted, there is no

rule that a dealer cannot be required to indemnify a stockbroking firm for losses arising

from the handling of his or her own client’s transactions or for the unauthorised

handling of the transactions of institutional clients. As such, dealers have been held

liable to indemnify their employers in many cases, including <i>Kim Eng Securities Pte Ltd

v Lee Kia Khen </i>(Suit No 940 of 1993), <i>Lee &amp; Co (Stock &amp; Sharebrokers) Pte

Ltd v Chia Kwok Yun </i>(Suit No 2254 of 1996) and <i>RHB-Cathay Securities Pte Ltd v

Shapy Khan s/o Sher Khan</i> (Suit No 1704 of 1999).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        The terms of the indemnity clause in Ms

Lai’s contract are unambiguous. The approach to be taken in the face of such clear

contractual terms was outlined in<i> Associated Asian Securities Pte Ltd v Lee Kam Wah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6798&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 1 SLR 585</a>, 587 by Yong Pung How CJ, who said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Normally when contractual terms

    are clear and unambiguous they are taken at face value unless there is some compelling

    reason why they should not be. The fact that a term may put what appears to be a

    disproportionate or unfair burden upon one party is not regarded as a sufficient reason to

    interfere with its interpretation if it is in itself clear, because parties who contracted

    on equal terms must be left free to apportion risks as they see fit. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        In view of the aforesaid, Ms Lai’s

contention that the terms of the indemnity are inapplicable cannot be countenanced. <b> </b></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">C. WHETHER ONG &amp; CO WAS

NEGLIGENT</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        In relation to two of her clients, namely Mr

Yuan Xu and Mr Tay Kong Kiong, the invalidity of the indemnity is Ms Lai’s only

defence. However, in relation to Mr New Aik Keong ("NAK"), Ms Lai contended that

even if the indemnity clause in her contract of appointment is valid, she is not liable to

Ong &amp; Co because NAK’s losses would not have accrued but for the company’s

negligence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        In her Defence and Counterclaim and in her

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Ms Lai alleged that Ong &amp; Co erred in handling

NAK’s account in a number of ways. However, her counsel, Mr Chia, confirmed during

the trial that notwithstanding what had been pleaded, it was not part of Ms Lai’s

case that the company was negligent when interviewing NAK before allowing him to open a

trading account or when approving Ms Lai’s numerous applications for an increase of

his trading limits. He said that Ms Lai would rely on her assertion that the company

misapplied money that should have remained in or ought to have been put into the

clients’ account as collateral for NAK’s debts. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        At this juncture, a few words ought to be said

about the clients’ account. Stockbroking firms are not allowed to mix money belonging

to their clients with their own funds. As such, they place money belonging to clients in a

clients’ account. Ms Lai said that the company would have had sufficient collateral

to cover NAK’s losses if it did not misapply three sums of money which should have

remained in or should have been banked into the clients’ account. The three sums are

as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) A sum of $473,312.43 which

    was handed over to NAK by Ong &amp; Co on 5 July 1999;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) NAK’s cheque for

    $116,184.51, which was used to pay for 100,000 Scotts shares purchased by him; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) NAK’s cheque for

    $200,000, which was used to pay for three lots of shares awaiting collection by him.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ong &amp; Co’s cheque for

S$473,312.43</font></p></i>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        On 5 July 1999, a sum of S$473,312.43 in the

clients’ account was released by Ong &amp; Co to NAK. Ms Lai, who said that this was

done without her knowledge and consent, contended that the company acted without prudence

or logic when it handed over this sum to NAK. She pointed out that NAK had signed a

document authorising the company to utilise money in the clients’ account to satisfy

any sum owed by him in connection with his trading activities and added that had this sum

not been handed over to NAK, the company would have reduced its loss by this amount. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        Ong &amp; Co, which contended that money in the

clients’ account was not treated as collateral for a client’s trading

activities, asserted that Ms Lai’s assertions were baseless as she gave instructions

to its Finance Department to release the S$473,312.43 to NAK. Ms Lau Mui Ling, the

company’s deputy finance manager, stated as follows in paras 11-16 of her affidavit

of evidence-in-chief:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11. The phone call from the

    Defendant’s client, NAK, was directed to me by the operator on 5 July 1999. This was

    the first time I was speaking to this client….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12. [NAK] complained to me that

    …. he did not know why the monies were placed into trust instead of being released to

    him. I told him that I would have to check with the Defendant and would get back to him on

    his request.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13 I immediately called the

    Defendant and told her about NAK’s request for a refund of his trust monies. The

    Defendant told me that she will only release a figure of about $100,000….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14. After this conversation with

    the Defendant, I called NAK and told him that I will issue a cheque for the figure as

    indicated by the Defendant. NAK was upset and commented that the monies belonged to him

    and insisted that he wanted the full sum. I told him to call the Defendant directly as I

    cannot release the full sum without her approval….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15. I believe it was after lunch

    that NAK called me again and simply informed me that he would come down at about 4 p.m. to

    collect the cheque. I asked him whether he had contacted the Defendant about releasing the

    full amount of the trust monies but he claimed he could not get hold of her. I told him

    that I will have to call the Defendant again and will get back to him if I still cannot

    get the Defendant’s approval.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16. I then called the Defendant

    again … I also told her that NAK had insisted that he was coming down at 4 p.m. and

    that she should make a decision quickly …. The Defendant paused for a short while and

    then gave her approval to release the full amount. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        Madam Lorinda Soong, the company’s finance

manager, confirmed that Ms Lau spoke to her on 5 July 1999 about NAK’s demand for the

release of his money in the clients’ account and her conversation with Ms Lai. When

cross-examined, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. What did Ms Lau tell you?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Just before lunch, she told me

    that NAK had called her, insisting on a full refund of the trust money but the dealer was

    only willing to release $100,000. She said that she asked the client to call the dealer

    himself to sort this out as she could not release the full amount unless the dealer

    approved….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Did she speak to you before

    and after the release of the trust money?</font></p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        Ms Lai categorically denied that Ms Lau or

anyone from the Finance Department had spoken to her about the release of the money in the

clients’ account. In para 73 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she stated:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The general manager alleged that

    Ms Lau Mui Ling spoke to me thrice on the refund and that I had agreed to it. This was

    untrue. Lau Mui Ling had never consulted me and therefore I could not have consented to

    the release. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        Ms Lai also alleged that Ms Lau had negotiated

with NAK for some time over the release of the trust money without her knowledge. In para

45 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… I went back and called Lau

    Mui Ling and asked her why she did so. She said that [NAK] had approached her over several

    days demanding that the money be refunded threatening to complain to the authorities if

    she did not comply. After trying unsuccessfully to bargain with [NAK] to retain half of

    the trust account monies, she gave in and refunded the entire sum of trust monies. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        When cross-examined, Ms Lai reiterated that she

knew nothing about the release of the money in the clients’ account at the material

time. She said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Is it still your evidence that

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Is it still your evidence that

    no one from the Finance Department called you on 5 July 1999 about the release of the

    trust money?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        To prove that Ms Lai lied when she said that

she did not know about NAK’s request for a refund of the money in the clients’

account and that no one from the Finance Department spoke to her about this matter, the

company’s counsel, Mr Andrew Ong, arranged for a tape recording of Ms Lai’s

conversation with NAK on 5 July 1999 to be heard in court. Both parties accepted the

authenticity of the tape recording and that the said conversation between Ms Lai and NAK

took place on the afternoon of 5 July 1999. The following part of the taped conversation

certainly undermines the credibility of Ms Lai’s evidence:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NAK: You turn off the bloody

    line, how am I going to call you to sell?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ms Lai: Oh, not that I turn off.

    I didn’t turn off. Was at a meeting. Just came out. <u><i>You called the Finance

    Department, is it? The Finance Department called me.</i></u></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        When questioned about the taped conversation,

Ms Lai finally admitted that she knew that NAK had called the Finance Department on 5 July

1999 and that the Finance Department’s staff called her on the same day. As for who

from the Finance Department had called her, Ms Lai, who had earlier denied that Ms Lau had

called her, subsequently shifted her position and admitted that Ms Lau or her assistant

could have called her. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        As for what NAK had called the Finance

Department about, the following part of the transcript of the taped conversation sheds

some light on the position:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NAK: I am requesting to pull out

    the thing also, because since you can’t do also I cannot just leave the money with

    you….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ms Lai: They said they can only

    re ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NAK: No, they did not say….

    Because its my money…. What do you mean they say they can… there’s no can

    or cannot, its my money.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ms Lai: Uh Huh.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NAK: I have the full authority to

    say that I want to pull out, you see? I think it’s a very clear cut kind of

    situation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ms Lai: Uh Huh.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        Although it was obvious that NAK had called the

Finance Department about the release of his money in the clients’ account, Ms Lai

claimed that she could not remember what his call was about. When questioned by me, she

said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ct. What did NAK call the Finance

    Department about?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.    I cannot remember. He could

    have called to enquire about the movement of his trust funds.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ct. If this was so, did the

    Finance Department call you to discuss this matter.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.    Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ct. Are you saying that the

    Finance Department called you about the movement of NAK’s trust funds?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. They could have called.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        Having conceded that NAK and someone from the

Finance Department called her about the movement of funds in the clients’ account, Ms

Lai tried to salvage her position by saying that by "movement", she meant the

transfer of money in the clients’ account to pay for NAK’s contra losses. This

cannot be so because it is clear from the taped conversation that NAK was only talking

about the release of money in the clients’ account and not payment of contra losses.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        Ms Lau, the company’s deputy finance

manager, is an experienced senior staff member who knew that it is the company’s

policy to have the dealer’s consent before releasing trust money to his or her

client. The defendant’s own witness, Mr Tang Loon Kong, a former credit officer in

Ong &amp; Co, agreed that it was up to the dealer whether to refund the money in question.

In para 17 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus, a decision to refund cannot

    be unilaterally taken by either party. Therefore, in that situation, not only is the

    consent of the remisier/dealer required, I would go further to say that the

    remisier/dealer has the final say as to whether to refund trust monies. If the sanctity of

    this rule is not jealously guarded, the entire system will fail like in this case.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        When cross-examined and when questioned by me,

Mr Tang reiterated that it was Ms Lai who had the final say as to whether the $473,312.43

should have been refunded to NAK.</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. In paragraph 17 of your

    affidavit of evidence-in-chief, you state that the dealer has the final say in the release

    of trust money?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ct. Are you saying that if Ms

    Vivien Lai had instructed the Finance Department to pay the $473,000 to NAK, the money

    could be paid to him as she had the final say?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.

        Having had the opportunity to listen to the

witnesses, I have no doubt whatsoever that Ms Lai knew about NAK’s request for the

release of the $473,312,43 in the clients’ account and that she had agreed to release

the said sum to him. Both Ms Lau and Ms Soong were truthful witnesses and I accept that

there is no reason whatsoever for Ms Lau to negotiate with NAK and take the risk of

releasing money in the clients’ account to NAK without Ms Lai’s consent. In

contrast, Ms Lai’s evidence on this issue left much to be desired. As Ong &amp; Co

released the sum of $473,312.43 to NAK on 5 July 1999 on Ms Lai’s instructions, her

complaint regarding the misapplication by Ong &amp; Co of this sum of money must be

dismissed.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NAK’s cheque for $116,184.51</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        Ms Lai next contended that a cheque for

$116,184.51, which she collected from NAK and handed to the company on 8 July 1999, was

misapplied when it was used to pay for Scotts shares bought by NAK on 1 July 1999. In para

53 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she stated:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When I handed over the [cheque

    for $116,184.51] to Ms Lorinda Soong, I relinquished all control and influence over the

    monies to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs alone had the power to decide what to do with the

    money to reduce their risk. However, after taking possession of the [cheque], Lorinda

    Soong … used the cheque for $116,154.51 to pick up … shares….</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.

        Ms Lai’s assertion made no sense at all.

When cross-examined, she confirmed that she had told Ms Soong that the cheque for

$116,184.51 was intended to pay for the Scotts shares in question. There can be no doubt

that NAK gave her the cheque to pay for these shares, which cost him exactly $116,184.51.

Ms Lai was in fact suggesting that although her client had given her a cheque to pay for

Scotts shares purchased on 1 July 1999 and she had informed Ms Soong about this, Ong &amp;

Co should have disregarded her instructions and the client’s wishes by banking the

said cheque into the company’s clients’ account as collateral for NAK’s

trading losses. It is surprising that she made such an assertion when in reply to my

question as to whether Ong &amp; Co had acted correctly, she stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ct. Did the company act correctly

    when it used the cheque for $116,184.51 to pay for the Scotts shares?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.    Yes, because NAK wrote on

    the back of the cheque that it was for this purpose.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.

        Ms Lai’s contention that Ong &amp; Co

caused its own loss by using NAK’s cheque for $116,184.51 to pay for the Scotts

shares in question must thus be rejected.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">NAK’s cheque for $200,000 </font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.

        When Ms Lai handed over NAK’s cheque for

$116,184.51 to Ms Soong on 8 July 1999, she also handed her another cheque given to her by

NAK. This second cheque for the sum of $200,000 was banked into the clients’ account

on Ms Lai’s instructions. Four days later, $271,972.74 of NAK’s money in this

account was used to pay for the following shares purchased by him:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) 193,000 Kian Ann shares -

    $177,504.45</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) 50,000 Kian Ann shares - $

    46,024.20</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) 45,000 Scotts shares - $

    48,444.09</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        Ms Lai contended that the use of the

$271,972.74 from the cliients’ account to pay for the above shares purchased by NAK

negated her effort in collecting the cheque for $200,000 from NAK. Ms Lai initially

claimed that NAK had given her the cheque for $200,000 for the purpose of putting the

funds in the clients’ account. When cross-examined, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. What did you tell NAK the

    $200,000 was for?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.    For trust account.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q.    Was it to cover the shares

    which he had already bought and were awaiting collection?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.    No, it was for trust

    account.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.

        It is most unlikely that NAK would have handed

over a cheque for $200,000 to Ms Lai for the purpose of having it put into the

clients’ account when he had insisted in rather abrasive terms a few days earlier, on

5 July 1999, on his right to withdraw all his money from the clients’ account. Ms Lai

subsequently changed her position altogether and conceded that NAK had given her the

$200,000 to pay for shares which he had purchased earlier on. When cross-examined, she

said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q.    Was the $200,000 cheque

    given to you to pick up the shares of NAK that were awaiting collection? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.    Yes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q.    Was the $200,000 cheque

    given to you by NAK to cover the $473,999 that was released to him?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. No.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.

        Ms Lai’s <i>volte face</i> is most

unsatisfactory. When cross-examined, she also changed her original position as to whether

she had given instructions for the money to be used to pay for NAK’s shares when she

said as follows:</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><u>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></blockquote></u></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">Q. I put it to you that

    the company would not have picked up NAK’s SAC position without consulting you.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. I do not recall whether they

    consulted me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. I put it to you that the 3

    transactions in question were picked up on your instructions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. I do not recall whether I gave

    any instructions or not.</font><i><u></u></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.

        I have no doubt that Ms Lai gave instructions

for NAK’s money in the clients’ account to be used to pick up the three lots of

shares awaiting collection on 12 July 1999. By doing so, she was carrying out NAK’s

specific instructions. As such, her assertion that she did not know about the withdrawal

of $271,972.74 on 12 July 1999 to pay for the said three lots of shares cannot be

believed.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">D. CONCLUSION</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.

        For reasons already stated, Ms Lai is obliged

to indemnify Ong &amp; Co for the losses incurred as a result of the trading activities of

Mr Xuan Yu, Mr Tay Kong Kiong and Mr New Aik Keong. She is also liable for interest on the

amount due to the company.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.

        As for costs, in accordance with clause 14 of

Ms Lai’s letter of appointment, the company is entitled to costs on an indemnity

basis.</font></p>
