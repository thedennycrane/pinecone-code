If the answer is “yes”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presumption of resulting trust arises). If the answer is “no”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the same manner as that in which the legal interest is held. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Regardless of whether the answer to (a) is “yes” or “no”, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set out in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, then: (i) there will be no resulting trust on the facts where the property is registered in Y’s sole name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Y will be entitled to the property absolutely); and (ii) the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property jointly where the property is registered in their joint names. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Notwithstanding the situation at the time the property was acquired, is there sufficient and compelling evidence of a subsequent express or inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in a proportion which is different from that in which the beneficial interest was held at the time of acquisition of the property? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion.

That meant negating the existence of a constructive trust or proprietary estoppel. Thus, while the Defendant asserted a constructive trust and proprietary estoppel, in assessing the Plaintiff’s claim, I had to consider whether she made out her contentions on the balance of probabilities. The legal burden insofar as her claim was concerned did not shift to the Defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Defendant’s positive assertion of a right to the Property would have had to be proven on the balance of probabilities too, but in the present case, it would have followed from the rejection of the Plaintiff’s claim that he would be entitled to an interest. Thus, he did not bear the legal burden of proving that the Plaintiff was not entitled to the whole of the beneficial interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The nature of the relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Plaintiff and Defendant were never legally married. The Plaintiff’s position was that while they had lived together, they were only flat mates and business partners. The Defendant argued that they were in an intimate, loving relationship, and that the Property was purchased against that background, with the objective of it being used as their retirement home as a couple.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Defendant put great score on the relationship between the parties. I understood that what the Defendant was primarily trying to show was that it was likely that a common intention constructive trust was formed because of the state of the relationship between the parties. The existence of a relationship was also invoked as a basis for the presumption of advancement to apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The nature of the relationship may have coloured the arrangements between the parties, but I did not find in the end that the relationship was particularly integral to the outcome. Some time was also spent at trial on the history of their working life, including the involvement of the Defendant in the running of the companies. As I will elaborate further in a later section (see [53] to [58]), I did not think this really assisted the Defendant’s case as the extent of the Defendant’s involvement could not lead to any conclusion on the existence or otherwise of a common intention constructive trust.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 That said, I accepted that the relationship between the parties was at least initially more than one of business. There was probably a relationship of some intimacy at the start which persisted for a considerable period of time, though it may have eventually come to an end. On the whole, I was satisfied that there was a relationship of some closeness if not intimacy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This was, as argued by the Defendant, borne out by the exhibited photographs

One would have expected there to either be some specific details about the reaching of a common intention, or failing that some indication of why despite the absence of a specific discussion, a common intention was formed nonetheless.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I could not accept that just because the right of survivorship accrued from the Property being legally held in joint tenancy, it therefore followed that the Plaintiff evinced an intention to give a half share in equity as well or that there was a common intention to share the Property beneficially in a proportion different from the parties’ respective contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Even if the Plaintiff and Defendant intended for the right of survivorship to operate upon the demise of one party in deciding to hold the Property as joint tenants, this did not mean that the parties also intended for the beneficial interest to be held in equal shares, or in any particular proportion while both parties were alive. The former discloses an intention that on the death of one party, the other would be entitled automatically to the property, rather than an intention to share the beneficial interest in the property equally while both parties are alive. The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew</span> [2012] 2 SLR 831, at [39], is instructive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The intended consequences of the rule of survivorship operate after the death of one tenant, and say nothing whatsoever about what should happen while both tenants are alive. This is not to say that the rule of survivorship is incompatible with an intention that the joint tenants should also hold the property beneficially during their lifetimes. What this means is that the rule of survivorship sheds no light on the tenants’ intentions as to their beneficial interests in the property while both are alive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In addition, the right of survivorship may entitle the surviving owner to a share of the property, but what is gained is only at law; it may be that even where the right of survivorship operates to make the sole surviving owner the sole registered proprietor of the property, the survivor may not be entitled to the whole of the beneficial interest. Such would be the case for instance where a resulting trust operates in favour of the deceased’s estate, which is not displaced by a common intention constructive trust, intention to gift or presumption of advancement (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 at [116]). Where co-owners have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property, how the beneficial interest in the property is to be apportioned upon the death of one party is still to be determined by undertaking the steps set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> (see above at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The upshot is that adding a person as a joint owner does not by itself support a common intention to share the beneficial interest equally; something more has to be shown to indicate a common intention than the mere fact that both parties are registered as joint owners at law. A joint tenancy may be used for many reasons: the fact that property is held jointly at law could not control the disposition in equity. What matters in equity is whether some basis is given for the beneficial interest to be held in any way other than in proportion to the contributions; a common intention constructive trust supplies one such reason. It is entirely conceivable for property to be held jointly at law, but with different interests in equity: that is the whole consequence of different interests being held in law and in equity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Therefore, the Defendant’s attempts to rely on a decision made by the parties to be legal joint tenants

Any failure or omission to remove the Defendant as a joint owner thus did not support the existence of any common intention to share the beneficial interest in the Property equally either.

Even if such contributions were made, that would not support the conclusion that there was a common intention constructive trust.

Though much time was spent on these events, any linkage was, to my mind, tenuous. Such assistance and support, even if rendered, need not lead to a common intention being formed; conversely, a common intention may be formed without there having been such assistance and support.

</div> In the light of my finding that there was no common intention to begin with, I will only deal with this alternative plea briefly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Firstly, to be clear, there was insufficient evidence to establish on the balance of probabilities that a common intention was reached at the point of purchase of the Property. If I was wrong on this, I did find that there was sufficient evidence of a change in common intention as argued for by the Plaintiff. I note that such a subsequent common intention would need to be common to all parties, and a unilateral understanding is not sufficient. In <span class="font-italic">Su Em</span><span class="font-italic">manuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>”), the Court of Appeal stated at [84]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The evidence in this case unequivocally militates against the finding of any common intention between the parties that Priya was to have more than a 49% interest in the Property for the reasons we have set out at [80]–[82] above. Nor is there any basis to find a <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> common intention to <span class="font-italic">vary</span> the beneficial interests in the Property from the proportions held by the parties when Priya entered the picture in 2004. Priya argues that there was a common intention to vary the beneficial interest when it became evident that she alone was making the mortgage repayments under the second mortgage. Even if we assume that Priya believed all along that <span class="font-italic">her</span> beneficial interest in the Property would be increased by virtue of her repayment of the second mortgage, for a common intention constructive trust to be found, the intention to vary the beneficial interest must in fact be <span class="font-italic">common</span> to all the parties involved. Yet it is clear in this case that Su <span class="font-italic">never</span> intended to reduce her interest in the Property from that which vested in her in 2004. In fact, as we have noted, Su had wished to retain her 50% interest in the Property in the belief that she would, as a result of this, be in a position to block any intended sale. In the light of this, we are satisfied that no common intention constructive trust can arise. It may also be noted that when the parties contemplated selling the Property for $1.6m, Priya’s position, … was that the net proceeds would be shared in the proportions in which they held the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Plaintiff gave evidence that in or about February 2009, she had informed the Defendant that she intended to retire and to wind up Zawana Fashion due to the poor performance of the business arising from the economic downturn. As she would not have a steady income, she had made a final request to the Defendant to contribute towards the financing of the Property, to which the Defendant responded that he had no money and that the Property was hers and she had to deal with it. The Plaintiff shortly thereafter took steps to redeem the Property in order to prevent the accruing of interest.

Without such contribution, there is little basis for a constructive trust to be imposed, unless the party asserting the constructive trust is able to show some other form of detrimental reliance, since it would otherwise be in response to a bare promise. As noted in John McGhee, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 24-057:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Simple proof of the oral or inferred agreement between the parties or an unwritten declaration of trust would not be enough to entitle the claimant to an enforceable interest in the property under a trust. Such an arrangement could only take effect as an express trust. It would be unenforceable since it would not be evidenced by writing signed by the party declaring the trust. Accordingly, proof that the claimant has acted to his detriment in reliance upon the agreement that he would take an interest in the property is essential to explaining the constructive trust. In these circumstances it would be fraudulent for the proprietor of the legal estate to rely on the formality requirements to deny the enforceability of the beneficial interest and claim the entire beneficial rights to the property for himself. The constructive trust arises to prevent this result. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I was satisfied that it was more probable than not that no contributions or very negligible contributions were in fact made by the Defendant towards the Property.

However, I did not find that this was as extensive or deep as the Defendant alleged. In addition, I was satisfied that it was more probable than not that the Plaintiff’s contributions towards the Property were not derived from company funds.

While the legal burden fell on the Plaintiff to make out that she alone financed the Property, it was incumbent on the Defendant, in the face of the Plaintiff’s affidavit, her testimony at trial, and the documents adduced showing payments from her personal bank account, to bring in evidence that would point to the companies being a source of the funds. The Defendant failed to adduce any such evidence. He gave evidence of his involvement in the companies, but did not introduce into evidence any detail in relation to the flow of funds from the companies. It was not enough for the Defendant to merely raise the possibility that the funds could have come from the companies. The Defendant testified after all that he could not remember any transfer of money or income derived from the companies.

Furthermore, I also accepted the Plaintiff’s assertion that the payment requested for the repairs to Casa Marina was made on an approximate basis. She had testified:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I therefore rejected the Defendant’s account that the money was for the renovation of the Property. In any event, moneys spent on renovations to the Property do not constitute direct contributions giving rise to a presumption of resulting trust under all circumstances. In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”), the Court of Appeal recognised, at [126], that payments made towards the renovation of the property could be considered as contributions towards the purchase price <span class="font-italic">if such renovations </span><span class="font-italic">were carried out closely after the purchase of the property and increased the value of the property</span>. Evidence would need to be brought in to show that the renovation work did indeed lead to an increase in the value of the property. In this case, even if I accepted that the money was used for the renovation of the Property, there was no evidence adduced to show that the renovation increased the value of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Further, there was nothing to show that such payment, though not directly related to the purchase price, was meant to substitute for or allow for the release of other funds to pay for the purchase price of the Property. It is also doubtful that such payment would constitute direct contributions giving rise to a presumption of resulting trust. Direct payments that count are payments that go directly to the purchase price, the mortgage, or renovations carried out closely after the purchase of the property which increase the value of the property (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [112]–[117], [126]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> at [53]–[57]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Resulting trust and the presumption of advancement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Where there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presumption of resulting trust arises). The basis for the presumption of resulting trust in such circumstances has been expressed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> at [78]–[79] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he doctrinal basis for the presumption of resulting trust is that an intention on the part of the payor of the purchase price to benefit the recipient (who receives property in his legal name but who has not paid for the property) will not be readily inferred … Put simply, a resulting trust arises by operation of law unless the court is satisfied that there was indeed an intention on the part of the person paying the purchase price for the property to benefit the recipient of the legal title … Where the presumption of resulting trust is invoked, it is the lack of intention to benefit the recipient of the property that is being <span class="font-italic">inferred</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>It follows that the presumption of resulting trust … will not be called in aid when the evidence that is before the court adequately reveals the true intention of the transferor. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In this case, I found that the contributions by the Plaintiff created a presumption of resulting trust in the Plaintiff’s favour, entitling her to the whole of the beneficial interest in the Property, as all of the payments towards the Property came from her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The presumption of resulting trust would not arise or would in any event be rebutted if there is evidence that the Plaintiff had intended 50% of the direct payments to be a gift to the Defendant. There was insufficient evidence to establish this. In the premises, I found that the Plaintiff did not intend for 50% of the contributions to be a gift to the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The presumption of resulting trust may also be rebutted by the operation of the presumption of advancement which presumes an intention to gift in the light of the nature of the relationship between the parties. Here, while I found that there was a relationship that went beyond merely business between the parties, that did not confer upon the relationship between them a status that would call for the operation of the presumption of advancement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The presumption of advancement operates as a rule of evidence in specific situations where the probability of a gift being intended is significant by virtue of the type of relationship. It should be treated as “an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of thumb” (see <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 410 at [29] and <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [59]). The overall aim of the presumption of advancement is to discern the intention of the transferor; the presumption should apply when the relationship between the parties is such that it is more probable than not that a beneficial interest was intended to be conferred, whether or not the purchaser owed the other a legal or moral duty of support (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [78] citing <span class="font-italic">Calverley</span><span class="font-italic"> v Green</span> (1984) 155 CLR 242 at 250).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the Court of Appeal held that the presumption of advancement was still relevant in the established (both traditional and extended) categories of relationships and that it is the strength of the presumption that should vary with the circumstances in accordance with the modern social conditions (at [77]). All the circumstances of the case should be taken into account by the court in assessing how strongly the presumption of advancement should be applied, with two aspects being particularly crucial, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the nature of the relationship between the parties and the state of the relationship (at [78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In relation to the categories of relationships which attract the presumption of advancement, the Court of Appeal opined (at [60]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Relationships which attract the presumption of advancement have traditionally included transfers from husband to wife, and from father to child. These categories of relationships have, however, been established in a markedly different social context from the present. It goes without saying that the application of the presumption of advancement, just like the presumption of resulting trust, should be assessed in accordance with contemporary norms. Indeed, the two traditional categories of relationships have each already been remoulded and refined in different jurisdictions as social realities and practices have changed over time. Nevertheless, further extension and extrapolation may be appropriate, and indeed required, to cater to the myriad matrices that prevail in today’s society. As Deane J sagely noted in <span class="font-italic">Calverley</span><span class="font-italic"> v Green</span> ([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 268, the categories of relationships to which the presumption of advancement applies are not “finally settled or closed”. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 While I accept that the categories of relationships to which the presumption of advancement applies are not finally settled or closed, in my judgement, the categories under which a presumption of advancement would apply should not be unduly expanded. An approach based on the actual intentions of the parties should be preferred; where there is no evidence of actual intentions, it should not be easily presumed that the intention was to gift the property. There are limited categories of relationships in which it is more probable than not that a gift was intended simply by virtue of the nature of the relationship between the parties. I was therefore doubtful that the categories attracting the presumption should be extended to include cohabiting couples who are not legally married. I noted in this regard that the Court of Appeal had stated in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> that such an extension to cohabiting couples may not be warranted (at [74]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is obvious that Gibbs CJ’s remarks were driven, at least in part, by his pragmatism in acknowledging the changing conditions of society and a desire to desist from the historical reasons for confining the presumption of advancement to cases of <span class="font-italic">legal </span>spouses. Though his remains the lone voice advocating for such a change, academics have acknowledged that it is <span class="font-italic">arguable</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that changing social attitudes to <span class="font-italic">de facto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>relationships, especially where they are recognised legislatively, should be reflected by the courts in the application of the presumption of advancement: see G E Dal Pont &amp; D R C Chalmers, <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts in Australia and New Zealand</span> (LBC Information Services, 2nd Ed, 2000) at p 591. However, given that legislative recognition and public consensus about the status of <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> relationships have yet to emerge locally, any development along the lines envisaged by Gibbs CJ may be, in our view, presently unwarranted. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Defendant relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">BMM</span><span class="font-italic"> v BMN and another matter</span> [2017] 4 SLR 1315 (“<span class="font-italic">BMM v BMN</span>”) to argue that the presumption of advancement should be applicable in the present case.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">BMM v BMN</span>, the plaintiff and defendant registered their marriage and the plaintiff then transferred the property in question (originally purchased in his sole name) to be held in their joint names, with the understanding that the marriage was valid. The marriage was discovered to be void and declared void only subsequently when the parties carried out the process of obtaining a divorce. Foo Tuat Yien JC found that given that the parties were in what they thought was a marriage, the financial dependency of the defendant on the plaintiff, and the close and loving relationship between the parties, that there was a strong presumption of advancement in favour of the defendant (at [32]). Nevertheless, Foo JC found that the presumption of advancement in that case was rebutted by the common intention that the property would be solely owned by the plaintiff. The circumstances in <span class="font-italic">BMM v BMN </span>were unique given that the parties had registered their marriage and were under the impression that they were legally married at the time of the property transfer. To the extent that <span class="font-italic">BMM v BMN </span>stands for the proposition that the presumption of advancement could be extended in principle to the benefit of a female partner in cohabitation receiving a gift from the male partner, I respectfully decline to follow it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In this case, the nature of the relationship between the parties was not such as to bring into operation the presumption of advancement.

The exception applies whenever a trustee retains trust property, or its proceeds, in her hands: see Robert Pearce, John Stevens and Warren Barr, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Trusts and Equitable Obligations</span> (Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2010) at p 900.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">249 Section 2 of the Limitation Act defines the terms “trust” and “trustee” as “[having] the same meanings as in the Trustees Act [Cap. 337]”. This is a reference to s 3 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed), which defines the terms “trust” and “trustees” as including “implied and constructive trusts, and … cases where the trustee has a beneficial interest in the trust property, and to the duties incident to the office of a personal representative”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">250 Although the definition does not include resulting trusts, the weight of authority suggests that resulting trusts are dealt with on the same footing as express and constructive trusts for the purposes of the section: see David Hayton, Paul Matthews and Charles Mitchell, <span class="font-italic">Underhill and </span><span class="font-italic">Hayton Law of Trusts and Trustees </span>(LexisNexis, 18th Ed, 2010) at para 94.2; John Mowbray <span class="font-italic">et al, </span><span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) (“Lewin on Trusts”) at para 7-004.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">251 I therefore find that the plaintiffs’ claims against TCS in respect of the resulting trusts that arose over their AAS shares which they transferred to TCS are not subject to the six-year limitation period in s 22(2) of the Limitation Act as they fall within the scope of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I saw no reason to depart from the approach in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>.

It was out of this that the doctrine of limitation by analogy developed so that limitation periods applicable to claims in law could not be side-stepped by the simple device of seeking equitable relief. The point is succinctly and clearly explained by Jules Sher QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge in <span class="font-italic">Coulthard</span> … (<span class="font-italic">Coulthard</span> at 730):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Two things emerge … First, where the court of equity was simply exercising a concurrent jurisdiction giving the same relief as was available in a court of law the statute of limitation would be applied. Secondly, even if the relief afforded by the court of equity was wider than that available at law the court of equity would apply the statute by analogy where there was ‘correspondence’ between the remedies available at law or in equity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74 … In our judgment, essentially the same result was achieved by s 6(7) of the 1959 Limitation Ordinance and its successor provisions and this is unaffected by the omission of the words “(if necessary by analogy)”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75 It will be recalled that s 6(7) of the 1959 Limitation Ordinance and its successor provisions make this regime subject to ss 22 and 32 of the same Ordinance and its successor legislation. This is the consequence of two things. First, not every claim to equitable relief will have a corresponding claim in the law such that the relevant limitation period specified for the latter can be readily applied by analogy. There is a historical rationale for this. The confluence of the streams of law and equity was such that there nonetheless remained areas in which only equity could intervene. This was referred to as the exclusive jurisdiction of equity as opposed to its concurrent or auxiliary jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76 The concurrent, auxiliary and exclusive jurisdictions of equity are explained as follows by William Swadling in his chapter on “Limitation” in <span class="font-italic">Breach of Trust</span> (Peter Birks and Adrianna Pretto eds) (Hart Publishing, 2002) at p 323:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The ‘concurrent’ jurisdiction comprises equity’s responses to common law claims. An example would be a claim for specific performance of a contract. Another would be an action for an account following a tort, while yet another would be an injunction to restrain a threatened breach of contract or tort. The common feature of these claims is that while the common law recognises the underlying cause of action, it does not give the particular relief sought. While the ‘concurrent’ jurisdiction might be said to be concerned with matters of substantive <span class="font-italic">relief</span>, the ‘auxiliary’ jurisdiction, by contrast, deals with matters of <span class="font-italic">procedure</span>. It might, for example, be that in a common law action the plaintiff wants discovery of certain documents. The common law has no power to order discovery, though equity does. If discovery is ordered by a court of equity, it does so within its ‘auxiliary’ jurisdiction. Within the ‘exclusive’ jurisdiction fall claims which the common law does not recognise at all. The most obvious is the claim of a beneficiary to enforce a trust. Trusts have never been recognised by the common law, so a beneficiary suing to enforce a trust can only obtain relief from a court of equity. Such claims are therefore said to be within the ‘exclusive’ jurisdiction of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77 For claims that fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of equity, since the plaintiff had no legal claim at all, there was no basis for invoking a statutory limitation. Instead, the equitable doctrine of laches applied, although the courts, in determining the time limit for laches, would usually follow the lead given by the Legislature and adopt the statutory period of limitation (see <span class="font-italic">Smith v Clay</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1767) 3 Bro CC 639).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">78 Under our framework, s 22 statutorily deals with the limitation period that is specifically applicable (or not, as the case may be) to claims for breach of trust or for the recovery of trust property, which claims would ordinarily have fallen within the exclusive jurisdiction of equity. … Second, equity developed its own rules that allowed for equitable defences to be raised against equitable claims. Section 32 preserves the applicability of those equitable defences (including laches and acquiescence) which may arise according to the facts of the case in any setting where equitable remedies are sought. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The relevant passages from <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span> cited above suggest that limitation by analogy under s 6(7) applies to concurrent jurisdiction equitable claims, with claims for breach of trust or for the recovery of trust property being dealt with under s 22. Therefore, should s 22 not cover a claim based on a resulting trust arising from direct contributions to the property, it did not follow that s 6(7) would be applicable. This is so since a claim based on resulting trust falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of equity. As the Court of Appeal stated (at [69]–[71]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 The effect of s 6(7) is that “this section”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the entire s 6, applies to all claims for equitable relief, whether these be founded upon contract, tort, a trust or other ground in equity. This, however, is expressly subject to s 22 (limitation of actions in respect of trust property) and s 32 (the equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of acquiescence, laches or otherwise). In other words, outside the operation of the two exceptions in ss 22 and 32, s 6(7) contemplates that the relevant limitation period for a particular cause of action in law (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, six years for claims for damages for breach of contract under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) will also apply when the claim is for equitable relief instead (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, specific performance of that contract).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 The language of the English provision indicates that the statutory limitation periods would <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>apply to equitable reliefs, save to the extent that the doctrine of limitation by analogy made them applicable. In contrast, the language of the Singapore provision indicates that the statutory limitation periods would apply in effect to all claims for equitable relief. <span class="font-italic">This can only be given effect to by finding the particular provision elsewhere in s 6 by which an express limitation period has been prescribed for an action at law, which bears the closest correspondence to the relevant claim for equitable relief.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Thus, even if it is accepted that s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) does not apply to a claim based on resulting trust (which I did not accept), it was doubtful that the Plaintiff’s claim was caught by the statutory limitation under s 6(7) by analogy given that the claim did not bear a close correspondence with any of the actions at law for which an express limitation period is prescribed under s 6. I rejected the Defendant’s assertion that the Plaintiff’s claim bore an analogy with a claim based on contract and therefore that s 6(7) would apply read with s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).

</div> A resulting trust arises automatically upon the non-exhaustion or non-disposal of the beneficial interest. Therefore, assuming that s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) did not apply, it is likely that the equitable doctrine of laches would apply exclusively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Laches </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The doctrine of laches is a discretionary remedy.
