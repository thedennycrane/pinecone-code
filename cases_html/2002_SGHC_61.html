</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    In SIC No 601418 of 2001 and SIC No 601420

of 2001, which were heard together, the liquidator of Show Theatres Pte Ltd

("ST") sought to reverse the effect of three transactions entered into by the

company with its two shareholders, Shaw Theatres Pte Ltd ("Shaw") and Eng Wah

Investments Pte Ltd ("Eng Wah"), prior to the presentation of the winding-up

petition. In SIC No 601418 of 2001, the liquidator asserted that the purchase by ST of

500,000 Chinatown Point shares from Shaw was a transaction at an undervalue. In SIC No

601420 of 2001, the liquidator contended that the question of an unfair preference arose

with respect to the repayment by ST of shareholders’ loans to Shaw and Eng Wah in

1999. 

<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

A. BACKGROUND</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    ST, whose principal business was the owning,

leasing and management of cinemas, was incorporated on 13 December 1993. Shaw and Eng Wah

were its only shareholders. Shaw held 375,000 shares and Eng Wah held 125,000 shares. Two

directors of ST, Mr Shaw Vee Chung Harold and Mr Shaw Vee King, are directors of Shaw

while ST’s other director, Mr Goh Keng Beng, is a director of Eng Wah.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    ST was wound up on 17 November 2000 as it was

unable to pay its debts, which amounted to more than $8.6m. After perusing ST’s

records and accounts, the liquidator questioned the propriety of a number of transactions

between ST and its two shareholders on the ground that they fell within the scope of

sections 98 and 99 of the Bankruptcy Act, read with section 329(1) of the Companies Act

(Chapter 50), which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Subject to this Act and such modifications as may be prescribed, any

  transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to

  property made or done by or against a company which, had it been made or done by or

  against an individual, would in his bankruptcy be void or voidable under section 98, 99 or

  103 of the Bankruptcy Act 1995 (read with sections 100, 101 and 102 thereof) shall in the

  event of the company being wound up be void or voidable in like manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

B. THE CHINATOWN POINT SHARES</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    SIC No 601418 of 2001, which concerns ST’s

purchase from Shaw of 500,000 Chinatown Point shares will first be considered. ST paid

Shaw $1.20 for each share and $600,000 for the 500,000 shares. The liquidator asserted

that the shares were worth $480,000 or $0.96 each at the material time and sought to

recover the sum of $120,000 from Shaw on the ground that the transaction was at an

undervalue. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    For the liquidator to succeed in his claim, the

following must be established:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) ST was insolvent when it bought the Chinatown Point shares.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The purchase of the said shares was made within the period of 5

  years before the presentation of the winding-up petition against ST (see section 100 of

  the Bankruptcy Act).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(c)    The value of the shares was significantly less than the $600,000

  paid by ST (see section 98(3) of the Bankruptcy Act).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    It is common ground that ST was insolvent at the

material time. However, there was disagreement as to when the shares were bought by ST and

what was their value at the material time. </p>
<i xmlns=""><u>
<p align="justify"><br/>

When was the agreement concluded</p></u>?</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    Shaw claimed that the agreement for the purchase

and sale of the Chinatown Point shares was concluded in July 1995, more than 5 years

before the petition to wind up ST was presented on 24 October 2000. If this is so, the

transaction falls outside the 5-year period stipulated in section 100 of the Bankruptcy

Act for impugning transactions at an undervalue. However, the liquidator submitted that

the shares were purchased by ST in 1997 and that the transaction falls within the 5-year

period stipulated in section 100 of the Bankruptcy Act. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    Mr Goh Keng Beng, who negotiated the transaction

on ST’s behalf, had no doubt that the agreement for the sale and purchase of the

Chinatown Point shares was concluded in July 1995. In para 12 of his affidavit dated 28

August 2001, he stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">12. Thereafter, the formal agreement was only entered into in December

  1996 as parties had to obtain the necessary approval from the other shareholder of

  Chinatown Point, City Centrepoint Pte Ltd ("City Centrepoint") and several

  condition precedents had to be satisfied….</p>
<p align="justify">13. The negotiations on the draft Sale and Purchase Agreement began in

  July 1995….. At that time, the condition precedents which had to be satisfied were

  stated as "conditions subsequent" because the lease agreement with City

  Centrepoint had not yet expired and thus not due for renewal.</p>
<p align="justify">14. Between July 1995 and the execution of the Sale and Purchase

  Agreement in December 1996, several drafts of the Sale and Purchase Agreement were

  negotiated upon and amendments were made. Due to the time lapse between the agreement and

  the execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, these "conditions subsequent"

  became [conditions precedent] as the lease agreement expired in November 1996. However,

  the terminology used in the executed Sale and Purchase Agreement remained as

  "conditions subsequent" and was never amended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    The liquidator, who did not agree with Mr Goh,

pointed out that the agreement for the sale and purchase of the Chinatown Point shares,

which was dated 12 March 1997, expressly provided that "the parties have executed

this agreement the day and year first above written". Where a document is dated, the

date is prima facie evidence of the date on which it was executed (see, for instance, <i>Andersen

v Weston</i> (1840) 6 Bing NC 296). While the prima facie presumption may be rebutted, no

convincing explanation was furnished to rebut the presumption. Discussions for the sale of

the Chinatown Point may have started in 1995. However, any assertion that the contract was

concluded in 1995 is untenable, if only because the terms of the draft sale and purchase

contract prepared in July 1995 were very different from the agreement executed by the

parties on 12 March 1997. In fact, in the original draft, Chinatown Point Theatres Pte Ltd

was a party to the contract but it was not a party to the executed agreement. It should

also be noted that the directors’ resolution to purchase the shares was passed in

January 1997 and the funds required for the purchase were provided by Shaw and Eng Wah in

March 1997.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    If all the circumstances are taken into account,

there can be no doubt that the agreement for the sale and purchase of the Chinatown Point

shares was concluded in March 1997. As such, the transaction in question was concluded

within the 5-year period referred to in section 100 of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Whether the transaction was at an undervalue</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    Whether or not the transaction was at an

undervalue will next be considered. The liquidator noted that no valuation report had been

produced to justify the price paid by ST for the shares and that in Chinatown Point’s

audited balance sheet as at 31 March 1997, the Book Net Tangible Assets showed that the

shares in question were worth only around $0.96 per share. Furthermore, the investment in

the Chinatown Point shares was totally written off in ST’s financial statements as at

31 March 1998. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    In <i>McDonald and Anor v Hanselmann </i>[1998] 28 ACSR 49, 53, where transactions at an undervalue were considered by the Supreme Court

of New South Wales, Young J rightly said that value is not a matter to be decided in a

vacuum and that the relevant question is "whether there was a bargain of such

magnitude that it could not be explained by normal commercial practice". It is also

pertinent to note that regulation 6 of the Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act

Provisions) Regulations 1995 provides that the court shall not make an order referred to

in section 98 of the Bankruptcy Act in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is

satisfied that the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for

the purpose of carrying on its business; and that at the time it did so there were

reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    Shaw contended that the price of $1.20 per share

was fair, reasonable and commercially justifiable because of the benefits which ST

expected to derive from the purchase of Chinatown Point shares. Shaw’s counsel, Mr

Tan Kok Quan SC, pointed out that Shaw, which owned 65% of ST, had to provide ST with much

of the funds required for the purchase of the shares. More importantly, it must be noted

that it was Eng Wah’s nominee director on the ST Board, Mr Goh Keng Beng, and not

Shaw’s nominee directors on the ST Board, who negotiated the purchase of the

Chinatown Point shares from Shaw. Eng Wah must have considered it in ST’s interest to

purchase the Chinatown shares from Shaw. In his affidavit dated 25 July 2001, Mr Goh, who

confirmed that the shares were purchased after he had discussions with the management of

Eng Wah, added as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">5. …. I was appointed by [ST] to negotiate on behalf of the

  Company.</p>
<p align="justify">6. [I]t was agreed that it was in the best interest of the Company to

  purchase 500,000 shares of Chinatown Point at S$1.20 per share from the Respondents….</p>
<p align="justify">8. In arriving at the conclusion that the price of S$1.20 was fair and

  reasonable, I had taken into account the commercial benefits that could be obtained by the

  Company at that time….</p>
<p align="justify">12. As [ST] wanted to have the benefit of participating in the

  operation of Choa Chu Kang Cineplex, it was necessary for the company to become a

  shareholder of Chinatown Point….</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>14.    …. It was a pure commercial decision on the part of [ST]

  with a view to future benefits. The purchase was approved by the Directors of the Company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    After taking all circumstances into account,

including the fact that Eng Wah viewed the transaction at arm’s length as it had to

provide part of the funds required by ST for the purchase of the 500,000 Chinatown Point

shares from Shaw, I hold that the transaction was not at an undervalue. ST entered into

the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the

time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would

benefit the company. As such, the liquidator’s claim with respect to the Chinatown

Point shares is dismissed with costs.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><br/>

C. REPAYMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS’ LOANS</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.   SIC No 601420 of 2001, which concerns the repayment by

ST of shareholders’ loans to Shaw and Eng Wah will next be considered. It is common

ground that ST borrowed money from Shaw and Eng Wah and that it paid Shaw $375,000 on 6

August 1999 and Eng Wah $125,000 on 28 September 1999. It was not disputed that ST was

insolvent when these shareholders’ loans were repaid. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.    The liquidator contended that the question of an

unfair preference arises because the money borrowed by ST from Shaw and Eng Wah should not

have been paid ahead of the sums claimed by the company’s other creditors. As for

what is an "unfair preference", section 99(3) of the Bankruptcy Act provide as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">For the purpose of this section and sections 100 and 102, an individual

  gives an unfair preference to a person if –</p>
<p align="justify">(a) that person is one of the individual’s creditors or a surety

  or guarantor for any of his debts or other liabilities; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the individual does anything or suffers anything to be done which

  (in either case) has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event

  of the individual’s bankruptcy, will be better than the position he would have been

  in if that thing had not been done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.    Shaw and Eng Wah contended that they were not

obliged to return to ST the amounts repaid to them in 1999 for three reasons. First, the

repayment of the loans fell within the ambit of <i>Quistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls

Razor Ltd</i> [1970] AC 567. Secondly, the Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act

Provisions) Regulations 1995, on which the liquidator relied for questioning the validity

of the repayment of the shareholders’ loans, are ultra vires the Bankruptcy Act.

Thirdly, the loans were repaid outside the relevant time referred to in section 100 of the

Bankruptcy Act for impugning transactions on the basis of an undue preference.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Quistclose case</p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    In <i>Quistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor

Ltd</i>, R Ltd, a company facing financial problems, negotiated with a financier for a

loan of 1m. It was suggested that the loan might be made on condition that R Ltd found a

sum of around 209,719 to pay an ordinary share dividend that had already been declared.

Quistclose agreed to lend R Ltd this sum on condition that it was to be used to pay the

dividend in question. Quistclose’s cheque was paid into a separate account opened

specifically for the agreed purpose of the loan. Before the dividend was paid, R Ltd went

into voluntary liquidation. Quistclose claimed that it was entitled to a refund of the

amount loaned on the ground that it was loaned for the sole purpose of enabling R Ltd to

pay the dividend in question. It was evident that the mutual intention of the parties and

the essence of the bargain was that the money loaned should not become part of the assets

of the company, but should be used exclusively for payment of a particular class of

creditors. It was held that Quistclose was entitled to the money loaned to R Ltd. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    A modern formulation of the <i>Quistclose </i>principle

may be found in <i>Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd </i>[1975] 1 AC 74, 100, where Lord Mustill

said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[I]t is necessary to show either a mutual intention that the moneys

  should not fall within the general fund of the company’s assets but should be applied

  for a special designated purpose, or that having originally been paid over without

  restriction the recipient has later constituted himself a trustee of the money….</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    Shaw and Eng Wah asserted that their position is

similar to that in the <i>Quistclose </i>case. In May 1997, ST’s Board of Directors

was informed that it was necessary for the company to call on its shareholders to provide

$2.6m for various purposes, one of which was to enable ST to provide a loan of $500,000 to

Chinatown Point. On 29 May 1997, a resolution was passed asking the shareholders to

provide an unsecured interest-free loan in proportion to their shareholdings. For the loan

to Chinatown Point, Shaw gave ST $375,000 while Eng Wah, which owned the rest of the

shares, gave ST $125,000. Shaw and Eng Wah said that after the loan of the $500,000 was

made to ST, Chinatown Point ceased to exist. As such, ST did not loan the money to

Chinatown Point. They contended that the sum did not form part of ST’s general funds

and that it ought to be returned to them as the agreed purpose of the loan was not carried

out. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    The liquidator, who took a different view, argued

that there was no mutual intention on the part of ST and its shareholders that the money

loaned to ST should be used for a designated purpose, failing which it should be returned.

Admittedly, Mr Yap Bock Seng, ST’s secretary and chief accountant, noted in his paper

to the directors that there were a number of items in respect of which funding was

required from ST’s shareholders. One of the items listed was a "provision for

loan to Chinatown" totalling $500,000. Counsel for the liquidator, Mr Lee, rightly

argued that if the $500,000 referred to in Mr Yap’s paper falls within the ambit of a

trust such as that upheld in the <i>Quistclose </i>case, Shaw and Eng Wah can argue that

all the sums mentioned in Mr Yap’s paper are also within the ambit of the <i>Quistclose

</i>type of trust. This cannot be the case. He also noted that the alleged purpose of the

$500,000 loan was not mentioned in the director’s resolution dated 29 May 1997, which

merely referred to a lump sum of $2.6m required as a loan from the shareholders.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    Mr Lee pointed out that there was no evidence

that the $500,000 loaned by Shaw and Eng Wah to ST had been placed in a fixed deposit that

was separate from ST’s other funds pending its release to Chinatown Point. He also

said that if the $500,000 had been intended as a loan from ST to Chinatown Point, it

should have been returned to Shaw and Eng Wah as soon as it was evident that its purpose

could not be achieved. However, Shaw and Eng Wah did not demand that the $500,000 be

refunded to them until two years later. By that time, ST was insolvent. Mr Lee contended

that in the circumstances of the case, no <i>Quistclose </i>trust had been created. I

agree and hold that the $500,000 is a normal loan made by Shaw and Eng Wah to ST. As such,

it should not have been repaid to Shaw and Eng Wah in priority to the other unsecured

loans and liabilities of ST. The first defence of Shaw and Eng Wah thus fails.</p>

Whether the Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act Provisions) Regulations 1995 are

invalid</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    The assertion by Shaw and Eng Wah that the

Companies (Application of Bankruptcy Act Provisions) Regulations 1995 ("CABAR")

are ultra vires the Bankruptcy Act will next be considered. The CABAR were made by the

Minister for Finance pursuant to section 411 of the Companies Act. Counsel for Shaw and

Eng Wah, Mr Tan, asserted as follows in his written submissions:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[T]he Bankruptcy Act does not come within the portfolio of the Minister

  for Finance. If the meaning of the word "associate" as determined by the

  Bankruptcy Act is sought to be modified or amended, it must be done by the Minister for

  Law pursuant to an enabling section in the Bankruptcy Act, if any….</p>
<p align="justify">[T]he Prime Minister … had directed that … the Minister for

  Law [be] responsible for … the Official Assignee and Public Trustee’s Office

  ….</p>
<p align="justify">As such, it is submitted that … the Minister for Finance had no

  authority to make regulations pursuant to section 411(g) of the Companies Act to <u><i>amend

  the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act</i></u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    Mr Tan’s argument raises a number of issues

which need not be considered as the question of ultra vires does not arise in this case.

Section 329(1) of the Companies Act incorporates some provisions of the Bankruptcy Act,

which concerns the insolvency of individuals, as part of the law relating to companies in

liquidation. In doing so, it does not amend the Bankruptcy Act. Evidently, some

Regulations are needed to give effect to section 329(1) of the Companies Act and the CABAR

serve this purpose. Regulation 3 of the CABAR provides that <i>for the purpose of section

329 of the Companies Act</i>, sections 98, 99, 100, 102 and 103 of the Bankruptcy Act

shall be read subject to the modifications set out in regulations 4 to 9 and such textual

and other modifications as may be necessary for their application to a company which is

being wound up. By introducing the CABAR, the Minister of Finance enabled section 329(1)

of the Companies Act to operate properly in the context of companies in liquidation. As

such, he acted within the scope of section 411(g) of the Companies Act, which provides

that the Minister may "make regulations for or with respect to all matters or things

which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed otherwise than by rules or

which are necessary or expedient to be prescribed for giving effect to this Act". In

view of the aforesaid, the second defence advanced by Shaw and Eng Wah was rejected.</p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p><br/>

Relevant time</p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    Whether the shareholders’ loans were repaid

before the relevant time referred to in section 100 of the Bankruptcy Act will next be

considered. In the case of an unfair preference given by ST to an associate, the relevant

time is two years before the presentation of the winding-up petition. In any other case,

the relevant time is six months. As the shareholders’ loans were repaid in August and

September 1999, more than six months before the winding-up petition was presented in

October 2000, the liquidator’s claim against Shaw and Eng Wah will fail if they are

not ST’s associates.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    To determine whether or not a company is an

associate of another company, the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and the CABAR must be

considered. Shaw and Eng Wah contended that attention should be focussed on regulation 5

of the CABAR, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In addition to the provisions of section 101 of the Bankruptcy Act by

  which the question whether a person is an associate of another person is to be determined,

  a company shall be regarded as an associate of another company if –</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(a)    the same person has control of both companies, or a person has

  control of one company and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his

  associates, have control of the other company; or</p>
<p>(b)    a group of 2 or more persons has control of each company, and

  such groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the

  same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a

  person of whom he is an associate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    Mr Tan submitted that as the liquidator did not

furnish any evidence of the requisite control referred to in regulation 5 of the CABAR,

Shaw and Eng Wah cannot be regarded as ST’s associates. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    In contrast, the liquidator’s counsel, Mr

Lee, relied on regulation 4 of the CABAR, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Any reference to an associate of a person or an individual who has been

  adjudged bankrupt (except any such reference to section 101 of the Bankruptcy Act) shall

  be read as a reference to <u><i>a person connected with a company</i></u> … against

  which a winding-up order has been made….<br/>

  (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.    Mr Lee next relied on regulation 2 of the CABAR,

which provides that a "person connected with a company" means, inter alia, a

person who is a director of the company or<i> "an associate of such a director"</i>.

In his written submissions, he put his clients’ position as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Pursuant to section 101(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, a person is an

  associate of an individual whom he employs or by whom he is employed and, for this

  purpose, any director of a company shall be treated as employed by that company. Since the

  directors of [ST] are also directors of either Shaw Theatres (in the case of Shaw Vee

  Chung, Harold and Shaw Vee King) and Eng Wah (in the case of Goh Keng Beng), Shaw Theatres

  and Eng Wah would be ‘associates’ of at least a director of the company.

  Applying the definition in regulation 2 of the [CABAR], Shaw Theatres and Eng Wah would

  then be persons connected with [ST] and accordingly, ‘associates of [ST]" for

  the purpose of section 100(b) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.    While a person who is connected with a company

includes an associate of a director of that company, note must be taken of regulation 2 of

the CABAR which provides that the word "associate" as used in the Regulations,

unless the context requires otherwise, means "an associate of a person or company as

determined in accordance with section 101 of the Bankruptcy Act as modified by regulation

5". In his informative article on <i>The Avoidance Provisions of the Bankruptcy Act

1995 and their Application to Companies </i>[1995] SJLS 597, 636, Mr Lee explained the

ambit of section 101 and its application to companies in liquidation in the following

succinct terms: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The scheme of section 101 of the Bankruptcy Act is that it lists

  certain situations in which a <i>person </i>or a <i>company </i>is an associate of an <i>individual.

  </i>It is clear that the word ‘individual’ here, as in the other relevant

  provisions, refers to the debtor who is subsequently adjudged a bankrupt. Presumably,

  then, when it is sought to apply the section to companies, the word ‘individual’

  must be taken to mean a reference to the company which is being wound up or under judicial

  management, as the case may be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.    Section 101(4) of the Bankruptcy Act provides as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A person is an associate of an individual whom he employs or by whom he

  is employed and for this purpose, any director or other officer of a company shall be

  treated as employed by that company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.    If the word "individual" is replaced by

the word "company", section 101(4) provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A person is an associate of [a company …] he employs or by whom he

  is employed and <i>for this purpose</i>, any director or other officer of a company shall

  be treated as employed by <i>that</i> company.<br/>

  (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.    As Mr Lee rightly pointed out in his article on <i>The

Avoidance Provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1995 and their Application to Companies</i>,

the word "company", when used in place of "individual" in section

101(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, refers to the "company which is being wound up".

The words "<i>for this purpose</i>" and "<i>that"</i> company make it

clear that section 101(4), when read in the context of companies in liquidation, merely

provides that a director of a company that is being wound up is an associate of <i>that</i>

company. Whether this is the result intended when the provisions of the United Kingdom

Insolvency Act, on which section 104 of the Bankruptcy Act and the CABAR are modelled,

were incorporated into the Bankruptcy Act and the CABAR is an interesting question.

Whatever may be the UK position, I cannot, in the face of the clear words of section

101(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, accept the liquidator’s argument that that this

statutory provision results in Shaw and Eng Wah being associates of ST. The words of

section 101(4) will be gravely distorted if they are to have the added effect of making a

company that is being wound up an associate of another company solely on the ground that

they have one common director. </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Conclusion</p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34<i>.</i>   As Shaw and Eng Wah cannot be regarded as

associates of ST on the basis of section 101(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, the relevant time

under section 100 of the Bankruptcy Act with respect to the repayment of the

shareholders’ loans is six months. Since the ST’s repayment of the

shareholders’ loans to Shaw and Eng Wah was made more than six months before the

presentation of the petition to wind up ST, the liquidator’s claim in SIC 601420 of

2001 is dismissed with costs.</p>
