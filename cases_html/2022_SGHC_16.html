The applicants relied on an implied prohibition, because there was no express prohibition in s 53 of the BMSMA. Indeed, under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA, each of the nine SPs was eligible for election, and none of the disqualifying factors in s 53(7) or s 53(8) of the BMSMA applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Section 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA concerns nominations by “a subsidiary proprietor who owns 2 or more lots” (“multiple-lot SP”). Together with the nominees of a multiple-lot SP already in council, that SP’s nominees for election must not exceed the threshold number under s 53(12) of the BMSMA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the number of council members proportional to that SP’s share value, or 49% of the number of council members, whichever number is lower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 For instance, if a multiple-lot SP owned 1/3 of the lots in a development, and had no nominees already in council, he could nominate up to 1/3 of the number of council members; but if he owned 2/3 of the lots, he could only nominate up to 49% of the number of council members. This struck a balance between allowing a multiple-lot SP to nominate candidates proportionate to his share value, whilst preventing such an SP’s nominees from amounting to a majority in council.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In “The Warren” development, however, each SP only owned one lot in the development, and the multiple-lot SP provisions in s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 53(12) of the BMSMA would not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The applicants argued, nevertheless, that if multiple-lot SPs were subject to a limit on nominations, SPs who own only one lot (“single-lot SPs”) must likewise be subject to some limit on nominations.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 That commentary is premised on a single-lot SP being entitled to nominate only one candidate in respect of his lot (which I term the “one lot, one candidate” principle).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Does that, however, mean that if several SPs are collectively nominated for election, none of them can run? My conclusion on this is summarised at [38] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “one lot, one candidate” principle.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I accepted that the “one lot, one candidate” principle underpins what a single-lot SP is entitled to do. But I did not arrive at this position by applying the multiple-lot SP provisions (s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 53(12) of the BMSMA), which do not apply to single-lot SPs. I based it instead on s 53(6) and s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA, and the legislative history of s 53 of the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Section 53(6) of the BMSMA indicates that an individual single-lot SP can either run himself (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA), or he can nominate a member of his immediate family (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA), but he cannot do both. Similarly, a corporate single-lot SP can nominate an individual to run (under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA). I did not accept that an individual single-lot SP can nominate <span class="font-italic">several</span> immediate family members; or that a corporate single-lot SP can nominate <span class="font-italic">several</span> corporate representatives. I read s 53(6) of the BMSMA as allowing an individual single-lot SP to run himself, or to nominate <span class="font-italic">a</span> member of his immediate family, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to nominate one candidate in respect of his lot. Likewise, a corporate single-lot SP may nominate <span class="font-italic">an</span> individual to run, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one individual. Historically, s 57(7) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1985 Rev Ed) in force from 1 December 1987 (“December 1987 LT(S)A”) restricted even multiple-lot SPs to either running or nominating <span class="font-underline">an</span> individual candidate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that SP could only nominate <span class="font-italic">one</span> candidate in respect of <span class="font-italic">all</span> his lots. The principle then was not “one lot, one candidate”, it was “one SP, one candidate”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 That restrictive position in relation to multiple-lot SPs was relaxed on 1 April 2005, when the BMSMA came into force with s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 53(12) of the BMSMA allowing a multiple-lot SP to run himself and also nominate others, or make several nominations, subject to the limits in s 53(12) of the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 None of this, however, directly addresses the issue of whether a collective nomination of individual SPs is valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The genesis of s 53 of the BMSMA, was the First Schedule read with s 30(4) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1985 Rev Ed) in force from 30 March 1987 (“March 1987 LT(S)A”). Paragraph 3(1) of that First Schedule simply said that a council would consist of between 3 and 14 SPs. Nothing was said about nominations, and there were no specific provisions in relation to joint SPs (like s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA), or multiple-lot SPs (like s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 53(12) of the BMSMA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On 1 December 1987, eligibility criteria were introduced (similar to s 53(6) of the BMSMA) by s 57(5) of the December 1987 LT(S)A:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  A person shall not be eligible for election as a member of the council unless he is —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) an individual who is a subsidiary proprietor;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) an individual who is nominated for election by a subsidiary proprietor who is a company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) a member of the immediate family of a subsidiary proprietor who is nominated for election by that subsidiary proprietor who is not a candidate for election.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Of the three categories of eligibility under s 53(6) of the BMSMA (and its predecessor s 57(5) of the December 1987 LT(S)A), an SP’s eligibility for election under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA is not defined with reference to “nomination”, unlike the other two categories: an individual <span class="font-italic">nominated</span> by a corporate SP (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA), and the immediate family of an SP <span class="font-italic">nominated</span> by that SP (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA). An SP’s eligibility for election is derived from <span class="font-italic">his own status as an SP</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his ownership of a lot, rather than from <span class="font-italic">being nominated</span><span class="font-italic"> by someone</span> who has the right to nominate him. That was the position since the First Schedule of the March 1987 LT(S)A, when the council simply comprised SPs (and nothing was said about nominations), through to s 53 of the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It is also instructive to consider s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA (and its predecessor s 57(6) of the December 1987 LT(S)A) about joint SPs (previously termed “co-subsidiary proprietors”): one joint SP could run for election, but only if the other joint SP was not also running and had not nominated another person. This too embodies the “one lot, one candidate” principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I thus accepted that, in the case of a single-lot SP, ownership of that one lot only confers an entitlement to nominate one candidate <span class="font-italic">in respect of </span><span class="font-italic">that lot</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an individual SP can either run himself, or nominate an immediate family member to run; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a corporate SP can nominate an individual to run.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This, however, still begs the question of whether a collective nomination of several SPs is valid, for each of them owns a lot, and as such is individually eligible to run for election.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The collective nomination of SPs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As I noted above (at [26]), an individual SP’s eligibility for election does not derive from him being nominated (by himself, or by another); it derives from him being an SP, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his ownership of a lot.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Here, all nine nominees were themselves individual SPs. Each of them was eligible for election under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA, and moreover none of the disqualifying factors in s 53(7) or s 53(8) of the BMSMA applied. Their names, unit numbers, and signatures (signifying their consent to run) appeared on a single form, with a tenth SP as proposer, and an eleventh SP as seconder.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I viewed the <span class="font-italic">collective</span> nomination as an exercise of each of the nine SPs’ <span class="font-italic">individual</span> right to run for election, and to nominate himself for that purpose. In making that nomination, the proposer and seconder were agents of the nine nominated SPs. The proposer and seconder were not exercising any individual rights of theirs to make several nominations; instead, each of the nine SPs was exercising his own right to run, and to nominate himself. The nine nominated SPs were not nominees in respect of the proposer’s or seconder’s lots: they were nominees in respect of their respective lots. Indeed, the proposer and seconder could still have put themselves forward for election, if they had wished to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the present case the proposer and seconder were themselves SPs, but this was not strictly necessary: in principle, an SP running for election could appoint a non-SP as an agent to nominate him. So, for instance, if he had given a non-SP a power of attorney for that purpose, his attorney could make that nomination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The correct question to ask was not: “can a single-lot SP nominate several persons for election?” It was: “can each of several individual SPs nominate himself for election, through a collective nomination of them all?” The answer to that is: “yes”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 An individual SP’s eligibility for election (under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA) lies at the heart of s 53 of the BMSMA. However, the applicants’ argument focused on <span class="font-italic">nomination</span> rather than on <span class="font-italic">eligibility</span> for election. On their argument, if each of the nine SPs had nominated himself, that would be fine; so too, if each of the nine SPs nominated another of the nine (such that each SP made just one nomination). The applicants’ narrow point was that the nine SPs (each of whom was eligible for election under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA) could not be collectively nominated, and if that happened then all nine would be ineligible to run because their <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">nominations</span><span class="font-italic"> were invalid</span>. That went against the core concept of an SP being eligible for election by virtue of his status as an SP: the <span class="font-italic">implied</span> prohibition contended for, would override the <span class="font-italic">express</span> provision in s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA that an SP is eligible for election.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I thus could not read into s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 53(12) of the BMSMA any implied prohibition against the collective nomination of individual SPs, when each of them was eligible for election. A collective nomination of individual SPs does not go against the letter, or the spirit, of the legislation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For the above reasons, I found that the collective nomination of the nine SPs was valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The commentary in the <span class="font-italic">SLS Guide</span> which says, “[o]wnership of one lot entitles you to nominate one person for election” should be understood as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An individual single-lot SP may run himself (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA), or he may nominate an immediate family member to run (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A corporate single-lot SP may nominate an individual to run (s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If a single lot is jointly owned, any one of the joint SPs who is an individual may run, or another person (whether an individual SP’s immediate family member under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA, or a corporate SP’s representative under s 53(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA) may be nominated in respect of that lot (s 53(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If several individual SPs are collectively nominated, each of them is exercising his individual right to run, and to nominate himself in respect of his lot – and that is valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I thus dismissed the appeal against the STB’s decision.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong En Hui Charis (Covenant Chambers LLC) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Teh Ee-Von (Infinitus Law Corporation) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
