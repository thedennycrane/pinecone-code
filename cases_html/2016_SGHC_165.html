Lawyers are often expected to fearlessly advance the interests of their clients. But when the notion of duty to the client is carried too far, lawyers may find themselves enabling and facilitating criminal conduct. Indeed, the present matter provides a timely reminder of what can go wrong when a lawyer deliberately turns a blind eye to signs of wrongdoing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>In this originating summons, the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) applied for the respondent (“the Respondent”), an advocate and solicitor of more than 30 years’ standing, to show cause as to why she should not be dealt with under s 83(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”). The conduct complained of was, in essence, that the Respondent had acted for the parties on both sides of an unlicensed moneylending transaction and had preferred the interests of the moneylender in the process. Four charges were brought against the Respondent, and the Disciplinary Tribunal determined that cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or, alternatively, s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA on each of the four charges. The Disciplinary Tribunal’s decision is reported in <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Leong </span><span class="font-italic">Pek Gan</span> [2015] SGDT 4 (“the DT Report”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The transaction in question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span>The transaction which the Respondent was engaged to handle (“the Transaction”) was, on its face, for the sale and purchase of a property at Bedok Court (“the Property”). The Property was owned by the complainant, Ms Vimala Devi d/o Selvadurai (“the Complainant”), and her husband (collectively referred to as “the Vendors”). At the relevant time, the Complainant was an insurance agent and her husband was a property agent. The intended purchaser was Invest-Ho Properties Pte Ltd (“Invest-Ho”). At all material times, Invest-Ho was represented by Benson Ho Soo Fong (“Ho”), who was its managing director and shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>The Transaction was structured as follows. The Vendors would grant Invest-Ho an option, exercisable anytime within six months, to purchase the Property at a price of $651,000. It should be noted that the market value of the Property at the time was almost three times that amount (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, approximately $1.7m), a point which we will return to later. The option fee was $250,000, and a further sum of $400,000 was to be paid upon the exercise of the option, leaving only a nominal $1,000 due on completion. At the same time, the Vendors would grant a power of attorney in Ho’s favour to allow him to deal with the Property. Among the broad powers granted to Ho were: (a) the power to “sell … and absolutely dispose of” the Property on such terms and conditions as he thought fit (cl 1.1); (b) the power, upon selling the Property, to give good receipt for any monies due to the Vendors and to do whatever he thought fit with those monies (cl 1.5); (c) the power to substitute any other person, at his pleasure, as the attorney (cl 1.17); (d) the power to deposit any monies which he received in his capacity as the Vendors’ attorney or which was otherwise due to the Vendors into any account in the name of any person whom he (Ho) deemed fit and to <span class="font-italic">withdraw th</span><span class="font-italic">ose monies for his own use and benefit</span>, including investing those monies in his own name (cl 1.21); (e) the power to do all other acts whatsoever in connection with the power of attorney (cl 1.22); and (f) the power to lease the Property (cll 2.1 to 2.8). In addition, the power of attorney was stated to be “irrevocable until the Property is sold and all monies paid to [Ho]”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The events leading up to the Transaction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>Beyond the undisputed fact that the Vendors and Ho were introduced to each other by a mutual friend, one Mr Selvarajan s/o Letchuman (“Rajan”), the parties proffered divergent accounts of the events leading up to the Transaction. According to the Vendors, Ho agreed to loan them $250,000 for a period of six months at an interest rate of 15% per annum, on the condition that they provided an option to purchase as well as a power of attorney over the Property. The power of attorney was to enable Ho to enforce the option to purchase in the event that the Vendors defaulted on loan repayment and tried to renege on the option to purchase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>On the other hand, Ho (who was called as the Respondent’s witness) testified that the Transaction was a genuine sale and purchase of the Property. According to him, the Vendors were in dire financial straits and had approached him for a loan of $400,000. He had rejected their request because he was not a licensed moneylender. Subsequently, the Vendors approached him again to ask if Invest-Ho was willing to purchase the Property. He also claimed that the parties had agreed on the purchase price of $651,000 after some negotiation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Respondent’s involvement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>At the material time, the Respondent was a partner at Ching Ching, Pek Gan &amp; Partners and had over 30 years of experience in conveyancing practice. Ho instructed the Respondent to act in the matter by way of an email dated 2 August 2012 (“the 2 August 2012 Email”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hello . Miss Leong</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Please see attachment . This is a Private 99 years . Can you please do for me</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thank you . </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ho Soo Fong</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The “attachment” referred to in the email included a draft option to purchase as well as a power of attorney which were to be executed by the Vendors. The Complainant was copied in this email.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>There is a dispute as to how the Respondent came to act for the Vendors. Ho’s account is that he instructed the Respondent on behalf of Invest-Ho and only introduced the Vendors to the Respondent when they asked if he knew of any conveyancing lawyer. Consistent with Ho’s account, the Respondent stated that she was introduced to the Vendors via the 2 August 2012 Email, and that the Vendors visited her office the next day (3 August 2012) and confirmed that they wanted her to act for them. In contrast, the Complainant states that it was Ho who chose the Respondent to act for her and her husband, and that Ho informed them that they would have to bear the solicitor’s fees of $1,000. According to the Complainant, the Vendors asked Ho if they could approach one of the lawyers whom her husband knew from his job as a real estate agent, but Ho insisted that they use the Respondent as their solicitor. Whichever was the case, the evidence was that the Vendors visited the Respondent’s office on 3 August 2012 and executed the option to purchase and the power of attorney in the Respondent’s presence. (The executed option to purchase and the executed power of attorney will hereafter be referred to as “the Option” and “the POA” respectively.) The handwritten attendance notes of the Respondent were bereft of details and simply stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- They signed (1) POA</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">       (2) OTP</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- But to wait for [Ho’s instructions] on Monday b4 proceeding any further</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- Email – apexintb24@singnet.com.sg</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- The OTP to be dated 3/8/12.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- No [objection] to me replacing the pages of the OTP since signature page not affected</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- To email to her the amended OTP now</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- To email amended OTP to [Ho] also</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the Respondent’s handwritten attendance notes were dated 3 July 2012, it is common ground between the parties that the date of the Vendors’ visit to the Respondent’s office was 3 August 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>On 5 August 2012, the Vendors sent Ho a softcopy of the Option. According to Ho, the document which he received was “signed but undated”. Upon noticing two minor typographical errors in the Option, Ho sent an email to the Respondent and the Vendors pointing out those errors and asking the Respondent to make the necessary changes. The changes were made after the Vendors confirmed that they had no objections.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>On 6 August 2012, the Respondent informed Ho that she would lodge the POA the next day and sought instructions as to whether a caveat should be lodged against the Property as well. The Respondent did not copy the Vendors in her email. Ho replied the next day (copying the Complainant) with instructions for the Respondent to lodge a caveat against the Property. In his reply, Ho also asked for a copy of the Option so that he could arrange for the option fee of $250,000 to be paid to the Vendors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>On 7 August 2012, the Respondent lodged a caveat on the Property in favour of Invest-Ho. It is particularly noteworthy that the caveat was lodged before the Vendors received the option fee, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before Invest-Ho’s interest in the Property had crystallised. The Respondent does not deny this. In fact, her evidence is that she lodged a caveat on the Property on Ho’s assurance that he would procure the payment of the option fee to the Vendors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>It was only on 8 August 2012 that the Vendors collected a cheque for the $250,000 option fee from Ho at Invest-Ho’s office. In exchange, the Complainant issued a cash cheque to Ho for the sum of $19,750, which, according to her, comprised $18,750 for the agreed 15% per annum interest on the loan for the six-month term and $1,000 for solicitor’s fees. Ho admits to having received the $19,750, but explains that the money was the commission for one Mr Nagasaravanan s/o Pillay (“Mr Sara”). According to Ho, Mr Sara had “inform[ed]” Rajan, who had in turn introduced him (Ho) to the Vendors (it is unclear from Ho’s evidence what Mr Sara had informed Rajan of). We will return to this point later.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The disagreements between the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span>On 1 January 2013, Ho sent the Complainant’s husband a text message which read as follows: “Hello. The exercise of your Option to Purchase of your property is coming very soon. Please let me know. Were [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] you agree to us to extend your date of option in [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] an urgent basis”. The Complainant’s husband responded saying that he would get back to Ho. However, the Vendors never replied to Ho.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>On or around 14 January 2013, Ho rang the Respondent to inform her of his intention to instruct another law firm to act for Invest-Ho in the purchase of the Property. Invest-Ho then instructed Optimus Chambers to act on its behalf in the exercise of the Option. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>On or around 28 January 2013, the Complainant’s husband recalled the unanswered text message which he had received from Ho on 1 January 2013 and informed the Complainant about it. The Complainant sent Ho a text message asking to speak to him about “my loan with you”. Ho denied knowledge of any loan between them. The Complainant and Ho subsequently exchanged a series of text messages in which Ho continued to deny the existence of a loan while the Complainant persisted in her attempts to ask for an extension of time to repay the loan. We set out some of these text messages below to give a flavour of what transpired between Ho and the Complainant:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sender</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Content of Text Message</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Complainant</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">“Hi Benson..

Optimus Chambers wrote to the Respondent to confirm that the completion date would be 15 March 2013, and enclosed a cheque for $400,000 as well as signed copies of the Option. At around the same time, Invest-Ho offered to withdraw the Option upon the Vendors’ refund of the option fee of $250,000 and their payment of $470,000 as compensation. The Vendors were given the deadline of 8 February 2013 to respond to this offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>On 1 February 2013, the Vendors discharged the Respondent from acting further as their solicitor. On 19 February 2013, a deed revoking the POA was filed in the High Court. The Vendors maintained throughout that the Transaction was a loan rather than a genuine sale and purchase of property, whereas Invest-Ho/Ho stood firm in their insistence that there was no such loan. Thereafter, the Vendors and Invest Ho/Ho commenced various legal proceedings to try to either (on the Vendors’ part) unravel the Transaction or (on the part of Invest Ho/Ho) perform the Transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>Those legal proceedings are largely irrelevant to the present application as the Respondent had by then ceased to act for the Vendors. Thus, we will not delve into them in detail, save to mention two subsequent developments. On 10 December 2014, the parties entered into a consent judgment in settlement of Invest-Ho’s claim in Suit No 843 of 2013 for specific performance of the sale and purchase of the Property pursuant to the Option (“the Consent Judgment”). Under the terms of the Consent Judgment, the Vendors were to pay Invest-Ho, within three months of the date of the judgment, the sum of $510,000, which comprised $250,000 as the refund of the option fee and $260,000 as compensation for aborting the Transaction. It is also relevant to note that the Vendors applied to set aside the Consent Judgment, but their application was dismissed by the court on 13 October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The police reports</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>On 9 March 2015 (the deadline for the Vendors to pay Invest-Ho the sum of $510,000 pursuant to the Consent Judgment), the Complainant lodged a police report against Ho and the Respondent alleging, amongst other things, that: (a) there was an unlicensed moneylending agreement between Ho and the Vendors; (b) the Respondent had “altered” the purchase price of $1,851,000 to $651,000 in the Option; and (c) the Respondent had been “coercing other clients into signing the Option to Purchase and Power of Attorney documents”. On 6 May 2015, the Respondent was informed that the police would not be taking further action against her in relation to the police report.

The Complainant explained, through her solicitors in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal, that the execution page was missing because the Respondent had not given the Vendors a copy of the Option after it was executed, and that she (the Complainant) had only recently found a copy of the Initialled Option (without the execution page) among a bundle of documents kept by a mutual friend of Ho and the Vendors, namely, Rajan.

We briefly set out below the key findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal on each of the charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>In respect of the first charge, the Disciplinary Tribunal ruled that the Respondent had contravened r 28 of the LPPCR by failing to advise the Vendors of the potential conflict of interests arising from her acting for both Ho/Invest-Ho and the Vendors <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Transaction, and considered her breach to be more than a technical breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>The Disciplinary Tribunal considered the Respondent’s failure to seek the informed and/or written consent of the Vendors to her concurrently representing them as well as Ho/Invest-Ho <span class="font-italic">unbecoming</span> for a solicitor who had practised conveyancing for some 30 years (see the DT Report at [25]). The Disciplinary Tribunal noted that the Respondent never paused to advise the Vendors of “the patent conflict of interests” and of the need for them to seek independent legal advice (at [27]). Further, the Respondent operated on multiple assumptions at the expense of her clients’ interests. Those assumptions were flawed and did not reduce the unflinching loyalty which she owed to each of her clients (at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>With regard to the second charge, the Disciplinary Tribunal found that the Respondent had preferred the interests of Invest-Ho/Ho over those of the Vendors while advising both parties in relation to the Transaction. In this regard, the Disciplinary Tribunal made two key findings in the DT Report:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The POA and its broad terms could only be in the interests of Invest-Ho/Ho and not the Vendors (at [39]). The Respondent was also aware that the POA was not a negotiated document and that its initial draft had been provided to her by Ho.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whilst less serious than the complaint relating to the POA, the Respondent’s act of filing the caveat over the Property in Invest-Ho’s favour even before the options monies had been paid to the Vendors gave Invest-Ho’s/Ho’s interests precedence (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>In respect of the third charge, the Disciplinary Tribunal held that the Respondent had <span class="font-italic">reasonable grounds to believe</span> that her advice was being sought to advance an illegal moneylending transaction, and that she had been “blissfully oblivious to the suspicious nature of the entire transaction” (see the DT Report at [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>To begin with, the fact that the POA was expressed to be “irrevocable until the Property is sold and all monies paid to [Ho]” ought to have signalled to the Respondent that the Transaction was not a straightforward sale and purchase between a willing buyer and willing sellers (at [60]). Instead, the Option was “a security for a loan” and the POA was “a further safeguard provided to [Invest-Ho] to enforce that security” (at [61]). Moreover, when questioned by counsel for the Law Society on the unusual terms of the Transaction and the payment of $19,750 by the Vendors, Ho was unable to offer any credible explanation for the same (at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fourth charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Where the fourth charge was concerned, the Disciplinary Tribunal ruled that the Respondent had <span class="font-italic">reasonable grounds to suspect</span> that the Property was used or was intended to be used in connection with illegal moneylending, one of the forms of “criminal conduct” falling within the ambit of s 39(1) of the CDSA. Therefore, her failure to disclose the Transaction to either the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office of the Commercial Affairs Department or an authorised officer under the CDSA was a contravention of r 11G of the LPPCR (see the DT Report at [82]–[83]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>The Disciplinary Tribunal held that the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> of having “reasonable grounds to believe” (<span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the third charge) was of a higher order than that of having “reasonable grounds to suspect” (<span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the fourth charge) because belief was stronger than suspicion (at [80]–[81]). Thus, given its finding (in relation to the third charge) that the Respondent had reasonable grounds to believe that her advice was being sought to advance an illegal moneylending transaction, the Disciplinary Tribunal was of the view that the Respondent must necessarily have had reasonable grounds to suspect that the Property was used or was intended to be used in connection with illegal moneylending (at [82]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues before this court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>The issues before this court may be broadly classified as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether due cause for disciplinary action to be taken against the Respondent has been shown under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if so, what is the appropriate penalty to be imposed on the Respondent under s 83(1) of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first charge: Whether the Respondent failed to advise the Vendors of the potential conflict of interests arising from her concurrent representation and of her duty in the event that such conflict materialised </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>It is often said that no man can serve two masters. The danger is that a person who undertakes to serve two masters at the same time may easily find himself in the position where he must prefer the interests of one over those of the other. It is for this reason that the law mandates that a solicitor who wishes to accept instructions from multiple parties in the same matter must seek the informed consent of all the parties whom he proposes to act for. In the present application, the nub of the first charge is that, prior to accepting instructions from the parties on both sides of the Transaction, the Respondent failed to advise the Vendors of the potential conflict of interests and of her duty as an advocate and solicitor if such conflict arose. The basis of this charge is r 28 of the LPPCR, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Potential conflict of interests</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">28.</span> When accepting instructions to act for more than one party in any commercial or conveyancing transaction where a diversity of interests exists between the parties, an advocate and solicitor shall advise each party of the potential conflict of interests and of the advocate and solicitor’s duty if such conflict arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>In the conveyancing context, the requirement of informed consent finds expression in r 6 of the Law Society’s Conveyancing Practice Directions and Rulings dated 19 May 2009 (“the 2009 Conveyancing PD”), which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.

In respect of the first element, the Respondent admits to having accepted instructions to act for both the Vendors and Invest-Ho/Ho in the purported sale and purchase of the Property. In so far as the third element is concerned, counsel for the Respondent confirmed at the hearing before us that the Respondent had admitted, in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal, that she did not inform the Vendors of the potential conflict of interests arising from her representation of both parties to the Transaction and of her duty in the event that such conflict materialised. The dispute centres, instead, on the second element. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>The Respondent argues that she did not have to advise the Vendors of the potential conflict of interests (and of her duty if such conflict arose) because the parties’ interests were not diverse at the material time. The main thrust of her argument is that r 28 of the LPPCR only applies when a solicitor is concurrently representing “clients whose interests [are] irreconcilable and/or directly in conflict and/or diametrically opposed”. This argument, as we understand it, seeks to confine the application of r 28 to situations where there is an actual, irreconcilable conflict between the clients’ interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>In our judgment, the Respondent’s interpretation of r 28 flies in the face of the plain language of this provision, which speaks of an advocate and solicitor’s duty to “advise each party of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">potential </span><span class="font-italic">conflict of interests</span> and of the advocate and solicitor’s duty <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if </span><span class="font-italic">such conflict arises</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. It has been observed that this rule is intended to apply in situations where the parties have different, <span class="font-italic">but not yet conflicting</span>, interests: see Alvin Chen, “Counselling Multiple Clients with Conflicting Interests” <span class="font-italic">Singapore Law Gazette</span> (December 2015) pp 32–37 at p 33.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>We are satisfied that the Vendors’ interests and Ho’s/Invest-Ho’s interests were diverse at the point when the Respondent accepted instructions to act for them. It is true that the parties were <span class="font-italic">ad </span><span class="font-italic">idem</span> as to the terms of the Transaction. Such agreement evinced a compatibility of their interests and created a common interest between them in completing the Transaction. However, it should not be forgotten that the parties were ultimately on opposing sides of the Transaction (whether as lender/borrower or as buyer/seller). It was therefore not without reason that V K Rajah JC remarked that “prudent solicitors, in all but the plainest cases, do not usually act for both the vendor and [the] purchaser in the same transaction”: see the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli v Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim (a firm)</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 594 (“<span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span>”) at [56]. In the present case, the Transaction was far from one of “the plainest cases”. It had a highly unusual structure, and, in particular, the terms of the POA were clearly and overwhelmingly in favour of Ho/Invest-Ho, providing a strong indication of the potential for a conflict of interests to arise at a later stage of the Transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>It also appears that the Respondent did not even apply her mind to the possibility of a conflict of interests arising before accepting instructions from both the Vendors and Ho/Invest-Ho. Had the Respondent truly believed that her obligation under r 28 of the LPPCR was not triggered (and therefore proceeded to act for both the Vendors and Ho/Invest-Ho on that basis), she would surely have raised this argument at the first available opportunity. But she did not. Her “common interest” argument was only raised after the conclusion of the hearing before the Disciplinary Tribunal. It is therefore clear, in our view, that this particular argument arose as a very belated afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>For the sake of completeness, we will address the Respondent’s contention that the Disciplinary Tribunal acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> by considering r 6 of the 2009 Conveyancing PD. There is no merit in this argument. In this regard, we find it apposite to refer to the comment by V K Rajah J in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Wong Keng Leong </span><span class="font-italic">Rayney v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 934 that “[t]he rules of ethics, as articulated in [the then equivalent of] the LPA, its subsidiary legislation and the Law Society Practice Directions and conventions” should not be perceived as an external and inconvenient imposition of values on the legal profession, but rather, as “an embodiment of the moral compass and aspirations of the profession” (at [84]). Indeed, the Law Society’s practice directions and rulings set out prevailing standards of professional conduct that the Respondent, as a member of the legal profession, is bound by, and the Disciplinary Tribunal was therefore entitled to consider them in assessing whether the Respondent had fallen short of her professional duty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second charge: Whether the Respondent preferred the interests of Ho/Invest-Ho while advising both parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>Beyond the requirement of informed consent, it is imperative that a solicitor who acts for multiple parties in the same matter advances each client’s interests unaffected by the interests of the other(s). Where the second charge is concerned, the crux of the complaint is that the Respondent failed in her duty to the Vendors by subordinating their interests to those of Invest-Ho/Ho with regard to two main aspects of the Transaction: (a) the lodgement of the caveat over the Property in favour of Invest-Ho; and (b) the execution of the POA. The basis of this charge is r 25(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPPCR, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conflict of interest</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">25.</span> During the course of a retainer, an advocate and solicitor shall advance the client’s interest unaffected by —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any interest of any other person; or …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>An advocate and solicitor’s core duty is to act in the best interests of his client and he should avoid any influence which could potentially interfere with his unflinching loyalty to his client: see, for example, the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Uthayasurian Sidambaram </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 674 (“<span class="font-italic">Uthayasurian</span>”) at [45].<span class="font-italic"> </span>Whilst there is no blanket prohibition against multiple representation, the standard of skill and care expected of a solicitor acting for multiple parties <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>each client must be at least equivalent to that of a solicitor acting for a single party: see <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span> at [48]. The solicitor’s duty extends to drawing attention to and, where appropriate, advising on the legal ramifications of a particular transaction; in particular, he ought to draw the client’s attention to any unusual aspects of the transaction, notwithstanding any concern that it may incur the displeasure of the other clients whom he is representing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>The present case calls to mind the facts of <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v</span> <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phuay Khiang</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phuay Khiang</span>”), a decision by this court. In that case, the solicitor prepared and witnessed the execution of a power of attorney appointing a complete stranger as the complainants’ attorney in the proposed sale and subletting of a flat. The solicitor contended that he was only obliged to provide a very limited ministerial role in so far as the preparation of the power of attorney was concerned, and was not obliged to inquire into why the complainants wished to appoint an attorney or why they wished to pay the sale proceeds to a third party. In this regard, V K Rajah JA observed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">95 … [T]he respondent erred in taking the view that it was not incumbent on him to query and advise the complainants on why they were executing a power of attorney. This is clearly not a situation where the respondent’s duties were wholly ministerial in nature. The respondent’s duties in this case went beyond the essentially perfunctory role of preparing a power of attorney and witnessing its execution. <span class="font-italic">The respondent was obliged to take reasonable care to advise and ensure that the complainants understood the implications of executing a power of attorney in the prevailing circumstances</span>. The respondent ought to have asked the complainants for their reasons in effecting a power of attorney given that the usual reasons for executing a power of attorney were absent on the facts … More significantly, the proposed attorney (Cheung) appeared to be a complete stranger to the complainants. The power of attorney prepared by the respondent was extremely broad and far-reaching both in its scope and application. It endowed Cheung with an almost unfettered discretion and power to dispose of the Flat as he saw fit, at any price and to any party. This effectively exposed the complainants to the risk that Cheung could sell the Flat at an undervalue to a related party, and potentially leave the complainants without any form of meaningful recourse.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98 The respondent compromised the interests of the complainants in the course of acting for them. He did not adequately explain to the complainants their potential legal predicament and failed to enquire into the context in which the power of attorney was required. Instead, the respondent took the view that he had been obliged to only provide a very limited ministerial role in so far as the preparation of the power of attorney was concerned. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Put another way, the respondent merely perceived his role as that of “rubber-stamping” the power of attorney and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[ensuring] that the technical details stated therein were accurate.

That having been said, even where a solicitor is dealing with commercially-savvy clients, he should not immediately assume that he is thereby free of any duty to advise them of the potential ramifications of any decisions which are potentially detrimental to their interests: see <span class="font-italic">Uthayasurian</span> at [57]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>In the present case, we are satisfied that the Respondent, while acting for both Ho/Invest-Ho and the Vendors in relation to the Transaction, breached her duty under r 25(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPPCR to advance the Vendors’ interests unaffected by the interests of Ho/Invest-Ho. Our decision in this regard is based on two key aspects of the Respondent’s conduct. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First</span>, contrary to the Respondent’s claims that she did advise the Vendors of the legal implications of the Transaction during their first meeting on 3 August 2012, the facts demonstrate that she did not do so. By the Respondent’s own admission, she spent only ten minutes taking the Vendors through each of the documents which they were to sign. Further, under cross-examination, the Respondent conceded that she did not advise the Vendors that: (a) the POA was expressed to be “irrevocable until the Property is sold and all monies paid to [Ho]”; (b) the POA went beyond the scope of the Option; and (c) there was a risk that Ho might breach the fiduciary duty which he owed the Vendors under the POA, given that he also wore the hat of Invest-Ho’s managing director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>We agree with the Law Society that the Respondent operated on multiple assumptions at the expense of the Vendors. She assumed that the Vendors and Ho/Invest-Ho had agreed on all the terms prior to engaging her services. She also assumed that the Vendors knew the consequences of executing the documents which they were to sign and that they would have asked her if they were in doubt. Coupled with her repeated emphasis on the fact that the parties had agreed on the terms before engaging her services, it is clear that the Respondent saw her role as a purely ministerial one. We note also that, in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal, then counsel for the Respondent sought to convince the Disciplinary Tribunal that “conveyancing now has become so factory production line”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>As was the case in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phuay Khiang</span>, the terms of the POA in the present case were extremely broad and the usual reasons for executing a power of attorney were ostensibly absent. By the Respondent’s own account, the Vendors wanted to sign the Option and the POA in a hurry. Notwithstanding these alarm bells, the Respondent did not see it necessary to probe deeper, and failed to adequately explain to the Vendors the nature and implications of the POA. Bearing in mind that the Respondent neglected to advise the Vendors in the face of the grant of a power of attorney that was detrimental to their interests and overwhelmingly in favour of Ho/Invest-Ho (for whom the Respondent was also acting), it is plain that the Respondent preferred the interests of Ho/Invest-Ho over those of the Vendors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">48 </span>In addition, we note that the Respondent’s attendance notes (set out in full above at [8]) were sorely lacking in details and did not record any advice rendered to the Vendors. The Respondent’s explanation during cross-examination was that it was not her practice to record what she explained to her clients. We find this particularly troubling in the light of repeated judicial pronouncements that an advocate and solicitor has a duty to keep contemporaneous notes and diligently document each stage of the transaction which he is handling, especially <span class="font-italic">any significant advice</span> rendered to the client. This would include taking attendance notes meticulously and faithfully throughout the course of his retainer (see <span class="font-italic">Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hendri Rusli</span> at [63]). The importance of a solicitor keeping contemporaneous attendance notes as a record of the communications between him and his clients was more recently reiterated by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar bte Mohd Ali and others v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin</span> [2015] 5 SLR 62 (at [97], [105] and [155]). In the absence of credible contemporaneous records, the court may come to the view that an adverse inference should be drawn against the solicitor: see <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phuay Khiang</span> at [82]. Given the Respondent’s admission that she did not advise the Vendors of what were, in our view, material aspects of the Transaction, it is unnecessary for us to draw such an inference in the present case. However, had it been necessary, we would have been prepared to find that this is an appropriate case in which an adverse inference should be drawn against the solicitor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Secondly</span>, the conduct of the Respondent subsequent to her meeting with the Vendors on 3 August 2012 was deplorable. The Disciplinary Tribunal found that the Respondent lodged the caveat against the Property in favour of Invest-Ho before the option fee was paid to the Vendors. Before us, the Respondent submitted that the Disciplinary Tribunal erred in so finding because she had lodged the caveat only after the Vendors had received Invest-Ho’s cheque for the option fee. She submitted, further, that a cheque was deemed paid on the date of tender. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>We note, first, that the Respondent’s submission is inconsistent with her affidavit evidence, in which she stated that she lodged the caveat against the Property upon Ho’s assurance that he was going to arrange for the payment of the option monies to the Vendors. This suggested that it was clear in the Respondent’s mind that the option monies had yet to be paid to the Vendors when she proceeded to lodge the caveat. In any case, we do not think there is merit in the Respondent’s submissions that a cheque is deemed paid on the date of tender. The decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chong Keng v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Bak Keng Vincent </span>[1985–1986] SLR(R) 496 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chong Keng</span>”), on which the Respondent relies, does not stand for the proposition that a cheque is deemed paid on the date of tender. <span class="font-italic">Tan Chong Keng</span> stands, instead, for a more limited proposition: that the acceptance by a creditor of a cheque in payment of a debt is, in the absence of any specific agreement, a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conditional payment</span> which operates to suspend the creditor’s remedies against the debtor in respect of the debt unless and until the cheque has been presented and dishonoured. Given the risk of Invest-Ho’s cheque for the $250,000 option fee being dishonoured, it was imprudent of the Respondent to have filed the caveat against the Property before the cheque was presented and cleared. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>To conclude our analysis of the second charge, we find that the Respondent failed to advise the Vendors on critical aspects of the Transaction which were clearly advantageous to Ho/Invest-Ho but disadvantageous to them (the Vendors), and lodged a caveat over the Property in Invest-Ho’s favour before the option fee was received by the Vendors. The Vendors were first-time clients of the Respondent. In contrast, the Respondent had a more than 20-year solicitor-client relationship with Ho, and this, in our view, required the Respondent to take greater care in her dealings with the Vendors so as to ensure that she did not unwittingly prefer the interests of Invest-Ho/Ho. But it is quite apparent from the way in which events unfolded that she failed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>For the above reasons, we are satisfied that the Respondent fell short of the standards expected of an advocate and solicitor representing multiple parties in the same matter. The present case is a timely reminder of the inherent risks involved in concurrent representation, and we urge solicitors who represent multiple clients in the same matter to exercise scrupulous caution when so doing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third charge: Whether the Respondent knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the parties were requesting for advice to advance an illegal purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>We turn now to the third charge. Rule 22 of the LPPCR, together with various other provisions therein, emphasises the duty of an advocate and solicitor not to connive with or assist a client in his misconduct: see Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Ethics and Professional Responsibility: A Code for the Advocate and Solicitor </span>(Academy Publishing, 2007)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 05.001–05.002. This duty arises out of an advocate and solicitor’s multi-faceted responsibility as an officer of the court and his duty to assist in the administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>The central question with regard to the third charge is whether the Respondent knew <span class="font-italic">or</span> had reasonable grounds to believe that her advice was being sought to advance an illegal purpose, more specifically, unlicensed moneylending in contravention of the MLA. The basis of this charge is r 22 of the LPPCR, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">No advice for illegal purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span> An advocate and solicitor shall not tender advice to a client when the advocate and solicitor knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the client is requesting the advice to advance an illegal purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>There are two planks to the Respondent’s defence with regard to the third charge. First, she raises a preliminary objection to the specification of alternative <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirements in the third charge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “knows or has reasonable grounds to believe”). The charge, so her argument goes, is bad for duplicity as two distinct offences were rolled up into one charge. Second, the Respondent argues that she did not know nor did she have reasonable grounds to believe that her advice was being sought to advance an illegal purpose. We will address these arguments in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the third charge is bad for duplicity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>Section 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”), which sets out the rule against duplicity of charges, provides that there must be a separate charge for “every <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">distinct</span> offence of which any person is accused” [emphasis added in bold italics]. It is unclear whether this rule applies to disciplinary proceedings under the LPA. However, even assuming that it does apply, we are of the view that it has not been engaged in the present case. It is clear from the case law that two offences will only be considered distinct within the meaning of s 132(1) of the CPC (and, thus, be required to be set out in two separate charges) if they are <span class="font-italic">not in any way inter-related</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if there is no connection between the various acts which give rise to criminal liability for each offence. This interpretation comports with the rationale underlying the rule against duplicity, which is to save the accused from being embarrassed in his defence as well as to prevent the court from being unduly influenced by the different evidence tendered against the accused on different charges (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lim Chuan Huat </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>In the present case, the third charge sets out alternative degrees of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> (that is, “knows or has reasonable grounds to believe”) which the Law Society has to prove in relation to the <span class="font-italic">same</span> offence. Even if these alternative <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirements are considered to create separate offences, the offences cannot be said to be “not in any way inter-related” (see [56] above). In any case, the Respondent was clearly not prejudiced by the specification of alternative <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> in the third charge. She knew precisely the case which she had to meet – that she had at least reasonable grounds to believe that the purpose for which her advice was being sought was illegal. Accordingly, we are of the view that the third charge is not bad for duplicity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the third charge has been proved </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>In order for us to find that the third charge has been established, the Law Society has to prove that, <span class="font-italic">first</span>, the Transaction involved an illegal purpose (namely, unlicensed moneylending in contravention of the MLA) and, <span class="font-italic">second</span>, the Respondent knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the Transaction involved the aforesaid purpose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(1) Whether the Transaction involved unlicensed moneylending in contravention of the MLA</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>The first element which the Law Society has to prove (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the Transaction involved unlicensed moneylending in contravention of the MLA) raises two sub-issues: (a) whether there was a loan in the first place; and (b) whether Ho/Invest-Ho was carrying on a moneylending business.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Whether there was a loan in the first place</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">first sub-issue</span> is an obvious, logical as well as commonsensical one. In order to fall within the proscriptions contained within the MLA, a threshold requirement must be fulfilled: there must have been a “<span class="font-italic">loan</span>” in the first place. As Judith Prakash J observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lim Beng Cheng v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Sing </span>[2016] 1 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Sing (HC)</span>”) (at [63]), “[i]t is self-evident that a transaction must be a loan to attract the operation of the [MLA] in the first place” (see also generally the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Yoong Hong v Choong Fah Rubber Manufactory </span>[1962] AC 209 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Yoong Hong</span>”) in an appeal from a decision of the Federation of Malaya Supreme Court, as well as the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Nissho Iwai International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kohinoor </span><span class="font-italic">Impex Pte Ltd and another </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 170). And, in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">City Hardware Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 733 (“<span class="font-italic">City Hardware</span>”), a leading decision in this area of the law, Rajah J observed as follows (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A loan need not be given directly to the borrower. It suffices that the borrower gives directions on the disbursement of the moneys. What constitutes lending must of course remain a question of fact in every case. Careful consideration has to be given to the form and substance of the transaction as well as the parties’ position and relationship in the context of the entire factual matrix. <span class="font-italic">It is axiomatic that if there has been no lending there can be no moneylending</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In a similar vein, Chan Sek Keong CJ, delivering the grounds of decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Donald </span><span class="font-italic">McArthy Trading Pte Ltd and others v Pankaj s/o Dhirajlal (trading as TopBottom Impex) </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 321 (“<span class="font-italic">Donald </span><span class="font-italic">McArthy Trading</span>”), observed (at [10]) that “[i]t is axiomatic that without ‘lending’, there could be no ‘moneylending’”. It bears emphasising that this inquiry into whether there has been a loan is an intensely factual exercise which turns strictly on the precise circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>In the present case, we are satisfied that there <span class="font-italic">was</span>, in fact, <span class="font-italic">a loan</span> which was secured by the Option and the POA. Although the Transaction itself was cast in the form of a sale and purchase of real property, the overwhelming evidence of what, in <span class="font-italic">substance</span>, underlay this particular transaction made it very clear that it was nothing more than a thinly disguised <span class="font-italic">loan</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>The following aspects of the Transaction were highly unusual and, in our view, cast serious doubts on the genuineness of the sale and purchase transaction which it purported to be. <span class="font-italic">First</span>, the period for the exercise of the Option was six months, significantly longer than the customary two-week period for the exercise of an option. <span class="font-italic">Secondly</span>, the sale price was $651,000 for a property which, as mentioned earlier at [4] above, had a market value in the region of $1.7m at the material time. We find incredible Ho’s evidence that he did not – and did not have to – take into account the market value of the Property in fixing the sale price. <span class="font-italic">Thirdly</span>, the option fee of $250,000 amounted to 38.4% of the sale price, a percentage which is substantially higher than the normal option fee of 1–5% of the sale price. <span class="font-italic">Fourthly</span>, through the terms of the POA, Ho arrogated to himself an extraordinary range of powers which were far wider than necessary for the stated purpose of executing and completing the sale and purchase of the Property. Those powers, as set out above at [4], included, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>: (a) the power for Ho to “sell … and absolutely dispose of” the Property on such terms and conditions as he thought fit (cl 1.1); and (b) the power, upon selling the Property, to give good receipt for any monies due to the Vendors and to do whatever he thought fit with those monies (cl 1.5). <span class="font-italic">Finally</span>, the POA was stated to be “irrevocable until the Property is sold and all monies paid to [Ho]”. In our view, the only plausible explanation is that the POA stood as security for a loan of $250,000 to the Vendors for a six-month period. Should the Vendors default on loan repayment, Ho/Invest-Ho could exercise their rights under the Option and the POA, and compel the sale of the Property at an extremely low price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>Care must be taken to distinguish the facts of this case from those of other cases in which the courts have found that there was no loan. One such case, in particular, merits some discussion. In the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">E</span><span class="font-italic"> C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 1 SLR 32 (“<span class="font-italic">E C </span><span class="font-italic">Investment</span>”), Ridout Residence Pte Ltd (“Ridout”) granted E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd (“ECI”) an option to purchase a property at a price of $20m, $3.2m (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 14%) below the forced sale value placed on the property. The option fee was $1.5m, which amounted to 7.5% of the sale price. Later, the parties entered into a deed of settlement under which Ridout had the right to cancel the option within 60 days by refunding the $1.5m option fee and paying an additional sum of $180,000 to compensate ECI. It was held that the true nature of the transaction as embodied in the option to purchase and the deed of settlement was that of a genuine agreement for the sale of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>There are a number of key features that distinguish the present case from <span class="font-italic">E</span><span class="font-italic"> C Investment</span>. First, the option fee, as a percentage of the agreed sale price, is much higher in the present case. Unlike in <span class="font-italic">E </span><span class="font-italic">C Investment</span>, where the option fee was a mere 7.5% of the agreed sale price, the option fee in the present case amounts to 38.4% of the agreed sale price of $651,000. Second, there is, in the present case, a much greater disparity between the agreed sale price and the market value of the property concerned. Unlike in <span class="font-italic">E </span><span class="font-italic">C Investment</span>, where the sale price of the property was only 14% below its forced sale value and described as an “extremely attractive price” (see <span class="font-italic">E C </span><span class="font-italic">Investment </span>at [64]), the agreed sale price here is only about one-third of the market value of the Property and was arrived at without any rational basis. According to Ho, he arrived at the figure of $651,000 based on his personal opinion without any regard to the market value of the Property. Third, the present case involves a power of attorney containing extremely and unnecessarily broad powers for the attorney, Ho, to deal with the Property as he deemed fit. Such a power of attorney is noticeably absent in <span class="font-italic">E </span><span class="font-italic">C Investment</span>. In view of these critical differences, the facts of <span class="font-italic">E </span><span class="font-italic">C Investment </span>can clearly be distinguished, and we are satisfied that the Transaction in the case before us was, in substance, a loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span>We find it useful to also refer to the recent (unreported) decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Sing v Lim Beng Cheng</span> Civil Appeal No 213 of 2015 (9 May 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Sing (CA)</span>”), in which the court largely upheld Prakash J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Sing (HC)</span>, save in respect of the issue of whether the transaction in question was, in substance, a loan. That transaction was on its face for the sale and purchase of real property at a price of $300,000. The option fee was $240,000. The vendor was entitled to “buy back” the option within three months at a sum of $340,000, failing which the intended purchaser would be entitled to either receive a sum of $340,000 or complete the purchase of the property at the agreed price of $300,000. The Court of Appeal accepted that, although the transaction was structured as an investment, it was essentially a loan in substance. However, this finding had no bearing on the outcome of the appeal, which was dismissed as the court held that the MLA was not applicable on the facts of the case. In our view, the facts of the present case point even more glaringly to the existence of a loan than those of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Sing (CA)</span>, especially in the light of the POA, which we have repeatedly noted to be extremely and unnecessarily broad in its scope. As stated above, there is no other discernible reason for such a power of attorney apart from its being security for a loan extended to the Vendors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>We are also satisfied that the payment of $19,750 by the Vendors on 8 August 2012 (see [12] above) was intended to be the 15% per annum interest payable for the loan and $1,000 in solicitor’s fees. We accept that the Respondent had no knowledge of this payment, but it is nevertheless a critical piece of evidence that casts light on the true nature of the Transaction. Ho’s evidence that the entire sum of $19,750 was meant as commission for Mr Sara for introducing him, through Rajan, to the Property is rather contrived. As pointed out by the Law Society in its submissions, Mr Sara was a cable contractor, not a housing agent; nor was he the Rajan who had introduced the Vendors to Ho. Moreover, although there was a handwritten note in which Mr Sara purported to acknowledge his receipt of the commission, that handwritten note stated the amount received as $19,700, and not the $19,750 stated on the Complainant’s cheque. Ho could not explain this discrepancy in the amount of commission that was allegedly paid to Mr Sara, apart from saying that perhaps, his (Ho’s) nephew, who had cashed in the cheque, had taken $50. In addition, Ho had no good explanation as to why it was necessary for the Vendors to pay Mr Sara’s commission through him, as evidenced by the following exchange:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Mr Ho, you can tell them, “This is your commission that you owe Mr Sara. You pay him directly. Don’t waste my time.” Correct? You could have told them this, right?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Yes, the reason why---the reason because this Sara don’t want to see him. Er, see---see these family people. I don’t know what happened. This one, I don’t know. If---if she [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Complainant] want to see them early, she can---er, sorry. He can direct introduce, but he get another person to introduce. That are the reason. And even, they want cash, you know? I said, “I got the cheque.” She said, “Don’t want, you go and get ca---cash for me.” So I have to get my nephew. Er, the cheque they give it to my nephew. I ask my nephew, “Go and collect it.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>We note too that multiple references were made to a “loan” in many of the text messages exchanged between the Complainant and Ho. Those text messages, which we set out earlier at [15] above, were exchanged in the context of the Complainant’s request for an extension of time to repay the option fee of $250,000. While Ho took pains to deny the existence of any loan in his replies to the Complainant’s text messages, the Complainant’s repeated pleas for an extension of time and for Ho not to take away her home contain, in our view, a strong ring of truth. Further, the execution of the Consent Judgment, under which the Vendors agreed to pay Invest-Ho $510,000 to abort the Transaction, is yet another indication of the Vendors’ lack of genuine intention to sell the Property. Similarly, it is clear from the evidence that Invest-Ho had no genuine interest in purchasing the Property. This can be seen from the fact that on or around the date on which the Option was exercised, Invest-Ho offered to withdraw the Option provided that the Vendors refund the option fee of $250,000 and make payment of a sum of $470,000 as compensation (see [16] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>Before leaving this first sub-issue of whether there was a loan in the first place, we turn to address the Respondent’s submission that the court’s dismissal of the Vendors’ application to set aside the Consent Judgment (see [18] above) is good evidence that the Transaction was a genuine sale and purchase transaction. It is clear from a perusal of the relevant minute sheet that the court’s dismissal of the Vendors’ application was not premised on any finding as to whether the parties were involved in an illegal moneylending transaction. Instead, the issue before the court was whether there was any contractual vitiating factor (such as duress or undue influence) that would warrant setting aside the Consent Judgment, and on that basis, the court concluded that there were insufficient grounds to set aside the judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>For the above reasons, we are persuaded that the form of the Transaction was merely a façade to disguise what was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in substance</span> a loan.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Whether Ho/Invest-Ho was carrying on a moneylending business</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">second sub-issue</span> of whether Ho/Invest-Ho was carrying on a moneylending business is relatively straightforward. As Chan Sek Keong J aptly put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Subramaniam </span><span class="font-italic">Dhanapakiam v Ghaanthimathi </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Subramaniam </span><span class="font-italic">Dhanapakiam</span>”) (at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The settled law is that what is prohibited by [the then equivalent of the MLA] was not moneylending but the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">business</span> of moneylending. This is <span class="font-italic">a question of fact.</span> It is also settled law that the giving of a number of loans to friends does not constitute the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">business</span> of moneylending, unless there is a system and continuity about the transactions.

In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the carrying on of moneylending as a “business” is inherent in the definition of “moneylender” in s 2 of the MLA, in that this provision defines a “moneylender” as “a person who, whether as principal or agent, carries on or holds himself out in any way as carrying on the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">business</span> of moneylending …” [emphasis added in bold italics]. This definition of “moneylender” has to be read in tandem with the presumption in s 3 of the MLA, which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Persons presumed to be moneylenders</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3. </span>Any person, other than an excluded moneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>Instructive guidance on the interrelationship between s 2 and s 3 of the MLA was provided by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Chik Lun and others v Loh Kim Her and others and another action </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 338 (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Mak</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Chik Lun</span>”)<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [11]–[12]:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 To prove that a person is in the business of moneylending, the easiest way is to show that the rebuttable presumption in s 3 of [the then equivalent of the MLA] is applicable to the facts of the case. If the borrower can show that a person lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid, the person is presumed to be a moneylender. Once a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> presumption is raised, it is for the lender to rebut the presumption by showing that it does not apply. He has to bring himself within one of the exceptions in s 2 or show that he is not a moneylender within the terms of the definition in s 2. In rebutting the presumption, the claimant, for instance, has to show that there was neither system nor continuity in moneylending. The local test of whether there is a business of moneylending is whether there was a system and continuity in the transactions. If no system or continuity is displayed, the alternative test (the <span class="font-italic">Litchfield</span> test) of whether the alleged moneylender is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible is used.

Further, a solitary transaction can amount to a moneylending transaction in an appropriate case: see <span class="font-italic">Bhagwandas</span><span class="font-italic"> Naraindas v Brooks Exim Pte Ltd</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 932</span> at [51], <span class="font-italic">Ng Kum </span><span class="font-italic">Peng v PP</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 900 </span>at [43].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">136 As stated by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Chik Lun</span>, if the borrower can show that a person lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid, the person is presumed to be a moneylender under s 3 of the [MLA]. It is then for the lender to rebut the presumption by showing [that] the [MLA] does not apply. The reference to “a larger sum being repaid” in s 3 is not confined to repayment in money only. If the repayment is in kind or partly in cash and in kind, it may still constitute a “larger sum” for the purpose of s 3 because otherwise, it would be easy to circumvent that section: see Woo Bih Li J in <span class="font-italic">Ding </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Kong v Mok Kwong Yue</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 637</span> at [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>Reference may also be made to, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Ng Kum </span><span class="font-italic">Peng v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 900 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kum </span><span class="font-italic">Peng</span>”) at [35]−[40] and <span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Thong v Lee Kiam Hong </span>[1998] SGHC 64 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Thong</span>”) at [19]−[20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">75 </span>Indeed, the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">rebuttable presumption under s </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3</span> of the MLA is a very significant one. The earliest version of what is now s 3 apparently had <span class="font-italic">no counterpart</span> in the corresponding <span class="font-italic">English</span> legislation from which the MLA stems, and this is the case even today (see the observation of Spenser-Wilkinson J in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Esmail</span><span class="font-italic"> Sahib v Noordin </span>[1951] MLJ 98 at 98, which was noted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Subramaniam </span><span class="font-italic">Dhanapakiam </span>at [9]; and see, further, the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>”) at [36]−[37] and [70]). In the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Yoong Hong</span>, Lord Devlin, delivering the judgment of the Board, succinctly summarised the significance of the presumption in the Federation of Malaya’s then equivalent of s 3 of the MLA (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, s 3 of the Moneylenders Ordinance 1951 (Malaya)) as follows (at 218):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 3 enables a defendant to found his claim on proof of a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">single</span> loan made to him at interest, it being <span class="font-italic">presumed</span>, in the absence of rebutting evidence, that there were <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">sufficient other transactions of a similar sort</span> to amount to a carrying on of business.

In this regard, there is no substitute for a granular analysis of the same – albeit bearing in mind Rajah J’s salutary reminder that “the court ought not to be overzealous in analysing or deconstructing a transaction in order to infer and/or conclude that the object of the transaction was to lend money” (see <span class="font-italic">City Hardware </span>at [25]). On a normative level, the two alternative tests that are now firmly established in the Singapore legal landscape in this particular area of the law were succinctly stated by Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Mak</span><span class="font-italic"> Chik Lun</span> at [11] (quoted above at [72]). It is important, at this juncture, to reiterate the fact that before these tests can even begin to be considered, there must be evidence of a “<span class="font-italic">loan</span>” in the first place (see above at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">77 </span>The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">first</span> test, which centres on whether there is a certain degree of system and continuity in the transactions concerned, appears to be more of an analysis of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">actual</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">facts and circumstances</span> relating to the transactions themselves, and also appears to connote (subject to the caveat noted at the end of this paragraph) a situation where there is <span class="font-italic">more than one</span> (actual) transaction. However, the transactions concerned need not be entered into by the lender with several persons, and a degree of system and continuity may (depending on the precise facts and context) exist even where the loans were made to only one person (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Ng Kum </span><span class="font-italic">Peng </span>at [43]). It should also be noted that, whilst it would be unusual, this first test might possibly be satisfied (again, depending on the precise facts and context) <span class="font-italic">even where</span> there was <span class="font-italic">only one transaction </span>(see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Bhagwandas</span><span class="font-italic"> Naraindas v Brooks Exim Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 932 at [51] as well as <span class="font-italic">Ng Kum </span><span class="font-italic">Peng </span>at [43]) – although, in such a situation, it might well be the case that the transaction concerned would fall within the ambit of the <span class="font-italic">second</span> test in any event (to which our attention now turns). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>Unlike the first test, the<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> second</span> test, which centres on whether <span class="font-italic">the lender</span> is one <span class="font-italic">who is willing and ready to lend to all and sundry</span><span class="font-italic"> provided they are, from his point of view, eligible</span>, appears to contemplate <span class="font-italic">not only</span> a situation where there is a certain degree of system and continuity in the transactions concerned, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but also</span> (and perhaps more importantly) a situation where <span class="font-italic">the precise facts and context suggest that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">although</span><span class="font-italic"> there is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only one isolated</span><span class="font-italic"> transaction, that particular transaction gives rise to the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">inference</span> <span class="font-italic">that </span><span class="font-italic">it is really </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a manifestation of an underlying “business” of moneylending</span><span class="font-italic"> inasmuch as the lender would be willing to lend to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all and sundry</span><span class="font-italic"> provided they meet his criteria of eligibility</span>. In this regard, we pause to observe that where the facts and context of a particular case demonstrate that there is a certain degree of system and continuity in the transactions concerned (and where the lender has, in fact, hitherto lent to all who have met his criteria of eligibility), the second test may, in a sense, be redundant inasmuch as that case could be said to fall within the ambit of the <span class="font-italic">first</span> test to begin with (<span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the “two-step test” advocated by Lai Siu Chiu J in <span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Thong </span>(at [21]), under which the first step (relating to the issue of whether there is a certain degree of system and continuity in the transactions concerned) is viewed as “a crucial, <span class="font-italic">initial</span> consideration” [emphasis added]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>In so far as the second test is concerned, the following observations by Kan Ting Chiu J in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Pankaj</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Dhirajlal v Donald McArthy Trading Pte Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 79 (“<span class="font-italic">Pankaj</span>”) (affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Donald </span><span class="font-italic">McArthy Trading</span>) might be usefully noted (at [31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While one can readily understand that someone who is prepared to lend to everyone is in the business of moneylending, one may ask whether that is a requisite element of the business of moneylending.

They also remind us of the <span class="font-italic">complementarity</span> between the first test and the second test. For example, in the hypothetical situation referred to by Kan J in the above quotation, it might be argued that the situation in question does not fall within the ambit of the second test, but falls within the ambit of the first test instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>The above two tests can be traced to the oft-cited English decisions of <span class="font-italic">Newton v </span><span class="font-italic">Pyke</span> (1908) 25 TLR 127<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Litchfield v Dreyfus</span> [1906] 1 KB 584, respectively (with regard to the first test and the second test, respectively). These two English decisions have been cited in numerous Singapore cases (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Subramaniam </span><span class="font-italic">Dhanapakiam </span>at [7] and [8], which paragraphs correspond to the second test and the first test, respectively). It should further be noted that these two tests can be utilised <span class="font-italic">not only</span> (as just stated) to establish that the lender is engaged in the “business” of moneylending, <span class="font-italic">but also</span> to <span class="font-italic">rebut the presumption</span> under s 3 that the lender is engaged in such a “business” – although in so far as the <span class="font-italic">latter</span> is concerned, it is obvious that the evidence adduced must (in contrast to the former) point in the <span class="font-italic">opposite</span> direction (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Pankaj</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]–[30]).

In this regard, we draw attention to another transaction that was raised in the course of the proceedings. Ho admitted to having entered into an option to purchase a flat at Chai Chee owned by one Chua and his wife (“the Chai Chee transaction”). The purchase price was fixed at $647,000 and the agreed option fee was $90,000. According to Ho, Chua required a high option fee as he owed money to loan sharks and required funds for his business. The sale did not go through because Ho later realised that the flat in question was a HDB flat and he was not eligible to buy such a flat. It appears that the Chai Chee transaction took place within the same month as the Transaction in the present case – the Option and the POA in respect of the Property were executed on 3 August 2012, whereas Ho’s intention to withdraw his purchase of the property in the Chai Chee transaction was evidenced in a letter dated 30 August 2012. Notably, the Respondent was also involved in the Chai Chee transaction as the vendors’ solicitor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>We find it extremely difficult to believe that Ho was simply a good Samaritan who was willing to assist in resolving the financial problems of others by offering them a high option fee for the purchase of their property. We are compelled to conclude, instead, that his practice is entirely consistent with that of a moneylender, and that there was system and continuity in the manner in which he/Invest-Ho entered into loan transactions. In addition, we find that the conduct of Ho/Invest-Ho evinced a willingness to lend to all and sundry who were, from their point of view, eligible. It is especially significant that Ho and the Vendors did not know each other beforehand. As noted at [5] above, they were introduced to each other by Rajan for the purpose of entering into what we have found earlier to be a loan transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>As the Transaction in the present case was a loan and Ho/Invest-Ho has not rebutted the presumption that it was made in the course of a moneylending business, we now turn to the question of whether the Respondent knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the Transaction involved unlicensed moneylending.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(2) Whether the Respondent knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the Transaction involved unlicensed moneylending</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>It is clear, in our view, that the Respondent knew or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">at least</span> had reasonable grounds to believe that the Transaction involved unlicensed moneylending. We make two brief observations before embarking on our analysis. First, not all of the facts that this court has considered above (in ascertaining whether the Transaction involved unlicensed moneylending) will be relevant for the purposes of assessing the Respondent’s state of knowledge at the time she accepted instructions to act for both the Vendors and Ho/Invest-Ho since it is undisputed that some of those facts were not brought to her attention at that time. Secondly, the proscription contained in r 22 of the LPPCR is against the provision of advice that will enable the client to “<span class="font-italic">advance</span> an illegal purpose” [emphasis added]; it does not require the illegal purpose to be completed before the solicitor is found to be in breach. In the present case, the Disciplinary Tribunal found that the Respondent had been “blissfully oblivious” to the “suspicious nature” of the Transaction (in so far as it purported to be a sale and purchase transaction), and the question here is whether the Disciplinary Tribunal erred in so finding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>The doctrine of wilful blindness is part of the legal landscape in many areas of law and the relevant principles are well established in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1, the Singapore Court of Appeal held that wilful blindness was the legal equivalent of actual knowledge (at [104]), and that in order to establish wilful blindness, there had to be the appropriate level of suspicion, which level of suspicion “<span class="font-italic">must then lead</span><span class="font-italic"> to a refusal to investigate further</span>, thus resulting in ‘blind eye knowledge’” [emphasis in original] (at [125]). The requisite level of suspicion would be established if the court is satisfied that the person in question refused to make further inquiries because he or she was virtually certain that if further inquiries were made, his or her suspicions would be confirmed (at [126]). We note also that in the absence of proof of knowledge, proof of a lower degree of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> – namely, that of “reasonable grounds to believe” – would suffice to establish a charge under r 22 of the LPPCR. In the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ow</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Beng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 536, it was held that having “reason to believe” involved a lower degree of conviction than certainty, but a higher one than speculation. In applying this test, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, including his knowledge and experience), but must reason from that position (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>infer from the facts known to that particular individual) like an objective reasonable person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>As a matter of context, it appears that the practice of moneylending on the security of the borrower’s property is not new or uncommon.

In that case, the respondent solicitor was found to have, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, facilitated an illegal moneylending transaction by preparing, for that purpose, a power of attorney and a sale and purchase agreement knowing that those documents constituted the security for the illegal moneylending transaction. The Disciplinary Committee found that the respondent, who had six years’ of experience in civil work and conveyancing, was experienced enough to appreciate that the transaction was highly unusual. First, despite the fact that completion was not to take place for six months, a “big up-front” of $150,000 (almost 25% of the purchase price of $610,000) was to be paid to the vendor in circumstances of the utmost urgency, without even passing through the hands of a stakeholder (at [120]). Notably, the respondent asked no questions about the need for urgency. Further, no instructions were recorded, no attendance notes were kept and no written advice was rendered to the client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>Secondly, there was expert opinion in <span class="font-italic">Joseph </span><span class="font-italic">Yoong</span> that both the sale and purchase agreement and the power of attorney contained some highly unusual features. The agreement provided for a deposit of $150,000, which was “well in excess of the usual 10% of the purchase price, the more unusual since it was forfeitable upon default by the purchaser” (at [118]). There was also a stipulation for the deposit to be paid directly to the vendor, instead of to his solicitor as the stakeholder. The power of attorney was stated to be irrevocable, and the expert witness testified that he had not come across more than a handful of such powers of attorney in the course of a conveyancing career spanning some 35 years. In addition, there was extraordinary provision in the power of attorney depriving the vendor of his rights over the property. It was also unusual for the purchaser’s solicitor to prepare a power of attorney which the vendor was to grant. Finally, there was an odd request by the respondent’s firm for the return of the cheque representing the $150,000 deposit. In the Disciplinary Committee’s view, this indicated that “[the cheque] could not have been presented … without any corresponding record that the deposit had been paid by some other means” (at [119]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>Returning to the present case, the Complainant asserted that she had in fact informed the Respondent at their meeting on 3 August 2012 that she and her husband “had no choice but to take the loan from [Ho]”. We note that, as pointed out by the Respondent, the Complainant’s husband admitted under cross-examination that nothing like that was communicated to the Respondent. However, even leaving aside this assertion by the Complainant (which did not appear to be substantiated by any evidence), we find that there were sufficient facts to show that the Respondent was wilfully blind to the fact that her advice was being sought to advance a transaction which involved unlicensed moneylending.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>We have stated earlier that several aspects of the Transaction were highly unusual. <span class="font-italic">First</span>, even if the market value of the Property (which the Respondent denies knowledge of) is put to one side, the Respondent must have appreciated the extraordinary nature of the payment structure – the option fee amounted to 38.4% of the purchase price and the bulk of the purchase price was to be paid upon the exercise of the Option, leaving only a nominal sum of $1,000 to be paid at the time of completion. <span class="font-italic">Second</span><span class="font-italic">ly</span>, at the risk of repetition, we must once again emphasise the extraordinarily (and also unnecessarily) broad scope of the POA, which, in our view, gave the game away. Ho had, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, the power to dispose of the Property for such consideration as he thought fit (cll 1.1 and 1.4), and to apply any monies which he received in his capacity as the Vendors’ attorney or which were otherwise due to the Vendors for his own use and benefit (cl 1.21). Ho, in his capacity as the Vendors’ attorney, also had the power to lease the Property at such rents and upon such terms as he deemed fit. The Vendors had effectively, by way of the POA, which was stated to be “<span class="font-italic">irrevocable</span> until the Property is sold and all monies paid to [Ho]” [emphasis added], ceded control over almost every aspect of their rights in the Property. In the face of such exceptional terms, even the Respondent had to concede under questioning that the Transaction was unusual and “seemed strange”. She also admitted that this was the first time she had encountered a sale and purchase transaction which involved such a power of attorney. We find it especially telling that the Respondent had no qualms about facilitating the Transaction without probing deeper or properly documenting every stage of the Transaction (including her advice to the parties), notwithstanding her own view that the Transaction “seemed strange” and that she was treading on dangerous ground by concurrently representing the parties on both sides of the Transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>It is crucial to note that, as mentioned earlier at [87] above, the test of whether the Respondent was wilfully blind is not wholly subjective. In ascertaining whether the Respondent had reasonable grounds to believe that her advice was not only being sought but was also being sought to advance an unlicensed moneylending transaction, the court must assume her position (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, including her knowledge and experience), but must reason from that position (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>infer from the facts known to her) like an objective reasonable person. In our view, a reasonably circumspect and observant practitioner imbued with the Respondent’s 30-over years of experience in conveyancing practice would have had reasonable grounds to believe that the sale and purchase which the Transaction purported to effect was in fact a cover for an unlicensed moneylending transaction. It bears reiterating that such schemes to disguise unlicensed moneylending transactions are not novel. Apart from moneylending, there could, in our view, be no other explanation operating in the Respondent’s mind as to why the parties were entering into such an unusual transaction. In these circumstances, the Respondent’s plea of ignorance is truly alarming and strains belief. Further, as a senior member of the profession, the Respondent must be presumed to know that persons who extend loans in consideration of a larger sum being repaid are presumed to be “moneylenders” for the purposes of the MLA. The Respondent could very well have been blindsided by her long-standing professional relationship/friendship with Ho, but that, in our view, does not mitigate or excuse her misconduct. Looking at the matter in the round, we are satisfied that the facts of the present case have crossed the threshold required to prove wilful blindness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>For completeness, since the Chai Chee transaction came after the Transaction between Ho/Invest-Ho and the Vendors, the Respondent’s knowledge of and assistance in the Chai Chee transaction cannot count towards her knowledge of the illegal nature of the Transaction between Ho/Invest-Ho and the Vendors. Nevertheless, we view with profound disquiet her subsequent involvement in another highly suspicious transaction in rather similar circumstances. We cannot stress enough the importance of the need for legal practitioners to exercise vigilance and to guard against the prospect of themselves being used (whether unwittingly or knowingly) as facilitators and enablers of illicit transactions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fourth charge: Whether the Respondent failed to report a transaction which she knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect involved unlicensed moneylending </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span>Turning now to the fourth charge, the basis of this charge is r 11G of the LPPCR, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Suspicious transaction reporting</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">11G.</span> Where an advocate and solicitor or a law practice knows or has <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">reasonable grounds to suspect</span> any matter referred to in section 39(1) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap. 65A), the advocate and solicitor or the law practice shall disclose the matter to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office of the Commercial Affairs Department by way of a suspicious transaction report; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) an authorised officer under that Act,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">in accordance with section 39 of that Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">96 </span>It appears that r 11G of the LPPCR was drafted to mirror the obligation imposed by s 39(1) of the CDSA, which provides thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duty to disclose knowledge or suspicion</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">39.</span>—(1) Where a person knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that any property —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents the proceeds of;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was used in connection with; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is intended to be used in connection with,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">any act which may constitute drug dealing or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">criminal conduct</span>, as the case may be, and the information or matter on which the knowledge or suspicion is based came to his attention in the course of his trade, profession, business or employment, he shall disclose the knowledge or suspicion or the information or other matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based to a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer as soon as is reasonably practicable after it comes to his attention.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 2 of the CDSA defines “criminal conduct” as the “doing or being concerned in, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, any act constituting a <span class="font-italic">serious offence</span> or a foreign <span class="font-italic">serious offence</span>” [emphasis added]. Unlicensed moneylending in contravention of the MLA is listed as a “serious offence” in the second schedule of the CDSA. In short, r 11G of the LPPCR, read together with the relevant provisions of the CDSA, imposes on an advocate and solicitor the obligation to report a transaction if he or she has reasonable grounds to suspect that it involves unlicensed moneylending.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>It is quite clear that the crux of the fourth charge is essentially similar to that of the third charge. However, a significant difference is that the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement of “reasonable grounds to suspect” (in r 11G) engages a lower threshold as compared to that of “reasonable grounds to believe” (in r 22), since belief is obviously stronger than suspicion. Given our finding (in relation to the third charge) that the Respondent knew or at least had reasonable grounds to believe that the parties were entering into a transaction which involved unlicensed moneylending, it stands to reason that the fourth charge, which involves a lower degree of knowledge, has also been established.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Vendors’ credibility and lack of probity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>We note that the Respondent has sought to undermine the Vendors’ credibility by highlighting the inconsistencies in their evidence as well as what she says to be a false police report by the Complainant. The Law Society admits that the Vendors’ evidence is neither perfect nor free from inconsistencies, but submits that the inconsistencies are not fatal to establishing the charges brought against the Respondent. It suffices for us to state that we do not think it necessary to delve into the issue of the Vendors’ credibility and lack of probity given that many, if not all, of our findings are premised on objective facts (such as the terms of the Option and the POA) as well as admissions made by the Respondent in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>For the foregoing reasons, we are satisfied that due cause for disciplinary action against the Respondent has been shown inasmuch as all the charges preferred against her have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. We note that the charges against the Respondent have been brought under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA and, in the alternative, s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the same.
