Manoj is TWG Tea’s former director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The Domain Name was registered by Manoj in his name, but TWG Tea claimed that he holds it on trust for the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In turn, Manoj counterclaimed that he is the owner of the Domain Name and that TWG Tea is liable to compensate him for its use. Manoj also counterclaimed against Mr Taha Bou Qdib (“Taha”) and his wife Ms Maranda Barnes Bou Qdib (“Maranda”). Taha is TWG Tea’s CEO and President, while Maranda is the Director of Corporate Communications and Business Development. Manoj alleged that TWG Tea, Taha and Maranda (“the counterclaim defendants”) had published false statements concerning Manoj’s role as the founder of TWG Tea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the close of TWG Tea’s case, Manoj made a submission of no case to answer. I rejected Manoj’s submission.

I will refer to the formation of TWG Tea (via the renaming of Sunbreeze) as its “incorporation”. Sunbreeze was effectively owned by Manoj, who had a 99.999% shareholding. TWG Tea had its genesis as the Tea Division of The Wellness Group Pte Ltd (“Wellness”). Wellness was incorporated in 2003 with Manoj and his wife as its shareholders and directors. Manoj was also Wellness’ Chairman and CEO. In 2003, Wellness had two main businesses, which were its Tea and Spa Divisions.

In August 2008, a further allotment of shares was given to Wellness, Taha, Maranda, Rith, and Philippe.

Maranda initially commenced employment as a director of Wellness’ Tea Division from 25 July 2007. Her employment was transferred to TWG Tea on 1 April 2008, and she was a director of TWG Tea from 18 August 2008 to 25 March 2009.

His employment was transferred to TWG Tea from 1 April 2008 and he is currently its Chief Operations Officer.  Rith is not a party in this suit but gave evidence for the counterclaim defendants.

The 15% shareholding was meant to reflect their contributions as partners and co-founders of TWG Tea’s business. Prior to their arrival, Wellness had no such tea division to speak of.

Manoj had also used TWG Tea’s corporate credit card to renew the Domain Name and other domain names in 2011. In fact, in the course of negotiations with Vision Straight General Trading LLC (“Vision Straight”) for it to acquire shares in TWG Tea, Manoj had signed a document dated 25 February 2010 declaring that the Domain Name would always remain the property of TWG Tea (“the Declaration Letter”).

In a letter on 23 August 2016, TWG Tea’s solicitors demanded that Manoj transfer the Domain Name to TWG Tea. TWG claimed that as Manoj has failed to do so, he has acted in breach of trust and/or in breach of his duties as a trustee to return the trust property to TWG Tea. Alternatively, Manoj holds the Domain Name on constructive trust for TWG Tea. Further, Manoj was estopped from denying that the Domain Name at all material times belonged to TWG Tea.

</div> Taha first met Manoj around November 2003 or 2004, and it was undisputed that they kept in touch to discuss Wellness’ tea venture in Singapore. Taha accepted that at that time, Wellness’ Tea Division had tea businesses it was already developing, such as “Art of Tea” and “Numi”, but he claimed that they were not “luxury” teas, the latter being a market that TWG Tea targeted. Taha was then employed at Mariage Frères and eventually left in April 2007.

The evidence supports Taha’s assertion that it was to be a partnership between Taha and Manoj and/or Wellness to incorporate the Tea and Spice Company (“T&amp;S Co”). A handwritten note by Manoj in around March 2006 and his email to Taha and Maranda showed that they would build T&amp;S Co “together”.

Equally, Taha’s assertions that Wellness had no tea division to speak of, or whether it had previously invested in “luxury” teas, were unhelpful. In any event, even some of TWG Tea’s teas were launched in August 2007 before TWG Tea’s incorporation.

Although T&amp;S Co did not materialise, in about February 2007, Manoj again discussed with Taha and Maranda for them to join Wellness. Pertinently, Manoj informed them (in his email of 21 February 2007) that “as before” they would be given a percentage of the business and that they would be making their own decisions as “owner in the business”. <span class="font-italic">This business was what Ms Koh (Manoj’s counsel)</span><span class="font-italic"> herself referred to as TWG Tea </span>in which Taha and Maranda received shares in 2008.

As it transpired, Taha and Maranda (and Rith) never received shares in Wellness, but obtained shares of roughly the same amount in TWG Tea, which Ms Koh herself related back to their respective employment contracts with Wellness. Even if Taha and Maranda only received TWG Tea shares in June 2008, Clause 4(b) made plain that it was envisaged all along <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the forming of the new entity for Wellness’ Tea Division (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, TWG Tea) that Taha and Maranda would own a stake in the new entity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I also reject Manoj’s assertion that the shares were given to “motivate” Taha and Maranda. Plainly they were given to adhere to the terms of employment. That a second allotment of shares on August 2008 was given was, according to Manoj’s pleadings, because “Taha requested…to allot additional shares to him, Maranda, Rith and Philippe so that their interest in [TWG Tea] would not be diluted.” The terms of Clause 4(b) supported Taha’s evidence that there was an intention to hold their shareholdings in proportion.

</div>
</div> Hence, from early 2009, Manoj had recognised Taha as a co-founder, at least in form, even if he asserts that Taha was not a co-founder in fact when TWG Tea was incorporated. Either way, Manoj cannot claim that Taha should not be described as a founder or co-founder in the publications which are the subject of Manoj’s counterclaim, and all of which occurred after Taha was conferred the “co-founder” title. The more relevant question is whether there was malicious falsehood in <span class="font-italic">excluding</span> Manoj as a co-founder in the publications or implying that he was not one at all. I will revert to this when I deal with Manoj’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I turn then to deal with some matters which may suggest that Taha and Maranda were not co-founders of TWG Tea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 First, on 24 August 2008, Maranda sent Manoj a draft public relations article on TWG Tea, wherein she described Manoj, Taha and herself as co-founders.

</div> Manoj informed her to remove this title for all of them, so as to make Rith and Philippe “feel included”. Manoj did not object to Taha and Maranda being described as co-founders, but merely gave some other reason for excluding the title from <span class="font-italic">all three</span> of them. Hence, that the title co-founder was removed in that article at Manoj’s request was at best neutral. Likewise, that in June 2009 Manoj asked Maranda to remove the description of “co-founder” from the titles of Manoj and Taha appearing in a captioned photograph for a TWG Tea press release was again at best neutral.

</div> There was little reason for TWG Tea’s staff to be checking and dealing with this unless the prior understanding was that the Domain Name belonged to TWG Tea.  It was also quite plain that Manoj referred to it as “our” Domain Name and not “his” Domain Name. Given the context of the email, “our” would have meant TWG Tea, since there would have been no reason to account to TWG Tea’s staff and update them on whether Manoj had renewed <span class="font-italic">his</span> Domain Name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Manoj also registered www.tahatea.com in April 2008 and informed Taha and Maranda that it was “registered for <span class="font-italic">us</span> as it was still open” [<span class="font-italic">emphasis added</span>].

</div> In my view, this showed that Manoj was in the habit of registering domain names which he perceived to benefit TWG Tea. No doubt the emails concerning the renewal of the Domain Name and the registration of www.tahatea.com occurred after the alleged agreement in August 2007, but I find it cogent evidence to support that the parties treated the Domain Name as belonging to TWG Tea all along even if registered in Manoj’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Second, the Declaration Letter of 25 February 2010 signed by Manoj was probative.

I accept Taha’s explanation that he did not ask Manoj to transfer the Domain Name to TWG Tea when he signed the Declaration Letter because Manoj was at that time the CEO, the Chairman and a director of TWG Tea. Further, he trusted Manoj that with the Declaration Letter he would eventually transfer the Domain Name to TWG Tea.

</div> Next, Ms Koh raised the issue that when a draft Sale and Purchase (“S&amp;P”) Agreement dated June 2012 was prepared for the purposes of OSIM acquiring shares in TWG Tea, a term therein was that Manoj would transfer all his rights and title of the Domain Name to TWG Tea. This term would have been unnecessary if the Declaration Letter remained effective.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, the Declaration Letter served a different purpose and vis-à-vis Vision Straight. The term in the S&amp;P Agreement was to impose an obligation on TWG Tea vis-à-vis OSIM, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that an actual transfer of the Domain Name to TWG Tea had to be effected in order for the sale and purchase of the shares by OSIM to be concluded or completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Third, I accept Taha’s evidence that TWG Tea had invested significant time and resources into building the website at the Domain Name, anchoring all of TWG Tea’s day-to-day email activity, online presence, services and application and an online store. This was even during Manoj’s tenure as TWG Tea’s Chairman and CEO.

</div>
</div> TWG Tea had used the website only for its purposes and there was no evidence that it was used for Manoj’s personal purpose. If the Domain Name belonged to Manoj throughout, it is puzzling that he had never claimed against TWG Tea for using it, not even when he resigned from all his positions in TWG Tea in 2012. This further supported Taha’s claim that Manoj had agreed to the Domain Name and treated it as belonging to TWG Tea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Fourth, although the evidence on the payment for the renewal of the Domain Name was not conclusive, there was evidence that some of the payments were more likely than not made using TWG Tea’s money and thus further supported that Manoj had treated the Domain Name as belonging to TWG Tea. It is not disputed that TWG Tea’s corporate credit card issued to Manoj was used by him to renew the Domain Name on 28 October 2011 for the period from 3 August 2012 to 3 August 2013.

</div> Given that Manoj had emailed TWG Tea’s staff on this transaction stating that he had renewed “our” domain name (see [43] above), it is more likely than not that Manoj had used TWG Tea’s corporate credit card for this purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for the next renewal for the period from 3 August 2013 to 3 August 2015, it is disputed as to whether Manoj had paid for them personally.  No doubt, when Manoj further renewed the Domain Name for the period from 3 August 2015 to 3 August 2017, he had already left TWG Tea and Taha accepts that TWG Tea would thus not have paid for these renewals.

</div> However, this did not detract from my finding that an express trust had already been created, based on the supporting evidence mentioned above. Subsequently, Manoj attempted to make payments on 15 November 2017 (for renewal of the Domain Name from 3 August 2017 onwards) but these were rejected by TWG Tea. As these were subsequent to TWG Tea’s solicitor’s letters to Manoj on the ownership of the Domain Name,

To the contrary, there was at least one occasion where he had paid for the renewal of the Domain Name with TWG Tea’s corporate credit card (see [49] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It would seem that Manoj’s main objection to there being an express trust created related to the fact that as of 3 August 2007, Manoj “was the owner of Sunbreeze and [Wellness]…and TWG Tea had not yet come into existence”.

</div> Although the specific legal import of the objection was unclear, it would seem that certainty of object for the creation of a trust was not present. I do not agree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I find that the trust was established during the 3 August 2007 meeting, when Manoj, Taha and Maranda agreed to set up a new entity named TWG Tea for Wellness’ tea business and for the domain name associated with the same name to belong to it. The agreement and intention among them was that when such a domain name was registered, it would vest in TWG Tea when the company was incorporated and for its sole use and purpose. Indeed, TWG Tea was incorporated shortly after in October 2007, and based on the earlier evidence (see [42]–[49] above) Manoj had treated the Domain Name as belonging to TWG Tea. Taha’s evidence was that they <span class="font-italic">first</span> discussed the creation and naming of TWG Tea <span class="font-italic">before</span> Manoj went to his office and registered the Domain Name. As Maranda stated, they would not have registered the new entity as “TWG Tea” without first obtaining the domain name with the same name, as they would not name a company after an existing domain name which belonged to someone else.

</div> It is not disputed that a trust can be declared for a beneficiary which is a company: see <span class="font-italic">Goi Wang Firn (Ni Wanfen) and others v Chee Kow Ngee Sing (Pte) Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 1049 at [27].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The beneficiary was thus certain and identifiable, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, TWG Tea, and which subsequently came into being. That TWG Tea was embryonic at the creation of the trust was not, in my view, a bar to the formation of a trust. By analogy, it has been held that a trust can be created for an unborn entity, such as for an infant in the mother’s womb: see <span class="font-italic">Blackburn v Stables</span> (1814) 35 ER 358. A trust for descendants, even those born subsequently, is valid even if their names cannot be listed when the trust is created: see Graham Virgo, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equity &amp; Trusts</span> (2nd Ed, 2016) (“Virgo, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equity &amp; Trusts</span>”), at pp 102–103. In the present case, once TWG Tea was incorporated it would take of the interest and it was completely ascertainable as the trust’s beneficiary. The trust also did not offend the perpetuity rule. TWG Tea was incorporated shortly after the trust was created and the interest in the Domain Name would then vest in TWG Tea.  In any event, when the Domain Name was registered in Manoj’s name, Manoj, Taha and Maranda were in Wellness’ employ. It could thus also be said that it was intended that Wellness would be the initial beneficiary with such interest to pass on to TWG Tea when it was formed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Even if no express trust could be or was created in August 2007, such a trust would have been created by April 2008 when Manoj represented to Taha that he was holding the Domain Name on trust for TWG Tea, or by July 2009 when Manoj declared that he was renewing “our” Domain Name, or by 25 February 2010 when Manoj informed Ghassan and Taha that he was holding the Domain Name on trust for TWG Tea and by his statement made in the Declaration Letter of the same. By this time TWG Tea had been incorporated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Ultimately, the settlor’s intention in the creation of the trust is what matters. By his actions, Manoj had consistently and clearly intended to and did treat the Domain Name as belonging to TWG Tea. It was clear even from the 3 August 2007 meeting that Manoj never intended to take the beneficial interest in the Domain Name for himself, whether before, on or after TWG Tea was incorporated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Before concluding this section, I deal with two other issues raised by Ms Koh during cross-examination of TWG Tea’s witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, Ms Koh suggested that TWG Tea had never asked Manoj to transfer the Domain Name to it until 23 August 2016 because the Domain Name never belonged to it.

Moreover, up until September 2012, Manoj was still the CEO, Chairman and a director of TWG Tea, and even after he relinquished his positions in TWG Tea, he remains a substantial shareholder through his holding in Wellness. Further, if Manoj’s case were true and the parties had regarded the Domain Name belonged to Manoj, I would have expected that given its substantial online presence on the TWG Tea’s website with that Domain Name, TWG Tea would have taken early action to shift its online presence to another domain name of its own, the moment Manoj left in 2012. That TWG Tea did not do so showed that it had been operating under the agreement in August 2007 and subsequent assurances from Manoj that the Domain Name belonged to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Second, Ms Koh had suggested that TWG Tea’s pleaded case did not make sense, in that Manoj had registered the Domain Name on 3 August 2007 after the discussion among Taha, Maranda and Manoj to name the brand “TWG Tea” and they then agreed to name the company TWG Tea only in October 2007.

</div> TWG’s pleaded case is that the tea <span class="font-italic">business</span> and <span class="font-italic">brand</span> TWG Tea were conceptualised in August 2007, but it was only in October 2007 that Wellness’ tea business moved to TWG Tea when the <span class="font-italic">entity</span> TWG Tea was incorporated.

</div>
</div> I did not find the chronology of events illogical. The parties had agreed to name the <span class="font-italic">tea business and brand</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>“TWG Tea” in August 2007, Manoj then registered a domain name with the same name, and they incorporated the company (with the agreed name) in October 2007.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In light of my finding that there is an express trust of the Domain Name, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether a constructive trust should be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proprietary estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 TWG Tea also pleaded that Manoj is estopped from denying that the Domain Name belongs to it. To successfully found an estoppel, there must be a representation on the part of the respondent (against whom the estoppel is sought to be raised), and reliance and detriment on the part of the claimant seeking to raise it. The question is whether the respondent said or did something that led the claimant to take a certain course of action in circumstances that renders it unconscionable for the respondent to go back on the assurance or representation: see <span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaith</span><span class="font-italic">ilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [56] citing <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292. Even if there was no trust of the Domain Name for TWG Tea, I would have found a proprietary estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I had earlier found that Manoj (and Taha and Maranda) had agreed that any domain name associated with “TWG Tea” would belong to the entity TWG Tea which would be set up. Manoj had also made representations to TWG Tea, and even whilst he was its Chairman, CEO or director, that the Domain Name belonged to TWG Tea and he was holding it on trust for TWG Tea (see [43]–[46] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 TWG Tea had clearly relied on these representations and expended time and money in building up the company’s brand name under, and with the use of, this Domain Name. TWG Tea was incorporated after Manoj had informed Taha and Maranda that he had successfully registered the Domain Name and after, as Maranda explained, they had first obtained the domain name bearing the same name. TWG Tea had conducted its business using the brand name “TWG Tea” for more than 10 years, investing considerable time and resources into building and maintaining its website under this Domain Name, using it as its marketing and publicity tool and anchoring its day-to-day email activity, online presence, services and applications on it. All these were done whilst Manoj was its Chairman, CEO and director and would have been done with his knowledge and consent, as he would have had the final say on the contents and use of the Domain Name and website. All throughout, Manoj did not demand that TWG Tea cease and desist from using the Domain Name and assert that it belonged to him. It is clear that TWG Tea had relied on Manoj’s representations to its detriment and it would be unconscionable to allow Manoj to now resile from his representations and enforce his rights to the Domain Name.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether TWG Tea’s claim is time barred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Manoj pleaded that TWG Tea’s claim is time barred and relied on ss 6(7) and 22(2) of the Limitation Act. As Taha had express knowledge since April 2008 that Manoj had registered the Domain Name in his own name, the action had commenced well over six years since the right of action accrued.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I find no merit in this defence. I found Manoj to be a trustee of the Domain Name for TWG Tea. Section 22(2) of the Limitation Act was subject to s 22(1). Given that Manoj retains the legal ownership of the Domain Name, the exception under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies, such that no period of limitation to the claim to recover the trust property from Manoj would apply. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Laches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Manoj further pleaded that TWG Tea had failed to bring this action within a reasonable time despite having knowledge of the matters claimed and acquiesced in the matter complained off. TWG Tea had caused Manoj to believe, and Manoj did in fact believe, that it did not intend to claim against him, such that he had acted to his prejudice. As such TWG Tea was estopped or barred by laches.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The doctrine of laches was summarised in <span class="font-italic">Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 769 at [46] (cited with approval by the Court of Appeal, eg, in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 at [44]), as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Laches is a doctrine of equity. It is properly invoked where essentially there has been a substantial lapse of time coupled with circumstances where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver thereof; or, where by his conduct and neglect he had, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him, if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted … This is a broad-based inquiry and it would be relevant to consider the length of delay before the claim was brought, the nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant, as well as any element of unconscionability in allowing the claim to be enforced …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Manoj has not been able to show me why laches should apply. There is no basis for Manoj to claim that TWG Tea had caused him to believe that it did not intend to make a claim against him. On the contrary, Manoj had maintained and assured TWG Tea and Taha that the Domain Name belonged to it and that he would transfer the Domain Name to it on its demand. As Taha explained, he had no reason to doubt Manoj at the material time as they had a good working relationship; Manoj was also up until September 2012 TWG Tea’s Chairman, CEO and director, and would have been obliged to act in its best interests. Even when Manoj left TWG Tea, Taha had no reason to believe that he would injure TWG Tea as Manoj continued to have a stake (as shareholder through Wellness) in the business. Further, when TWG Tea first sent its demand letter in August 2016 (see [17] above) and Manoj refused to transfer the Domain Name, TWG Tea had commenced this suit shortly after in 2017. Pertinently, Manoj failed to show what prejudice he has suffered such that it would be unconscionable for TWG Tea to now maintain its claim. To the contrary, as he has a stake in TWG Tea, Manoj would have benefitted from TWG Tea’s continuing use of the Domain Name. I did not find any undue delay on TWG Tea’s part, or an undue delay without any proper justification, in taking earlier steps to assert its claim on the Domain Name.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on TWG Tea’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In conclusion, I find that Manoj was holding the Domain Name on trust for TWG Tea, alternatively Manoj is estopped from denying that the Domain Name belonged to it. I also find that Manoj could not avail of the defences of limitation and laches. Consequently, Manoj’s counterclaim against TWG Tea for unjust enrichment must fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Manoj’s submission of no case to answer</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As I had found TWG Tea’s case had succeeded on the facts (and on a balance of probabilities), it is thus amply clear that there was at <span class="font-italic">minimum</span> a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case to answer. Manoj’s submission of no case to answer cannot succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Mr Yeo (counterclaim defendants’ counsel) argued that as I had dismissed Ms Koh’s submission of no case to answer, and had found a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, I should therefore enter judgment for TWG Tea without any further consideration of Manoj’s closing submissions.

</div>
</div> However, while TWG Tea succeeded in proving its claim on the balance of probabilities, and this necessarily meant that it succeeded in proving a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, the converse is not true. The mere fact that a defendant’s no case to answer submission is dismissed does not lead to the <span class="font-italic">automatic</span> result that judgment is entered for the claimant. In order to overcome the submission of no case to answer, all that the claimant needs to show is that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case. The court is still entitled to look at the totality of circumstances, the pleadings and the evidence to determine whether the claimant has truly succeeded on the <span class="font-italic">claim</span> <span class="font-italic">on a</span><span class="font-italic"> balance of probabilities</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Hence, a no case to answer submission may be dismissed and yet the claimant may not succeed in the claim. As the court held in <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004 (“<span class="font-italic">Peter Lim</span>”) where the plaintiff sued the defendants for alleged defamatory comments, and in which the court found the defendants had shown a defence of qualified privilege, a “position of “no case to answer” does not diminish the usual burden remaining on the plaintiff to establish there was malice on a balance of probability on the totality of the evidence” (at [210]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Next, I deal with the effect of the no case to answer submission on Manoj’s counterclaim.

The defendant broadcasting corporation (“BBC”) had applied to strike out Mr Schellenberg’s libel proceedings on the grounds that it was an abuse of process or it was frivolous and vexatious and had no real prospect of success. Mr Schellenberg had previously brought a libel action against the publishers of <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Guardian</span> concerning his stewardship of an island (“the Guardian action”) but had settled that action. In <span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span>, he brought libel proceedings against the BBC on a specific defamatory allegation made by a BBC journalist that Mr Schellenberg’s use of his powers to evict a family from the island portrayed him as being tyrannical. The claim in <span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span> was struck off, although there had been no determination of the Guardian action, and despite that these were two different publications and the BBC publication took place after the Guardian action.

The absence or existence of these factors is not decisive and the court remains guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court, and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive. (See <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”) at [53] and <span class="font-italic">Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 760 (“<span class="font-italic">Andy Lim</span>”) at [38] and [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I did not find Manoj’s counterclaim on malicious falsehood to be an abuse of process, and it would be unjust to preclude Manoj from bringing his counterclaim. Manoj’s claim in Suit 187 was for conspiracy to injure, essentially that OSIM, Taha and Ron Sim had sought to remove him as CEO of TWG Tea. Manoj’s counterclaim in the present suit is for malicious falsehood as to whether his role as founder has been misrepresented. In any event, Maranda was not even a party to Suit 187. For completeness, I should also state that Manoj’s claim in Suit 545 for defamation was against parties completely different from the present suit, and on a different matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Moreover, the Statements were published well after Suit 187 was commenced in February 2014.

</div> They could not have constituted part of the earlier Suit 187, and any attempt to bring the claim on publications which did not then exist would have been premature. Mr Yeo’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span> is thus misplaced. Although the BBC publications took place after the Guardian action, the allegations in the BBC action could be said to be a subset of the Guardian publications. As the court there observed (at 319) that “[t]hose meanings are, as will be apparent from a comparison, very close to the one complained of in this action”. This was plainly not the case in the present suit. Hence I fail to see how the counterclaim defendants were being vexed twice over in respect of the same issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Finally, Mr Yeo has mis-cited the findings in <span class="font-italic">OSIM International</span>, where the court dismissed Wellness’ allegations at [178]. The claims brought in that suit were different and the court’s dismissal of the claims there would not preclude Manoj from bringing his present counterclaim. Pertinently, the court in <span class="font-italic">OSIM International</span> had not made findings on the allegations stated in Manoj’s claims in Suit 187 in the way that Mr Yeo had alleged (at [81] above). There was nothing in the court’s findings in <span class="font-italic">OSIM International</span> concerning the allegations raised by Manoj that purportedly touched on the current proceedings.

</div> The article had obscured Manoj’s role in TWG Tea’s founding altogether in favour of Taha’s role. There were phrases that implied that Taha and Maranda were the only founders, such as “[b]efore he founded TWG Tea … [Taha] decided to strike out on his own…the couple had packed up their lives and moved here and began working round the clock to start up their business.” Manoj was not mentioned at all. The only possible reference was “[w]ith $10 million in capital from their own [Taha and Maranda’s] pockets and a group of investors…” Taha claimed that he did not mention Manoj because he was not asked, but he volunteered Maranda’s name nevertheless.

</div> Thus, she and Taha had authorised TWG Tea to publish the false statement regardless of her personal views on it. As such, both Maranda and Taha would be personally liable for the publication of the false statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As to TWG Tea, Maranda’s lawyers (who also represent Taha and TWG Tea) had stated that the statements were made on TWG Tea’s behalf.  Given that Taha was its CEO and President while Maranda was its Director of Communications and they were part of the management team that decided to publish the Website Statement, their knowledge would be attributed to TWG Tea: see <span class="font-italic">The Dolphina</span> [2012] 1 SLR 992 at [205], [216], [235], [237], [239], [255] and [256]; and <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd</span>) [2014] 3 SLR 329 at [48].

The court may draw an inference of publication, for instance in the case of generally accessible web pages (see [91] above).

It’s bad press for us. It is very bad for our brand, because he disclosed that to the media”. Taha also then stated, “if you just put “Manoj Murjani TWG Tea”…the first articles will be the lawsuit”.

</div> The inference from Taha’s and Maranda’s evidence is that the Website generates significant income from online customers, and the dominant purpose of the Website is for widespread commerciality. Further, by Taha’s evidence, the “brand” includes TWG Tea’s founding story as published on the Website Statement. As such, I would infer publication to third persons of the Website Statement even in the absence of direct evidence (of the number of persons who had seen the Website Statement) and find that the Website Statement would have reached third parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Montecristo article</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The Montecristo article was titled “TWG Tea Salon &amp; Boutique Vancouver: True love’s sip”, and it stated that, “[f]ounded in 2008 in Singapore by Barnes and her husband Taha Bouqdib, TWG [Tea] is known across the globe…”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I find the statement in the Montecristo article to be false, and the sole natural and ordinary meaning of the statement was that Taha and Maranda were the only founders of TWG Tea.

The context of the sentence focused on the persons who attended the dinner or reception, who were Taha and Maranda, and was written to introduce the persons from TWG Tea who were present there.

Moreover, Maranda’s uncontroverted evidence was that her answers were not given on behalf of TWG Tea. She stated that she was speaking about her personal experiences.

</div> I accept Maranda’s evidence in this regard. In the circumstances, neither Taha nor TWG Tea could be attributed with the statements made at the CRIB summit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 As for Maranda, I find that the statements she made (read in context of the questions being asked of her) were not false. Manoj alleged that Maranda made statements to the effect that Taha and Maranda had founded TWG Tea and that he was “another partner who merely acted as an investor”.

Maranda replied that “[w]e were in Paris…and we did by chance happen upon someone … who [literally] became a friend, who later became our … angel investor.” In my view, what Maranda said in that context cannot be construed as merely showing that Manoj (who is not mentioned by name) is “merely” an investor. Second, Maranda had mentioned Manoj as a “partner” later in the interview. In fact, she went on to say that after coming to Singapore, “[i]t was the two of us plus an investor and we just started…”, that “we had a partner who was spoon-feeding us” in terms of the finances, and she conceded that the “partner” had “a level of trust” in investing in them. Taken together it could be construed that Manoj’s role was mainly to provide investment money, but I did not read the statements to therefore mean that Manoj was merely an investor and was not a founder. Third, Maranda had mentioned that “we together with this other partner, and the two of us, we started in an office the size of two of these tables … To be honest and fair to our investing partner, he came in one day and said “You know you guys gotta stop renting …”.

</div> It was plain to me that Maranda’s reference to “together” with the other partner that they “started” in an office, was a clear expression that they (including Manoj) had begun TWG Tea together.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Admittedly, Maranda did state that “yes, we did start the company. Three, four, five, six people joined us afterwards and then it became a little SME.”.

</div> It was suggested that if the “three” people who joined afterward included Manoj, this would convey the impression that it was only Taha and Maranda who started TWG Tea. However, Maranda could simply have meant that three <span class="font-italic">more</span>, and four <span class="font-italic">more</span> individuals joined afterward.

</div> Given that Maranda had already indicated that it was she, Taha, and their “other partner” who started the company, I do not think the natural and ordinary meaning read in its overall context was that Taha and Maranda were the only founders of TWG Tea. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Accordingly, I dismiss Manoj’s counterclaim in relation to the statements made at the CRIB summit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether special damage proved</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 From the foregoing, I dismiss Manoj’s counterclaims in relation to the Nomss, Niche and Vogue articles and the CRIB summit statements as I find that these were not false statements when read in their proper context. However, I found that the unambiguous meanings of the Website Statement, and the statements in the Forbes and Montecristo articles were false and that Taha, Maranda and TWG Tea had acted with malice when they caused the statements to be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Nevertheless, it was an essential element of the tort of malicious falsehood to show the element of special damage, this being an element of the tort without which the claim cannot stand and liability cannot be held to have been made out (see <span class="font-italic">Low Tuck Kwong v Sukamto Sia </span>[2014] 1 SLR 639 (“<span class="font-italic">Sukamto Sia</span>”) at [102] and [106]). In the present case, no evidence was led to show any actual damage suffered, and this was the case in relation to all the Staements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Instead, Ms Koh sought to rely on s 6(1) of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed), which states:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Slander of title, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.</span>—(1) In any action for slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage —</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if the words upon which the action is founded are <span class="font-italic">calculated to cause pecuniary damage</span> to the plaintiff and are published in writing or other permanent form; or</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if the said words are c<span class="font-italic">alculated to cause pecuniary damage</span> to the plaintiff in respect of any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of publication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-italic">Emphases added</span>.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In <span class="font-italic">Sukamto Sia</span> (at [112]–[113]) the Court of Appeal held that if s 6(1) of the Defamation Act applied, a plaintiff would not need to prove specific pecuniary loss but instead the court will infer the existence of such loss. The meaning of the words “calculated to cause pecuniary damage” means “likely to produce the result”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In order to rely on s 6(1) of the Defamation Act, Manoj had to show that the statements or words on which his action was founded were calculated to either cause pecuniary damage to him or to him in respect of his office, profession, calling, trade or business. However, there was no evidence that the Statements were calculated to cause or were likely to produce the result of such damage if any. There was also no evidence of what, much less the extent of, pecuniary damage Manoj had suffered whether to him personally or otherwise. That Taha and Maranda may have intended to put themselves at the forefront of TWG Tea’s founding by the Statements did not necessarily mean that the Statements were calculated to cause or were likely to produce the result of damage to Manoj or his office, profession, calling, trade or business. The brevity of Manoj’s Counterclaim as to damage spoke for itself – the best particulars that he had provided was simply the words found in s 6(1) of the Defamation Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In the same vein, and where s 6(1) of the Defamation Act could not apply, Manoj has not shown the element of special damage for the purposes of the claim of malicious falsehood. There was no evidence of what damage he had suffered, let alone that the damage must have been the natural or probable result of the words or statements made (see <span class="font-italic">Sukamto Sia</span> at [108]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In the circumstances, I dismiss Manoj’s counterclaim for malicious falsehood even in relation to the Website Statement and the Montecristo and Forbes articles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">Manoj’s claim in conspiracy </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Manoj had alleged that the counterclaim defendants had engaged in a conspiracy by lawful and unlawful means. In a claim for conspiracy by unlawful means: (a) there must be a combination of persons to do certain acts; (b) the persons must have intended to cause damage or injury to Manoj by those acts; (c) the acts were unlawful and performed in furtherance of the agreement; and (d) Manoj had suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy (<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [112]). In a conspiracy by lawful means, no unlawful act need be committed but there is the requirement of proving a predominant purpose by the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the claimant and the act is carried out and the purpose achieved (<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others and other appeals</span> [2013] 1 SLR 374 at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I find that Manoj’s counterclaim for conspiracy, whether by lawful or unlawful means, has not been made out. In particular, there is no evidence that Taha, Maranda and/or TWG Tea had intended or had the predominant purpose to cause damage or injury to Manoj by making the Statements. As with the claim in malicious falsehood, there was also no evidence of what loss, injury or damage Manoj had suffered as a result of a conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For completeness, I address briefly the element of the intention to cause damage or injury and of “predominant purpose”, as it overlaps with the element of malice in the claim for malicious falsehood. Although Taha denied it, the Statements were published to benefit and would have benefitted his and Maranda’s public profile and place themselves front and centre in the founding of TWG Tea. This was understandable even if it was not entirely excusable. They had contributed significantly to bring about TWG Tea, making it into an international brand.

Manoj is to take all necessary steps to transfer the Domain Name to TWG Tea subject to TWG Tea bearing the costs related to the transfer.
