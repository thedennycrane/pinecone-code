<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant,
                    Mr Tan Kah Ghee, (“Mr Tan”), seeks an injunction to
                    restrain the plaintiff’s solicitors, Messrs Tan Kok Quan Partnership
                    (“TKQP”) from acting as solicitors for the plaintiffs and/or
                    giving legal advice in all court matters arising out of these present
                        proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These proceedings, (the main action, Suit
                    No 1084 of 2009, consolidated with Suit No 1085 of 2009/M and Suit
                    No 1086 of 2009/R (“S 1084/2009”)), flow from the protracted
                    Horizon Towers litigation which culminated in the Court of Appeal judgment
                    setting aside the order of the Horizon Board for the collective sale of the
                    property (“Horizon Towers litigation”) on 2 April 2009: see
                        <em>Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others
                        (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 109 (“the CA Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the Horizon Towers litigation, the plaintiffs
                    were part of a group of subsidiary proprietors who opposed the collective sale.
                    They were unsuccessful before the Strata Titles Board (“STB”) and
                    the High Court, but as noted, succeeded before the Court of Appeal. The
                    plaintiffs were represented by TKQP before the STB, the High Court in relation
                    to orders made by the STB and in the judicial review application in the High
                    Court before Choo Han Teck J (“STB matters”). TKQP did not
                    represent the plaintiffs in the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to
                    S 1084/2009, Mr Arjun Samtani (“Mr Samtani”) was the
                    chairman of the management council of Horizon Towers at the time the collective
                    sale was first mooted. He was later appointed as the chairman of the original
                    sales committee (“the original SC”). Mr Tan was also a member
                    of the original SC. It should be noted at the outset that Mr Samtani is
                    neither applicant nor respondent to Mr Tan’s application to restrain
                    TKQP from participating in any capacity in S 1084/2009. Mr Samtani adopts a
                    neutral stand, neither supporting nor opposing Mr Tan’s application
                    for an injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In S 1084/2009, the plaintiffs found their claim
                    on the defendants’ breach of fiduciary duties which the Court of Appeal
                    found to be owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs, due to a possible conflict
                    of interest which the defendants should have disclosed to the subsidiary
                    proprietors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     At the time of initiation of the
                        collective sale process, unknown to other members of the original SC, the
                        defendants took steps to purchase additional units in Horizon
                            Towers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> These purchases were
                        only discovered during the CA hearing and during the discovery process in S
                            1084/2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     As members of the original SC, the
                        defendants breached duties owed to the plaintiffs <em>qua</em> agent, fiduciary and trustee which resulted in the
                        plaintiffs’ loss and damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Specifically, at [38.1] of their Statement of
                        Particulars, the plaintiffs claim they suffered loss and damage as a result
                        of the breach in the form of the solicitor and client costs incurred in the
                        sum of $264, 771.71 for the proceedings leading up to the setting aside of
                        the collective sale.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In the consolidated suit, S
                        1084/2009 the plaintiffs claim $752,665.15 in total solicitor and client
                        costs from the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is noteworthy that the only
                    pleaded loss and damage sought by the plaintiffs is the solicitor and client
                    costs paid by the plaintiffs to TKQP in the STB matters. The plaintiffs also
                    state that they will give credit for any costs they recover in the Horizon
                    Towers litigation; those bills, I have been told by counsel, have yet to be
                    taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Tan’s answer to the
                    plaintiff’s claim in so far as it is relevant to this application is as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The quantum of damages claimed by the
                        plaintiff is “unreasonable and/or manifestly excessive” or
                        unreasonably incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The invoices listed at [38.1] of the Statement of Particulars
                        are not sufficiently particularised: the number of solicitors, their
                        seniority, their time costs incurred and their respective charge out
                        rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was
                        “substantial duplicity” of the work in representation of the
                        plaintiffs in the three suits which have been consolidated under S
                        1084/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     There
                        was “gross overcharging” in relation to the matters to which
                        the invoices relate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Because Mr Tan challenges the quantum of
                    loss and damage suffered by the plaintiffs, and therefore the <em>reasonableness</em> of TKQP’s invoices to the plaintiffs (which
                    were paid by the plaintiffs), Mr Tan contends that TKQP should be prevented
                    from representing the plaintiffs due to the professional duties and obligations
                    imposed on them under Rules 25 and 64 of the Legal Profession (Professional
                    Conduct) Rules (Cap 61, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) (“LPPCR”).
                    Rules 25 and 64 of the LPPCR read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Conflict of interest</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25. During the course of a retainer, an advocate and solicitor shall
                        advance the client’s interest unaffected by:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) any interest of the advocate and solicitor;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(aa) where the advocate and solicitor is a partner or an employee of a
                        limited liability law partnership any interest of the limited liability law

                        maintain his professional independence or would make it incompatible with
                        the best interests of the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Solicitor not to act if he is a
                        witness</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64 (1) An advocate and solicitor shall not accept instructions in a case
                        in which the advocate and solicitor has reason to believe that he is likely
                        to be a witness on a material question of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) An advocate and solicitor shall discharge himself from representing a
                        client if it becomes apparent to the advocate and solicitor that he is
                        likely to be a witness on a material question of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) In discharging himself, the advocate and solicitor shall take all
                        reasonable steps to ensure that his client’s interest is not in any
                        way jeopardised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Urgency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The matter has assumed some urgency because the
                    consolidated action is fixed for hearing from 6 to 17 February 2012. This
                    application was filed just before the court vacation on 30 November 2011,
                    fixed for hearing on 21 December 2011 but adjourned as counsel was not
                    available due to the holiday season and came before me on 10 January 2012.
                    In view of the urgency, I gave my decision with brief grounds on 27 January
                    2012 and told the parties that my written grounds will follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It appears that Mr Tan, inadvertently or
                    otherwise, has contributed to the protraction of the main action by multiple
                    changes of solicitors. Initially Mr Tan was represented by TSMP Law
                    Corporation and then by Mr Glenn Knight on or around 29 July 2011,
                    after which Mr Tan was a litigant in person. On 8 Nov 2011, Collin Ng
                    Partners (“CNP”) were instructed and currently represent
                        Mr Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Mr Samtani has
                    maintained the same representation throughout these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Tan introduced the defence relating to
                    the propriety of TKQP’s invoices rather belatedly on 18 November 2011
                    by way of amendment to paragraphs 30-31 of his defence (above at [6]). This was no doubt due to CNP’s
                    coming on board and their assessment of the matter. While the plaintiffs
                    objected to a large number of the other amendments proposed, the position taken
                    on paragraphs 30-31 was that reply submissions would be filed followed by an
                    application for further discovery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Tan’s submission that the plaintiffs are estopped from arguing
                    against the merits of the defence raised in paragraphs 30-31 is without
                    substance. In light of the seriousness of the remedy sought by Mr Tan, the
                    merits of the defence are a paramount consideration in the present application.
                    Further, it can be said that the plaintiffs reserved their position by clearly
                    stating their intention to file a reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the other hand, the plaintiffs have taken
                    out an application for preliminary determination, in which they seek to
                    establish that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendants’ defences
                        amount to a collateral attack on the CA judgement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the alternative, the defences are
                        unsustainable at law. In particular the dispute relating to the invoices
                        (forming the subject matter of dispute) does not arise as damages for
                        breaches of fiduciary duties are awarded based on principles of restitution
                        or equitable compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     This application and the submissions have
                    raised the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Issue
                            1</em>: Does the Court have the inherent jurisdiction to hear an
                        application based on breaches of the LPPCR?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       If so, when should it
                            exercise its discretion;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Is the Court the proper forum to determine a
                            breach of the LPPCR;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       If so, can Mr Tan, an adverse party, make
                            the application;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Issue 2</em>: What is the nature
                        and extent of the alleged breaches of rr. 25 and 64 of the LPPCR and what
                        facts support the present application;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>Issue 3</em>: Whether the scope
                        of r 64 could extend beyond the testifying solicitor to restrain all
                        the solicitors at TKQP from acting for the plaintiffs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>Issue 4</em>:
                        Whether the reasonableness of the invoices rendered to the plaintiffs by
                        their solicitors is a material fact in issue where the claim is for
                        equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary claim; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     
            <em>Issue 5</em>:
                        If the Court takes the view that this is the proper forum, is the evidence
                        in support of the allegation of overcharging upon which the breach of
                        r 64 is premised, sufficient to trigger the court’s exercise of
                        its inherent jurisdiction?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Inherent jurisdiction of the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The inherent jurisdiction of the court is very
                    widely expressed in O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”). It is exercisable to prevent
                    “injustice” or an “abuse of process”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these
                        Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to
                        make any order as may be necessary to <b>prevent injustice
                            or to prevent an abuse of process of the Court.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It has long been settled that O 92 r 4 of the Rules includes
                    the jurisdiction to regulate and supervise the conduct of Advocates and
                    Solicitors as Officers of this Court. That much is common ground. Further under
                    paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the Supreme Court Judicature Act,
                    (Cap 322 Rev Ed 2007) the High Court also has a very wide power to
                    issue to “...<em>any person or authority any direction,
                        order or writ for the enforcement of any right conferred by any written law
                        or for any other purpose...</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     However, cases have laid down that the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction under O 92 r 4 of the Rules should
                    only be exercised where there is a clear need and where the justice of the case
                    so demands. In <em>Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 (“<em>Wee Soon Kim</em>”) the Court of Appeal said that
                    whilst its inherent jurisdiction under O 92 r 4 or under the common
                    law should not be restricted by rigid tests or criteria, that jurisdiction
                    should be exercised judiciously. An essential touchstone identified was the
                    “need” for its invocation. In addition to the question of
                    prejudice to either party, the court held that there must be “reasonably
                    strong or compelling reasons showing why that jurisdiction should be
                    invoked”: see <em>Wee Soon Kim</em>
                        at [30]. Similarly in <em>Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Oversea-Chinese
                        Banking Corp Ltd and another</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 353
                        at [16] and [17], the CA emphasized that inherent
                    jurisdiction should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where there is
                    a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands. In the words of Chao
                    Hick Tin JA, the “circumstances must be
                special”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Accordingly, the issue is whether there are
                    strong or compelling reasons for the court’s inherent jurisdiction to be
                    invoked and whether there is a need to do so. For the reasons set out below,
                    this is not a case where the court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to
                    intervene.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proper forum for the present application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This application is based on alleged breaches
                    of the LPPCR. A question arises: whether the Mr Tan’s complaint
                    should more properly be dealt with by the Law Society rather than the Court. The
                    concern is that the court’s inquiry and findings would effectively usurp
                    the Law Society’s jurisdiction in hearing the issue first instance; it
                    subverts the proper inquiry and due process laid down in the Legal Profession
                    Act (Cap 161, Rev Ed 2009) (“LPA”) and denies TKQP its
                    rights thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This view that the Law Society is the proper
                    forum for a determination of breaches of the LPPCR is not new. In <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and others</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 798 (“<em>Ong Jane
                    Rebecca</em>”), Choo J took the view that a declaration of
                    propriety by measure of the LPPCR could only be made by the Law Society after a
                    full enquiry. He stated that it was not for the court to usurp the jurisdiction
                    of the Disciplinary Committee (“DC”). In <em>Ong
                        Jane Rebecca</em>, ironically, TKQP sought an order to cease acting
                    for their client due to the possible breaches of rr. 29 and 31 of the LPPCR if
                    they continued with their representation. The court took the position that it
                    was for the solicitor to decide if there was a conflict or breach of the LPPCR
                    and the propriety of his/her decision would be determined by a DC upon full
                    inquiry. Similarly, prior to the DC’s determination in <em>The Law Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm</em> [2006]
                    SGDSC 11 (at [13])
                        (“<em>LSS v Malcolm</em>”), when the
                    issue of a possible breach of an LPPCR rule was raised in the main action before
                    the High Court, V K Rajah JC, as he then was, informed the parties
                    that any possible breach of the LPPCR was a matter between the Law Society and
                    the respondent. Similar to the present case, the facts of <em>LSS
                        v Malcolm</em> also involved a possible breach of r 64 of the
                    LPPCR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Apart from some New Zealand and Australian
                    cases, which are dealt with below, the cases where the court has exercised its
                    jurisdiction and intervened for breaches of the LPPCR also involved the
                    protection of or possible misuse of confidential information acquired by a
                    solicitor at Common Law. For example in <em>Alrich Development
                        Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy</em> [1994] 3 SLR 1 at 25
                        (“<em>Alrich Development</em>”), Chao
                    Hick Tin J, as he then was, discussed the issue of a possible conflict of
                    interest due to a law firm’s employment of a solicitor who had been an
                    employee of the firm acting for the opposing party. The mischief the court was
                    concerned with was the classic situation of a conflict of interest arising from
                    the possible misuse of confidential information. While the court did not find
                    that there was a conflict of interest on the facts, the issue of proper forum
                    was not raised or discussed. In <em>Vorobiev Nikolay v Lush John
                        Frederick Peters and others</em> [2011] 1 SLR 663 <em>(“Vorobiev Nikolay”)</em>, Lee Seiu Kin J
                    granted an injunction to restrain solicitors (all solicitors in the firm rather
                    than a specific advocate) from acting for the client on account of breach of
                    r 31(1) LPPCR. The party who sought the injunction successfully claimed
                    that their reason for objecting was that the solicitors they sought to restrain
                    acted for them in a related matter. Again the issue of proper forum was not
                    ventilated by the court. However, at [24], the learned judge quoted from <em>The Law
                        Society of Singapore v Seah Li Ming Edwin</em> and another [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 401, also at [24], where the Court of Three Judges observed that behind
                    r 31(1) was a larger public interest, <em>viz</em>,
                    the trust between lawyer and client should not be compromised as the legitimacy
                    of the law in general and the confidence of clients in their lawyers are of
                    fundamental importance and should not be undermined. Agreeing, Lee J
                    underscored the larger public interest beyond the need to protect against
                    disclosure of confidential information under r 31 <em>per
                        se</em> which was the solicitor-client relationship of trust and
                    ensuring public confidence in the integrity of the legal
                profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The difference between <em>Ong
                        Jane Rebecca</em> and <em>LSS v Malcolm</em> on
                    the one hand and <em>Alrich Development</em> and <em>Vorobiev Nikolay</em> on the other, is that in the latter two
                    cases, the court was not dealing with breaches of the LPPCR <em>per se</em>, but also the common law protection of confidential
                    information, the possible breach of legal professional privilege and the wider
                    public interest. This gave rise to legal obligations upon which the court could
                    have exercised its jurisdiction to restrain the solicitors from the possible
                    misuse of such confidential information. In such cases, the complainant was
                    often the client on the other side. This was something quite independent of the
                    purported breaches of the LPPCR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This was the precise distinction which the
                    English court made in <em>David Lee &amp; Co (Lincoln) Ltd v
                        Coward Chance (a firm)</em> and others [1991] Ch 259
                        (“<em>David Lee</em>”) which opined that
                    the Law Society was the right forum to determine breaches of professional rules
                    of conduct. The court recognised that professional rules tended to impose a
                    higher duty on the members of the profession than the law itself. Further, the
                    decision to restrain the solicitors was made on the basis of legal obligations
                    owed to the client and “<em>not the obligations imposed by
                        professional rules of conduct laid down by the Law
                    Society</em>”. Similar reasoning was applied in <em>In Re a Firm of Solicitors</em> [1992] 1 QB 959
                        (“<em>In Re a Firm of Solicitors”</em>)
                    where the court limited itself to the common law and only applied rules from the
                    conduct rules which were within the boundaries of existing obligations owed at
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Prince Jefri Bolkiah v
                        KPMG (a firm)</em> [1999] 2 AC 222, at 234-235, the
                    then House of Lords emphasized the limited situations in which an injunction
                    will be granted to restrain solicitors from acting, <em>viz</em>, where (i) if the solicitor acted against a present
                    client, this is based on a solicitor’s duty of loyalty to his client, just
                    as a fiduciary cannot act for and against a client at the same time, and
                    (ii) where there is a potential or possible misuse of confidential
                    information obtained by a solicitor from a former client, this was based on a
                    continuing duty to preserve the confidentiality of information imparted during
                    the solicitor-client relationship. Also, <em>In Re a Firm of
                        Solicitors</em> [1997] 1 Ch 1 at 9, the court
                    emphasized that the basis of intervention was not a possible perception of
                    impropriety, but the protection of confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When read in light of these principles, the
                    decisions in <em>Alrich Development</em> and <em>Vorobiev Nikolay</em> are not inconsistent with <em>LSS v Malcolm</em> and <em>Ong Jane
                        Rebecca</em>. It therefore seems to me that where one is concerned
                    only with breaches of the LPPCR, which do not trigger any concurrent breach of
                    legal obligations owed by the counsel to the court or the client at Common Law,
                    the proper forum for investigation and determination of the breach is the Law
                    Society rather than the Court. I should not be taken to say that this is an
                    immutable rule. There may be special or exceptional circumstances where the
                    nature of the complaint is such that on an objective view, a reasonable, fair
                    minded observer would think that a fair trial would not be possible without the
                    Court’s intervention and restraint of the advocate or solicitor from
                    continuing to act. Where matters impinge on the proper administration of
                    justice, due process and wider public interest issues, the Court should
                    intervene, either on its own initiative or pursuant to a complaint by the other
                    party. The Court must not allow confidence in the administration of justice to
                    be undermined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Subramaniam Pillai
                    (“Mr Pillai”), counsel for Mr Tan, submitted that I
                    should follow certain New Zealand and Australian cases which show a liberal
                    invocation of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to intervene in exercise
                    of its supervisory powers over the conduct of counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>Kooky Garments Ltd v
                        Charlton</em> [1994] 1 NZLR 587, (“<em>Kooky Garments</em>”), in the course of an appeal from the
                    District Court, Thomas J said that it was not appropriate for a partner or
                    solicitor in the law firm which acted for a tenant, to represent that tenant in
                    a subsequent dispute where the crucial question was whether a letter written by
                    another solicitor in that firm, the material terms of which appeared to be
                    different from their instructions, was an acceptance of an offer of a lease from
                    the landlord’s letting agent. Thomas J observed that where the
                    possible acts or omissions of a law firm, including situations where the actions
                    of the client are based on the advice given by solicitors, are at the heart of
                    the question in issue, that firm is, in a real sense, defending its advice
                    and/or its actions. In such circumstances there was a danger that the client
                    will not be represented with the objectivity and independence which the client
                    is entitled to and which the court will demand. I entirely agree with this
                    principle. As set out in the judgement, such a client is entitled to independent
                    advice untrammelled by considerations of possible personal liability of the
                    solicitors. The reported decision in <em>Kooky
                        Garments</em> was limited to this aspect and it appears that it was
                    the judge who raised this issue. In dismissing the appeal, he accordingly
                    ordered that the party and party costs below and the appeal were to be borne by
                    the solicitors personally. This case illustrates the principle referred to
                    above, <em>viz</em>, the integrity of the judicial process
                    is undermined if solicitors or counsel do not possess the objectivity and
                    independence which their professional responsibility and obligations to the
                    court require of them. The court intervened because no one had raised the point
                    and the court could not let it pass without intervention. However in the present
                    case, the complaint by Mr Tan relates to professional fees rendered to and
                    paid by the opposing party to its own solicitor in what appears to be, normal
                    circumstances. It does not relate to any advice or ‘potential’
                    liability of TKQP or advice or action lying at the heart of the matter in the
                    other proceedings. In <em>Kooky Garments</em>,
                    Thomas J also said, at [50],
                    the principle enunciated by him does not apply where the advice given is
                    unrelated to the liability or the question in dispute. This case is thus of no
                    assistance to Mr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The decision of <em>Brogue
                        Tableau Pty Ltd v Tottle Partners (a firm)</em> [2006] WASC 273,
                        (“<em>Brogue Tableau”</em>), is slightly
                    different. The factual situation was analogous to the present case. Solicitors
                    successfully represented their client, Binningup, in the removal of a caveat
                    lodged against its land. The court ordered, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the removal of the caveat and awarded costs of the action
                    to be taxed to Binningup. These costs were later agreed at $17,000 and duly
                    paid. Binningup then commenced an action to assess compensation under s 140
                    of the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (Western Australia) and claimed $34,582.15 and
                    counsel fees of $8,700 which were paid by it, over and above the compromised
                    costs of $17,000, to their solicitors for the removal of the caveat action
                    (“s 140 proceedings”). The opposing party applied to court to
                    restrain Binningup’s solicitors from representing Binningup in the
                    s 140 proceedings. It is interesting to note that the court rejected all
                    but one of the opposing party’s arguments. On the basis that what was
                    claimed was compensation, not damages, the court held that there was no
                    substance in the submission that Binningup’s solicitors had an interest in
                    the proceedings in that, if the level of fees they charged was inappropriate,
                    they would perhaps have to refund moneys already paid. The court said it was not
                    infrequently that solicitors have an interest in an aspect of a case which
                    affects their fees, examples include, a solicitor who applied for costs after a
                    successful application or who attends a party and party taxation. The court took
                    the view that it could not be said that the solicitors have so direct an
                    interest in the proceedings that they should not represent their clients whether
                    or not their clients complained. The court issued the injunction against the
                    solicitors only on the basis that there was a difference in what Binningup had
                        <em>agreed to accept</em> as its costs and the costs it
                    was claiming over and above that as compensation and it was open to the opposing
                    party to argue that even if what Binningup was entitled to was compensation and
                    not damages, the amount of costs claimed as compensation was unethical. If the
                    ethics of the solicitor became an issue, then the solicitor’s interest
                    would be different to that of the client. The rest of the judgement goes against
                    Mr Tan’s arguments. That case is certainly distinguishable from the
                    present proceedings, where the facts are very different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I was also referred to <em>Bowen v Stott</em> [2004] WASC 94. At first blush, this Western
                    Australian case appears similar to <em>Brogue Tableau</em>
                    in that the applicant to restrain the solicitor was an opposing party but, upon
                    closer examination, its facts are more akin to <em>Kooky
                        Garments</em> in that the very fact in issue, whether there was a
                    settlement which included an apology by way of a retraction of certain words
                    allegedly said, depended on the lawyers who were the ones negotiating the
                    settlement, their client not being present, and there was potential liability in
                    settling the matter if they failed to obtain the apology their client required
                    before she was prepared to settle her case. <em>Bowen v
                        Stott</em> therefore does not assist Mr Tan either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There were other cases cited but I do not find
                    it necessary to go into them because there is a more fundamental reason why the
                    practice adopted in these cases should not be followed here. Where we have our
                    own CA judgments setting out the boundaries of this Court’s exercise of
                    its inherent jurisdiction, laying down certain principles and guidelines for
                    their application, which are directly applicable to the case in hand, we should
                    approach the prevailing practices of other jurisdictions with much
                    circumspection. First, these other jurisdictions may well have their own reasons
                    to adopt their differing approaches, including differences in the wording of
                    their professional conduct or ethical rules. Secondly, and most importantly, our
                    CA decisions are binding on me unless the CA itself decides to vary, refine or
                    depart from its earlier decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Where the application to restrain is by the opposing party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Where the application is made by an opposing
                    party to restrain lawyers a court will look carefully into the grounds for doing
                    so and if necessary carry out a balancing exercise, <em>a
                        fortiori</em> if the application is made at a late stage. In the
                    Australian decision of <em>Tricontinental Corporation Ltd v
                        Holding Redlick</em> (VSC, Mandie J, 22 December 1994)
                    at 5 (“<em>Tricontinental</em>”) the
                    court held that “[i]t is a serious matter to prevent a party from
                    retaining the legal representative of its choice, particularly upon the
                    application not of a former client but of an adverse party”. In <em>Kalenik v Apostolidis</em> [2005] VSC 27 the reasoning of the
                    court in <em>Tricontinental</em> was followed. It is
                    noteworthy that both these cases involved possible misuse of confidential
                    information and not pure breaches of professional conduct rules. Many American
                    Bar Associations have an exception that the lawyer-witness rule may not be
                    invoked where such disqualification would work substantial hardship on a client.
                    A court will therefore have to balance the mischief that is to be prevented
                    against the right of a party to be represented by a lawyer of his choice. This
                    involves a balancing of all the facts and circumstances including the alleged
                    breach, the <em>bona fides</em> of the
                    opposing-party-applicant, the time at and circumstances under which the
                    application is made and the mischief the rule is intended to prevent. In the
                    present case, the plaintiffs did not complain over their solicitor’s bills
                    and have, in fact, paid them sometime ago and it is the opposing party who now
                    complains that those bills are manifestly excessive or constitute gross
                    overcharging. Mr Tan contends that, for that reason, the plaintiffs’
                    lawyers should be disqualified from acting. I cannot agree. The circumstances
                    surrounding this application are dealt with below, see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>, <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> and <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Breach of rr. 25 and 64</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I now turn to Mr Tan’s bases of his
                    application, <em>viz</em>, TKQP’s continued
                    representation of the plaintiffs would be in breach of rr. 25(a) and 64 of the
                    LPPCR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Rule 25 of the LPPCR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Rule 25(a) of the LPPCR lays down the
                    principle that an advocate and solicitor should not allow a conflict of interest
                    between the client’s interest and that of the advocate and solicitor. It
                    is alleged that TKQP has a personal interest in maintaining that their fees
                    rendered to the plaintiffs in the Horizon Towers litigation are reasonable and
                    neither manifestly excessive nor a gross overcharging for the work done.
                    Mr Tan’s defence is that he is not liable for the fees borne by the
                    plaintiffs because TKQP’s charges are unreasonable, manifestly excessive
                    or amount to a gross overcharging of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As pointed out by the plaintiffs, and accepted
                    by Mr Tan,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> TKQP’s invoices were
                    rendered for work done over a period of time in 2007 and the invoices have been
                    paid. The bulk of the payments were made in 2007 and some instalments were paid
                    in 2008. This was well before the appeal on 3 February 2009 and the CA
                    judgment on 2 April 2009. It is significant to note that at the time
                    TKQP’s bills were rendered, the plaintiffs had failed in all their
                    attempts to halt the collective sale. The plaintiffs were represented by another
                    set of solicitors in the CA and it is only before the CA that the plaintiffs
                    prevailed. TKQP’s bills did not appear to be to be rendered in a state of
                    euphoria that follows upon a victory in court nor rendered at sanguine (let
                    alone inflated) levels in anticipation of partial recovery from party-and-party
                    costs from the other side. They were rendered and paid well before any finding
                    of breaches of fiduciary duty were made by the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Nor is this a case where payment of
                    TKQP’s fees is in some way contingent upon recovery from the plaintiffs.
                    TKQP’s interest is in fact aligned with that of their client in
                    establishing the ‘reasonableness’ of the invoices. There is no
                    evidence at all that the plaintiffs are unhappy about the level of fees charged
                    or that they have been overcharged or that the fees are unreasonable, let alone
                    manifestly excessive or at a level reaching gross overcharging. There are no
                    allegations or even hints of fraud or collusion on the part of TKQP and the
                    plaintiffs, in fabricating invoices with higher amounts in order to enhance
                    recovery from the plaintiffs. I therefore do not see any conflict of interest on
                    the evidence before me. Insofar as Mr Pillai urges me to read <em>Brogue Tableau</em> in the way that he submits, with respect,
                    I cannot agree that I can restrain TKQP from acting because there is a <em>possibility</em> that TKQP’s fees might be held to be
                    unreasonable, manifestly excessive, unreasonably incurred or the result of gross
                    overcharging. The compensation claimed by the plaintiffs are the fees rendered
                    and paid some time ago. Further, the plaintiffs have undertaken to give credit
                    for any taxed party-and-party costs recovered. On the facts as they stand now
                    and the circumstances in which the bills were rendered, that is, in the words of
                    the judgement in <em>Brogue Tableau</em>, at [13] and [14], Mr Tan is not only “jumping at shadows”
                    but also making “effectively a pre-emptive strike” to disrupt the
                    plaintiff’s representation by solicitors of their choice at this late
                    stage. It is also noteworthy that the plaintiffs have chosen TKQP for this
                    recovery action and not the solicitors who succeeded before the CA. There are
                    obvious advantages to the plaintiffs for TKQP to represent them in this recovery
                    action as TKQP are already well acquainted with the facts of the
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>The </em><em>Law Society of Singapore v Koh Lee Kheng Florence</em> [2005]
                    SGDSC 7 (“<em>LSS v Florence</em>”), in the
                    discussion relating to r 25(a), the DC stated that the purpose of the rule
                    is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>[T]he protection of the client</b>. It follows
                        that the <b>client must be the aggrieved party when his
                            solicitor breaches that rule.</b> That rule is not meant for
                        ex-partners or solicitors representing the opposite side to use to vent
                        their frustrations, however justified they may feel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DC commented that if all the Law Society needed to prove to
                    establish a breach of r 25 was the solicitor’s pecuniary interests
                    (which is a given in the case of his bill) and the client’s loss in his
                    payment of costs to the successful party, then such a solicitor and most of the
                    legal profession would have breached r 25(a). The DC took the view that so
                    long as the interest of the client and solicitor was aligned, no issue of
                    conflict arose. A finding of a breach of r 25 of the LPPCR requires
                    something more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There may be cases where an uninformed or
                    disadvantaged client may not realise that he has been grossly overcharged by his
                    lawyer. In such cases, the independent quality of the advice his lawyer will be
                    able to provide on the reasonableness of the lawyer’s invoices to the
                    plaintiffs will be in issue. In Andrew Boon and Jennifer Levin’s <em>The Ethics and Conduct of Lawyers in England and Wales</em>
                    (Hart Publishing, 1999) at 281, the authors discussed the proper procedure
                    to be followed in the event of such a personal conflict of interest:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In these cases the solicitor must reveal the interests to the client with
                        “complete frankness” and the client must receive independent
                        advice from another solicitor or other appropriate advisor such as a
                        surveyor. Only if the client gets such advice can the solicitor continue to
                        act in relation to the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     While Mr Tan may argue that the
                    plaintiffs will not get independent advice from TKQP on whether the invoices
                    rendered by them are reasonable or a case of gross overcharging, this conflict
                    is for the client to remedy. Whether TKQP have advised their clients (i.e. the
                    plaintiffs) to seek independent advice on the level of their fees is a matter
                    between TKQP and the plaintiffs, not the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     There is no suggestion that the plaintiffs are
                    ignorant or disadvantaged clients and I can see no issues of injustice arising
                    on this score. In the circumstances, I take the view that a possible breach of
                    r 25 on the issue of the independence of TKQP’s advice on its
                    invoices is a matter between the client, TKQP and if it comes to it, the Law
                    Society, but not the defendants. Furthermore, in light of the facts as they
                    stand, I found this application to be without any basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Rule 64 of the LPPCR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The rationale behind r 64, known as the
                    advocate-witness rule, can be found in Lord Ried’s speech in
                        <em>Rondell v Worsley</em> [1969] 1 AC 191
                    at 224 on the duty of counsel to court. As it should be graven on the heart
                    of any advocate worth his salt, it bears repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every counsel has a duty to his client fearlessly to raise every issue,
                        advance every argument, and ask every question, however distasteful, which
                        he thinks will help his client’s case. But, as an officer of the court
                        concerned in the administration of justice, he has an overriding duty to the
                        court, to the standards of his profession, and to the public, which may and
                        often does lead to a conflict with his client’s wishes or with what
                        the client thinks are his personal wishes. Counsel must not mislead the
                        court, he must not lend himself to casting aspersions on the other party or
                        witnesses for which there is no sufficient basis in the information in his
                        possession, he must not withhold authorities or documents which may tell
                        against his clients but which the law or the standards of his profession
                        require him to produce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is readily apparent that r 64 also
                    overlaps with r 25. An advocate’s independence and objectivity are
                    two key attributes required in the discharge of his duty to the court. Breaches
                    of r 64 will usually also concern the public interest issue of confidence
                    in the proper administration of justice and therefore falls within the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court. But whether the court intervenes depends on <em>inter alia</em>, the presence of compelling reasons or
                    special or exceptional circumstances and the necessity of doing
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There can be no doubt that courts depend on an
                    advocate’s integrity, independence, objectivity and impartiality to assist
                    them in dispensing justice. This ability to be independent, objective and
                    impartial is seriously in doubt when an advocate is asked to remove his robe and
                    move from the bar table to the witness stand to give evidence which is neither
                    formal or undisputed. There may well be a subconscious shaping of the evidence
                    or the case to negate a potential professional negligence claim. To preserve the
                    integrity of the proper administration of justice, such a situation should be
                    avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There are therefore clear authorities on the
                    point that when a solicitor is to testify to a material fact in his
                    client’s claim he should discharge himself. In <em>LSS v
                        Florence</em>, the material fact in dispute was the cost arrangement
                    entered into for which the solicitor was likely to be called as a witness. The
                    DC stated that the origin of r 64 was that an advocate and solicitor had a
                    paramount duty to the court to testify to the truth and it was the conflict
                    between the interest of the client and the duty of the court which r 64
                    sought to avoid. Along the same vein, in <em>Commissioner for
                        Corporate Affairs v P W Harvey</em> [1980] VR 669 the court found that
                    an advocate must be able to promise the court, singularity of interest. The
                    purity of interest in advocates before the court was identified as central to
                    the utility and credence of the system. In fact in <em>LSS v
                        </em><em>Malcolm</em> the DC took the absolute
                    position that once a solicitor had reason to believe he was likely to be a
                    witness on a material question of fact, he should not continue to act for the
                    client in any capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Scope of r 64 LPPCR’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Does r 64 also apply where it is not the
                    advocate who is giving evidence but his partner or another solicitor in his
                    firm? Mr Tan’s application seeks to disqualify <em>all</em> solicitors of TKQP from representing the plaintiffs
                    notwithstanding the degree of their involvement with the invoices in question.
                    Mr Tan contends that notwithstanding Mr Kannan Ramesh’s
                        (<em>i.e.</em> the solicitor who rendered the invoices
                    in dispute) removal from the case, he continues to instruct the solicitors
                    and/or they are working under his supervision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan submitted that
                    passing on the plaintiff’s file to another litigation partner not involved
                    in the disputed invoices would still be in breach of r 64(2) of the LPPCR
                    and relied heavily on <em>Ho Kon Kim v Betsy Lim Gek Kim &amp;
                        Ors</em> [2001] SGHC 75 (“<em>Betsy
                        Lim</em>”). In <em>Betsy Lim</em>, the
                    court held that r 64(2) of the LPPCR would still be breached where the
                    advocate-witness passed the file to another partner in the firm, not involved in
                    the matter in issue, to handle the litigation. The learned judge held that the
                    solicitors for Mdm Ho Hon Kim (“Mdm Ho”) were in serious
                    dereliction of their duty in advising their client to pursue a claim against the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, a law firm, and the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, a bank. Pursuant to O 59
                    r 8 of the Rules, the learned judge ordered that the solicitors should
                    personally bear the costs that Mdm Ho had to pay these two parties. In the
                    course of her judgment, the learned trial judge also ruled that the solicitors
                    had breached no less than 5 of the professional conduct rules, including rr. 25
                    and 64, and took a very dim view of the solicitors alleging dishonesty and fraud
                    against another solicitor without any evidence to substantiate their
                    allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When that decision was urged upon me, counsel
                    for Mr Samtani, Mr Sreenivasan, interjected, despite his
                    client’s neutral stand in the application, to point out that <em>Betsy Lim</em> was reversed on appeal. This, if I may say so,
                    was a very good example of the principle referred to above, that the courts
                    depend on the integrity, independence, objectivity and impartiality of counsel
                    to assist them in carrying out their function in dispensing
                justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The CA in <em>Betsy
                        Lim</em> allowed the appeal and reversed the personal cost order that
                    had been made against Mdm Ho’s solicitors under O 59 r 8 of
                    the Rules. The CA held that the other solicitor who was alleged to have acted
                    dishonestly was potentially liable for having been involved as an accessory to,
                    or having assisted the buyer in disposing of Mdm Ho’s property in
                    breach of trust. Mdm Ho’s solicitors therefore acted reasonably in
                    making the claims that they did and against the parties named as defendants. The
                    CA did not express a conclusive view on the reach of r 64(2) LPPCR but did
                    say the following at [62] and
                        [63]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62    ... The mere failure of Mr Ponniah [the
                            litigation partner] and Mr Wong [the conveyancing partner, both of
                            whom were in the firm which acted for Mdm Ho] to advise Mdm Ho
                            to seek independent legal advice or to discharge themselves could not be
                            said to have caused Mdm Ho to have incur the costs of the action
                            against WLAW and RHB, as it cannot be said with reasonable certainty
                            that any other independent or prudent or reasonable lawyer would not
                            have given the same advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">63    It may be that for obviously good reasons
                            Mr Ponniah and Mr Wong should not have acted for her in these
                            proceedings. First, they knew fully well that Mr Wong himself would
                            be a material witness in the proceedings to be taken against
                            Ms Lim, and second that they had a personal interest in the case as
                            it was their firm which had acted for Mdm Ho in the sale of the
                            property and mortgage to OCBC. <b><em>Without expressing
                                any view on this matter, we would just mention that it may be said
                                that </em></b><b>prima facie</b><b><em> the problem that had arisen could be said to have been

                                discharged themselves from acting for Mdm Ho and should have
                                advised her to seek independent legal advice.</em></b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Rule 64 is worded as applying to the advocate
                    and solicitor himself. This is unlike the equivalent English version of the
                    advocate-witness rule which is expressly wider in its scope; the relevant
                    English Rule 21.12 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A solicitor must not accept instructions to act as advocate for a client
                        if it is clear that he or she <b>or a member of the
                            firm</b> will be called as a witness on behalf of the client,
                        unless the evidence is purely formal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This distinction was recognised and highlighted in <em>LSS v Malcolm</em>. It is thus not surprising that in an Opinion of
                    the Ethics Committee of the Law Society of Singapore, published in the Singapore
                    Law Gazette on 29 January 2009, r 64(2) was interpreted to only
                    require the particular advocate who is likely to be a witness to discharge
                    himself. The Ethics Committee specifically stated that other members of the firm
                    could continue to conduct the suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Pillai cited the old English decision
                    of <em>Davies v Clough</em> (1837) 8 Sim 262 where a
                    solicitor acted against a former client using personal information gained in the
                    original matter. The court found that as the firm was conceived under the
                    traditional partnership model, any act of one partner was that of another. The
                    court took the view that if one partner was restrained, it would follow that all
                    partners should be restrained notwithstanding their involvement. Mr Pillai
                    submits, that this principle should also be applied here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The difficulty is that r 64 makes perfect
                    sense when applied to a split profession with barristers and solicitors. In the
                    old English context, one would not expect a barrister or his junior to take off
                    their robes and enter the witness stand to give evidence on a material point.
                    They were all sole practitioners and had no partners or professional employees.
                    The applicability of that simple self evident rule was on less secure contextual
                    footing when solicitors were also allowed to act as counsel in court as they had
                    partners and employee solicitors. This is now complicated by law firms today
                    comprising a few hundred lawyers, the mobility of groups of lawyers crossing
                    from one firm to another and to law firms practising in more than one
                    jurisdiction and possibly subject to different professional conduct rules. If
                    law firms A and B have an overseas practice and law firm A’s overseas
                    branch acquires a group of solicitors from law firm B’s overseas branch,
                    how does r 64 work? Does r 64 still bite in A and B’s home
                    jurisdiction? I would venture that it becomes conceptually more muddled when one
                    considers the concept of a limited liability partnership or solicitors in a
                    limited liability corporation. In a limited liability partnership, if partner
                    X’s file gives rise to a potential negligence claim, partner X’s
                    liability is quite different from partner Y, who had nothing to do with
                    X’s files. When this is compared to a traditional partnership, it may be
                    difficult to take the same simplistic view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, in my view, while the wording of
                    r 64(2) of the LPPCR is expressly limited to the advocate and solicitor and
                    in certain situations should be restrictively applied, we should go back to
                    basics and ask: what is the real mischief targeted? As rightly pointed out by
                    Jeffrey Pinsler SC in <em>Ethics and Professional
                        Responsibility: A Code for the Advocate and Solicitor</em> (Academy
                    Publishing, 2007) at 156, it is the danger of the subconscious shaping of
                    the evidence to suit the solicitor’s interest as against that of his
                    client and the duty to the court. This particular concern, depending on the
                    interest and evidence in question could easily impact the firm collectively. It
                    is incontrovertible that the LPPCR should be interpreted with proper
                    appreciation of the mischief to be averted rather than in a strict textual
                    fashion. In <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay
                        Khiang</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477, at [100] and [120],
                    the court held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100 It is also axiomatic that it is the spirit and intent, rather than
                        just the plain letter, of the professional ethical rules that breathe life
                        and legitimacy into the standards that are relevant in assessing whether a
                        lawyer has discharged his professional obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">120 Ethical codes, practices and standards must be religiously observed
                        and adhered to, as an unequivocal affirmation of and testament to the legal
                        profession's undivided commitment to probity, competence and diligence in
                        the practice of the law. However, it must also be stressed that a rigid and
                        formalistic adherence to the codes of practice without a proper appreciation
                        of their spirit, purport and intent may from time to time lead to ethical
                        blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Whether r 64(2) would extend to all other
                    solicitors in the firm therefore depends on the facts and circumstances of each
                    case. No rigid rules or criteria should be laid down. So long as the
                    sub-conscious shaping of evidence is of genuine concern and the issues envelop
                    the entire firm, it seems to me that r 64(2) of the LPPCR can be
                    interpreted to extend accordingly. However, a wider interpretation should be
                    adopted only when the mischief intended has a real possibility of occurring. Two
                    significant guideposts include, first, the mischief that r 64 is meant to
                    avoid and secondly, whether the heart of the client’s case touches upon
                    the correctness or otherwise of an act or document generated or soundness of
                    advice given by the advocate’s partner or other member of his firm. The
                    degree of his loss of objectivity, the degree to which it impacts or can
                    potentially affect his practice, (be it a traditional partnership, or limited
                    liability partnership or limited liability corporation), and therefore the
                    fulfilment of his duty to the court, is the true question to be answered. I
                    would venture to say that even in the context of a limited liability
                    partnership, there <em>may</em> be direct pecuniary
                    interest in the outcome of the client’s case since any significant payment
                    of a negligence claim by the professional indemnity insurer will inevitably be
                    visited with higher premium payments in the following years for all solicitors
                    in that limited liability partnership. There can also be an indirect pecuniary
                    loss, depending on the circumstances of the case, where reputational damage is
                    incurred which will affect the limited liability partnership’s ability to
                    attract work. It will all depend on the particular facts of each
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I conclude this issue by contrasting the
                    American Bar Association (“ABA”) Code of Conduct which deals with
                    the advocate-witness rule in a slightly different fashion (“ABA
                    rules”). Similar to r 64 of the LPPCR, the equivalent ABA rule is
                    expressly limited to the advocate-witness in question.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) <b>A lawyer may act as advocate in a trial in which
                            another lawyer in the lawyer's firm is likely to be called as a witness
                            unless precluded from doing so by Rule 1.7 or Rule 1.9</b> [rule
                        on conflicts of interest].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The ABA’s position, which is clear from the commentary to this
                    rule, is that the tribunal has proper objection when the trier of fact may be
                    confused or misled by a lawyer serving both as advocate and witness. The
                    emphasis placed is on the possibility of the tribunal being misled rather than
                    the subconscious shaping of evidence. This focus is rooted in their jury system.
                    Interestingly, r 3.7(a)(2) expressly recognizes that where the testimony
                    concerns the extent and value of legal services rendered in the action in which
                    the testimony is offered, permitting the lawyers to testify avoids the need for
                    a second trial with new counsel to resolve that issue. In such a situation the
                    judge has firsthand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is less
                    dependence on the adversarial process to test the credibility of the testimony.
                    Furthermore, apart from these two exceptions, r 3.7(a)(3) recognizes that a
                    balancing is required between the interests of the client and those of the
                    tribunal and the opposing party. Despite the risk of prejudice to either party
                    or a real risk of the compromise of the evidence given to the court, due regard
                    must be given to the effect of disqualification on the lawyer’s client in
                    determining whether the lawyer should be disqualified. It should be noted that
                    r 3.7(b) expressly allows another lawyer from the testifying lawyer’s
                    firm to continue to act for the client on the basis that the tribunal is not
                    likely to be misled when a lawyer acts as advocate in a trial in which another
                    lawyer in the lawyer’s firm will testify as a necessary witness. The
                    exception is in situations involving a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the facts of this case, I do not see any
                    breach of r 64. In addition to the facts recited above, there is the fact
                    that the amount of work done is something that is readily ascertainable as the
                    main litigation has ended. Whether there was urgency or not, the issues involved
                    and the stakes in the event of success or failure are all matters that can be
                    easily established and weighed. Disbursements incurred, such as the
                    solicitors’ airfare, can also be objectively ascertained. I now turn to
                    whether the allegations are a “material fact in issue” (as

                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Jeyaretnam SC, counsel for the
                    plaintiffs, submits that there is a more fundamental flaw in Mr Tan’s
                    application. He takes the view that the level of fees TKQP charged the
                    plaintiffs is not a material issue because his clients’ claim is for
                    equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty, as distinct from a claim in
                    contract or tort, which effectively amounts to an indemnity. On his submission,
                    the only defence open to such a claim is for the fiduciary to show that the loss
                    would have happened independent of his breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Jeyaretnam SC cites Andrew Ang
                    J’s judgment in <em>Firstlink Energy Pte Ltd v Creanovate
                        Pte Ltd and another action</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1050
                        (“<em>Firstlink Energy v
                    Creanovate</em>”), which in turn cited the earlier CA decision of
                        <em>Kumagai-Zenecon Construction Pte Ltd v Low Hua
                        Kin</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1049 (“<em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>”). Andrew Ang J held that for a
                    breach of fiduciary claim, full restitution and compensation was the entitlement
                    of the wronged party to whom the fiduciary obligation was owed. Further, the
                    principles of causation, foreseeability and remoteness are not readily
                    applicable to a restitutionary claim and the only defence available to the party
                    is to show that the loss would have happened even if there was no breach.
                        <em>John While Springs (S) Pte Ltd and Another v Goh Sai
                        Chuah Justin and others</em> [2004] 3 SLR 596
                        (“<em>John While Springs</em>”), was also
                    cited by Mr Jeyaretnam: there the court held that for the errant fiduciary
                    to avoid making restitution, he must be able to show that the wronged party
                    would have incurred those losses even if there was no breach of duty. The court
                    stated that once liability is proved, the errant fiduciary must compensate the
                    wronged party for such loss as was occasioned by the breach. In the leading
                    English decision on this issue, <em>Target Holdings Ltd v
                        Redferns and another</em> [1996] 1 A.C. 421 (“<em>Target Holdings</em>”), which was followed by the
                    Supreme Court of Queensland in <em>Mantonella P/L v
                        Thompson</em> [2009] QCA 80, the House of Lords held that even if the
                    immediate cause of the loss was the dishonesty or failure of a third party, the
                    trustee would be liable to make good that loss to the trust estate if, but for
                    the breach, such loss would not have occurred. The court took the view that the
                    test of causation was satisfied so long as the loss would not have occurred but
                    for the breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Jeyaretnam SC submits that but
                    for the breach of duties by the defendants, the plaintiffs would not have sought
                    legal advice and representation from TKQP which resulted in the stated loss in
                    the form of their solicitor and client costs payable. Therefore, on these
                    authorities, the reasonableness of TKQP’s bills are irrelevant as a full
                    indemnity is payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I am not sure the law is, with respect, in the
                    black-and-white tones as painted by Mr Jeyaretnam SC’s submission.
                    The very <em>raison d’etre</em> for equity <em>is</em> the need to mitigate the black-and-white rigidity of
                    the law and the need to cater for the many shades of grey thrown up by the
                    myriad diversity of human activity and interaction. I do not think a simplistic
                    “but-for” test fits all cases in assessing the amount of equitable
                    compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     An uncontroversial starting point is Viscount
                    Haldane L.C’s judgment in <em>Nocton v
                        Lord Ashburton</em> [1914] AC 932 in which he confirmed
                    that in its exercise of its exclusive equitable jurisdiction over fiduciaries,
                    the court had the jurisdiction to make an award of equitable compensation for a
                    breach of fiduciary duty. Echoing a similar view, in the Australian decision of
                        <em>Markwell Bros Pty Ltd v CPN Diesels </em><em>Pty Ltd</em> (1982) 7 ACLR at 437, Thomas J
                    opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he origin of the power to award equitable compensation ... is part of
                        the long established power of a court of equity to award compensation for
                        breach of trust, and a manifestation of the court’s power over a
                        fiduciary</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nevertheless, while the remedy the plaintiffs seek is uncontroversial
                    and settled law, the extent of the compensation is another matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As noted above, in <em>Firstlink Energy v Creanovate</em>, Andrew Ang J, citing
                        <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>, took the view that any loss
                    that was caused by the breach of fiduciary duty alleged was claimable as
                    equitable compensation so long as it <em>would not have been
                        caused but for the alleged breach</em>. The following principles,
                    taken from <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>, were articulated in
                    support:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    If a breach of fiduciary obligation has been
                            committed then the fiduciary is liable to make restitution – that
                            is restore the wronged person in the same position as he would have been
                            if no breach had been committed. <b><em>Consideration of
                                causation, foreseeability and remoteness do not readily enter into
                                the matter.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  The test of liability is whether the loss would
                            have been [suffered] if there had been no breach. In other words, the
                            fiduciary can escape liability only if he can demonstrate that the loss
                            or suffering would have happened even if there [had] been no
                            breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  The right to restitution and compensation of a
                            beneficiary or sufferer which the Court of Equity [has] imposed on an
                            errant fiduciary is more of an absolute nature than the common law
                            obligation to pay damages for tort or breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv)  The <em>beneficiary or sufferer
                                under the concept of restitution or equitable compensation is
                                entitled to a full indemnity</em> and equity will award such
                            interest as may be necessary to create full restitution and
                            compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In stating the principles above, G P
                    Selvam J in <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em> relied heavily on
                        <em>Re Dawson (deceased</em>) [1966]
                    2 NSWR 211 at 216 (“<em>Re
                        Dawson</em>”) where Street J gave the following reasons in
                    support of distinguishing damages claimed in a breach of fiduciary action from
                    one in contract or tort:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Moreover the distinction between common law damages and relief against a
                        defaulting trustee is strikingly demonstrated by reference to the actual
                        form of relief granted in equity in respect of breaches of trust. The form
                        of relief is couched in terms appropriate to require the defaulting trustee
                        to restore to the estate the assets of which he deprived it. Increases in
                        market values between the date of breach and the date of recoupment are for
                        the trustee’s account: the effect of such increases would, at common
                        law, be excluded from the computation of damages; but in equity, a
                        defaulting trustee must make good the loss by restoring to the estate the
                        assets of which he deprived it notwithstanding that market values may have
                        increased in the meantime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     These cases do not directly answer the
                    question: even though the loss flowed from the breach of fiduciary duty, which
                    satisfies the “but-for” test, what happens where there is also
                    third party conduct which has caused a large increase in the loss claimed, or
                    contributory responsibility, (I prefer not to use the term contributory
                    negligence as that connotes different rules of causation at law), or
                    unreasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff which has the same effect of
                    increasing the loss suffered? Should the court ignore the reasonableness of the
                    solicitor’s bills in determining the extent of equitable compensation
                    awarded? What did the Court in <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>
                    really mean in saying that “[c]onsideration of causation, foreseeability
                    and remoteness do not readily enter into the matter”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Cases from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and
                    the United Kingdom suggest that the application and construction of principles
                    of causation in a claim for equitable compensation is by no means uniform or
                    settled as one would think at first blush.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The high water mark was the Privy Council
                    decision of <em>Brickenden v London Loan and Savings Co. et
                        al.</em> [1934] 2 D.L.R 465 at 499 (“<em>Brickenden</em> rule”), where Lord Thankerton took a very
                    strict view in relation to the applicable rules of causation in relation to the
                    loss claimable as a result of the breach of fiduciary duties owed by a solicitor
                    to his client in failing to disclose a material fact and to reveal a conflict of
                    interest in relation to the transaction in issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a party, holding a fiduciary relationship, commits a breach of his
                        duty by non-disclosure of material facts, which his constituent is entitled
                        to know in connection with the transaction, he cannot be heard to maintain
                        that disclosure would not have altered the decision to proceed with the
                        transaction, because the constituent’s action would be solely
                        determined by some other factor, such as the valuation by another party of
                        the property proposed to be mortgaged. Once the Court has determined that
                        the non-disclosed facts were material, speculation as to what course the
                        constituent, on disclosure would have taken is not relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As noted by Peter Birks and Francis Rose in <em>Restitution and Equity Volume One: Resulting Trusts and Equitable
                        Compensation</em> (Mansfield Press, 2000) at 239 (“Birks
                    on Equitable Compensation”), commenting on the <em>Brickenden</em> rule: “This somewhat vague and punitive rule,
                    ascribing full liability to merely material causes, has attracted a degree of
                    comment and criticism.” In response to the criticism spoken of,
                    subsequent decisions all over the Commonwealth interpreting the <em>Brickenden</em> rule softened its contours.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>Maguire v
                        Makaronis</em> (1997) 188 CLR 490, 490-492
                        (“<em>Maguire v Makaronis</em>”),
                    Kirby J stated courts in the Commonwealth had developed three approaches to
                    “mollify the absoluteness of the <em>Brickenden</em>
                    rule”:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first was to reverse the onus of
                        proof such that once a fiduciary breach is established the fiduciary must
                        prove that adverse results were not liable consequences of the breach. This
                        approach was considered by the High Court decision of <em>John While Springs</em> where Choo J held that the burden
                        was on the claiming party to prove that they had suffered losses and that
                        these losses were caused by or linked to the defendants’ breaches of
                        fiduciary duties. The burden then shifted to the fiduciary to show that the
                        claiming party would have incurred those losses even if there had been no
                        breach by the fiduciary (“the modified <em>Brickenden</em> rule”). This position has also been
                        adopted by the United Kingdom in the leading decision of <em>Target Holdings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second was to apply the “but-for”
                        causal test which was adopted by our Courts in <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em> in adopting the line taken by Street J
                        in <em>Re-Dawson</em> instead of the “material
                        cause” test as articulated in the <em>Brickenden</em> rule. “[T]he inquiry in each instance
                        would appear to be whether the loss would have happened if there had been no
                        breach” (see <em>Maguire v Makaronis
                            at 4</em>91).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third was to confine the stringent “material
                        cause” or “but-for” tests to cases of fiduciary breach
                        involving actual dishonesty or conscious wrongdoing. The court stated that
                        this distinction was founded upon a suggested difference between "breaches
                        of fiduciary obligations" and "honest but careless dealings". This approach
                        has found some approval in the decision of <em>Bristol and
                            West Building Society v Mothew</em> [1996]
                        4 All ER 698 at 710 – 713.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As helpfully summarised by Birks on Equitable
                    Compensation at 244:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The “but for” causal test promoted in Canada, New Zealand
                        and Australia thus amounts to a policy decision: that breach of fiduciary
                        obligations ought to be treated with especial severity in order to pursue a
                        policy of deterrence, that is the prophylactic defence of guarded
                        relationships. The chief difference seems to be that Canadian and New
                        Zealand Courts have developed causation rules and defences, akin to those
                        applied to common law obligations, in order to control the reach and extent
                        of equitable compensation. By contrast, the Australian authorities, so far
                        as they have decided, eschew use of contributory negligence, <em>novus actus</em>, and other apportionment defences, and
                        rely instead on manipulation of the but-for test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The courts all over the Commonwealth have developed nuanced approaches
                    in order to cope with harsh consequences or unjust results of a strict
                    application of the modified <em>Brickenden</em> rule. One
                    must keep in mind that in exercising its equitable jurisdiction, the courts have
                    never taken a formulaic or rigid approach as suggested by the plaintiffs. For
                    example, in <em>Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton &amp;
                        Co</em> (1991) 85 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 129
                        (“<em>Canson Enterprises</em>”), in the
                    Supreme Court of Canada, McLachlin J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Compensation is an equitable monetary remedy which... attempts to restore
                        to the plaintiff what has been lost as a result of the breach, ie, the
                        plaintiff’s lost opportunity... Foreseeability is not a concern in
                        assessing compensation, but it is essential that the losses made good are
                        only those which, on a common sense view of causation, were caused by the
                        breach. <em>The plaintiff will not be required to mitigate
                            ... but losses resulting from clearly unreasonable behaviour on the part
                            of the plaintiff will be adjudged to flow from that behaviour and not
                            from the breach.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly in <em>Maguire v Makaronis</em>, the
                    High Court of Australia took the following view at 496:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of equity’s relief is not punishment. So far as
                        possible, it is to restore the status quo ante. For this reason, the
                        remedies will be fashioned according to the exigencies of the particular
                        case so as to do what is “practically just” as between the
                        parties. <em>The fiduciary must not be
                            “robbed”; nor must the beneficiary be unjustly
                            enriched</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Another layer affecting the application of the
                    principles of causation or the relevance of intervening or concurrent causes
                    relates to the nature and context of fiduciary duty owed. As helpfully
                    summarised by Malcolm Cope in <em>Equitable Obligations: Duties,
                        Defences and Remedies</em> (Lawbook Co, 2007) at 337, in
                    discussing the relevant Australian jurisprudence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has also been accepted by some judges that one uniform approach may not
                        be applicable to all circumstances involving a breach of fiduciary duty.
                        This would enable a variety of approaches to be adopted in relation to
                        causation in equity depending upon the particular purpose of the rule that
                        is being applied. It has therefore been suggested that various tests may
                        apply. In the case of a traditional trust, the trustee may be responsible
                        for any loss to the trust property even if there is an intervening or
                        concurrent cause. This test would be confined to a non-commercial trust
                        whereas a narrower “but-for” test would apply where the breach
                        merely facilitates the actual loss which occurs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I have no doubt that the decisions of
                        <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em> and <em>Firstlink Energy</em> were correct on their facts. It lies ill in the
                    mouth of a company director who flagrantly breaches his fiduciary duties for
                    personal gain to say that the damage suffered by the wronged party should be
                    reduced because of principles of law relating to causation or remoteness or that
                    the innocent party was contributorily responsible. In <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>, the CA gave short shrift to the attempts by the
                    fiduciary director to argue that the action by provisional liquidators in
                    selling off certain shares en bloc inflated the loss as they should have sold
                    off only that amount of shares necessary to pay the bank. The CA held that the
                    action of the provisional liquidators was reasonable in the circumstances then
                    prevailing and a subsequent rise in the market was unforeseen and unforeseeable.
                    The CA also said that bad faith or unreasonableness was not established even
                    though the provisional liquidator had not made inquiries with stockbrokers or
                    investment bankers before effecting the en bloc sale of the shares. The CA was
                    clearly not prepared to place too heavy a burden on the actions of the party who
                    was wronged or its provisional liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     But there are situations like <em>Canson Enterprises</em>, where application of the <em>Brickenden</em> rule would cause an unjust result. The facts
                    of <em>Canson Enterprises</em> were as follows. A purchased
                    land for development. Unknown to A, who thought it was purchasing the land from
                    an original vendor, the seller was an intermediary who had purchased the land
                    from the original vendor and on-sold the land to A at a substantially higher sum
                    than what it paid for the land. A’s solicitor, who acted for A and the
                    intermediary, failed to disclose this fact to A. A proceeded to develop the land
                    and suffered substantial losses when the piles supporting the constructed
                    warehouse began to sink. A sued the soils engineer and the pile-driving company,
                    but was left with a substantial shortfall as these tortfeasors were unable to
                    pay the full loss and damage. A then sued its solicitors for the shortfall. It
                    was agreed that A would not have entered into the contract had it known that the
                    vendor was an intermediate buyer-seller. The trial judge found the solicitor
                    liable for breach of fiduciary duty but held that the purchasers were entitled
                    to direct damages of the secret profit, as well as consequential damages of the
                    expenses incurred on the warehouse project prior to the wrongful acts of the
                    engineers and pile-drivers. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal holding
                    that the shortfall was not recoverable because such damages did not flow from
                    the breach of the fiduciary obligation but were the unrelated fault of the
                    engineers and pile-drivers. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed A’s
                    appeal. The loss and damage which arose from actions of the third party
                    engineers and pile-drivers could not be said to flow from the breach of the
                    fiduciary obligation. (See the judgment of McLachlin J quoted above
                        at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>). This has been
                    characterised as the ‘restorative remedial approach’ by Malcolm Cope
                    in his work cited above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In <em>Swindle v
                        Harrison</em> [1997] 4 All ER 705, the English Court of
                    Appeal stated that the restitutionary obligation imposed on those who owed
                    fiduciary duties is more stringent than the common law obligations to pay
                    damages for breach of contract or negligence and although foreseeability and
                    remoteness of damages are not relevant, it was still necessary to show that the
                    loss suffered has been caused by the relevant breach of the fiduciary
                    duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     
          <em>Kumagai Zenecon</em>
                    and <em>Firstlink Energy</em> are correct on their facts
                    and generally, but they do not lay down an absolute rule that all loss and
                    damage, no matter how it is caused, lie at the doorstep of a party in breach of
                    its fiduciary obligations. In the latter case, this is what Andrew Ang J
                    meant when he said that causation, foreseeability and remoteness “...do
                    not <em>readily</em> enter into the matter...”
                    (emphasis added). There may be circumstances, as in <em>Canson
                        Enterprises</em> where there are limits to the applicability of such
                    an absolute rule. It is best not to lay down any hard and fast rules. There are
                    a significant number of cases on equitable compensation in the other common law
                    jurisdictions from which guidance can be obtained. Strict rules and rigid
                    criteria are not the inherent nature of equity nor should it be for equitable
                    compensation which is but a part of the whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I say no more as this application is at an
                    interlocutory stage. At this juncture, the principles referred to above are
                    sufficient to dispose of this interlocutory application. None of these
                    interesting points on remoteness, foreseeability or causation arise on the facts
                    as they now stand before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 5: The evidence before the Court relating to the
                invoices</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Finally I now turn to the test that must be
                    satisfied by the evidence. In <em>Alrich Development</em>,
                    Chao Hick Tin J, as he then was, cited <em>Rakusen v Ellis,
                        Munday and Clarke</em> [1912] 1 CH 831 with approval and
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion the public interest in the administration of justice is
                        sufficiently safeguarded on the test of ‘reasonable anticipation of
                        mischief’ or in other words ‘reasonable likelihood of
                        mischief’. One should look at the real situation in its totality and
                        not just the form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The current English position as stated in <em>In Re a
                        Firm of Solicitors</em> is also to consider whether a reasonable man
                    informed of the facts might reasonably anticipate such danger. In <em>Dana-West Hotels Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada</em> (1984) 37
                    SASK R. 81, an application by defendant to restrain counsel for acting for
                    plaintiff was dismissed as the court was not satisfied that the mischief would
                    probably result if counsel was allowed to continue to represent his client. On
                    the facts of this case the testimony of a partner was important to establish
                    what transpired in the agreement between parties which the plaintiff was seeking
                    to set aside by reason of duress. Arguably the facts of that case reached a far
                    higher threshold than the case before me but the court still did not allow the
                    injunction application. The court recognised that an order to restrain counsel
                    was rarely made and most decisions stopped short of enforcing criticism of
                    counsel acting at trials where associates are witnesses (at [12]). On a similar cautionary note, in
                        <em>In re A Solicitor</em> (1987) 131 S J 1063
                    Hoffman J, as he then was, said that the threshold required to be met to
                    restrain counsel from continuing to act was intentionally high as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is not desirable that the right of a client to have the services of
                        the solicitor of his choice should be unnecessarily restricted. It is not
                        desirable that the litigation, or as in this case the proceedings... should
                        be delayed because of a compulsory change of solicitors on grounds which do
                        not involve any real possibility of injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In <em>Emperor v Dadu Rama
                        Surde</em> AIR 1939 BOM 150 the court found that the
                    inherent jurisdiction of the court should be invoked in a r 64 scenario
                        <b><em>only</em></b> when the party applying for solicitor to
                    be discharged establishes that the trial will be materially embarrassed if the
                    advocate continued to appear. Similarly, the court in <em>Pearnbran Pty Ltd v Win Mezz</em> (QLD SC unreported) found that
                    the mere circumstance that a solicitor was to be a material witness, even on a
                    controversial matter, in of itself did not justify restraining a solicitor from
                    continuing to act (at [24]). The
                    line was crossed only when the solicitor had a personal stake in the outcome of
                    the proceedings or their conduct, beyond the recovery of proper fees for acting.
                    The court noted that the relevant stake may not necessarily be financial but
                    could involve the personal or reputational interest of the solicitor. It is this
                    concern that forms the nub of this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For the reasons set out above, especially
                        at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>, <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> and <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>, I do not see
                    the need for the court to intervene and the mischief rr. 25 and 64 are designed
                    to avoid is absent on the facts and circumstances of this case. I therefore
                    dismissed Mr Tan’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 6: Costs</p>
