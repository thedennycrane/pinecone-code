</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        By a time charterparty

dated 8 January 1998, Admiral Chartering Ltd ("Admiral"), a Liberian

incorporated company, chartered the "RAINBOW SPRING" on an amended New York

Produce Exchange Form. The present dispute stems from a May 2002 voyage charter whereby

Admiral as disponent owner sub-chartered the "RAINBOW SPRING" to International

Coffee and Fertilizer Trading Co ("INCOFE"). A consignment of crystalline

potassium nitrate shipped on board the "RAINBOW SPRING" in June 2000 at

Tocopilla, Chile for carriage to and delivery at Puerto Caldera, Costa Rica and Puerto

Quetzal, Guatemala had sustained wet damage. INCOFE consequently commenced arbitration in

New York against Admiral for damages. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        On 31 October 2001,

Admiral as Plaintiff commenced an action in rem against the vessel "RAINBOW

SPRING". The Plaintiff’s claim is for damages for breach of time charterparty

and/or for an indemnity against all losses should Admiral be found liable to INCOFE for

wet damage to its cargo. The writ was served on "RAINBOW SPRING" and she was at

the same time arrested in Singapore on 31 December 2001. Security was provided by West of

England Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association (Luxembourg) as P&amp;I Club on behalf of

its member, Rainbow Spring Shipping Limited Inc ("RSSL"), a Panamanian company.

The vessel was released on 3 January 2002.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        The Plaintiff’s case

is that the time charter of the "RAINBOW SPRING" was from the outset made with

RSSL as registered owner. The Plaintiff is entitled to proceed by way of an action in rem

against the vessel because RSSL is the person who would be liable on the claim in an

action in personam, and because RSSL is the owner of the vessel, both when the cause of

action arose and when the action is brought. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        RSSL as Defendant entered

an appearance and on 14 January 2002 applied to set aside the writ of summons and warrant

of arrest. RSSL’s contention is that the in personam requirement of s4(4) of the High

Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (cap 123) is not satisfied. RSSL was not a party to the

time charter of the "RAINBOW SPRING". The contracting parties were the Plaintiff

and Oriental Shipway Inc ("Oriental"). An alternative ground put forward to set

aside the warrant of arrest is non-disclosure of material facts. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The Assistant Registrar,

who heard the application on 25 March 2002, declined to set aside the in rem writ.

However, the warrant of arrest was set aside on the ground of non-disclosure of material

facts. The Assistant Registrar also ordered damages for wrongful arrest to be assessed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        Both parties appealed

against her decision. Further affidavits were filed after the hearing before the Assistant

Registrar. All in all, a total of 13 affidavits were filed before and at the appeal stage.

Within the affidavits the opposing contentions of the parties are found. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Defendant’s Appeal</p></b><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i)    The jurisdictional issue - In personam test in

s4(4) of the Act</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        It is common ground that

the claim falls within s3(1)(h) of the Act. It is also common ground that the court only

has jurisdiction to entertain an action in rem if the Plaintiff satisfies s4(4) of the

Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        It is not in dispute that

the burden is on the Plaintiff to establish that RSSL is the likely person to be liable in

personam on the claim. As to the standard of proof, Selvam JC (as he then was) in The<i>

"Opal 3"</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=5559&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 585</a> stated that in applying the in personam test in

s4(4) of the Act, all that is needed is an arguable case. See The<i> "St

Elefterio"</i> [1957] 1 Lloyd’s Law Rep 283 and The<i> "Wigwam" </i>[1982-1983]

SLR 188. Justice Chua’s decision in The<i> "Wigwam"</i> was affirmed by the

Court of Appeal. (See unreported decision dated 14 September 1984 in Civil Appeal no. 89

of 1982). Admiral has only to show that it has an arguable case, even though it may have a

difficult case in fact or law. If the Plaintiff discharges the burden, the action would

proceed to trial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        The sole question, which I

have to consider, is whether it is arguable that RSSL would be liable in personam. If the

plaintiff’s case on jurisdiction is plainly unarguable in that it is bound to fail,

the in rem writ would be set aside. The present case is no different from the rest where

the substance of the underlying claim is factually inseparable from the basis of

jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        Counsel for the

Defendant, Mr. Toh Kian Sing, urged the court to adopt the robust approach taken in The <i>"AA

V"</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=60141&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 1 SLR 207</a> where 15 affidavits were filed. Judith Prakash J said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"….if the evidence before me convincingly established that

    the defendants were not party to those contracts then I would have to hold at this early

    stage that the admiralty jurisdiction of the court had not been properly invoked." <font size="3">[p218]</font> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        On the first page of the

charterparty, Oriental is named as ‘Owners" of the "RAINBOW SPRING".

The "owning company" is stated to be Oriental in the Description Clause (Clause

74) which incorporated Charterer’s completed Questionnaire. On page 3, there is a

company stamp of RSSL where Tam Kwong Lim("Tam"), who is president and director

of RSSL, had signed the document on behalf of RSSL. The signature of Tam as RSSL

representative/director viewed in isolation is unqualified. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        Counsel for the

Plaintiff, Ms Magdalene Chew, advances the proposition that a party who signs a contract

in his own name is deemed to have contracted personally unless it is clear he executed it

as agent only. The general principle is set out in <i>Scrutton on Charterparties</i> (20<sup>th</sup>

Edition) Art 19 p45: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Where a person signs the charter in his own name without

    qualification, he is prima facie deemed to contract personally and, in order to prevent

    this liability from attaching, it must be clear from the other portions of the

    charterparty that he did not intend to contract personally." </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Counsel further submits

that if nonetheless there is ambiguity on the face of the charterparty as to identity of

the contracting party, extrinsic evidence is admissible as an aid in identifying the

contracting party: <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (28<sup>th</sup> ed) Vol. 1 12-120. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        Ms Chew said that on

construing the entire document, RSSL was clearly the contracting party. Ms Chew referred

me to some of the clauses in the charterparty. For example, Clause 72 which provides: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Owners to have the option to sell the vessel together with

    charterparty subject to Charterer’s approval of new ownership, which should not be

    unreasonably withheld." </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Defendant is the only party who would have the right to

"sell" the vessel. Therefore, the word "Owners" in Clause 72 is

clearly referable to the Defendant as registered owner of the vessel and not Oriental.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        Clause 40 states that

West of England is "Owners’ P&amp;I Club". Again the word

"Owners" there is referable to RSSL. During negotiations for the charter, West

of England had at the behest of RSSL commented on the terms of the charter. West of

England also handled the off-hire dispute and dispute over prices of bunkers applicable at

time of redelivery. Furthermore, West of England communicated with the Plaintiff on these

disputes as if the charter was with RSSL. West of England only disclosed that Oriental was

not its member at the setting aside stage. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        There are some documents

emanating from the Defendant which showed the time charterparty dated 8 January 1998 to be

between Admiral and RSSL. For example, the Notice of Assignment of earnings dated 29 April

1999 was addressed to Admiral and signed by Tam for RSSL. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        Woo Man Fong

("Woo"), the general manager of the Defendant, asserts in his affidavit that the

Defendant’s rubber stamp on the charterparty was due to a clerical mistake. Kingstar

Shipping Ltd ("Kingstar"), the vessel’s agent, kept the Defendant’s

rubber stamp in its office and the wrong stamp was used.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        Woo also asserts that the

Plaintiff was fully aware at the time of the arrest that the contracting party was

Oriental. He cites in support the Plaintiff’s voyage instruction to the master dated

22 April 1998 where Oriental was expressly referred to as head owner and Admiral as time

charterer. The Notice of Assignment of earnings dated 8 February 1998 named Oriental as

the contracting party. Ms Chew had earlier drawn my attention to a contrary position

appearing in the Notice of Assignment of earnings dated 29 April 1999. The Defendant also

referred to the Protocol of Delivery to evidence delivery of the vessel by Oriental to

Admiral. However, that document is unreliable in that not only is it incomplete as the

blank spaces were not filled in but the document alludes to a bareboat charterparty dated

25 November 1997 between Admiral and Oriental. Further, the Protocol of Delivery was not

signed by Admiral. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        The inconsistencies in

documents are dismissed as clerical mistakes by the Defendant. As for West of England

pursuing a claim ostensibly on behalf of RSSL, the explanation put forward by Fiona

Caldwell McCoig on behalf of West of England is that she was assisting the manager, Hang

Woo Ship Management Ltd, who is also a member.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        In addition, it is said

that Admiral’s P&amp;I Club, Assuranceforeningen SKULD (Gjensidig) Den Danske

Afdeling ("Skuld"), and American lawyers M/s Lambos &amp; Junge have in

correspondence acknowledged and treated Oriental as the contracting party. Furthermore, on

11 October 2001 Skuld appointed John Schofield as arbitrator in respect of the dispute

under the charter between Admiral and Oriental. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        I have in the foregoing

paragraphs mentioned the main points in the case on either side. Fortuitously for the

Defendant, in the present case the jurisdictional fact in dispute could be decided despite

these apparent conflicting evidence, arguments and counter arguments. Of decisive

importance is whether I accept the contrary view of the Defendant that the fixture was

concluded by exchanges of correspondence before the formal charter was drawn up and

signed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        Negotiations for the

charter took place over two months. The faxes/telexes culminating in the fixture were

exchanged between Plaintiff’s brokers, Rodskog Shipbrokers Limited

("Rodskog") and the vessel’s agent, Kingstar. By a fax dated 8 January

1998, Kingstar informed Rodskog that the contracting party in the charterparty was to be

"Oriental Shipway Inc". In that fax, Kingstar stated: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<font size="2">PLS NOTE OWRS ON C/P SHALL BE "ORIENTAL

    SHIPWAY INC</font>."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        On 9 January 1998,

Rodskog replied and confirmed by telex the final terms as acceptable to charterers:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<font size="2">VERY PLEASED WE ARE NOW CLEAN FIXED</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font size="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">CHARTERERS LOOKING FORWARD TO A PLEASANT COOPERATION WITH OWNERS AND

    VESSEL</p>
<p align="justify">WE HAVE NOTED OWNERS STYLE FOR C/P BEING "ORIENTAL SHIPWAY

    INC" (WHERE REGISTERED PSE) BUT PLEASE FULL STYLE/ADDRESS OF MANAGERS TO WHOM HIRE

    STATEMENTS ETC SHALL BE MAILED…"</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        The phrase used to

conclude the contract was <font size="2">"VERY PLEASED WE ARE NOW CLEAN FIXED"</font>.

The expression "clean fixed" in chartering parlance is used to signify a binding

charterparty contract or concluded fixture. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        The unchallenged evidence

shows: Oriental was named as contracting party and agreed by the Plaintiff. I am satisfied

that there was no contract between the Defendant and Plaintiff. It is plain that the

Plaintiff’s case is unarguable and the writ of summons is therefore set aside.

Consequently, the arrest is set aside on this ground and not on the ground of

non-disclosure. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        Having answered the main

issue in favour of the Defendant, it is unnecessary to deal with the bareboat charter

point raised at the hearing of this appeal. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Plaintiff’s Appeal </p></b><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i)    Non-disclosure of material facts </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        Counsel for the Defendant

submits that the Assistant Registrar was right and the arrest should be set aside because

the arrest was procured as a result of non-disclosure of material facts. The disclosure of

the charterparty itself was grossly inadequate to present to the court the true picture.

He contends that all or some correspondence and documents which show that the charterparty

was between Admiral and Oriental should have been disclosed. In particular, the fax dated

8 January 1998 from Kingstar to Rodskog (pp 18 to 19 of Woo’s 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit); telex dated 9 January 1998 from Admiral to RSSL (p 34 of Woo’s 1<sup>st</sup>

affidavit); fax dated 13 January 1998 (p 20 of Woo’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit); telex

dated 16 January 1998 from Kingstar to Rodskog (p 35 of Woo’s 1<sup>st</sup>

affidavit); Notices of Assignment dated 2 February 1998 (pp 50, 51 and 53 of Woo’s 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit); Sailing instructions from Seaside Navigation (pp 43 and 45 of Woo’s 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit); Skuld’s fax dated 16 May 2001 (p 55 of Rasmussen’s 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit) and Skuld’s fax of 31 May 2001 (pp 36 and 38 of Woo’s 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit). </p>
<p xmlns="">28.        Counsel for the Plaintiff contends on the

authority of The<i> "Varna"</i> [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 253 that there is no

duty to disclose the documents. In that case, the English Court of Appeal held that O75 r

5(1) of the English Rules of the Supreme Court expressly bestowed the power to issue a

warrant of arrest on the plaintiff thereby effectively removing the discretion vested in

the court as to whether or not to issue a warrant of arrest. According to Ms Chew, Order

70 r 4(1) of our Rules of Court was amended in 1997 and is in line with the English

position. The<i> "Damavand" </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7316&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 2 SLR 717</a> was a decision before 1997. And

in The<i> "AA V"</i>, the court’s attention was not drawn to the changes to

the Rules of Court and decision of The<i> "Varna"</i>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        The decision of The<i>

"Varna"</i> turned largely on amendments made to the Order 75 r 5(1) of the

English Rules of Supreme Court. With the amendments, the Praecipe for Warrant of Arrest

was revoked by RSC (Amendment No.2) 1981 (S.I. 1981 No. 1734). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        Even though the language

of our Order 70 r 4 (1) is similar to Order 75 r5(1) of the English Rules, the phrase

"the plaintiff may issue a warrant in Form 156" in Order 70 r 4 (1) when read in

conjunction with Form 156 and r 4(2)(a) does not confer a power on the plaintiff to issue

the warrant of arrest. It is the court that issues the warrant of arrest (Form 156)

following the filing of a Praecipe for Warrant of Arrest (see Order 70 r 4(2)(a)). A

sensible reading of Order 70 r (4)(1) is that it is only after the writ is issued that the

plaintiff may initiate issuance of a warrant of arrest. By Order 70 r 4(3), the warrant of

arrest will not be issued unless there is an affidavit complying with the particulars

required by r 4 (6) and (7). Order 70 r 4(3) provides that even if there is non-compliance

with r 4(6) and (7), the court may in its discretion issue the warrant. Conversely, a

failure to comply with the rules could render the warrant of arrest a nullity as

Kulesekaram J so held in The<i> "Courageous Colocotronis"</i> [1978-1979] SLR 337. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        In Singapore, the issue

of a warrant of arrest is a discretionary remedy and, as on any ex-parte application for a

discretionary remedy, full disclosure of material facts is required. The requirement that

there be full and frank disclosure of material fact on an application for arrest is

clearly established.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        Although I have ruled in

favour of the Defendant on the jurisdictional issue, for the reasons below, I am of the

view that there is no material non-disclosure. The materiality of the non-disclosure

complained about is neither premised nor dependent on the success of the Defendant’s

contention that the charter was concluded by exchanges of correspondence. Even if I have

found that there has been material non-disclosure, I have a discretion to uphold the

warrant of arrest: <i>The Fierbinti</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8803&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 3 SLR 864</a> at 879. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        The Defendant’s

position is that a binding fixture was made before the formal charter was drawn up and

signed. If a contract is to be found from the correspondence the whole of that which

passed between the parties must be taken into consideration. See <i>Hussey v Horne-Payne</i>

(1874) 4 App. Cas. 311. In the present case, the Plaintiff sued on the charterparty having

taken the view that the signed charter constituted the binding contract. Given the

Plaintiff’s case as put forward and without reference to the further point whether it

is likely to succeed or not, it was not unreasonable for Admiral to have excluded the

pre-fixture documents because of the parol evidence rule. To that extent, the Plaintiff

could not be criticised for making no disclosure of pre-fixture correspondence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        The charterparty was

indeed the working document for the parties over the 4-year relationship. I also have

regard to the passage of time since its formation in 1998 and the conduct of the parties

in the context of this charter in the ensuing years. RSSL was set up to own the vessel and

Oriental to operate the vessel. Tam is a director of RSSL. Mr. Tam is also a director and

shareholder of Oriental and Kingstar. It is not the Plaintiff’s case that the

corporate arrangement was a sham or faade or that Oriental was RSSL’s nominee. But

Ms Chew in her submissions said that the Plaintiff throughout the period of charter dealt

with Tam. Also over the 4-year relationship, the Defendant’s slipshod documentation

has created confusion. The situation was further compounded and complicated by the

involvement of West of England as explained. It is clear that in the present case there

are extenuating circumstances. Against this background and context, there is Peter

Rasmussen who particularly deposed in 6 of his affidavit in support of the arrest that

Admiral’s solicitors (not the American lawyers) had advised that it has a good claim

against the Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        For these reasons, I do

not consider a case has been made out to justify setting aside of the arrest on the ground

of non-disclosure of material facts. Accordingly, Counsel for Defendant’s submission

must fail. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        I note that the Assistant

Registrar in this case, set aside the warrant of arrest but not the in rem writ.

Ordinarily, where the very existence of jurisdiction cannot be challenged or survives an

attack in that the jurisdiction requirements of the Act are satisfied and the writ not set

aside and, there being at the same time no complaint that rules 4(6) and (7) have not been

complied with, non-disclosure should seldom be the sole ground for setting aside the

warrant of arrest. In such a situation, assuming that the matters in question are material

and ought to have been disclosed, the court in exercise of its discretion ought not to set

aside the warrant of arrest purely on the basis that the claimant had failed to disclose

matters in obtaining the warrant of arrest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.        I would in passing

mention Ms Chew’s contention that the affidavit leading the warrant of arrest need

only specify the matters set out in Order 70 r 4(6) and (7). Whilst this is often the case

with most arrest affidavits, the obligation under Order 70 r 4(6) and (7) is not so

narrow. Depending on the circumstances, a mere statement in purported compliance with

Order 70 r 4(6) and (7) may not be enough. It is incumbent on the deponent of the

affidavit to make sure that he has a basis or reasonable ground for his statement of

belief as to the statutory requirements and where necessary to support the statement made

in his affidavit. As Clarke J in The "<i>Tjaskemolen"</i> [1997] 2 Lloyd’s

Rep 465 said, and I completely agree with his remark, that how much detail is required in

the affidavit will depend upon the facts of a particular case. After all, the aim of the

requirements of r 4(6) and r 4(7) is twofold: (i) to enable the court to assess whether,

on the facts of the particular case, it has in rem jurisdiction under the Act; and (ii) to

enable the defendant or prospective defendant, or other persons interested in the vessel,

to identify the basis upon which and the claim in respect of which the property has been

arrested: The "<i>Tjaskemolen"</i> at p468. See also The<i> "Lloyd

Pacifico"</i> [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 54 at p55; The<i> "Courageous

Colocotronis"</i> [1978-1979] SLR 337.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Wrongful Arrest</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        For the same reasons

explained earlier in this decision, it could not be said that the arrest of the vessel was

so obviously groundless as to amount to mala fides or crassa negligentia implying malice.

A weak case for a plaintiff is not gross negligence: The<i> "Euroexpress" </i>[1988] SLR 67. Of significance is the fact that Admiral pursued the arrest on the back of

positive legal advice. Bokhary JA in The<i> "Muale"</i> [1995] 2HKC 769 at 774

observed that whilst he was not prepared to go so far as to say that the fact that the

plaintiff proceeded under legal advice is invariable a good answer to a claim for wrongful

arrest, he said that such advice is at least a relevant factor to be taken into

consideration. The Defendant has thus failed to establish mala fides or crassa negligentia

in this case. Accordingly, the decision of the Assistant Registrar on wrongful arrest is

reversed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        It follows from the

setting aside of the in rem writ and warrant of arrest that the security provided by West

of England is to be returned to the Defendant for cancellation. The Plaintiff is to pay

the Defendant the costs of the appeal fixed at $10,000. I have in fixing the quantum of

costs taken into account the outcome of the Plaintiff’s appeal.</p>
