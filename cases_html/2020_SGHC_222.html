At such time as the Production Requirements have been consistently met, to the reasonable satisfaction of HIL and Simplot India, the balance of the Holdback Amount, if any, shall be released to HIL out of Escrow.

It is common ground between the Parties that this includes an element of producing a quality product of the required volume. The Production Requirements are set out specifically, and also not in dispute. Indeed, the Respondent maintained throughout this case that the PPE was capable of meeting the Production Requirements as stated. The Tribunal refers to “Fitness for Purpose” as a convenient shorthand for the PPE being able consistently to produce a volume of quality commercially saleable product at the level of the Production Requirements.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">616. <span class="font-weight-bold">Product Quality</span>: The Parties agree that reasonable product quality is an important aspect of fitness for purpose and meeting the Production Requirements. Mr Matters refers to the evidence of customer complaints, and concludes that these complaints evidence defects with the PPE itself. In his view, these quality issues would have been exacerbated had the Main Line been operating at higher capacities. The Claimants also rely on the evidence of Mr Tandon. The issues can be summarised as follows: The Fries were slightly black in colour or discoloured, of poor taste, broken, took too long to fry, were uneven in size and cut, were not crunchy, or were dull after frying.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">628. <span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on the PPE</span>: The Tribunal finds that the PPE was not Fit for Purpose. This applies in particular to the Fryer and the Dryer, but also to a number of other components. The frequent extensive downtimes and customer quality complaints reinforce this conclusion. The Tribunal finds that the work needed to bring the PPE up to Fitness for Purpose would cost very substantially more than the Holdback Amount. The fact that the PPE is to be measured with a latitude of some USD 500,000.00 of further improvements does not, therefore, assist the Respondent.

</div> [emphasis added]. Nothing in that suggests that a finding on whether the PPE could meet the Production Requirements would be dependent on whether quality fries could be produced. Rather, there were two distinct obligations on HIL – the PPE had to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) meet the Production Requirements; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) produce quality fries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As the tribunal put it at para 563 of the Award (quoted above at [11]), the PPE had to be able “consistently to produce a volume of quality commercially saleable product at the level of the Production Requirements”. It is clear from the Award that the tribunal’s finding on breach of clause 9.01(e) was not dependent on a finding of breach of clause 9.01(g) or the issue of “quality” – see further paras 578, 580, 587, 588, 592, 595, 609 and 610 of the Award.

</div> HIL’s argument appears to be that if the PPE failed to meet the Production Requirements, Simplot was only entitled to the Holdback Amount, and the tribunal had no jurisdiction to award Simplot any sum beyond that (even if Simplot would have to spend more than the Holdback Amount for the PPE to meet the Production Requirements).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 HIL’s counsel however clarified in oral submissions that if the “quality” aspect had not featured at all, an award of damages going beyond the Holdback Amount in clause 1.03(c) of the MA (see [5] above) would not exceed the scope of the reference. But HIL argues that here, the tribunal had taken both qualitative and quantitative aspects into account in awarding damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 What damages Simplot should receive for HIL’s breach of clauses 9.01(e) and 9.01(g), and how that related to clause 1.03(c) on the Holdback Amount, were issues before the tribunal. HIL’s argument on damages is dependent on its argument on “quality”, and HIL seeks to challenge a point which it had <span class="font-italic">accepted</span> before the tribunal: that the warranties did include an aspect of the quality of the potato products produced. HIL’s case is premised on a contentious interpretation of the MA; it is a challenge to the substantive correctness of the tribunal’s decision; it is a backdoor appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Finally, it is stated in the affidavit of HIL’s Chairman and Managing Director, Mr Malik, that the tribunal’s award on costs should, in any event, be set aside for being “excessive”.

</div> This is however not mentioned in HIL’s written submissions, and was not pursued in oral submissions.

Although the MA was governed by Indian law, the issue in this OS was whether the tribunal had exceeded the scope of submission to arbitration (under the IAA and the Model Law) – that was not an issue of Indian law. If HIL were merely relying on the foreign lawyer’s affidavit as an Indian legal opinion on how the MA should have been construed (so as to resile from the position it had taken in the arbitration), this was not the time or place to do so. Moreover, the affidavit did not satisfy the requirements for expert affidavits under O 40A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) – it did not contain a statement that the expert understands that in giving his report, his duty is to the Court and that he complies with that duty (per O 40A r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>)). Understandably there was no such statement, because the foreign lawyer was effectively acting as the plaintiff’s lawyer rather than as an independent expert.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Gleeson v </span><span class="font-italic">J Wippell &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1977] 1 WLR 510 at 519, Megarry VC deprecated the inclusion in an affidavit of a Queen’s Counsel’s opinion and a journal article:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In Mr. Brown’s affidavit he quotes a passage from an opinion of a silk, and he exhibits an article in a journal concerned with patents. The object appears to be to demonstrate that the plaintiff has prospects of success against Wippell if her action is not halted. The main objection to the extracts from the article is that they do not appear to me to constitute any evidence; and the purpose of affidavits is, or should be, to provide evidence. As I told Mr. Jacob, I would listen with pleasure to any submission upon the subject that he chose to put before me, whatever his source of inspiration, but I would not listen to the words of a Queen’s Counsel, however eminent, or the author of an article, when proffered as evidence of the legal rights and prospects of a litigant.
