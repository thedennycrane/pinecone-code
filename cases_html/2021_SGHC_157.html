The defendant’s signature was “witnessed” electronically by one Foong Daw Ching (“Foong”). Foong sent an email dated 21 May 2018 to the plaintiffs forwarding the AOD signed by the defendant. In that email, Foong stated that his email could be treated as him having witnessed the defendant’s signature on the AOD.

However, the PT Entities refused to pay the monies demanded and disputed the amount that was owed. In those circumstances, the plaintiffs then sought to enforce the guarantee given by the defendant under the AOD. A demand was sent by the plaintiffs’ solicitors, Tan Kok Quan Partnership (“TKQP”), to the defendant on 6 March 2019 demanding payment from the defendant of the sum of IDR 8,221,181,489 (“Outstanding Balance”) said to be due to the plaintiffs as at the date of the letter.

</div> Accordingly, whilst the plaintiffs had also relied on a number of other limbs in O 11 r 1 ROC in their <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application, namely O 11 rr 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) and/or 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(iii), it was unnecessary for me to decide if the plaintiffs also satisfied those limbs to the standard of a good arguable case. It is common ground between the parties that the jurisdictional gateway requirement is met by a plaintiff so long as <span class="font-italic">at least one</span> of the jurisdictional gateways in O 11 r 1 ROC upon which the plaintiffs have relied is met to the standard of a good arguable case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This point was of relevance in this case because engaging in an analysis of whether the plaintiffs were able to rely on O 11 rr 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) and/or 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(iii) of the ROC as jurisdictional gateways <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">ould</span> potentially involve delving into the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of the claim to determine if a case had been made out by the plaintiffs to the standard of a good arguable case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 However, in light of the defendant’s acceptance that the plaintiffs did have a good arguable case to rely on O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC, which was a jurisdictional gateway that did <span class="font-italic">not</span> engage the merits of the case, the court would only need to consider the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim at a <span class="font-italic">lower</span> threshold, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> whether there was a serious question or issue to be tried (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span><span class="font-italic">Electrolok Ltd and another v Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd and others </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span>”) at [18] and [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Shortly after the hearing before me had concluded, the High Court delivered judgment in <span class="font-italic">Kernel Oil Pte Ltd v Iman </span><span class="font-italic">Djuniardi </span>[2020] SGHC 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Kernel Oil</span>”). I directed parties to tender further submissions to address <span class="font-italic">Kernel Oil</span>. In particular, I directed the parties to submit on the threshold which the plaintiffs had to meet at this stage of the proceedings with regard to the merits of their case when O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) ROC was the jurisdictional gateway in question. In <span class="font-italic">Kernel Oil</span> at [16], Choo Han Teck J was of the view that at least with regard to O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) of the ROC, a plaintiff had to establish a good arguable case that the limb applied and to go on separately to demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Ultimately, in light of the defendant’s concession (see [22]), it was not necessary for me to engage the issue of whether a plaintiff has to separately show a serious issue to be tried on the merits when the jurisdictional gateway relied upon is O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC. I therefore say no more on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 With the jurisdictional gateway requirement established, I turn my attention to the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The defendant submitted that the plaintiffs have failed to show that there is any serious issue to be tried.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The plaintiffs submitted that they have demonstrated that there is a serious issue to be tried. PT API was incorporated on or about 10 October 2018 and had commenced operations, and therefore the defendant’s liability under the AOD had been triggered. The PT Entities had failed, refused or neglected to pay the debt due and the quantum of this debt could be ascertained. There is thus sufficient foundation for the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant was liable under the AOD. The AOD was governed by Singapore law and not Indonesian law. While the defendant made various assertions to the effect that the plaintiffs’ case lacked sufficient merit, these assertions have been adequately addressed by the plaintiffs. Lastly, there was no uncertainty as to the parties to the AOD and there was valid consideration flowing from the plaintiffs in the form of an implied forbearance to sue.

The threshold of a “good arguable case” requires “more than a mere <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case, but is lower than that of a balance of probabilities” (at [30]). As for the merits of the case, where it is required to be separately shown, the threshold is that of a “serious issue to be tried” (see <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54(b)], referenced at [19] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 That the threshold of a “serious issue to be tried” is lower than that of a “good arguable case” is uncontroversial, but what does that lower threshold entail in practical terms? In particular, what does a plaintiff need to demonstrate to cross that lower threshold? In <span class="font-italic">Kernel Oil</span>, the High Court held at [16] that a “serious issue to be tried” merely means that a plaintiff “must raise an issue which needs to be resolved by the court”. To that, I would add that the issues or questions raised by the plaintiff and the available evidence disclose that the claim is not <span class="font-italic">so hop</span><span class="font-italic">eless</span> as to warrant leave to serve out being refused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The English House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Seaconsar</span> <span class="font-italic">Far East Ltd v Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran </span>[1994] 1 AC 438 (“<span class="font-italic">Seaconsar</span>”) was the seminal case that explained the distinction between the “good arguable case” standard to establish a jurisdictional gateway and the “serious issue to be tried” standard <span class="font-italic">vis-a-vis</span> the merits of the case, in the context of an application for leave to serve originating process out of jurisdiction. Lord Goff of Chieveley, delivering the leading opinion of the House of Lords (at 451–452), referenced Lord Davey’s opinion in <span class="font-italic">Chemische</span><span class="font-italic"> Fabrik vormals Sandoz v Badische Anilin und Soda Fabriks</span> (1904) 90 LT 733 (“<span class="font-italic">Chemische</span>”), where Lord Davey stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An injunction is sought to restrain the defendants from doing some act within the jurisdiction. Rule 4 of [Order 11] prescribes that the application is to be supported by evidence stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and no such leave is to be granted unless it be made sufficiently to appear to the court or judge that the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Order. This does not, of course, mean that a mere statement by any deponent who is put forward to make the affidavit that he believes that there is a good cause of action is sufficient. On the other hand, the court is not, on an application for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction, or on a motion made to discharge an order for such service, called upon to try the action or express a premature opinion on its merits, and where there are conflicting statements as to material facts, any such opinion must necessarily be based on insufficient materials. But I think that the application should be supported by an affidavit stating facts which, if proved, would be a sufficient foundation for the alleged cause of action, and, as a rule, the affidavit should be by some person acquainted with the facts, or, at any rate, should specify the sources or persons from whom the deponent derives his information. <span class="font-italic">A more difficult question is where it is in dispute whether the alleged or admitted facts will, as a matter of law, entitle the plaintiff to the relief which he seeks. If the court is judicially satisfied that the alleged facts, if proved, will not support the action, I think the court ought to say so, and dismiss the application or discharge the order. But where there is a substantial legal question arising on the facts disclosed by the </span><span class="font-italic">affidavits which the plaintiff bona fide desires to try, I think that the court should, as a rule, allow the service of the writ.</span> The words at the end of the Order do not, I think, mean more than that the court is to be satisfied that the case comes within the class of cases in which service abroad may be made under the first rule of the Order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 With reference to Lord Davey’s opinion in <span class="font-italic">Chemische</span>, Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Seaconsar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>opined as follows (at 452):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On this approach, if in support of the plaintiff's ex parte application an affidavit is sworn in proper form deposing to facts which, if proved, provide a sufficient foundation for the alleged cause of action, that should generally be enough for present purposes. This is no doubt what a number of judges have referred to when they have used the expression "prima facie case" in this context. The problem arises from the fact that the court will consider, on an application to set aside leave so given, affidavit evidence on the part of the defendant, and will take such evidence into account when deciding whether or not to exercise its discretion in favour of the plaintiff. <span class="font-italic">But the court cannot resolve disputed questions of fact on affidavit evidence; and it is consistent with the statement of the law by Lord Davey that if, at the end of the day, there remains a substantial question of fact or law or both, arising on the facts disclosed by the affidavits, which the plaintiff bona fide desires to try, the court should, as a rule, allow the service of the writ. If this approach is correct, the standard of proof in respect of the cause of action can broadly be stated to be whether, on the affidavit evidence before the court, there is a serious question to be tried.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The House of Lords further held (at 456–457) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Once it is recognised that, so far as the merits of the plaintiff's claim are concerned, <span class="font-italic">no more is required than that the evidence should disclose that there is a serious issue to be tried, it is difficult to see how this matter, although it falls within the ambit of the court's discretion, has not in practice to be established in any event.</span> This is because it is very difficult to conceive how a judge could, in the proper exercise of his discretion, give leave where there was no serious issue to be tried. Accordingly, a judge faced with a question of leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction under Order 11 will in practice have to consider both (1) whether jurisdiction has been sufficiently established, on the criterion of the good arguable case laid down in <span class="font-italic">Korner's</span> case, under one of the paragraphs of rule 1(1), and (2) whether there is a serious issue to be tried, so as to enable him to exercise his discretion to grant leave, before he goes on to consider the exercise of that discretion, with particular reference to the issue of forum conveniens.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Lord Davey’s opinion in <span class="font-italic">Chemische</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was cited with approval by our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span>. The Court of Appeal also reiterated the point that the court is “not called upon to try the action or express a premature opinion on its merits” (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span> at [17]). The court needs only to be satisfied at this early stage of the proceedings that the evidence demonstrates that the claim <span class="font-italic">is not so hopeless</span> such that leave should not be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Aside from leave to serve out of jurisdiction under O 11 of the ROC, the threshold of a “serious issue to be tried” is also a requirement to be met by a party seeking an interlocutory injunction under the test as set out in <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd </span>[1975] AC 396. As to what constitutes a “serious issue to be tried” for purposes of obtaining an interlocutory injunction, the authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 </span>vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2019) note that the court “must be satisfied that <span class="font-italic">the claim is not frivolous or vexatious</span>”; and that the court should consider this requirement as having been met “unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application … fails to disclose that the plaintiff has <span class="font-italic">any real prospect of succeeding</span> in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial (at para 29/1/11, emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> further note (at para 29/1/12) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The prospects of the plaintiff’s success are to be investigated only to a limited extent.

The threshold is low but nevertheless, it must be shown that there is a “substantial question of fact or law which the plaintiff has a genuine desire to be tried” (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury Laws of Singapore</span>”) at para 75.071, citing <span class="font-italic">Chemische</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Following from the above, so long as the plaintiffs are able to demonstrate that there are issues that they have raised in respect of their claim against the defendant which the court would need to resolve at a trial, which are not so hopeless and in respect of which the plaintiffs may prevail at trial, the threshold of demonstrating a serious question or issue to be tried on the merits would have been crossed. This remains the case <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the plaintiffs may not, at this stage, have the “better of the argument” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a good arguable case) on certain aspects of their claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my judgment, the plaintiffs have established that there are serious issues to be tried as far as the merits of their claim are concerned. None of the defendant’s arguments demonstrates otherwise. I turn to consider each of the defendant’s arguments summarised at [28] above. My analysis and conclusions below on the competing arguments are based on the evidence that was before me when SUM 5867 was heard, and the various submissions of the parties in relation to whether the Service Out Order should be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Operational commencement of the “new PT” entity </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The defendant argued that the operational commencement of the “new PT” entity never took place and therefore, liability under the AOD had not arisen.

First, the defendant submitted that the plaintiffs had changed their position on the identity of the “new PT” entity that they were seeking to rely on to prove their claim under the AOD.

</div> the plaintiffs’ position was that the “new PT” entity envisaged in the AOD was PT APP, which had been incorporated on 16 November 2017 “to assume a role similar to that of the PT Entities”. However, and according to the defendant, inexplicably, the plaintiffs’ position changed in the SOC filed on 25 June 2019, where it was pleaded by the plaintiffs that the “new PT” entity was PT <span class="font-italic">API</span>, not PT APP.

</div> Second, on the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant incorporated PT API on 11 October 2018 after the plaintiffs terminated the Term Sheet on 28 September 2018, the AOD would no longer be in effect at that latter point. As such, PT API could not have been the “new PT” entity referred to in the AOD. Third, the plaintiffs’ claim that PT API is the “new PT” entity was based on mere speculation that PT API was owned or controlled by the defendant. It could not be the case that the defendant’s liability under the AOD would be triggered as long as any “new PT” entity was set up, even if the business was not related to the PT Entities or the defendant.

Before the execution of the AOD, the defendant’s representative Sri Siniyati Wijaya had informed representatives of the plaintiffs, Schwarz and Quek, by an email dated 17 April 2018 that the defendant was planning to start PT APP on 1 May 2018. Thus, PT APP was initially intended to be the “new PT” entity referred to in the AOD.

The plaintiffs argued that they have adduced sufficient evidence to show that PT API carried on the business and functions that were originally slated to be performed by PT APP. In particular, the first plaintiff had engaged an Indonesian law firm, TMID Law Firm, to prepare an investigation report on PT API (“TMID Report”). The TMID Report showed that:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having considered the competing arguments, I am satisfied that there are serious issues to be tried. There is at present insufficient evidence that the defendant’s liability to pay under <span class="font-italic">the AOD</span> would not be triggered if the “new PT” entity was incorporated after the termination of <span class="font-italic">the Term Sheet</span>. The AOD states that the fees are due “with the operational commencement of the new PT” with no other qualification; it was not expressed to be conditional on the Term Sheet remaining alive or not being terminated. The plaintiffs do have a case to argue that the defendant is liable under the AOD to pay any outstanding fees due once PT API (as the alleged “new PT”) had been incorporated even if that occurred after the Term Sheet had been terminated. I could not conclude that a claim advanced on this basis was so hopeless that it did not even cross the low threshold of constituting a serious issue to be tried. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The defendant also argued that by purporting to terminate the Term Sheet and the commercial relationship between the plaintiffs and the PT Entities,  the plaintiffs would no longer be effecting any transfer of the franchise agreements and/or business from the PT Entities to the “new PT” entity thereafter. Therefore, the “phoenix” scheme that the AOD was meant to facilitate was abandoned at that point.

</div> However, the defendant’s assertions as to the factual background and purpose of the AOD are disputed by the plaintiffs. It is axiomatic that in applications of this nature, factual disputes cannot be determined by the court at this stage of the proceedings based on conflicting affidavit evidence. In this case, evidence of the surrounding circumstances and context are likely to have some relevance on the interpretation of the Term Sheet, the AOD and their respective terms. That exercise cannot be conducted on the basis of affidavit evidence adduced at this nascent stage of the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, based on the TMID Report adduced by the plaintiffs, there is at least some evidence indicating that PT API was linked in some way to the PT Entities and the defendant or had sought to provide services similar to that provided by the PT Entities. It is noteworthy that PT API had applied to register in Indonesia marks similar to those owned by the first plaintiff; the defendant did not specifically deny this in any of her affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Many questions have been left unanswered by both parties on several aspects of their relationship and the current dispute; in addition, the evidence adduced by both sides in SUM 5867 was far from complete and left a number of question unanswered. For example, the termination clause in the Term Sheet refers to the termination of the <span class="font-italic">license agreement</span>, but it is not clear on the face of the document whether that refers to the Term Sheet itself, although parties appear to have taken this position in their arguments before me. Much of the plaintiffs’ arguments also hinged on the TMID Report, and the credibility of that report remains to be tested at trial. The plaintiffs acknowledged that the TMID Report was unsigned and undated but submitted that the report does refer to a company named PT API.

</div> There is also insufficient evidence in relation to whether PT API had attained “full operational status” and what that entailed. Further, there are also the questions of whether the parties intended the “new PT” in the AOD to be a reference only to PT APP and what, if any, was the significance of the 1 July 2018 date stated in the AOD as the operational commencement date of the “new PT” entity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the purposes of my decision, I took into account the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs in the TMID Report. Apart from arguing that it was unsigned and undated, the defendant did not adduce any positive evidence to rebut the contents of the TMID Report, when information about the operations of PT API was, in my view, more likely than not to be within the defendant’s knowledge. As the plaintiffs submitted, the defendant did not positively assert in her affidavits that PT API did not commence operations concurrently with its incorporation. Nor did she procure an affidavit from Oey to that effect.

Given the imprecision in the wording of the AOD and the Term Sheet, it is likely, at least as a matter of Singapore law, that evidence of surrounding circumstances and context may well be relevant and necessary to aid in the interpretation of these documents and their terms. While the plaintiffs will no doubt have to explain the change in their position on the identity of the “new PT” from PT APP to PT API, on the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that the plaintiffs’ claim is so hopeless that it does not raise any serious issue to be tried. Similarly, the alternative argument by the plaintiffs that a term is to be implied in the AOD that the AOD would be enforceable if the “new PT” entity was not set up on or before 1 July 2018 is also not so hopeless such as to raise no serious issue to be resolved at trial.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Ambiguity of parties to the AOD</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The defendant argued that the parties to the AOD are ambiguous. First, the fact that the AOD was signed by the “Global Beauty Group” was fatal to the plaintiffs’ case as a group of companies is not a legal person capable of entering into a contract. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Max-Sun Trading Ltd and another v Tang Mun Kit and another (Tan Siew Moi, third party) </span>[2016] 5 SLR 815 (“<span class="font-italic">Max-Sun Trading</span>”) at [48], counsel for the defendant argued that the parties to the AOD were too uncertain for it to be valid. Second, whilst the Term Sheet refers to “agreements”, no evidence has been provided as to who exactly the parties to these agreements are. Third, the plaintiffs and their related companies had not finalised the parties who were meant to enforce the Term Sheet and/or the AOD, and have in correspondence referred to monies being owed to “GBI”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “Global Beauty International Ltd”.

</div> Against this, the defendant argued that the Term Sheet referred to these dates as dates on which the agreements were <span class="font-italic">entered into</span>, and not their <span class="font-italic">effective dates</span>. Further, save for one agreement, the expiry dates of the agreements as stated on the Term Sheet and the Agreements also do not match, thereby strengthening the defendant’s arguments that the Term Sheet referred to phantom agreements.

</div> I also noted that the defendant’s arguments in relation to the ambiguity of the parties to the AOD were raised somewhat belatedly only at the hearing before me. It was not an issue that the defendant raised in any of her affidavits for SUM 5867. Nor was it a point made by the defendant in any of the fairly extensive correspondence exchanged between the parties’ solicitors prior to the commencement of S 617.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The defendant stated, in her first affidavit filed on 22 November 2019, that the Term Sheet served a “bridging function” as a number of the Agreements had expired and the plaintiffs were in the midst of negotiating the terms of new franchise agreements that would supersede the Term Sheet. It was therefore agreed that during this interim period, the PT Entities could continue using the plaintiffs’ franchise/ brand and that the plaintiffs would continue to provide the services that it had been providing to the PT Entities under the Agreements.

</div> In my view, this was at the least an implicit acknowledgement that the Term Sheet was entered into between the plaintiffs and the PT Entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Further, the defendant also stated in the same affidavit at [11] that as the liquidation of the PT Entities was being contemplated, <span class="font-italic">the plaintiffs</span> were concerned that they “would have no one to turn to in connection with any monies owing under the Interim Arrangements clause when the PT Entities are liquidated”. According to the defendant, it was in these circumstances that <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">plaintiffs</span> requested her to sign the AOD. Again, this was, in my view, at least an implicit acknowledgement by the defendant that the AOD was a document signed by her and the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The defendant again repeated her position in her second affidavit filed on 17 January 2020, where she stated at [13] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As I explained [in the defendant’s 1st affidavit] … it was contemplated that the sums which <span class="font-italic">the Plaintiffs</span> owed the PT Entities would be set off against the sums which the PT Entities owed <span class="font-italic">the Plaintiffs</span>. <span class="font-italic">This was why the AOD stated </span><span class="font-italic">… expressly that “should there be any amounts outstanding and agreed upon, it will be offset against the total owing amount by the creditor to [the first plaintiff] and its affiliated companies”.</span> Indeed, I should also point out that the AOD defines the “creditor” to mean [PTSU], [PTCU], and [PTHP] (i.e. the PT Entities)”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original removed; emphasis added in italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Put another way, there was no <span class="font-italic">specific</span> denial by the defendant in any of her affidavits in support of SUM 5867 that the plaintiffs were parties to the AOD and the entities who could assert a claim against the defendant under the AOD. I had also alluded to the extensive correspondence exchanged by the parties’ solicitors prior to the commencement of S 617. The defendant’s solicitors were at pains to point out to the plaintiffs’ solicitors the defendant’s defences to the claim, but in none of the correspondence spanning several months did the defendant ever raise any issue about the plaintiffs not being parties to the AOD or that the AOD was void for uncertainty of parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The case of <span class="font-italic">Max-Sun</span> relied on by the defendant does not assist her. First, <span class="font-italic">Max-</span><span class="font-italic">Sun</span> was not an O 11 case but a case that was decided after trial. Second, the facts in <span class="font-italic">Max-Sun</span> are quite different to those in the case before me. For one, the contract alleged to have been concluded in <span class="font-italic">Max-Sun</span> was oral. At this stage of the matter, all I need to be satisfied is whether the plaintiffs’ claim that they are parties to the AOD was so hopeless or frivolous as to be doomed to failure. I was far from satisfied that this was the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Lastly, I also note that the defendant, while arguing that the burden remains on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that all the requirements for leave to serve out have been met, was conspicuously silent on who, in her view, the parties to the AOD are. More specifically, the defendant does not say to whom she was agreeing to undertake personal liability when she signed the AOD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For the foregoing reasons, I disagree that there is no serious issue to be tried on whether the plaintiffs are parties to the AOD or whether the AOD is void for uncertainty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) AOD is void under Indonesian law and/or is not supported by valid consideration</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the reasons which are detailed below at [73] to [119], I have concluded that the governing law of the AOD is <span class="font-italic">Singapore law</span>. In the circumstances, the defendant’s argument that the claim had no merits, as the AOD was governed by Indonesian law and would therefore be null and void and unenforceable under Indonesian law, is not made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendant’s alternative argument is that even if the AOD is governed by Singapore law, it would be unenforceable as the AOD is not supported by consideration. The defendant contends that no evidence has been adduced by the plaintiffs to show that they had exercised forbearance from commencing legal proceedings against the PT Entities in exchange for the execution of the AOD by the defendant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 These arguments can be dealt with briefly. First, whether the AOD had been signed by the defendant in exchange for the plaintiffs’ forbearance in suing the PT Entities on the sums (if any) owed to the plaintiffs under the Term Sheet is a disputed factual issue that would need to be determined at trial. Second, the plaintiffs argued that forbearance to sue as consideration may be implied. While the defendant argued to the contrary, the plaintiffs’ contentions were, again, not so hopeless such as to demonstrate an absence of any serious issue to be tried on this point. On the contrary, there were substantial issues of fact and/or law on the lack of consideration point to be determined at trial. The court should not express any premature opinion at this stage of the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In conclusion, I disagreed with the defendant’s contentions that the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim are so weak that they raise no serious issues or questions to be tried. While there may be (and I would put it at no higher than that) some aspects of the plaintiffs’ claim that are less robust than others, overall, this is not a claim that has been shown to be so hopeless or doomed to failure as to warrant the setting aside of the Service Out Order. In my judgment, the plaintiffs’ claim has a sufficient degree of merit and thus, this requirement has also been satisfied by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The natural forum requirement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I turn next to the natural forum requirement<span class="font-italic">. </span>The plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that Singapore is the more appropriate forum to hear the dispute. The principles that apply in determining the appropriate forum in the context of a service out application are well-known and have been reiterated in a number of Court of Appeal decisions, including <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span> at [80(c)]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The inquiry for determining whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum in the context of service out applications was the same as that undertaken at the <span class="font-italic">first</span> stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> ([54] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [70]). Consequently, Singapore would be the more appropriate forum if it had the most real and substantial connection with the disputes raised (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [38]). The court would weigh the connecting factors that had the most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute rather than undertake a mechanical application of established connecting factors. It would also be primarily concerned with the <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of the connecting factors rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 265 at [70]; <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra</span> [2019] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar</span>”) at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In this regard, it is also clear that in assessing whether Singapore is the natural forum, it does not matter whether Singapore is the natural forum by a hair or by a mile (<span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span> at [80(b)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Five broad categories of relevant connecting factors have been identified in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) (at [42]) to guide a court in its identification of the natural forum, namely, the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses; the connections to relevant events and transactions; the applicable law to the dispute; the existence of proceedings elsewhere; and the shape of the litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The parties have raised the following factors to be considered in the analysis:

In a similar vein, the court should not apply and assess the connecting factors in a mechanical fashion; instead, “greater weight should be ascribed to factors that are likely to be material to a fair determination of the dispute” (<span class="font-italic">MAN Diese</span><span class="font-italic">l &amp; Turbo SE</span> at [128]). The “lodestar for a court tasked with identifying the natural forum is whether any of the connections point towards a jurisdiction in which the case may be ‘tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice’” (<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span>”) at [72]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Bearing in mind the principles summarised above and for the reasons articulated below, I am of the view that Singapore is the clearly more appropriate forum in which the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendant should be tried. Qualitatively, the more relevant factors to consider in this case are (a) the governing law of the AOD, (b) witness compellability and (c) the existence of parallel or related proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Governing law of the AOD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In my judgment, the most relevant and significant connecting factor in the present dispute is the governing law of the AOD. The crux of the dispute involves the interpretation of the terms in the AOD (and to an extent, the Term Sheet) and whether the AOD can be enforced by the plaintiffs against the defendant to recover monies alleged to be owed under it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The defendant argues that if Singapore law is the governing law of the AOD, that should not be a significant factor because there would be no complex legal issues at play, citing <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 (“<span class="font-italic">Dresdner </span><span class="font-italic">Kleinwort</span>”). The defendant contends that the plaintiffs had not pointed to any legal issue arising from Singapore law which <span class="font-italic">the Indonesian courts</span> would find difficulty in adjudicating. If Singapore law applied, the main issues in the dispute would, according to the defendant, be factual. In contrast, should Indonesian law govern the AOD, the issues of Indonesian law at play would be complex. As such, if Indonesian law is found to govern the AOD, it should be a significant factor pointing toward Indonesia being the appropriate forum.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is well-settled that the relevance of choice of law considerations in a jurisdictional enquiry regarding the natural forum to determine a dispute “lies in the general proposition that where a dispute is governed by a foreign <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">causae</span>, the forum would be less adept in applying this law than the courts of the jurisdiction from which the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">causae </span>originates”. Whilst the court of one jurisdiction can apply the laws of another country, there will “clearly be savings in time and resources if a court applies the law of its own jurisdiction to the substantive dispute” (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”) at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In <span class="font-italic">Dresdner </span><span class="font-italic">Kleinwort</span>, the court held that in that case, Singapore law on unjust enrichment was similar if not identical to the prevailing law in England, such that the Singapore courts would be well able to apply English law without the aid of foreign law experts. On that basis, the court found that even if the agreement in question were governed by English law, that factor would not be of much significance (at [63]). In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>, the court considered that even where a party fails to adduce proof of foreign law, the court may have regard to the fact that the principles in the foreign jurisdiction concerned will, in all likelihood <span class="font-italic">differ from </span>the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori </span>in some respects (at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the present case, it is not the defendant’s case that there are no material differences between Indonesian law and Singapore law as applied to the AOD. Indeed, on the defendant’s own case, the AOD is governed by Indonesian law and would be <span class="font-italic">null and </span><span class="font-italic">void</span> under Indonesian law by virtue of the Indonesian language law which mandates contracts involving Indonesian parties to be in Bahasa Indonesia. Further, the evidence of the defendant’s Indonesian law expert, as set out in in the 2nd Supplemental Legal Opinion of Paul Antonius Sitepu (“Sitepu”), is that the AOD would be annulled by virtue of the Indonesian language law <span class="font-italic">even if </span>the governing law of the contract <span class="font-italic">is Singapore law</span>.

For example, whether evidence of negotiations and/or discussions leading up to the execution of a personal guarantee is relevant to and admissible in the interpretation of an agreement was an issue identified by the defendant’s Indonesian law expert.

</div> Similarly, there may be other legal questions that are likely to arise in the interpretation of the AOD under Singapore law which the Indonesian courts would have to grapple with; one example would be the issue of implication of terms into the AOD. A further example would be the concept of valid consideration for a contractual bargain and implied forbearance constituting valid consideration. It is therefore incorrect for the defendant to assert that even if Singapore law governed the AOD, the issues to be determined by the Indonesian courts would largely be factual issues.

The fees due under the Term Sheet and the AOD were to be paid to the plaintiffs, which were either Singapore-incorporated companies (the second to fourth plaintiffs) or a BVI-incorporated company that operated out of Singapore (the first plaintiff).

Therefore, as the first plaintiff was a BVI-incorporated company and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the defendant’s obligation, if any, to pay under the AOD would be to seek out the first plaintiff and pay it in the BVI.

</div> Apart from the 2005 PTCU Agreements, the plaintiffs did not adduce evidence of any similar agreements involving PTCSU and PTHP even though presumably, such similar agreements exist and would contain similar choice of law clauses. As against this, the plaintiffs’ case is that the Term Sheet refers to the Agreements entered into in <span class="font-italic">1995</span>, which expressly stipulated Singapore law as their governing law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I note that there are other gaps in the evidence. The 2005 PTCU Agreements were set to expire in 2015, and it is unclear if there was any subsequent renewal of those agreements. As I mentioned at [91], it is also unclear if the other agreements signed in 1995 with PTCSU and PTHP had also been renewed. In any event, leaving aside these gaps, all of these agreements were entered into between the relevant parties quite some time prior to the execution of the AOD on 18 May 2018. Thus, this factor of itself does not assist to determine whether Singapore law or Indonesian law would have the closest and most real connection to the AOD. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Invalidating effect of Indonesian law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In relation to the plaintiffs’ submission that the parties could not have intended the AOD to be governed by Indonesian law as it would be rendered null and void, the defendant submitted that she was unaware of the invalidating effect of Indonesian law on the AOD. The defendant referred to <span class="font-italic">BNA v BN</span><span class="font-italic">B </span>[2020] 1 SLR 456 (“<span class="font-italic">BNA v BN</span><span class="font-italic">B</span>”), where the respondents in that case sought to advance the argument that the parties could not have intended Shanghai to be the seat of the arbitration as the arbitration agreement would be void under Chinese law. The Court of Appeal held (at [90]) that for the respondents to make such an argument, they had to show that the parties were, at the very least, <span class="font-italic">aware</span> at the time of contracting that the choice of proper law of the arbitration agreement could have an impact on the validity of the agreement. On the facts in that case, the evidence suggested no such consideration operated on the minds of the parties. The defendant submitted that the argument made by the plaintiffs in the present case is analogous to that made by the respondents in <span class="font-italic">BNA v BN</span><span class="font-italic">B.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I accept that there is insufficient evidence before the court to indicate that at the point of entering into the AOD, the parties were aware of or had applied their minds to the possibility that the AOD would be void or unenforceable under Indonesian law. As such, I am unable to draw the conclusion that parties intended for the AOD to be governed by a system of law other than Indonesian law because of its otherwise invalidating effect on the AOD. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Place of performance of the AOD</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiffs argued that the place of performance of the AOD is Singapore. According to the plaintiffs, the fees under the Agreements and the Term Sheet from the PT Entities to the plaintiffs were typically paid into bank accounts in Singapore, as there were payments made to Global Beauty International Pte Ltd, a company incorporated in Singapore and which was part of the same group of companies as the plaintiffs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Having considered the rival contentions, I agree with the plaintiffs that the place of performance of the AOD is Singapore. Following from this, any cause of action against the defendant based on the AOD would also have arisen here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The general rule at common law is that a debtor’s payment obligations are to be performed at the place of the creditor’s residence (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury Laws of Singapore </span>at para 75.347, n 9). As set out in <span class="font-italic">The Eider </span>[1893] P 119 (“<span class="font-italic">The Eider</span>”) (at 131), the “ordinary rule” is that “the debtor must follow his creditor, and must pay where his creditor is” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Esher MR). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In <span class="font-italic">EFG Bank AG, Singapore Branch v Teng Wen-Chung </span>[2017] SGHC 318 (“<span class="font-italic">EFG Bank</span>”) at [55]–[56], George Wei J held, in the context of a summary judgment application, that the place of performance of a loan agreement was where payment was to take place. In <span class="font-italic">EFG Bank</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [56]), the court referred to <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on The Conflict of Laws</span> (Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 11-197 for “[t]he general rule … that where no place of payment is specified … the debtor must seek out his creditor”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The position in <span class="font-italic">EFG Bank</span> was adopted by the Singapore International Commercial Court in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas SA v Jacob </span><span class="font-italic">Agam and another </span>[2018] 4 SLR 57 (<span class="font-italic">“Jacob </span><span class="font-italic">Agam”</span>). In <span class="font-italic">Jacob </span><span class="font-italic">Agam</span>, Vivian Ramsey IJ had to decide whether the case before him was an “offshore case” which “had no substantial connection with Singapore”. At [26]–[28], Ramsey IJ held, adopting the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">EFG</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank</span>, that the place of payment under the guarantees in question in that case would be the place of the creditor, which was Singapore. On that basis, the court held that Singapore was the place of the performance of the guarantees in question in that case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The general rule that it is the duty of a debtor to seek out his creditor in the absence of any agreement to the contrary is well-settled and has been accepted in a number of jurisdictions (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Arab Bank Ltd v Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas</span><span class="font-italic">) </span>[1954] AC 495 at 531, where the House of Lords held that “generally it is the duty of a debtor to seek out his creditor and tender the amount of his debt”, although there was nothing to stop the parties from agreeing otherwise; in <span class="font-italic">Coates v Charles Porter &amp; Sons Pty Ltd </span>(1990) 2 ACSR 733 at 735–736, where the Supreme Court of Western Australia found that it was an implied term of a quasi-contract that payments were to be paid to the liquidator at his ordinary place of business and residence, following the general rule that where a contract is silent as to place of payment, the debtor is to seek out the creditor and the debt is payable where the creditor is found). It follows from this general rule that the place of performance of monetary payment obligations would, where the contract is silent, be the creditor’s place of business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 On the facts of the present case, the place of performance of the AOD would, in my judgment, be Singapore. The available evidence pointed to payments being made, and the plaintiff’s business being based, in Singapore. The plaintiffs contended that they typically received payment from the PT Entities through their bank accounts in Singapore and adduced some evidence in support (see [95] above). In contrast, the defendant did not assert or produce any evidence that she or any of the PT Entities had ever dealt with the first plaintiff in the BVI or made any payments to the first plaintiff in the BVI. The defendant’s argument on <span class="font-italic">The Eider</span> principle was that she could seek out the first plaintiff in the BVI since it was incorporated there; however, as stated above, the scope of the general rule in <span class="font-italic">The Eider </span>is that the debtor should seek out the creditor at its place of business, and there was no suggestion from the defendant that the plaintiffs did not carry on business in Singapore. Nor was there was any evidence of a history of past transactions between <span class="font-italic">the defendant </span>and <span class="font-italic">the plaintiffs</span> where <span class="font-italic">the defendant</span> had made payments to the plaintiffs otherwise than in Singapore. Based on the evidence before me, the defendant’s personal guarantee under the AOD was the first and only “transaction” between the defendant personally and the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In addition, there was other evidence that indicated that Singapore was the plaintiffs’ place of business or at least their primary place of business. For example, it is undisputed by the defendant that shortly before the AOD was signed, there were meetings and in-person negotiations that took place in Singapore in or around May 2018 between the <span class="font-italic">plaintiffs’ Singapore-based representatives</span> and the defendant. There were also affidavits affirmed on behalf of the plaintiffs in these proceedings by Quek and Schwarz. Quek described herself in her affidavits as a director of all of the plaintiffs and was based in Singapore.

</div>
</div> I also refer to the points I make below at [116]–[118] on the currency of payment. Thus, this was not a case bereft of any evidence whatsoever indicating that Singapore was the plaintiffs’ place of business. As I mentioned above at [98], the general rule in <span class="font-italic">The Eider</span> is applicable here since there is no express term in the AOD as to where payment was to be effected by the defendant. In my judgment, the available evidence supported the conclusion that payment by the defendant of any sums due to the plaintiffs under the AOD was to be made in Singapore. I note here in passing that a recent judgment of the Court of Appeal which was released after I rendered my decision in SUM 5867 supports the conclusions I have reached at [102]–[103] above – see <span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1 Pte Ltd v Industries </span><span class="font-italic">Chimiques Du Senegal and another appeal and another matter </span>[2021] 1 SLR 342 at [84]–[85] and [88]<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 That the place of performance by the defendant of her obligations under the AOD was Singapore would support the plaintiffs’ case that Singapore law has the closest and most real connection to the AOD and the circumstances surrounding its inception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Before I leave this issue, I would refer to the case of <span class="font-italic">Bunge SA and ano</span><span class="font-italic">ther v Indian Bank</span> [2015] SGHC 330 (“<span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>”), which further buttresses the conclusion I have reached on the significance of the <span class="font-italic">place of performance</span> of a party’s contractual obligation to the issue of determining <span class="font-italic">the governing law</span> of that contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span> involved an application to stay proceedings that had been brought in Singapore in favour of India on the basis that India was the natural forum for the determination of the dispute. The claim by the plaintiff was for breach of an undertaking by the defendant bank contained in a SWIFT message sent by the latter. Amongst the connecting factors considered by Belinda Ang J (as she then was) was the governing law of the alleged undertaking contained in the SWIFT message. The parties in <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span> accepted that the choice of law analysis was as set out in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> (see [79] above). The parties also accepted that there was no express choice of law in the SWIFT message, nor could a choice be inferred, and that the court should proceed to the third stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> test. At [51], Ang J summarised the parties’ arguments as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The plaintiffs submitted that as the March SWIFT message was sent in the context of the overarching structured finance transaction, and specifically was an undertaking that flowed from Varun’s obligations under its contract dated 27 February 2012 with the first plaintiff (see [17(a)] above) which was governed by English law, the plaintiffs submitted that English law governed their claims against the defendant for breach of the undertaking. In contrast, the defendant’s view is that the laws of India have the closest and most real connection because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     The March SWIFT message was issued by the defendant’s Mumbai branch.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     The performance of the terms of the March SWIFT message was to be effected in India.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107  At [52], Ang J held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before the court is able to determine the proper law of the alleged undertaking in the March SWIFT message, the court must first decide on the factual issue of whether or not the March SWIFT message constituted an undertaking as alleged. <span class="font-italic">Applying the approach in </span><span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation, the law that has the closest and most real connection to the March SWIFT message is prima facie Indian law for the two reasons stated by the defendant at [51] above.</span> Hence, the question of whether the March SWIFT message constituted an undertaking in the first place is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> governed by Indian law. Assuming then that the March SWIFT message amounted to an undertaking under Indian law, the proper law of the undertaking and the defendant’s obligations thereunder would have to be decided as a matter of Indian law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It can be seen from the passages reproduced above that in <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>, the court considered the place of performance of the asserted contractual obligation as a relevant consideration in assessing the objective choice of law of that contract. That is also the approach I have adopted in this case. In my view, it is logical and principled for a court to have regard to the place of performance of the contract in its quest to determine the law that has the closest and most real connection with that contract. It is certainly a relevant factor considering that <span class="font-italic">performance</span> of a contractual obligation may be said to be the very essence of any contract. Thus, the place where a contractual obligation is to be performed by a party is, in my view, a useful <span class="font-italic">indicium</span> of a contract’s objective proper law. As noted by the authors of <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> (see [82] above), the place of performance is ordinarily a factor that is highly relevant at the third stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> test. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Place of contracting</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for the place of contracting, whilst the AOD did state “Singapore” just above the signature block (see [10] above), the defendant’s case is that she signed the AOD in Indonesia. The defendant asserted that the AOD was sent to her for her signature via email by the plaintiffs’ representative on 18 May 2018. She then signed it in Indonesia and sent it via email on 21 May 2018 to Foong, who then forwarded the same to the plaintiffs.

On 30 April 2018, the parties negotiated the AOD at the Singapore office of Global Beauty International Pte Ltd. Schwarz, Quek and Carrie Neo Chin Wee (“Neo”) represented the plaintiffs in the negotiations whilst the defendant was accompanied by Foong, who was based in Singapore.

</div> The plaintiffs disagreed and submitted that the commercial purpose of the AOD was to secure payments due to them under the Term Sheet from the defendant personally. The “phoenix scheme” which the defendant intended to put in place may have been part of the background context but it was not the purpose of the AOD. The AOD itself stated that it “serves the purpose of the temporarily [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] continuance under the current terms.”

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The defendant has acknowledged that under the AOD, she was personally liable for any sums to be paid by the PT Entities (see [83(a)]). It also could not be seriously disputed that the plain wording of the AOD is to make clear the payment obligation of the defendant as a personal guarantor – hence the words “I … hereby acknowledge that I am personal [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] liable …” in the AOD. While there may have been broader considerations or transactions contemplated by the parties, the direct or immediate obligation of the defendant under the AOD was to personally guarantee the payment of sums due from the PT Entities to the plaintiffs. That purpose of the AOD or the direct underlying obligation of the defendant under it was of greater relevance in determining the AOD’s governing law (see <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As for the commercial purpose of the AOD, as I have already mentioned, the parties disagree what that was. In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Kernel Oil</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Choo J placed weight on the commercial purpose of the loan agreement in circumstances where the parties <span class="font-italic">did not dispute</span> what that purpose was, namely to set up a Swiss entity and provide it with working capital (at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Given the parties’ disagreement in this case on the commercial purpose of the AOD, I preferred to focus on the purpose of the AOD with specific reference to the defendant’s immediate obligations under it. Analysed in that context, the purpose for which the AOD was entered into leaned in favour of Singapore law as the governing law, given my earlier conclusion that the place of performance of the AOD is Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(7) Where entities are based </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In relation to the defendant’s argument that the PT Entities are based in Indonesia and that the liability under the AOD concerns transactions or events that took place in Indonesia, this is, in my view, a neutral factor. Whilst the PT Entities were based in Indonesia, the plaintiffs were incorporated in or based in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) Currency </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Finally, on the defendant’s submission that Indonesian Rupiah is specified as the currency under the AOD, I do not think much significance is to be ascribed to this factor. In <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>, the Court of Appeal observed<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [44] that one “may occasionally infer that parties intend a contract to be governed by the law of the country in whose currency the sums due under the contract are payable”. It was commercially sensible for Indonesian Rupiah to be the currency in which the sums due under the AOD were expressed since it is, on the face of the document, a personal guarantee given by the defendant who is Indonesian. But that, in and of itself, does not necessarily point to Indonesian law or establish a closer connection to Indonesia. There was also evidence before me that invoices were issued to the PT Entities by the plaintiffs in other currencies such as US dollars.

First, notwithstanding the reference in the AOD to Indonesian Rupiah amounts, the plaintiffs were quite clearly looking to be paid by the defendant <span class="font-italic">in Singapore dollars</span>. It can be reasonably inferred that the reference by Neo to the “daily limit for Indo to transfer out money <span class="font-italic">overseas</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>…” [emphasis added] was a reference to transferring money from Indonesia <span class="font-italic">to Singapore</span>. This appears consistent with the conclusion I reached above at [97] on the place of performance of the AOD and provides additional support for the inference that the parties intended for Singapore to be the place of performance of the defendant’s payment obligations under the AOD, where the defendant’s creditor was based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Secondly, the email also suggests that the amounts in the AOD expressed in Indonesian Rupiah were so expressed as a matter of convenience to the defendant more than anything else. I also note that neither party stated in any of their affidavits that the currency mentioned in the AOD was of any particular significance to them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(9) Conclusion on governing law of the AOD</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Considering all of the factors as laid out above, I come to the conclusion that Singapore law is the governing law of the AOD. That is the law which, in my judgment, bears the most close and real connection to the AOD and the circumstances surrounding its inception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 My conclusion that Singapore law governs the AOD is, in this case, a significant factor pointing to Singapore as the clearly appropriate forum to determine the dispute or in O 11 parlance, demonstrating that this case is a proper one for service out of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Witness compellability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiffs submitted that most of the witnesses who are likely to be called by them are individuals who either negotiated or signed the AOD, namely Jason Kardachi, Schwarz, Quek and Foong. These individuals are all based in Singapore. As the defendant took issue with the construction of the terms of the AOD, the governing law of the AOD and its enforceability, as well as when the defendant’s liability to pay crystallised and the sums due and owing under the AOD, these witnesses would be able to speak to these matters.

This is because the defendant intends to call non-party witnesses who reside in Indonesia (see <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar </span>at [73]). The plaintiffs submitted that it was unclear why Sri Linawati and Sri Siniyati Wijaya would be specifically required to testify that the new PT entity had not commenced operationally or that the Outstanding Balance was not owed by the PT Entities.

</div> However, as stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [67], the threshold at this stage is for the defendant to show that evidence from foreign witnesses is “at least arguably relevant to its defence”.

First, the parties involved in the dispute in the Indonesian Proceedings are different to those in S 617. The causes of action and reliefs sought in both proceedings also appear to be different, even though there may be some overlap in terms of the <span class="font-italic">factual</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>assertions that may be advanced in both sets of proceedings. In so far as the Term Sheet and its validity play some part in both sets of proceedings, I am prepared to accept that there is an overlap in some of the issues in both sets of proceedings.

This risk has to be weighed against other factors such as:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the parties and causes of action overlap or are different in the two sets of proceedings; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the situation presented is a true <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span>, or a case involving a “reversed parties” scenario, or simply a case of different proceedings being commenced by different parties; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) all the other relevant factors in determining which jurisdiction would be the natural forum to determine the dispute (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [90]; <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar</span> at [59] and [70];<span class="font-italic"> Raffles Education </span>at [89]–[91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Further, I have concluded that the governing law of the AOD is Singapore law (see [119]). If I accept the defendant’s case that the AOD would be null and void, and unenforceable in any proceedings brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant before the Indonesian courts, it appears counter-intuitive to give weight to the Indonesian Proceedings in the proper forum analysis. In any event and purely to complete the picture, counsel for the parties updated the court during the hearing of the defendant’s application for leave to appeal that the Indonesian court had dismissed the Indonesian Proceedings on 17 November 2020 and that the PT Entities have lodged an appeal against the dismissal. As these developments only occurred after I rendered my decision, they obviously played no part in my deliberations on SUM 5867. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other factors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I deal briefly with the remaining factors that the parties had raised in argument. The plaintiffs submitted that the parties have personal connections which tie the dispute to Singapore. Most of the parties in S 617 are companies incorporated in Singapore and the defendant owns property in Singapore. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the domicile of the parties is a neutral factor in this case.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In relation to the domiciles of the parties, I agree with the parties that it is a neutral factor in this case. As for the location of documentary evidence, I am also of the view that it is a neutral factor. There is no evidence from either party that there is a voluminous amount of documentary evidence available only in hard copy form, or (in the defendant’s case) that transporting documents from Indonesia to Singapore would pose any particular or extraordinary challenge that I should take note of. Nor was there any suggestion by either party that translation of documents was an issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Conclusion on the natural forum requirement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Taking into consideration the different factors which I have highlighted above, I conclude that Singapore law is the law that has the <span class="font-italic">most</span> close or real connection with the AOD <span class="font-italic">and</span> the circumstances surrounding its inception. Qualitatively, I find that to be a weighty factor pointing to Singapore as the clearly more appropriate forum in which the dispute in S 617 is to be determined. In my judgment, on balance, the relevant connecting factors which I have identified, taken as a whole, qualitatively point to Singapore as the clearly more appropriate forum for the trial of this action. Therefore, I find that the three-step test as set out in <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> and <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span> (see [19] above) has been met by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failure to make full and frank disclosure </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I begin this section by first summarising the applicable principles. It is well-settled that a plaintiff applying <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>for leave to serve originating process on a defendant out of jurisdiction is subject to a duty of full and frank disclosure (<span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span><span class="font-italic"> Trikamdas Mody and another v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1161 at [79]). As stated by the Court of Appeal in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Associates Pte Ltd v SBM Offshore NV </span>[2021] SGCA 36 (“<span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span>”) at [12], this is a duty that is “owed to the Court and is driven by the need for the Court to satisfy itself that the case is a <span class="font-italic">proper </span>one for service out of jurisdiction” (emphasis in original). This duty “invariably extends to facts that may go towards rebutting the applicant’s claim”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Ltd v Liu Ming </span>[2019] 1 SLR 779, the Court of Appeal cited its earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 and held that the test of materiality is “whether the facts in question are matters that the court would likely take into consideration in making its decision” (see also <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span><span class="font-italic"> Communications </span>at [68]). The applicant is to “identify the crucial points for and against the application, and not rely on general statements and the mere exhibiting of numerous documents” (at [105]). The key question is ultimately whether the facts disclosed are “sufficient for [the] purpose of making an informed and fair decision on the outcome of the application, such that the threshold of full and frank disclosure can be meaningfully said to be crossed” (at [106]). The court further considered that a “balance must be struck between protecting the defendant from abuse and unduly impeding the plaintiff from serving proceedings”, such that an informed and fair decision could be reached “without necessarily requiring an applicant to canvass the arguments against his own case as thoroughly as his opponent would if present” (at [106]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The Court of Appeal also recently held in <span class="font-italic">Steep Rise </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Attorney-General </span>[2020] 1 SLR 872 that the <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte</span> applicant must disclose defences that may be reasonably raised by the defendant, but the duty “extends only to plausible defences and not fanciful or theoretical ones” (at [23]). The duty to make full and frank disclosure requires the applicant to also disclose “such additional facts which he would have known if he had made proper inquiries”, and not only material facts known to him (<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah) </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 786(“<span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex</span>”) at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The plaintiffs sought to rely on <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Eagle Prestige” </span>[2010] 3 SLR 294 (“<span class="font-italic">The Eagle Prestige</span>”) for the proposition that they need only raise defences which possessed the quality of a “knock out blow” to the plaintiffs’ case.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Conversely, the defendant argued that the duty of full and frank disclosure was not limited to the disclosure of “knock out blow” defences. In <span class="font-italic">The Eagle Prestige</span>, the court was concerned with the issue of whether it had admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>jurisdiction, and the court was making a finding on whether the claimant had proved that it had a good arguable case that its claim fell within one of the limbs of s 3(1) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed). This is a different issue from the question in the present case, which is whether the plaintiffs had a good arguable case on the merits.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I agree with the defendant that the principle in <span class="font-italic">The Eagle Prestige </span>is not one of general application across all <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte</span> applications but is limited to its context of an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> and the disclosure obligations imposed by the law on a plaintiff in such an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> when applying <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte</span> for a warrant of arrest against the ship concerned. In <span class="font-italic">The Eagle Prestige</span>, Belinda Ang J (as she then was) held that the duty to disclose plausible defences is not generally directed at defences that may be raised at trial in answer to the plaintiff’s underlying claim but in a broader perspective, to matters that may constitute an abuse of process. Ang J specifically pointed out that in the context of an application for a warrant of arrest, the concerns of the court were with considerations germane to its jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> and generally <span class="font-italic">not </span>with the merits of the claim. Consequently, material facts would be facts relevant to the court’s decision whether to grant the application for the arrest warrant, such that defences to the claim at trial need not generally be disclosed. The exception to this is where the matters, if disclosed, would show up the claim as an abuse of process or one that was so obviously frivolous and vexatious as to be open to summary dismissal, such that the non-disclosure would be tantamount to or constitute an abuse of process (at [73]–[75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On the other hand, the threshold requirements for obtaining leave to serve originating process out of jurisdiction under O 11 of the ROC clearly do engage<span class="font-italic"> </span>the merits of the case (see [19] above). Thus, the discussion and holding in <span class="font-italic">The Eagle Prestige </span>on disclosure of plausible defences in an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application for a warrant of arrest in an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> are inapplicable in the context of an application for leave to serve originating process <span class="font-italic">ex juris</span> under O 11 of the ROC. The law on whether an applicant has met its obligation of full and frank disclosure in an O 11 case is as set out in the established line of case authorities referred to at [133]–[135] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Having discussed the general principles, I turn now to their application to the facts of this case. The defendant submitted that the plaintiffs did not make full and frank disclosure and had failed to disclose the following facts in their affidavit supporting the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>leave application:

When the commercial relationship broke down and the plaintiffs discovered that PT API had been set up and was taking steps in Indonesia to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, register marks belonging to the first plaintiff, they commenced S 617 and identified PT API as the “new PT” entity.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 On the evidence and based on the arguments presented, I find that there were some instances of material non-disclosure on the part of the plaintiffs. The  existence of the Indonesian Proceedings, the change in the identity of the “new PT” entity from PT APP to PT API, and the fact that the 2005 PTCU agreements provided for Indonesian law as their governing law were, in my view, relevant to the application for leave to serve out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The plaintiffs did not dispute that they were aware of the Indonesian Proceedings at the material time even though the first plaintiff may not have yet been formally served with the proceedings then. Whilst the causes of action and parties in both sets of proceedings might be different, it is undeniable that there are some overlapping issues in both sets of proceedings. The existence of parallel or related proceedings would be a relevant fact for the court to be apprised of in considering whether to grant leave to serve the originating processes out of jurisdiction. As for the 2005 PTCU agreements, they would have had some relevance to the issue of the governing law of the AOD even though those agreements preceded the Term Sheet. The governing law of the AOD was relevant to the application both as a jurisdictional gateway requirement under O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC and when considering the natural forum requirement. Lastly, the identity of the “new PT” entity and the change from PT APP to PT API would have been relevant when considering the merits of the case. Thus, I find that, objectively, these facts would have been relevant to the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application for leave to serve out and could well have been taken into consideration by the assistant registrar who granted the Service Out Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 It is settled law that even though there are material non-disclosures by an applicant in an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application, the court nevertheless retains a discretion not to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> order granted, or to deal with the non-disclosure by granting a fresh order in the light of the facts before it at the <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> setting aside hearing. In exercising its discretion, the court would consider whether the non-disclosure was “inadvertent or innocent (in the sense that the applicant did not know that fact, forgotten its existence, or failed to perceive its relevance), or whether it was deliberate and intended to mislead the court” (<span class="font-italic">Bahtera</span><span class="font-italic"> Offshore (M) Sdn Bhd v Sim Kok Beng and another </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 365 at [25]–[27]; see also <span class="font-italic">Brink’s-Mat Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Elcombe </span>[1988] 3 All ER 188 at 193; <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span>at [27]–[33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In the present case, I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs’ non-disclosures could be classified as deliberate or intended to mislead the court.

The defendant took the position that the relevant transaction involving the plaintiffs took place in Indonesia and that any relevant witnesses as well as documentary evidence relating to any dispute between the parties would also be situated in Indonesia. Indonesia should therefore be the natural forum to adjudicate the dispute (Affidavit at [50(a)]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I find that the plaintiffs had sought to disclose the defendant’s key substantive defences as they had understood it. I contrast the present case with that of <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span>, where the court found that there was deliberate suppression or non-disclosure of material information. In <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span>, the appellant was fully aware of the respondent’s defence that it had not contracted with the appellant, and that the contract was instead concluded between the appellant and another subsidiary. However, in its <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>application, there was a “complete and conspicuous absence” of any reference by the plaintiff to that subsidiary (at [18]). Critically, if the proper disclosures had been made by the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span>, it would have demonstrated that plaintiff <span class="font-italic">did not</span> have <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ny</span> good arguable case that its claim fell within <span class="font-italic">the asserted jurisdictional gateway</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) ROC) as it would have demonstrated that the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">no contract</span> with the defendant. It suffices to say that the facts and extent of non-disclosures in <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span> are somewhat extreme and the evidence pointing to the non-disclosure being “deliberate and systematic” was compelling. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In the present case, however, whilst there was material information which should have been placed before the court as I have highlighted above at [143], none of the facts, singly or collectively, would have fatally impacted the plaintiffs’ ability to bring themselves within at least one of the jurisdictional gateways in O 11 r 1 of the ROC – I refer to O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) specifically. I consider this to be a material difference between this case and <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span>. The evidence overall also did not suggest to me that the plaintiffs had deliberately omitted to disclose any major defence available to the defendant, and this included the plaintiffs’ decision to switch the identity of the “new PT” entity referred to in the AOD from PT APP as initially envisaged to PT API. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Further, there would, in my view, be little purpose in discharging the Service Out Order, since the plaintiffs would be entitled to re-apply for leave on the evidence before me at the setting aside application (see <span class="font-italic">IM </span><span class="font-italic">Skaugen SE and another v MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE and another </span>[2018] SGHC 123 <span class="font-italic">(“IM </span><span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC)”)</span> at [79]; I pause here to note that while <span class="font-italic">IM </span><span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC)</span> was reversed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MAN Diesel &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Turbo SE</span>, the Court of Appeal did not disturb or overturn <span class="font-italic">IM </span><span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC)</span> on this discrete point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Viewing the matter in the round, the non-disclosures in this case, while not trivial, were at the same time not so egregious as to warrant the setting aside of the Service Out Order. If a fresh application had been made before me at the hearing of the setting aside application, I would have granted the plaintiffs leave to serve out based on the evidence and information then available. In the circumstances, setting aside the Service Out Order would, in my view, represent a disproportionate outcome bearing in mind that a key consideration in challenges of this nature is whether the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> applicant has gained some unfair advantage by reason of the non-disclosure(s). Therefore, in the exercise of my discretion, I declined to set aside the Service Out Order and upheld it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Substituted Service Order should be set aside </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The final issue for consideration in SUM 5867 is whether the Substituted Service Order (HC/ORC 6729/2019) granting the plaintiffs leave to effect substituted service of the Writ and SOC on the defendant should be set aside. The Substituted Service Order provided that service could be effected on the defendant by sending copies of the Writ and SOC (i) by registered post to the defendant’s address in Indonesia and/or (ii) through the smartphone messaging platform “Whatsapp” to the defendant’s mobile phone number as specified in the Substituted Service Order. The defendant contends that the Substituted Service Order should be set aside as both modes of service stipulated therein contravene Indonesian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152  In support of her position, the defendant relied on an Indonesian law expert opinion provided by Sitepu. Sitepu opined that the “only mode of service of foreign process is by way of sending rogatory letters through diplomatic channel, which process has been mandated” by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (opened for signature 24 April 1963), 596 UNTS 261 (entered into force 19 March 1967) (“Vienna Convention”).

</div> Article 5(j) of the Vienna Convention expressly identifies the transmission of judicial documents as a consular function. The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Indonesian courts had, first in 2013 and subsequently in 2018, enacted a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) “to ensure that the transmission of judicial documents would be effected in a manner compatible with the laws and regulations of Indonesia”. This MOU regarding Letters Rogatory Management and Request for Assistance on Civil Matters Document Delivery from a Foreign Court to an Indonesian Court and from an Indonesian Court to a Foreign Court sets out the procedure for service of foreign court documents in Indonesia.

Under O 11 rr 3(2) and 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, service would not be valid if it is contrary to the law of the foreign country. Service could contravene foreign law in two ways: (a) because it failed to comply with a <span class="font-italic">mandatory</span> manner of service of foreign process prescribed by the foreign law; or (b) because it had been effected in a manner specifically <span class="font-italic">prohibited</span> by the foreign law (at [104]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The defendant has not provided any credible evidence to support her contention that that the HIR applies to service of foreign process also.
