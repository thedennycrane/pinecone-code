<p align="justify">Facts</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The plaintiffs were a

company incorporated in Taiwan. The defendants were a company incorporated in Singapore.

The plaintiffs entered into a contract for the purchase of shredded and sudare cuttlefish

from the defendants on 12 September 1994. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The defendants failed to

deliver the goods and the plaintiffs then sued for recovery of an advance payment made to

them in the Taiwan courts. The plaintiffs obtained a judgment for New Taiwan Dollars (NT$)

1,482,010 against the defendants in the Taipei District Court in 1995 in relation to a

failure by the defendants. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The plaintiff then commenced

an action in Singapore to sue on the Taiwan judgment on 15 October 2001, as it could not

be registered under the Singapore Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap.

265). The defendants applied to strike out the plaintiffs’ claim in the Singaporean

action on the grounds that the contract with the plaintiffs was illegal for breach of

Taiwan’s import regulations; thus the judgment, which had been obtained in reliance

on that agreement should not be enforced in the Singaporean courts. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The defendants also argued

that it was open to them to raise the issue of illegality in the Singaporean courts even

though it had not been raised by them before the Taiwanese courts. The plaintiffs argued

that there was no evidence that the contract was illegal and, even if so, that it was thus

void <i>ab initio</i>. They also contended that it was not open to the defendants to raise

this issue of illegality since it was not raised by them during proceedings in Taiwan.

They relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Hong Pian Tee v Les Placements

Germain Gauthier Inc </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=63015&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 2 SLR 81</a> where it had been stressed that the enforcement

forum should not act as an appellate tribunal with respect to the final decision of a

foreign court</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing the defendants’ application:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1)        Although there was

evidence of the illegality of the contract, what was essential here was whether the

contract was void or unenforceable by reason of that illegality. This was a point that

could not be resolved based simply on the affidavit evidence which had been provided. (see

 41-43)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2)        Even though the issue of

illegality had not been raised in proceedings before the courts in Taiwan, it is not open

to the defendants to raise it before our courts, for the reasons given in <i>Hong. </i>The

fact that the appellant in <i>Hong </i>had sought to raise an issue of fraud, and not

illegality as in the present case does not put the plaintiff here in a better position. <i>Hong

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.        The

Plaintiff Wu Shun Foods Co Ltd (‘Wu Shun’) is a company incorporated under the

laws of Taiwan. The Defendant Ken Ken Food Manufacturing Pte Ltd (‘Ken Ken’) is

a company incorporated in Singapore. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        In

April 1995, Wu Shun commenced action against Ken Ken in the Taipei District Court seeking

recovery of New Taiwan Dollars (NT$) 1,482,010 being the balance of an advance payment

made by Wu Shun to Ken Ken for goods under a Sale and Purchase Contract dated 12 September

1994 between the parties, which Ken Ken failed to deliver.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        Wu

Shun succeeded and obtained a judgment from the Taipei District Court ordering Ken Ken to

pay the sum claimed, interest and costs. Ken Ken’s appeals to the Taiwan High Court

and the Supreme Court of Taiwan were unsuccessful. I will say more on the proceedings in

Taiwan later.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        Wu

Shun said that as it could not register the Taiwan judgment it had obtained under the

Singapore Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265), it commenced an

action in Singapore on 15 October 2001 to sue on the Taiwan judgment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        On

22 October 2001, Ken Ken entered an appearance to the Singapore action and applied for

security for costs on the ground that Wu Shun was ordinarily resident out of Singapore and

for a stay of further steps in the meantime.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.        On 5

December 2001, Wu Shun applied for summary judgment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.        On

11 December 2001, both the application for security for costs and for summary judgment

were adjourned to 22 January 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        On

22 January 2002, the applications were adjourned to 29 January 2002 pending the decision

of the Singapore Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 600101 of 2001 <em>Hong Pian Tee v Les

Placements Germain Gauthier Inc (‘Hong’s</em> case). The judgment of the Court

of Appeal is reported in [2002] 1 SLR 81.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        On

28 January 2002, Ken Ken applied to strike out Wu Shun’s claim in the Singapore

action. Ken Ken relied on two grounds:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)

            the amount stated in the Taiwan judgment was

    wrong.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)

            Wu Shun’s claim in Taiwan was based on an

    illegal contract because the contract in question related to the importing of squid which

    was prohibited under Taiwan law.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<b><i><font size="4">
</font></i></b></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        On 29 January 2002, the Deputy Registrar Ms Ong

Chin Rhu directed that the striking out application be heard first. After hearing

arguments, she dismissed the application for striking out. She then gave directions in

respect of Wu Shun’s application for summary judgment and Ken Ken’s application

for security for costs.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        On 21 February 2002, Ken Ken filed a Notice of

Appeal to the District Judge on the sole ground of illegality.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        On 25 May 2002, District Judge Ng Peng Hong

dismissed Ken Ken’s appeal after hearing arguments and gave directions with respect

to the application for security for costs. The application for summary judgment had still

not been heard by then.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        On 8 April 2002, Ken Ken served its Notice of

Appeal to the High Court against the District Judge’s decision. This appeal was heard

by me. The only issue before me was the one based on illegality. After hearing arguments,

I dismissed the appeal. Ken Ken is appealing to the Court of Appeal.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Arguments for Ken Ken</font></em></b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        Ken Ken relied primarily on two affidavits. The

first is the second affidavit from Ken H C Chiu, an Attorney-At-Law in Taipei, Taiwan. </font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        Mr Chiu’s affidavit was to the effect that

at all material times, the import of squid (except prepared or preserved squid which is

canned) into Taiwan was illegal under the Lists of Goods the Import of Which is Restricted

published by the Board of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan,

unless a prior import permit was obtained from the relevant authority. I will refer to the

Lists as ‘the import regulation’ for convenience. An importer who did so,

without the permit, was liable to be fined and could be suspended from importing goods for

a certain duration. Also the goods could be considered smuggled goods and confiscated.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        The other affidavit which Ken Ken relied on

primarily was the third affidavit from its director Tay Kian Guan. He said that although

the contract was for shredded and sudare cuttlefish, this was in fact composed of dried or

salted squid. Squid is a kind of cuttlefish. He also alleged that representatives of Wu

Shun had attended at Ken Ken’s factory premises in Singapore and saw that Ken Ken

processed only squid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.        In

response, Wu Shun obtained an affidavit from Yuhsin Peng, another Attorney-At-Law from

Taipei, Taiwan. She said that the sale and purchase contract in question was enforceable

under Taiwan law despite the import regulation. The contract was not illegal and the

Taiwan judgment dated 8 June 2000 of the Taiwan Supreme Court is valid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.        Mr

Andrew Ho, for Ken Ken, stressed that there was no denial by Wu Shun or Yuhsin Peng that

there was a breach of the import regulation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.        He

then relied on a number of cases on illegality but it is not necessary for me to deal with

those cases. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.        He

also sought to persuade me that it was open to Ken Ken to raise the issue of illegality

even though it was not raised before any of the courts in Taiwan. On this point, he relied

on other cases of which I need only refer to a few.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.        In <em>Batra

v Ebrahim</em> [1982] 2 Lloyds Rep 11, Lawton LJ said at p 13:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘…. On this basis it

    seems to me that if it appears to the Court that a party is suing on a contract which is

    made unenforceable by art. VIII, (2)(b), then the Court must itself take the point and

    decline to enforce the contract. …. But for present purposes the important point is

    that if the contract appears to be one which is contrary to the exchange control

    regulations of India, then it is unenforceable in England and it is the duty of this Court

    to take the point, even though not pleaded nor taken below.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr. Summerfield urged before us -

    this is a new point which was not taken in the Court below - that there might be an

    adjournment for him to consider it further or there might be a new trial, and things of

    that kind. But I must say, when this matter is looked at broadly in the light of the

    Bretton Woods Agreements and the policy thereunder, it seems to me that we do not need a

    further adjournment or a new trial or anything of that kind. To my mind these transactions

    are plainly unenforceable in these Courts, and I would allow the appeal accordingly and

    give judgment for the defendant.’</font></p>

461F:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘…. It is well

    established as a general principle that the illegality of an agreement sued upon is a

    matter of which the court is obliged, once it is apprised of facts tending to support the

    </em>Auerbach) for clearly, no court could knowingly be party to the enforcement of an

    unlawful agreement. ….’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        However, these cases did not involve the

enforcement of a foreign judgment in another jurisdiction. Hence Mr Ho turned to and

relied primarily on <em>Soleimany v Soleimany </em>[1999] QB 785. The headnote of that

report states:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘The plaintiff purchased

    quantities of carpets and exported them, illegally, out of Iran to be sold by the

    defendant in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Disputes arose between the parties over the

    division of the proceeds of sale. The parties made an agreement to arbitrate their

    disputes before the Beth Din which applied Jewish law. The award, in favour of the

    plaintiff, referred to the illegality and assessed his share of the profits at 576,574.

    The plaintiff applied to the High Court under section 26 of the Arbitration Act 1950 to

    register the award as a judgment. The master made an order granting leave to enter

    judgment for the sum of 576,574, and gave leave to enforce the award. The defendant

    applied to set aside the order on the grounds that illegality rendered the

    plaintiff’s claim void or unenforceable in an English court, and that it would be

    contrary to public policy for an award founded on an illegal agreement or transaction to

    be enforced as a judgment of the High Court pursuant to section 26 of the Act of 1950. The

    judge refused the defendant’s application holding, inter alia, that a contract,

    otherwise unenforceable for illegality, became enforceable if the procedural law of the

    arbitration attached no significance to the illegality.</font><i><b></b></i></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">On appeal by the defendant:-<i><b></b></i></font></p>
<p align="justify">Held, allowing the appeal, that it was apparent from the face

    of the award that the arbitrator was dealing with an illicit enterprise under which it was

    the joint intention that carpets would be smuggled out of Iran illegally, but that he

    considered the illegality to be of no relevance since he was applying Jewish law under

    which any purported illegality would have no effect on the rights of the parties; ….

    That an award, whether domestic or foreign, would not be enforced by an English court if

    enforcement would be contrary to public policy and the interposition of an arbitration

    award did not isolate the successful party’s claim from the illegality which gave

    rise to it: and that, in the circumstances, the award should not be enforced by the

    English courts ….’</p>
</blockquote></ol></font>
<i><b>
<p></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        Waller LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court

of Appeal, said, at p 803 and 804:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘Finally, under this head, we should state

    explicitly what may already have been apparent: when considering illegality of the

    underlying contract, we do not confine ourselves to English law. An English court will not

    enforce a contract governed by English law, or to be performed in England, which is

    illegal by English domestic law. Nor will it enforce a contract governed by the law of a

    foreign and friendly state, or which requires performance in such a country, if

    performance is illegal by the law of that country. That is well established as appears

    from the citations earlier in this judgment. This rule applies as much to the enforcement

    of an arbitration award as to the direct enforcement of a contract in legal

    proceedings.’<b><i></i></b></font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">29.        He further submitted that

even if the contract was illegal, an action to recover money paid could still succeed in

Taiwan.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.        As regards the question

whether it was open to Ken Ken to now raise the point about illegality, Mr Hee stressed

that there were in fact five hearings in Taiwan which he elaborated on as follows:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a)        On 4

    December 1995, the Taipei District Court gave judgment in favour of Wu Shun and ordered

    Ken Ken to pay to Wu Shun the sum of NT$1,482,010, interest and costs of the action. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b)        In 1997,

    Ken Ken appealed to the Taiwan High Court against the judgment of 4 December 1995. On 14

    April 1997, the High Court dismissed Ken Ken’s appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c)        On 14

    April 1997, Ken Ken appealed to the Supreme Court of Taiwan against the judgment of 14

    April 1997. On 28 May 1998, the Supreme Court of Taiwan allowed Ken Ken’s appeal and

    directed a rehearing of its appeal at the Taiwan High Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d)        On 16

    December 1998, there was a rehearing at the Taiwan High Court. Ken Ken’s appeal was

    again dismissed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(e)        Ken Ken

    then appealed again to the Supreme Court of Taiwan against the judgment of 16 December

    1998. On 8 June 2000, the Supreme Court of Taiwan dismissed its appeal.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<b><i><font size="4">
</font></i></b></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.        Mr Hee also

submitted that Ken Ken was represented by lawyers throughout the legal proceedings.

Indeed, Ken Chiu was the very lawyer representing Ken Ken in the later part of the legal

proceedings in Taiwan and yet he too did not raise the point about illegality. On the

other hand, Wu Shun was not represented by any lawyer. Its case was conducted through its

representative Huang Ho Yun. </font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.        Mr Hee relied on

the decision of our Court of Appeal in Hong’s case. The headnote of the report

states:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<strong>Facts</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The respondent (‘Les Placements’) was a

    Canadian company which entered into a loan agreement (‘the loan agreement’) with

    a Singapore company, Wiraco Trading Pte Ltd (‘Wiraco’), in 1995. At the time of

    the loan agreement, the President of Les Placements was one Mr Germain Gauthier

    (‘Germain’). Under the terms of the agreement, Les Placements was to lend Wiraco

    C$350,000 and the appellant (‘Hong’) gave Les Placements a guarantee to ensure

    the repayment of the loan. [I would add that the guarantee from Hong was addressed to

    Germain.] Wiraco subsequently defaulted in repaying the loan and Les Placements commenced

    proceedings against it and Hong in the Superior Court of the District of Montreal, Quebec,

    Canada. At the trial, Hong alleged that he had never guaranteed a loan from Les Placements

    to Wiraco. Instead, he claimed that either the guarantee he executed related to a personal

    loan from Germain to Wiraco which was never effected, or that the arrangement was that

    Germain was to extend a personal loan to him. The thrust of his defences was therefore

    that there was no privity of contract between Hong and Les Placements. The Canadian court

    rejected Hong’s defences and held that in relation to the loan transaction, Germain

    was not acting for himself but on behalf of Les Placements, and that the guarantee was

    addressed to him as the head of Les Placements. It then held that both Hong and Wiraco

    were jointly and severally liable to Les Placements for C$360,645 plus interest and costs.

    Dissatisfied with this decision, Hong and Wiraco appealed to the Court of Appeal in Quebec

    but their appeal was disallowed.</font><b><i></i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Upon obtaining the judgment in Canada, Les

    Placements commenced a writ action in Singapore to enforce the Canadian judgment against

    Hong under common law. It then applied for, and received, summary judgment in its favour.

    Hong appealed, arguing that the Canadian judgment had been obtained by fraud because Les

    Placements had fraudulently failed to disclose to the Canadian court that the guarantee

    was addressed to Germain and not Les Placements. As such, the Canadian judgment was not

    conclusive and that this was so, even if the defence of fraud had been investigated into

    by the Canadian court and rejected. Furthermore, Hong argued that he was entitled to have

    the issue of fraud re-litigated in Singapore even if there was no new material before the

    court supporting his allegation of fraud. Finally, Hong asserted that there were, in any

    case, fresh material to support his allegation: the sworn statements of two witnesses

    which were prepared by Les Placements in the Canadian proceedings but were never produced

    before the Canadian court.’</font><b><i></i></b></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p></p></font><font size="3">33.        I would add

that Hong’s appeal to the Singapore High Court was dismissed and his appeal to the

Court of Appeal was also dismissed.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.        I continue with the

headnote, which states:</font><font size="4">

<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<strong>Held</strong>, dismissing the appeal:</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p></ol></font><font size="3">(1)</font><font size="4">   </font><font size="3">     ….</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">(2) </font><font size="4">  </font><font size="3">     There were two distinct views as to how a domestic court

  should treat a foreign judgment where fraud was raised in relation to that foreign

  judgment, the English position as enunciated in <em>Abouloff v Oppenheimer &amp; Co</em>

  (1882) 10 QBD 295 and the Canadian-Australian approach laid down in <em>Jacobs v Beaver

  Silver Cobalt Mining Co</em> (1908) 17 OLR 496 and <em>Keele v Findley</em> (1990) 21

  NSWLR 444. Under the former approach, so long as fraud was alleged, the defendant was

  entitled to reopen the issue of fraud even though no new evidence was produced and even

  though the fraud might have been, and was, alleged in the foreign proceedings. The latter

  approach allowed the examination of the merits of the foreign judgment only if extrinsic

  fraud was alleged or if the defendant had discovered evidence of intrinsic fraud after the

  foreign judgment was passed. The latter approach is consistent with the approach taken by

  courts when facing an allegation of fraud vis--vis domestic judgments (see  15-26).</font><font size="4"><b><i></i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">(3)</font><font size="4">   </font>  

  <font size="3">….</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4)        ….</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5)        Hong had objected to the

  admission of the two sworn statements in the Canadian proceedings and now sought to rely

  on them to show that the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud. He knew of the existence

  of the statements and of what the two persons stated therein. There was therefore no new

  evidence of fraud (see  32). ….’ </p>
<b xmlns=""><i><font size="4">
<p></p></font></i></b><font size="3" xmlns="">35.        I now cite

from the judgment of Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Hong’s</em> case:</font>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3"><i>‘Our approach</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">27        There were,

    therefore, before us, two distinct views as to how a domestic court should treat a foreign

    judgment where fraud is raised in relation to that foreign judgment. One is that

    enunciated in <em>Abouloff </em>(supra) and the other advocated by the Canadian-Australian

    cases which sought to limit the circumstances under which a domestic court may re-open an

    issue already determined by a foreign judgment including an allegation of fraud. In our

    judgment the approach adopted in <em>Abouloff</em> has less to commend itself as it<b><i> </i></b>would

    <u>only encourage endless litigation. It is of paramount importance that there should be

    finality</u>. Every losing party understandably would like to litigate the issue over

    again with the hope that a different tribunal would look at the fact situation

    differently. But that can never be a good reason for allowing a losing party to re-open

    issues. To liberally allow a party to do so would be to permit that party to have a second

    bite at the cherry, an eventuality which is generally abhorred by all civilised systems of

    law. Of course, we are conscious that the rule against re-opening issues is not absolute.

    There are exceptions but they are subject to safeguards. In England, an issue already

    adjudicated upon by the domestic courts would not, as a rule, be allowed to be

    re-litigated. There is no logical reason why a different rule should apply in relation to

    a foreign judgment.<b><i></i></b></font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">28</font><font size="4">   </font><font size="3">     It is also vitally important that no court of one

    jurisdiction should pass judgment on an issue already decided upon by a competent court of

    another jurisdiction. This is the doctrine of comity. After all, two tribunals, both

    acting conscientiously and diligently, could very well come to a different conclusion on

    the same facts. There is no question of which is being more correct. To seek to make such

    an evaluation would be an invidious exercise and could lead to the undesirable consequence

    which we have mentioned before of encouraging judicial chauvanism. <u>It must be borne in

    mind that the enforcement forum is not an appellate tribunal vis--vis the foreign

    judgment</u>.<b><i></i></b></font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">29</font><font size="4">   </font><font size="3">     We note here that in <em>Owens Bank v Etoile Commerciale

    SA</em> [1995] 1 WLR 44, Lord Templemen, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council

    observed that it did not ‘regard the decision in <em>Abouloff </em>… with

    enthusiasm’. In <em>Etoile Commerciale</em> the Privy Council adopted the approach

    taken by the Court of Appeal in <em>Waite</em> (supra) rather than that in <em>Abouloff.</em></font></p>
<p align="justify">30        In our judgment, the

    approach taken by the Canadian-Australian cases and <em>Ralli v Angullia</em> (supra) is

    more in line with principles of conflict of laws and treats foreign judgments in the same

    way as domestic judgments. It is consonant with the doctrine of comity of nations. <u>It

    avoids any appearance that this court is sitting in an appellate capacity over a final

    decision of a foreign court</u>. We, therefore, ruled that where an allegation of fraud

    had been considered and adjudicated upon by a competent foreign court, the foreign

    judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud only where fresh evidence has come to

    light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered and

    the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result of

    the case. There is no necessity for us to offer any views on the jurisprudential question

    whether a foreign judgment created a new and independent obligation distinct from that of

    the underlying or original cause of action, raised by Woodward J in <em>Ralli v Angullia.</em><i><b></b></i></p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">31</font><font size="4">   </font><font size="3">     This common law principle of according finality to a

    foreign judgment was at one time thought to be based on the doctrine of comity. ….

    However, this theory seems to have given way to what is known as the doctrine of

    obligations, .... Whatever may be the correct legal foundation, or for that matter it

    could be a combination of both, the cardinal principle is that no one court should sit in

    judgment over the final decision of a competent court of another jurisdiction. <u>A party,

    litigating in a foreign court, must diligently muster all the evidence and raise all

    pertinent issues in that forum. He should not have any expectation that any carelessness

    or omission on his part could nevertheless be made good in the forum of enforcement</u>.’<b><i></i></b></font></p>

</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.        As regards <em>Soleimany

v Soleimany</em>, Mr Hee pointed out that the illegality aspect was already apparent from

the award itself. Furthermore at p 797, Waller LJ said:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">‘We stress that we are dealing with a judgment

<font size="3"><p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]<b><i></i></b></p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">Ken Ken’s response</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.        In response, Mr Ho sought

to distinguish <em>Hong’s </em>case on the argument that the defendant there sought

to raise the issue of fraud and not illegality. He submitted that illegality is not cured

by a judgment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.        In response to my query as

to whether a judgment by our highest court, the Court of Appeal, could be set aside in

Singapore, say, one year later, on the ground of illegality, Mr Ho submitted that such a

judgment could be set aside. Ms Wan, who also appeared for Ken Ken, went further to stress

that as in <em>Batra v Ebrahim,</em> once illegality is raised, the court must itself take

up the point and decline to enforce the contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.        I have two observations on

this submission.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">40.        First, as I have said, <em>Batra

v Ebrahim</em> was not a case involving the enforcement of a foreign judgment in England.

There the question of illegality was not taken in the English court of first instance but

was considered in the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">41.        Secondly, it is also not

authority for the proposition that after a judgment is made against a litigant, and

assuming no further appeal, that litigant could subsequently succeed in a fresh

application to set aside the judgment on the ground that he had omitted to take the point

that the underlying contract was illegal. Indeed, I very much doubt that such a litigant

could succeed in this endeavour.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><i><font size="3">My Decision</font><font size="4"></font></i></b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">42.        In the face

of the evidence from Ken Ken, I was of the view that it could not be said that there was

no evidence of illegality. Also neither Wu Shun nor Yuhsin Peng had denied a breach of the

import regulation although Yuhsin Peng had said the contract was not illegal. Ms Peng had

also said that the contract was enforceable. On the other hand, Mr Chiu did not go so far

as to assert that the contract was not enforceable or that under Taiwan law, the monies

advanced could not be repaid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">43.        If I were to adopt the

technical and narrow approach that Mr Ho was advocating, Ken Ken’s application on the

affidavits alone must fail since it is not sufficient for Mr Chiu to assert a breach and

illegality only. A contract which breaches a law is not necessarily void or unenforceable.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">44.        It seemed to me that even

if there was a breach of the import regulation, it was the effect of the breach which was

significant. This point, if still relevant, could not be resolved through affidavit

evidence alone. It was therefore obvious to me for this reason alone that Ken Ken’s

application to strike out must fail.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">45.        However Ken Ken faced a

more significant hurdle i.e whether it can even raise the issue of illegality before the

Singapore courts.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">46.        For the reasons given by

our Court of Appeal in <em>Hong’s</em> case, I was of the view that Ken Ken cannot do

so even though the illegality was not raised before any of the courts in Taiwan before.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">47.        I also did not think that

the ground of illegality will put Ken Ken in a stronger position than Mr Hong in <em>Hong’s</em>

case. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">48.        As for the case of <em>Soleimany

v Soleimany,</em> the facts there are different from those before me. I reiterate what

Waller LJ said at p 797:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘We stress that we are dealing with a judgment

    which <em>finds as a fact</em> that it was the common intention to commit an illegal act,

    the foreign court to the contrary <u>or simply no such finding, and one party now seeks

</blockquote>
<b><i><font size="4">
</font></i></b></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">49.        I would add

one more point. Ken Ken had not sought to set aside the Taiwan judgment on the ground of

illegality even though the alleged illegality arises from an import regulation of Taiwan.

It seemed to me that Ken Ken was trying to achieve its purpose through the backdoor

instead of doing so through the front door.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
