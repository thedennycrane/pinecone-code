Sara also informed him on that call that there was a “bungkus” for him and that the Boy had locked the Box.

When he unlocked the Box with one of the Keys, he saw the Red Bag and the White Package. He took the White Package and then closed the lid of the Box but did not lock the Box. He did not check what was in the Red Bag because Sara had already informed him that it contained “panas” items just like in the previous incident. Munusamy subsequently found out that the White Package contained a handphone when he returned to the cleaners’ room at Tower 2 and opened it.

There is no need to prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs or even something that turns out to be contraband. To prove knowledge, the accused must be shown to know not only of the existence of the thing which is later found to be a drug, but also knowledge of the specific drug. (See <span class="font-italic">Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 254 at [32], [34] and [35]; <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 2 SLR 1375 at [54].)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Prosecution also relied on the presumptions of knowledge and possession under ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA. In particular, s 18(2) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(2)   Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 To rebut the presumption under s 18(2), the accused must prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know of the nature of the drug. The presumption may be rebutted by proving that the accused genuinely believed that he was in possession of something innocuous or of some contraband item or drug other than the specific drug in possession. He has to adduce sufficient evidence disclosing the basis upon which he claims to have arrived at that subjective state of mind (<span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) at [58]–[59]). However, an accused who is indifferent to what he is carrying cannot be said to believe that the nature of the thing in his possession is something other than or incompatible with the specific drug he is in possession of. Where he is in a position to ascertain the nature of what he is carrying but chooses not to do so, he may be said to be indifferent to the nature of what he is carrying: (a) where he is in fact wholly indifferent to what he is carrying; or (b) where he knows that what he is carrying is a contraband item, but does not care to find out what that item is or is not (<span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [65] and [67]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether element of possession of the Drugs made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I found that possession was made out.

Tony had explained that he did not record the Conversation immediately because he did not have a field book with him at that time. In any event, I accepted Tony’s account that after James had recorded the Conversation in his field diary, James handed the diary to Tony, and Tony read it back to Munusamy and asked him if he wished to make any amendments to which Munusamy declined.

I had earlier found that the 2nd Statement was accurately recorded. In court, Munusamy stated that Sara was not a drug supplier which I disbelieved and it was inconsistent with the 2nd Statement.

At the very least, given his indifference, he could not be said to believe that the nature of the items in the Red Bag was something other than the specific drug that was in it (see [31] above). Hence the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Indeed, Munusamy’s failure to find out the contents of the Red Bag is to be contrasted with what he claimed he had done during the July 2017 Incident. Assuming the July 2017 Incident occurred (which I had rejected), Munusamy claimed that he had insisted on checking what was in the “bungkus” that Sara had intended to store in the Box then. Munusamy’s deliberate failure to check the contents of the Red Bag must also be looked in the light that on 26 January 2018, Sara did not mention what the “panas” items were but Munusamy merely <span class="font-italic">assumed</span> they were handphones.

If the keyhole had been in a horizontal position, the Box could have been opened merely by unlatching the lid. The keyhole would have remained in the same position as Munusamy left it, as there would have been no reason for it to be turned back to vertical position, given his claim that he did not even latch the Box let alone lock it after he removed the White Package. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 However, the photographs taken of the Box showed otherwise – that the Box was locked when Munusamy was arrested and first brought to the Bike.

Hence a person who holds drugs intending only to return them to the person who originally deposited them with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking” and would not be in possession of the drugs “for the purpose of trafficking”.

Although the Prosecution was not required to prove that Munusamy was moving the drugs closer to their ultimate consumer (<span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> at [114]), I add that what Munusamy did or did not reveal in the Statements showed that he was not a mere “bailee” as in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>, but that he was involved in the “movement of drugs along a supply chain towards end-users”. He knew that Sara could not enter Singapore as Sara was involved in criminal or illegal activities, and by his account in the 2nd and 4th Statements he was awaiting Sara’s instructions on what to do with the Red Bag. I had earlier found no evidence to support that the Red Bag was meant to be returned or moved back to Sara (or the Boy). Munusamy’s act of storing the Red Bag and Drugs for Sara thus constituted part of the process of moving the Drugs along a chain to eventually be distributed to their final customer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Even if I accepted Munusamy’s evidence that he was informed that the Boy would return to collect the Red Bag (which I did not), I would have found that Munusamy was facilitating the process of the distribution of the Drugs along a chain and that he was aware of this.

</div> On the contrary, he claimed that when he met the Boy, the Boy told him that he would hand over the $8,000 to Sara in Malaysia first before returning to Singapore to retrieve the “panas” items (see [26] above). This suggested that the Boy was not intending to return the Red Bag to Sara, as otherwise there was no reason why he could not have taken the Red Bag together with the $8,000 to bring to Malaysia for Sara.  Hence, there was no evidence to show that the Drugs, even if collected by the Boy, were intended to be returned to the owner (namely Sara, according to Munusamy). Munusamy agreed that the contents of the Red Bag belonged to Sara, that Sara was the Boy’s boss (see the 5th Statement), and he claimed that it was Sara who told him on 26 January 2018 that Sara was sending the Boy to put a package in the Bike Box.

IO Wong admitted that he signalled to Nasrulhaq on two occasions when the latter was testifying. First, he picked up the field diary and showed it to Nasrulhaq when the latter was being asked about whether the handover of the Duffel Bag was recorded. Second, he had mouthed the word “diamorphine” towards Nasrulhaq when the latter was asked by the court what the term “heroin” referred to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I rejected IO Wong’s explanation that he did the above “subconsciously”.

</div> Whilst IO Wong’s actions may not have been pre-meditated, it was clear that they were intentional. Indeed, IO Wong initially denied that these two incidents occurred claiming he could not recall,

</div> and it was only after the video footage of the courtroom was viewed by the parties and the court that he admitted to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Additionally, IO Wong admitted that after Nasrulhaq had finished testifying for the day on 6 May 2021, he had spoken to Nasrulhaq. Mr Lukshumayeh stated that this conversation lasted about three to four minutes, although IO Wong stated that he did not know for how long but that what he had done was merely to remind Nasrulhaq to return to court on the next occasion

</div> (as Nasrulhaq’s testimony had not been completed yet).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I found that IO Wong’s conduct did not affect Nasrulhaq’s credibility or the veracity of his testimony nor did it prejudice Munusamy’s case. First, Nasrulhaq had already given substantial evidence in court before he stood down on 6 May 2021. He had completed his examination-in-chief and cross-examination had begun. Second, when the court asked Nasrulhaq which drug “heroin” referred to, as Nasrulhaq had used the term “heroin” in his testimony, this was after his cross-examination had completed. But it is undisputed that “diamorphine” is commonly known as “heroin”. Third, it was undisputed that the chain of custody of the Red Bag and exhibits therein were recorded in the field diary, which the Prosecution had shown a copy to Mr Lukshumayeh subsequently.

</div> In any event, the Defence did not dispute the chain of custody of the drug exhibits nor that the Red Bag was found to contain the Drugs. Munusamy’s defence was that he thought the Red Bag contained handphones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It goes without saying that IO Wong’s conduct was inappropriate and unacceptable. Attempting to prompt a witness who is testifying, even on a point which may turn out to be immaterial or inconsequential, is improper and unbefitting of an enforcement officer. Whilst I found IO Wong’s conduct to be unacceptable, it did not prejudice Munusamy’s case. However, the same might not be said in other instances, where the prompting of or the interfering with a witness may be prejudicial to an accused’s case and cause a miscarriage of justice. I had directed the Public Prosecutor to raise the matter to the attention of the CNB to take appropriate measures and to ensure that officers who are involved in investigations are properly briefed and made aware of the boundaries of their conduct in relation to cases pending in court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Given the quantity of drugs, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death. Section 33B of the MDA gives the court the discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment (with caning), provided the accused satisfies the requirements under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and receives a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Prosecution did not dispute that Munusamy was a courier, and I was satisfied that this was the case. However, it did not issue Munusamy with a certificate of substantive assistance. As Munusamy could not avail himself of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA, I therefore passed the mandatory death sentence on him.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Audrey Lim<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chin Jincheng, Chong Yong and Benedict Chan Wei Qi (Attorney General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mahadevan Lukshumayeh (Lukshumayeh Law Corporation) and Josephine Iezu Costan (David Nayar and Associates) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
