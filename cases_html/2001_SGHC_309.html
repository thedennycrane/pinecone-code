<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1 The 1<sup xmlns="">st</sup> Plaintiff ("Malcomson") is the

Chief Executive Officer of the 2<sup xmlns="">nd</sup> Plaintiff ("Zerity"), a company in

the business of providing financial services.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 In February 2000, the Defendant ("Mehta") commenced

employment in Zerity as an Assistant Vice-President. His responsibilities included looking

into the development of Zerity’s business in the area of e-commerce. However things

apparently did not turn out well and after less than three months, on 28 April 2000, Mehta

sent an e-mail to Malcomson in which he tendered his resignation. The rest of that e-mail

contained a litany of complaints about various people in Zerity. On 2 May, Malcomson

replied to say that Zerity accepted Mehta’s resignation with immediate effect and

waived the contractual requirement for Mehta to serve a 2-month notice period. Zerity also

paid Mehta $17,947.83 being his pro-rated salary for 1 May 2000 and two months’

salary in lieu of notice pursuant to the relevant provision of the employment contract.

Mehta acknowledged the receipt of this letter and the cheque for that sum by signing at

the bottom of Zerity’s duplicate copy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 On 6 June 2001, 13 months after Mehta had left Zerity, the Plaintiffs

took out the writ in this action claiming damages for (i) trespass at Malcomson’s

residence; (ii) nuisance by telephone at Malcomson’s residence as well as at

Zerity’s office; and (iii) harassment of Malcomson. The Plaintiffs also sought

injunctions to restrain Mehta from further committing such acts. On the same day the

Plaintiffs applied in SIC 1266/2001 for an interim injunction prohibiting Mehta from the

same three acts until trial of the action. At the hearing of the SIC on 11 June, Mehta

appeared in person. He did not dispute that he had been making the telephone calls and had

entered Malcomson’s residence. Instead he explained that he had been trying to

contact Malcomson because of the problems he had with the Inland Revenue Authority of

Singapore on account of his income tax. At the material time, Zerity was registered under

the name, First-E Asia Pte Ltd. Mehta said that he received an IR8A form, which is the

employer’s statement of income in respect of an employee, from Factor e-Asia Pte Ltd.

However his employment contract was with First-e Asia Pte Ltd. IRAS had queried him about

this discrepancy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 On the basis of Malcomson’s supporting affidavit and in view of

Mehta’s position that he had no intention to trespass, cause nuisance or harass, I

granted the interim injunction but directed Plaintiffs’ counsel to look into the

matter about the IR8A form raised by Mehta. I also ordered Mehta to communicate with

Malcomson and Zerity only through their counsel, Mr Pillai.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 In the event, Mehta did not enter appearance by 26 June. Pursuant to

Order 13 rule 6(1), the Plaintiffs elected to proceed as if Mehta had done so. On 26 June

they filed the Statement of Claim. This was served on Mehta on 27 June. No defence was

filed by Mehta by 12 July 2001 and on that day the Plaintiffs filed SIC 1575/2001 to apply

for judgment in default of defence pursuant to O 19 r 7 of the Rules of Court. This

application was first heard on 25 July 2001. At the hearing, Mr Pillai informed me that he

had notified Mehta of the hearing but the latter had chosen not to attend. He exhibited a

printout of an e-mail he received from Mehta to that effect. However the hearing was

adjourned for further submissions. At the adjourned hearing on 10 August, Mr Pillai

applied for and obtained leave to amend the Statement of Claim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 The Amended Statement of Claim was served on Mehta on 10 August 2001.

He did not file any Defence to this within the prescribed time and on 27 August the

Plaintiffs applied again for judgment in default of defence, this time to the Amended

Statement of Claim. I reserved judgment and now give my decision in writing.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The application before me is for judgment in default of defence under

O 19 r 7(1) which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Where the plaintiff makes against a defendant or defendants a

  claim of a description not mentioned in Rules 2 to 5, then, if the defendant … fails

  … to serve a defence on the plaintiff, the plaintiff may, after the expiration of the

  period fixed under these Rules for service of the defence, apply to the Court for

  judgment, and on the hearing of the application the Court shall give such judgment as the

  plaintiff <u>appears entitled</u> to on his statement of claim."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 In relation to the corresponding provision in the repealed English

Rules of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court Practice 1999 had the following

commentaries:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<b>Proof of plaintiff’s case </b>– At a meeting of the

  Judges, a majority decided that the Court cannot receive any evidence in cases hereunder,

  but must give judgment according to the pleadings alone (<i>Smith v Buchanan</i> …; <i>Young

  v Thomas</i> …). It is therefore not necessary on the hearing of the summons or

  motion for judgment to prove the case by evidence (<i>Webster v Vincent</i> …).</p>
<b><p align="justify">Discretion of the Court</p></b> – Although para.(1) of the rule is

  expressed in mandatory terms, the rule is not mandatory but discretionary, and the Court

  retains its discretionary power whether to give judgment or to extend a party’s time

  to plead when it is just to do so … " (paragraph 19/7/14)

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In respect of discretion, I would go further to say that the words <i>"appears

entitled"</i> that I have emphasised in the rule above requires the Court to be

satisfied that the plaintiff is indeed entitled to the judgment and relief prayed for. It

would require a determination whether the pleadings disclose any cause of action.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 In the present case, the Plaintiffs have pleaded three causes of

action, namely:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) trespass and nuisance in respect of Malcomson’s residence

  ("the Residence");</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii) trespass and nuisance in respect of Zerity’s office premises

  ("the Premises");</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) harassment of Malcomson.</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Pleaded Facts</p></i>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 I turn now to the facts pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim.

In the particulars pleaded under para 5, the Plaintiffs alleged that the following had

occurred after Mehta had ceased employment:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) Between May 2000 and June 2000, the Defendant telephoned Malcomson

  at the Premises on not less than 10 occasions;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Between October 2000 and April 2001, the Defendant sent 8 e-mails

  to Malcomson which he retrieved at the Premises and elsewhere; </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) In November 2000, the Defendant sent Malcomson 2 facsimiles and 1

  bouquet of flowers at the Premises;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) On 22 October 2001, the Defendant procured a third party, whose

  name and identity is unknown, to telephone Malcomson at the Residence at 6.00 am;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) On 1 April 2001, the Defendant trespassed on the Residence while

  Malcomson was overseas. He demanded and obtained from Malcomson’s maid the latter's

  confidential mobile phone number. On the same day, the Defendant made 3 calls to Malcomson

  at his mobile phone. These calls were received by Malcomson while he was outside the

  Residence.</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) On 22 April 2001, the Defendant trespassed on the Residence and

  delivered a greeting card addressed to Malcomson and his wife. This was a card normally

  used to congratulate couples over the birth of a new-born baby. The Defendant was aware

  that this was close to the anniversary of the death of their infant son.</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) Following his resignation in May 2000, the Defendant sent

  numerous e-mails and SMS messages via mobile telephone to various employees and directors

  of Zerity, namely the Chief Financial Officer Nachiappan Alagappan, the Chief Operating

  Officer Cavin Choo and Malcomson. The e-mails and messages were received at the Premises

  and elsewhere. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 In the particulars pleaded under para 9 of the Statement of Claim,

the following additional facts were alleged:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) Between May 2000 and June 2000, the Defendant telephoned Marianne

  Lim, Nachiappan Alagappan, Cavin Choo and Martin Buchholz, employees of Zerity, at the

  Premises on a total of 15 occasions;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) In October 2000, the Defendant telephoned Marianne Lim, the Human

  Resource Manager of Zerity, at the Premises on 3 occasions;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Between October 2000 and April 2001, the Defendant sent a total

  of 31 e-mails to Marianne Lim, Nachiappan Alagappan, Cavin Choo, Martin Buchholz and

  William Scrimgeour, employees of Zerity, at the Premises; </p>
<p align="justify">(iv) In November 2000, the Defendant sent a bouquet of flowers and 2

  greeting cards to Marianne Lim, Nachiappan Alagappan and Cavin Choo at the Premises;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) On 1 June 2001, the Defendant attempted to wrongfully enter the

  Premises. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 And finally, in para 10 of the Statement of Claim, the following

additional particulars were pleaded:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) In May 2000, the Defendant wrongfully entered the Premises on at

  least 2 separate occasions;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) On 24 October 2000, the Defendant wrongfully entered the Premises;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 In respect of the first two causes of action, i.e. trespass and

nuisance in respect of the Residence and the Premises, on the pleadings the Plaintiffs

have established the bases for them. The Plaintiffs have alleged that Mehta had trespassed

or attempted to trespass the Residence and the Premises. The persistent faxes, telephone

calls and e-mail retrieved at either location would interfere with the Plaintiffs’

use and enjoyment of the land. These acts collectively constitute the tort of nuisance in

relation to the Residence and the Premises.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14<b> </b>It is the third cause of action that requires consideration.

This is because harassment is not an established tort. However Mr Pillai urges that the

time has come for the Court to give recognition to it as an actionable tort. Before

turning to examine the relevant developments in the law pertaining to this, I first set

out factual circumstances. I am aware that in the present application it is not necessary

to look at the evidence. However due to the unique circumstances of the present case, it

would be useful to do so in order to obtain a full picture of the harassment complained

of. Malcomson had filed an affidavit on 6 June 2001 in support of the application for

interim injunction and it is based on that affidavit, along with the documents exhibited,

that the findings of fact are based.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Facts from Malcomson’s Affidavit</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 The substantive complaint of Malcomson in respect of harassment is

that Mehta:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) sent e-mails to Malcomson, some of which he had retrieved outside

  the Premises;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) obtained the confidential mobile phone number of Malcomson and

  made calls to that number which Malcomson received outside the Residence; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) sent numerous e-mails and SMS messages via mobile phone to

  Malcomson and various employees and directors of Zerity, some of which were received

  outside the Premises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 It was Mehta who had resigned of his own accord. It is not known

whether he was pressured to do so, but this was not asserted in the e-mail he sent on 28

April 2000 in which he tendered his resignation. However, shortly after his departure, in

May 2000, Mehta started making persistent calls to the various directors of Zerity,

including Malcomson, Alagappan (the Chief Financial Officer), Choo (the Chief Operating

Officer), Buchholz (the Chief Technology Officer) and Lim (the Human Resources Manager).

He also sent them e-mails and SMS messages via their mobile phones. These communications

varied from pleas to reinstate his employment to allegations of misconduct, incompetence

and neglect of duties on the parts of Zerity’s employees. On two occasions Mehta

appeared unannounced at the Premises to demand his job back. Lim, who met him on those

occasions, told him that this was not possible and that he should get on with his life.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 Around 6 June 2000, at the insistence of Mehta, Malcomson met him at

the Starbucks coffee house at Temasek Towers. Mehta told Malcomson that he wanted to

"re-establish good relations". He also wanted his job back. Malcomson asked

Mehta to stop annoying the directors of Zerity and to leave the company alone. He told

Mehta that Zerity intended to issue a "formal complaint" to him. Mehta pleaded

with Malcomson not issue such a complaint and promised that he would cease all contact

with Zerity’s employees and related third parties. In view of this, Malcomson agreed

not to "issue" the complaint.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 However matters did not end there. From October to early November

2000, Mehta sent e-mail messages to Malcomson and various other directors and employees of

Zerity. In these messages he levelled accusations at the recipients of giving him a bad

reference to a potential employer, Loh. Malcomson was annoyed by this because to his

knowledge, Zerity had not given any such reference. Mehta had attached an e-mail from Loh

to him to support his accusation. Loh’s e-mail states as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Naresh,</p>
<p align="justify">After the latest incidences of unsolicited calls at night and numerous

  emails, I have made various reference checks on your background including your stints in

  Finesse Alliance, Keppel and [Zerity].</p>
<p align="justify">I regret to inform you that your profile will not fit my requirements,

  and hence I have no need to meet you on Monday as planned. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 Lim subsequently received an e-mail from Loh in which the latter

apologised for any inconvenience caused as a result of his e-mail to Mehta. Loh later

telephoned Lim and clarified that he had not spoken to anyone in Zerity about Mehta and

that the reference on Mehta he obtained was from a third party. Loh said that he had

received persistent calls and e-mails from Mehta insisting on a job interview and so he

had sent that e-mail to Mehta.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 On the morning of 21 October 2000, a Saturday, Mehta telephoned

Zerity's solicitor, Joyce Tan of Joyce A. Tan &amp; Partners. Tan had drafted the

employment contract between Mehta and Zerity. She is also Zerity's company secretary.

Mehta introduced himself as "John Tan" and made arrangements to meet her the

same day about an employment matter. Shortly afterwards he turned up at Tan's office. Tan

told him to leave. Mehta however insisted on having a discussion with her. He eventually

left the office but not before making a nuisance of himself.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 That afternoon Mehta sent an e-mail to Malcomson and Lim demanding

reinstatement of his employment with Zerity. He stated the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I have also written to you all to reconsider my case in the past and

  also the NULL VOID case of the letter of appointment issued to me. I need an answer by

  Monday and would like to settle this issue in a nice manner before I escalate it to the

  next level of seeking justice.</p>
<p align="justify">I have arrived at this conclusion that my letter of appointment given

  to me via the below email was Null and Void. Factor-e Asia Pte Ltd, First-e Asia Pte Ltd,

  First-e OUB Asia Pte Ltd were formed only on 01/03/2000 while the letter was issued to me

  in Feburary 2000 as the date stated below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">He went on to demand reinstatement on the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. No Termination Clause till December 2001</p>
<p align="justify">2. You shall reinstate me immediately with the AVP Position and all the

  benefits, overseas training and other product training that have been deprived from me

  including stock Options from the date of Joining. Under what bad circumstances and

  abusement [<i>sic</i>] I had been told to tender resignation will be considered as Null

  and Void.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Apology for all the harassement [<i>sic</i>] I went thru in finding

  a Job in a very tight job market, Bad Comment I received from various employers and

  First-e employees "willingly" coming to my house taking my notebook and cleaning

  all the stuff searching my house etc. etc. on the instructions of [<i>sic</i>]</p>
<p align="justify">4. The Human Resource Manager- Marianne Lim was appointed after me so

  she has no right to handle my case at that point of time or until asked for.</p>
<p align="justify">5. You shall with immediate effect refrain to write or speak any

  adverse comments about my performance or anything else that shall spoil my image/

  reputation etc to any of my prospective employers and shall write to all those employers

  who you have already to undone the damage as an apology (including BroadVision Singapore

  whose email is below)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 On Sunday 22 October 2000, at about 6 o'clock in the morning, the

telephone at the Residence rang. Malcomson answered it and a lady’s voice at the

other end introduced herself as Mehta’s sister. She wanted to talk about Mehta's

employment in Zerity. Annoyed at receiving the call at such an early hour, Malcomson told

her that he had already put Mehta on notice not to make further contacts with him, either

personally or through his representatives. At this the lady apologised and hung up. That

night, Alagappan and Scrimgeour (employees of Zerity), informed Malcomson via e-mail that

Mehta had, to their great annoyance, telephoned them on Saturday 21 October 2000 and

Sunday 22 October 2000 respectively to complain about his failure to be reinstated.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 On 23 October 2000, Mehta telephoned Lim at the Premises. He told

her that he would report for work the next day. He demanded to be provided with a desk and

a telephone at the Premises. Lim told Mehta that Zerity would not consider reinstating

him. Notwithstanding this, Mehta insisted on turning up for work the next day. And he

lived up to his word by appearing at the Premises at 8.45 am the next day. Lim told him to

leave immediately, warning him that she would summon the police otherwise. At this, Mehta

left. Later that day, Mehta telephoned Lim at the Premises. He threatened to inform the

press that his house was ransacked by Zerity at the time his employment was terminated.

Malcomson explained that at that time, Alagappan, Choo and Lim had called at Mehta's

residence to check if he had kept any information pertaining to Zerity in his notebook

computer. Mehta had willingly submitted himself to the check, which revealed that he was

indeed in possession of information and intellectual property belonging to Zerity. He was

asked to erase the information from his computer and he complied.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 On 27 October 2000, Mehta telephoned Lim at the Premises. He again

demanded to be reinstated. She was annoyed at his persistent demands and told him once

again that Zerity would not reinstate him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 In the evening of 31 October 2000, Malcomson received an e-mail from

Mehta. Again he asked for reinstatement with Zerity. He also threatened to complain about

Zerity to the authorities should he not be re-employed. The relevant excerpt of the e-mail

is as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This morning at 11.15 am I have passed the necessary papers along with

  the ROC/ROB registered papers to the front recep. I would like to resolve this issue on a

  co-ordial manner and peacefully.</p>
<p align="justify">I have already emailed to you that I would like to resolve this on a

  lunch table today but later on calling found that all people missing in the office. I have

  given my word to Gerhad Huber, Chairman of the company and CEO Nicholas Malcomson that I

  would like to settle this issue in a nice and professional way. </p>
<p align="justify">However if the company and responsible people still would like to test

  my patience then I had a small chat with the Management Consultants in a nice way

  regarding ROB/ROC issues in a general manner. Under the act the following breaches takes

  place</p>
<p align="justify">1. Breach of Contract Act-Both employment and Company Act. The company

  and the relevant companies can be taken for task.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Breach of Contract Ractification by Lawyers and other necessary

  Board of Directors. They can be struck of LawBar Payroll if I take the matter to that

  level.</p>
<p align="justify">Leading to cease of their operation and cannot work or operate business

  in Singapore and all the directors and company secretaries will be liable for prosecution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 By a letter dated 1 November 2000, Zerity's solicitors, Messrs Allen

&amp; Gledhill, requested Mehta to stop harassing and making unsolicited communication

with the employees of Zerity. Mehta was also warned not to enter the Premises. Mehta

replied to this letter by e-mail on the same day. In the e-mail, he apologised for his

actions and agreed not to harass or contact Zerity's employees. The relevant excerpt of

his e-mail is reproduced below:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I have forgiven your client and all their staff for the so "called

  employment letter". Having read the contents of the same. I will here by from

<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 However Mehta continued to send numerous e-mails, faxes, cards and

even flowers to Malcomson and other employees of Zerity at the Residence and the Premises.

Messrs Allen &amp; Gledhill sent another letter, dated 10 November 2000, to Mehta to warn

him again not to harass or communicate with Zerity's employees. He responded by sending to

Allen &amp; Gledhill two faxes the same evening as well as an e-mail at about 1.32am on 11

November 2000. In the first telefax, he confirmed that he had already promised and

"given his word of honour" that he would not further communicate with Zerity. He

added that it was Lim who had telephoned to thank him for the flowers he had sent. He

further claimed that it was Alagappan who had telephoned him to tell him that he

(Alagappan) was leaving Zerity and that Mehta should contact Malcomson in respect of any

"pending issues in the near future". In the second fax, he accused Messrs Allen

&amp; Gledhill's clerk of forcing his entry into his home to deliver their letter dated 10

November 2000. In an e-mail dated 11 November 2000, Mehta raised the issue of Messrs Allen

&amp; Gledhill's letter dated 10 November 2000. He wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I am writing to you and also have spoken to you asking if you have any

  concerns in a nice manner however you still send me the letter which is not professional.

  Please do not test my patience. I am a nice person and a gentleman…</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 When Malcomson checked with Lim, she said that it was Mehta who had

telephoned her to ask if she had received the flowers. She had told him not to send

anything or call her again. Lim however recalled an incident which occurred a few days

earlier when she had telephoned Mehta by mistake. As soon as she realised this, she

apologised and discontinued the conversation. As for Alagappan, he clarified that the

reason he telephoned Mehta was to tell him that he was leaving Zerity so that Mehta would

stop calling him. Prior to that, Mehta had been calling him frequently on the telephone,

sometimes through third parties and had become "too much of a nuisance". Mehta

had also turned up at Alagappan's house unannounced on 5 November 2000 only to be told to

leave immediately.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 Finally, in paras 44 to 52 of his affidavit, Malcomson sets out the

latest incidents as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">44. Between 12 November 2000 and 31 March 2001, the Defendant, to my

  knowledge, did not make any contact with the employees of [Zerity] or myself.</p>
<p align="justify">45. On 1 April 2001, the Defendant came to my residence, uninvited, and

  asked to see me. At that time, I was overseas. Our maid, Rosmina, informed him that I was

  not around. The Defendant in an extremely belligerent manner demanded that my maid give

  him my handphone number. My maid was reduced to tears by his conduct. She was eventually

  forced to reveal my mobile phone number. This is a private number, which I do not give it

  to anyone outside the family. He then made three calls to me on the same day through my

  handphone number. The substance of the conversation was that the Defendant wanted to be

  re-employed by [Zerity]. I told him not to call me, ever.</p>
<p align="justify">46. On 22 April 2001, the Defendant came to my house, again, uninvited.

  This time, he handed delivered a card addressed to my wife and I. The card had a picture

  of a rattle on its front with ‘Congratulations’ printed across the front. It is

  clear from the design of the card that it was meant to be used to congratulate couples

  over the birth of their newly born babies. </p>
<p align="justify">47. The following words were written in the card:</p>
<p align="justify">"Thanks a lot Nick for your help. All I need from you, Gracy Choo,

  Marianne Lim, Peter Seah clearance of my case as green or cannot be employed for the job

  marked so I can get a job - Naresh." </p>
<p align="justify">48. … My wife showed me the card when I returned to Singapore on

  23 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">49. The receipt of this card from the Defendant was especially

  distressing to my wife and I. We have been married for some 10 years and our son died at

  birth two years ago around this time. The Defendant obviously intended to inflict my wife

  and I with emotional pain and distress by giving us a card containing a picture of a

  rattle so close to the anniversary. </p>
<p align="justify">50. The next day, on 23 April 2001, the Defendant sent me an e-mail

  requesting that I send a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"clearance letter to the Ministry of Manpower to allow Singapore

    Employers to hire [him] and let [him] earn [his] bread and butter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">He also asked for a letter to be sent to the Home Affairs Ministry to: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"put his Singapore identity card back to workable position and not

    tagging of any criminal/ offence or green record". </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">These demands simply did not make sense to me as [Zerity] has not

  written to the relevant authorities to complain about him in the first place. …</p>
<p align="justify">51. On 27 April 2001, I made a police report against the Defendant.

  …</p>
<p align="justify">52. On 4 June 2001, I received a note from William Scrimgeour of

  [Zerity]. He stated in the note that on 1 June 2000, whilst he was having lunch at a

  coffee shop located at the basement of Temasek Tower, the Defendant approached him. The

  Defendant asked for my whereabouts. He also asked where Ms Lim was. On that day, both of

  us were overseas. He further informed William Scrimgeour that he had earlier visited

  [Zerity’s] office and found out that there was nobody there. It was plain to William

  Scrimgeour that the Defendant had intended to confront me or Ms Lim on that day. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 What emerges from Malcomson’s affidavit is a sorry story of a

person who, out of either malice or due to mental instability, had embarked on a course of

conduct with such persistence that he had made life unbearable for the objects of his

attention. He had used physical presence as well as telephone, mail, e-mail and SMS

messages – all forms of communication available in this day and age - to wear out

those people and in the process caused them much annoyance and great distress.

Particularly vicious is the sending of the card with the picture of the baby rattle close

to the anniversary of the death of Malcomson’s son.</p>

Developments in the Law</p></i>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 Before considering the law, it is necessary to define the meaning of

the term "harassment". The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3<sup>rd</sup>

Ed.) defines "harass" as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<b>1.</b> To wear out, or exhaust with fatigue, care, trouble,

  etc. … <b>3.</b> To trouble or vex by repeated attacks … <b>4.</b> To worry,

  distress with annoying labour, care, importunity, misfortune, etc. …"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Black’s Law Dictionary (7<sup>th</sup> Ed.) gives the meaning of

"harassment" as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Words, conduct, or action (usually repeated or persistent) that,

  being directed at a specific person, annoys, alarms, or causes substantial emotional

  distress in that person and serves no legitimate purpose."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">For the purposes of this application I shall take the term

"harassment" to mean a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or

action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would

cause, and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or

annoyance to another person. This is not intended to be an exhaustive definition of the

term but rather one that sufficiently encompasses the facts of the present case in order

to proceed with a consideration of the law.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 There is no reported decision in our courts which deal with

harassment in an action in tort. The position in England is not settled and I now consider

the authorities.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33 <i>Patel v Patel</i> <nobr>[1988] 2 FLR 179</nobr> concerns an action in which

the plaintiff sought an injunction against his son-in-law who, in the course of a family

dispute, had trespassed on the plaintiff’s home and threatened him in a number of

ways such as telephoning him at home or abusing him in the street or at work. An

interlocutory injunction was issued restraining the defendant from, <i>inter alia</i>,

approaching within 50 yards of the plaintiff’s home. This part of the injunction was

subsequently discharged and the Court of Appeal upheld that decision on appeal. In his

reasoned judgment, May LJ said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…it must be made clear, at any rate in my opinion, that in

  common-law actions based upon an alleged tort injunctions can only be an appropriate

  remedy where an actual tortious act has been or is likely to be committed. A number of

  allegations in the various affidavits that are before us do not constitute a tort, nor

  give any reason for thinking that a tort might be committed, and I have no doubt that it

  was for this reason that the judge thought it proper to limit the terms of the original

  injunction of 20 August 1986, in particular removing from it the restraint on the

  son-in-law from approaching within 50 yard of his father-in-law’s house. Unless an

  actual trespass is committed or is more than likely to be committed, it does not seem to

  me that merely to approach to within 50 yards of a person’s house does give cause of

  action which may be restrained by an injunction in those terms."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34 That judgment does not deal with the question of harassment. However

Waterhouse J, sitting as the second judge in the Court of Appeal, extended the scope of

this decision by stating that there was no tort of harassment. In a single-paragraph

judgment, he said (at p.182):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I agree with the orders proposed by May LJ and with the reasons for

  them that he has given. In particular, I endorse the approach adopted by the judge below

  in reformulating the injunctions. The essence of the appellant’s complaint is that he

  has been the victim of repeated harassment since May 1985, but in the present state of the

  law there is no tort of harassment. The judge was right, in my judgment, in limiting the

  scope of the injunctions in the way that he did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35 This position was doubted by the Court of Appeal in <i>Khorasandjian

v Bush </i>[1993] 3 All ER 737. After quoting from the judgment of Waterhouse J, Dillon LJ

said (at p.678):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I find it difficult to give much weight to that general dictum that

  there is no tort of harassment, when the reformulated injunctions which Waterhouse J

  approved included an injunction restraining the defendant from molesting the plaintiff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 In <i>Burris v Azadani </i>[1995] 1 WLR 1372, Sir Thomas Bingham MR

also doubted the position taken by Waterhouse J in <i>Patel v Patel</i>. The Master of the

Rolls, with whom the other two Lord Justices agreed, quoted from the judgments of May LJ

and Waterhouse J and said (at p.1378):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I do not, however, understand May LJ to have held that such an order

  was improper even in a case where the commission of a tort was reasonably to be

  apprehended and where an "exclusion zone" order was reasonably judged to be

  necessary for protection of the plaintiff as the potential victim of tortious conduct.

  Nor, in the light of later authority, can the view be upheld that there is no tort of

  harassment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37 In England the matter is now covered by the Protection from

Harassment Act 1997 - see <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd</i> [1997] 2 All ER 426. In that

case, the House of Lords was faced with the question whether a person who had no right to

the land affected by a nuisance could bring an action in private nuisance. The majority of

their Lordships held that only a person with a right to exclusive possession of the land

affected could sue, and a mere licensee or occupier could not. In so holding, the House

had to overrule the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Khorasandjian v Bush</i> [1993] 3 All ER 737, in which the facts were as follows: the plaintiff met the defendant in a

snooker club when she was 16 years of age and he 20. They became friends and dated on and

off over a period of about a year. Then the plaintiff broke up the relationship but the

defendant, who had suicidal tendencies, could not accept it. He embarked on a series of

acts directed at the plaintiff which included threats of violence, aggressive behaviour in

her presence and simply following her around and shouting abuse. He also pestered her with

telephone calls to her parents’ as well as grandmother’s home. On one occasion,

as a result of such abusive behaviour, the defendant was arrested and kept in custody over

the weekend but was given a 12-month conditional discharge. However he made further

threats against the plaintiff and was eventually sent to prison for six weeks for

threatening to kill her. He was also fined for offences under the Telecommunications Act

1984 in respect of nuisance telephone calls he made to the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal

had upheld an injunction against the defendant restraining him from, <i>inter alia</i>,

"harassing, pestering or communicating with" the plaintiff. In his speech in <i>Hunter

v Canary Wharf Ltd</i>, Lord Goff had this to say (at p.437) of the decision of the Court

of Appeal in <i>Khorasandjian v Bush</i>:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">… The question before the Court of Appeal was whether the judge

  had jurisdiction to grant such an injunction, in relation to telephone calls made to the

  plaintiff at her parents’ home. The home was the property of the plaintiff’s

  mother, and it was recognised that her mother could complain of persistent and unwanted

  telephone calls made to her; but it was submitted that the plaintiff, as a mere licensee

  in her mother’s house, could not invoke the tort of private nuisance to complain of

  unwanted and harassing telephone calls made to her in her mother’s home. The majority

  of the Court of Appeal (Peter Gibson J dissenting) rejected this submission, relying on

  the decision of the Appellate Division of the Alberta Supreme Court in <i>Motherwell v

  Motherwell</i> (1976) 73 DLR (3d) 62. In that case, the Appellate Division not only

  recognised that the legal owner of property could obtain an injunction, on the ground of

  private nuisance, to restrain persistent harassment by unwanted telephone calls to his

  home, but also that the same remedy was open to his wife who had no interest in the

  property. In the Court of Appeal Peter Gibson J dissented on the ground that it was wrong

  in principle that a mere licensee or someone without any interest in, or right to occupy,

  the relevant land should be able to sue in private nuisance.</p>
<p align="justify">It is necessary therefore to consider the basis of the decision in <i>Motherwell

  v Motherwell</i> that a wife, who has no interest in the matrimonial home where she lives,

  is nevertheless able to sue in private nuisance in respect of interference with her

  enjoyment of that home. The case was concerned with a claim for an injunction against the

  defendant, who was the daughter of one of the plaintiffs, the other two plaintiffs being

  her brother and sister-in-law. The main ground of the complaint against the defendant was

  that, as a result of a paranoid condition from which she suffered which produced in her

  the conviction that her sister-in-law and her father’s housekeeper were inflaming her

  brother and her father against her, she persistently made a very large number of telephone

  calls to her brother’s and her father’s homes, in which she abused her

  sister-in-law and the housekeeper. The Appellate Division of the Alberta Supreme Court, in

  a judgment delivered by Clement JA, held that not only could her father and brother, as

  householders, obtain an injunction against the defendant to restrain this activity as a

  private nuisance, but so also could her sister-in-law although she had no interest in her

  husband’s property. Clement JA said (at 78):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Here we have a wife harassed in the matrimonial home. She has a

    status, a right to live there with her husband and children. I find it absurd to say that

    her occupancy of the matrimonial home is insufficient to found an action in nuisance. In

    my opinion she is entitled to the same relief as is her husband, the brother.’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This conclusion was very largely based on the decision of the Court of

  Appeal in <i>Foster v Warblington UDC</i> [1906] 1 KB 648, which Clement JA understood to

  establish a distinction between ‘one who is "merely present"’ and

  ‘occupancy of a substantial nature’, and that in the latter case the occupier

  was entitled to sue in private nuisance. However, <i>Foster v Warblington UDC</i> does

  not, in my opinion, provide authority for the proposition that a person in the position of

  a mere licensee, such as a wife or husband in her or his spouse’s house, is entitled

  to sue in that action. This misunderstanding must, I fear, undermine the authority of <i>Motherwell

  v Motherwell</i> on this point; and in so far as the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Khorasandjian

  v Bush</i> is founded upon <i>Motherwell v Motherwell</i> it is likewise undermined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38 Lord Goff recognised that the primary complaint of the plaintiff in <i>Khorasandjian

v Bush</i> was not private nuisance but harassment. He continued (at p.438):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">But I must go further. If a plaintiff, such as the daughter of the

  householder in <i>Khorasandjian v Bush</i>, is harassed by abusive telephone calls, the

  gravamen of the complaint lies in the harassment which is just as much an abuse, or indeed

  an invasion of her privacy, whether she is pestered in this way in her mother’s or

  her husband’s house, or she is staying with a friend, or is at her place of work, or

  even in her car with a mobile phone. In truth, what the Court of Appeal appears to have

  been doing was to exploit the law of private nuisance in order to create by the back door

  a tort of harassment which was only partially effective in that it was artificially

  limited to harassment which takes place in her home. I myself do not consider that this is

  a satisfactory manner in which to develop the law, especially when, as in the case in

  question, the step so taken was inconsistent with another decision of the Court of Appeal,

  viz <i>Malone v Laskey</i> [1907] 2 KB 141, by which the court was bound. In any event, a

  tort of harassment has now received statutory recognition (see the Protection From

  Harassment Act 1997). We are therefore no longer troubled with the question whether the

  common law should be developed to provide such a remedy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39 Lord Hoffman agreed and expressed similar sentiments, saying (at

p.452):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The perceived gap in <i>Khorasandjian’s</i> case was the absence

  of a tort of intentional harassment causing distress without actual bodily or psychiatric

  illness. This limitation is thought to arise out of cases like <i>Wilkinson v Downton</i>

  [1897] 2 QB 57, and <i>Janvier v Sweeney</i> [1919] 2 KB 316. The law of harassment has

  now been put on a statutory basis (see the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) and it is

  unnecessary to consider how the common law might have developed. But as at present

  advised, I see no reason why a tort of intention should be subject to the rule which

  excludes compensation for mere distress, inconvenience or discomfort in actions based on

  negligence (see <i>Hicks v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police</i> [1992] 2 All

  ER 65). The policy considerations are quite different. I do not therefore say that

  Khorasandjian’s case was wrongly decided. But it must be seen as a case on

  intentional harassment, not nuisance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40 <i>Wilkinson v Downton</i> [1897] 2 QB 57 and <i>Janvier v Sweeney</i>

[1919] 2 KB 316 are of course the well known cases which established that false words or

verbal threats calculated to cause, and uttered with the knowledge that they are likely to

cause, and actually causing physical injury to the person to whom they are uttered are

actionable. But I do not understand those cases, which have extended the law to include

recovery for mental shock caused by intentional acts, as restricting in any manner its

further development.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41 The editors of Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacob’s <i>Precedents

of Pleadings</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed. 2001) take the position that harassment is a

recognised tort, although they did not consider the judgment of the House of Lords in <i>Hunter

v Canary Wharf Ltd</i>. In paragraph 54-01 of Bullen &amp; Leake, the editors state:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Harassment is now recognized at common law and protection will be

  afforded against it, in particular, by the courts’ powers to grant injunctive relief.

  In <i>Khorasandjian v Bush</i> .. the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against an order

  restraining the defendant from "using violence to, harassing, pestering or

  communicating with" the claimant by, among other things, "the persecution by

  telephone calls". In <i>Burris v Adazani</i> … Sir Thomas Bingham MR reviewed

  the law of harassment in the context of the court’s power to grant interlocutory

  injunctive relief and concluded that the jurisdiction derived from section 37(1) of the

  Supreme Court Act 1981 and section 38 of the County Courts Act 1984 was not limited to

  restraining conduct which is in itself tortious or otherwise unlawful but extends to the

  protection of "the legitimate interests of those who have invoked [the Court’s]

  jurisdiction" …</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42 In <i>International Privacy, Publicity and Personality Laws</i>

(2001) (Henry, Ed.), the contributors to the chapter on Singapore (Chapter 24), opined

that the Singapore courts should recognise the tort of harassment. After quoting from the

speech of Lord Hoffman in <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf</i> that I have reproduced above, the

editors say (at p.368):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This passage from the decision of Lord Hoffman provides material for

  the development in Singapore of a common law tort of intentional harassment. …</p>
<p align="justify">If, and when this takes place, there would be much scope for the

  protection of privacy, since the tort may, if fully developed, protect against

  ‘distress, inconvenience and discomfort’. The main difficulty against the

  adoption of the tort of harassment in Singapore is a passage from the decision of Selvam J

  in <i>Arul Chandran v Gartshore</i> which suggests that mental distress is not actionable.

  It is submitted that Selvam J’s statement that mental distress is not actionable

  should not preclude the development and acceptance of a tort of intentional harassment in

  Singapore for several reasons. First, the statement of Selvam J was only an <i>obiter

  dicta</i> in respect of recovery for mental distress in tort, since the case before Selvam

  J involved a claim for breach of contract. Secondly, Selvam J relied on old judgments that

  mental distress was not recoverable. Selvam J’s attention was not drawn to the modern

  cases including those cited in this part of the chapter that support the view that there

  can be a cause of action based on intentionally causing mental distress. Thirdly, Selvam

  J’s suggestion that such damages should not be recoverable on the basis that they are

  difficult to quantify is not a good reason to deny a remedy. The courts are adept in

  quantifying damages. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43 The passage in <i>Arul Chandran v Gartshore</i> <nobr>[2000] 2 SLR 446</nobr>

that the editors are referring to is probably paragraph 13 in which the judge said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I now commence an analysis of the law on the issue. Historically

  speaking, English law acted on the apriorism that pure mental suffering without physical

  injury was an inevitable fact of interpersonal relationships in private and public life

  alike. Unlike actionable physical injury, which arises from an external cause, mental

  distress stems from inherent predisposition of the individual. As it arose from the

  constitution and circumstances of the individual it did not traditionally give a cause of

  action. After all, people must learn to accept with a certain degree of stoicism the

  slings and arrows of this vale of tears. In such instances, they should be slow to rush to

  the law with a tale of tears and fears save in certain recognised circumstances. It makes

  no difference whether the event causing such suffering was the commission of a tort or the

  breaking of a contract. In the time-honoured language of the law, such suffering is too

  remote for recompense at law: see <i>Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas</i> [1888]   13 App Cas 222. At one time, it was thought that this was not a desirable situation

  because it failed to deter the callous conduct of irresponsible people. So an attempt was

  made to move the boundary by Wright J in <i>Wilkinson v Downton</i> [1897] 2 QB 57.

  Notably, that was not a contract action. Even in tort the novelty failed to flourish. It

  is settled law that mental distress by itself does not constitute sufficient damage to

  found a cause of action. In 1957, Devlin J stated the correct position in <i>Behrens v

  Bertram Mills Circus Ltd</i> [1957] 2 QB 1 at 28: `The general principle embedded in the

  common law that mental suffering caused by grief, fear, anguish and the like is not

  assessable.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44 For my part, I do not think that the judge had intended to rule out

all actions founded on mental distress. But to the extent that he does, I would agree with

the editors that the statement in respect of tort is <i>obiter</i> because the question

before the court in that case involved damages for mental distress in a breach of contract

situation. Also, counsel there did not appear to have cited the authorities that I have

dealt with above, in particular, the statement by Lord Hoffman in <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf

Ltd</i> (quoted in paragraph 39 above) in which he said that he saw no reason why <i>"a

tort of intention should be subject to the rule which excludes compensation</i> <i>for

mere distress, inconvenience or discomfort in actions based on negligence."</i> In

the premises, I consider that there is no authority in the way of the development of the

law in this area in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45 The basic facts in the present case can be summarised as follows:

Mehta, having left the employment of Zerity, embarked on a course of conduct that made

life unbearable for Malcomson and the other employees of his former employer. It was a

course of conduct that any reasonable person would consider intolerable. Indeed

Mehta’s actions, as can be seen from his behaviour generally, the written

communications from him, and the fact that third parties have also been at the receiving

end of his actions, could well be a manifestation of some form of mental illness. However

even if that is relevant, Mehta has not entered a defence nor filed any affidavits and for

the present purposes I can only assume that he has the faculties of an ordinary person.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46 In <i>Wilkinson v Downton</i> [1897] 2 QB 57, the defendant played a

practical joke on the plaintiff by telling her that her husband had met with a serious

accident and had broken both legs. On hearing this the plaintiff suffered a violent shock,

fell ill and became incapacitated for several weeks. The court found that these

consequences were not the result of any existing condition or predisposition of the

plaintiff. In giving judgment for the plaintiff, Wright J declined to base the action on

fraud because the damage suffered did not naturally result from the plaintiff acting upon

the false statement. Instead he held as follows (at p.58):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defendant has, as I assume for the moment, wilfully done an act

  calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff - that is to say, to infringe her legal

  right to personal safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her. That

  proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of action, there being no

  justification alleged for the act. This wilful injuria is in law malicious, although no

  malicious purpose to cause the harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to

  the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">It remains to consider whether the assumptions involved in the

  proposition are made out. One question is whether the defendant's act was so plainly

  calculated to produce some effect of the kind which was produced that an intention to

  produce it ought to be imputed to the defendant, regard being had to the fact that the

  effect was produced on a person proved to be in an ordinary state of health and mind. I

  think that it was. It is difficult to imagine that such a statement, made suddenly and

  with apparent seriousness, could fail to produce grave effects under the circumstances

  upon any but an exceptionally indifferent person, and therefore an intention to produce

  such an effect must be imputed, and it is no answer in law to say that more harm was done

  than was anticipated, for that is commonly the case with all wrongs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47 Wright J then held that the connection between cause and effect in

that case was sufficiently close such that the damages suffered by the plaintiff were not

too remote in law. He considered the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Victorian

Railways Commissioners v Coultas</i> 13 AC 222 to be of doubtful authority. In any event

Wright J distinguished it on the grounds that the <i>Victorian Railways</i> case did not

involve any element of wilful wrong. He also distinguished <i>Allsop v Allsop</i> 5

H.&amp;N. 534, a case involving a slander. Wright J considered that the plaintiff had a

legal right to personal safety. This right was infringed by the defendant who had wilfully

done an act calculated to cause, and which did cause, physical harm to her. It did not

matter that it was not the defendant’s intention to cause physical harm. What was

important was that the defendant had intended to carry out the act and the consequences

that resulted were within reasonable contemplation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48 In <i>Janvier v Sweeney &amp; Anor</i> [1919] KB 316, the plaintiff

was a French woman employed as companion to one Mrs Rowton. She was engaged to be married

to a Mr Neumann, a German, against the wishes of her relatives. In July 1915 Neumann was

interned in the Isle of Man. The plaintiff had visited him there twice and corresponded

regularly with him. In mid-1917, one Miss Marsh moved in to live with Rowton. The first

defendant was a private detective and he wanted to look at some letters that Marsh had in

her possession. His assistant, the second defendant, went up to the plaintiff and

announced, falsely, that he was a detective from Scotland Yard representing the military

authorities. He told the plaintiff that she was the woman they were looking for as she had

been corresponding with a German spy. They had hoped to scare her into helping them gain

access to Marsh’s letters. Unfortunately the plaintiff suffered a severe nervous

shock as a result of this encounter. The English Court of Appeal approved and applied <i>Wilkinson

v Downton</i> and held that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages. The

words of Duke LJ, at p. 326 are particularly apposite:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This is a much stronger case than <i>Wilkinson v. Downton</i>. In that

  case there was no intention to commit a wrongful act; the defendant merely intended to

  play a practical joke upon the plaintiff. In the present case there was an intention to

  terrify the plaintiff for the purpose of attaining an unlawful object in which both the

  defendants were jointly concerned.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Should there be a tort of harassment?</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49 There the law in this area has remained up to today, apart from the

dicta in <i>Burris v Adazani</i> and <i>Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd</i>. The common law has

been in development for close to 1000 years. In most of that time the nature of the

community regulated by it was rural and agrarian. Indeed emphasis had been placed on land

because that was the main means of economic output and, consequently, wealth. As concerns

the area of law in the present case, protection was offered to the landowner against

interference with enjoyment of his land by the tort of nuisance. Outside of his land he,

as with any individual, is protected generally by the tort of trespass to the person and

the tort of negligence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50 In the last 200 years improvements in technology have brought about

3 great changes in lifestyle, at least for those of us in affluent societies. The first is

urbanisation due to the fact that the means of livelihood for most people shifted from

agriculture to manufacturing and services. More and more people live closer and closer

together. The second is the widespread availability of leisure time. No longer do most

people have to toil long hours daily in order to eke out a hand to mouth existence. With

education, and hence skills, and technology, productivity has risen to such levels that

virtually everyone can afford considerable periods of leisure. The third great change is

in communication. With mobile phones, voicemail, SMS and pagers we can be contacted

anytime, anywhere, instantaneously or otherwise. With e-mail and internet homepages our

presence is not tied down to geography but has become virtual, somewhere out there in the

ether of cyberspace.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51 These three changes have combined to create the problem in the

present case which did not and could not exist before. An abundance of leisure time means

that there are people who can afford the time and money to indulge in fantasies about

other people, whether in respect of any grievance they have, or of so-called celebrities,

another product of the modern era of mass media and sophisticated marketing. And the means

by which such people can act out their fantasies have become not only easier but more

powerful. No longer need one be within sight or hearing of the victim. He or she can be

reached aurally by mobile phone and pager, or communicated to in the form of words,

symbols or graphics by SMS or e-mail. This can be done anytime from anywhere. With a

computer, such communications can be generated at high volumes automatically, e.g. e-mail

"spamming". While there are those who may view the proliferation of pagers,

mobile phones and e-mail with dismay, a steadily growing number of people consider these

devices indispensable to their occupation and in many cases, to their personal lives as

well. Certainly within one generation these will be as commonplace as the fixed-line

telephone and television have become in the lifetime of those of us who are old enough to

have ever been deprived of them. People will arrange their lives around these devices as

was done for the earlier inventions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52 But life can be unbearable for the person who finds himself the

object of attention of one who is determined to make use of these modern devices to

harass. That person’s mobile phone can be ringing away at all times and in all

places. He may get a flood of SMS messages, which can now be conveniently sent out by

computer via e-mail. His inbox can be flooded with unwanted e-mail. These communications

can be warm words of adulation or they can be chilling threats to property or personal

safety. The result can range from displeasure to distress to debilitation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53 Sections 13A and 13B of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and

Nuisance) Act provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="justify">Intentional harassment, alarm or distress<br/>
</p></b>13A. --(1) Any person who in a public place or in a private place, with intent to

  cause harassment, alarm or distress to another person —<b>
</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or</p>
<p align="justify">(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is

    threatening, abusive or insulting,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">thereby causing that person or any other person harassment, alarm or

  distress, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not

  exceeding $5,000. </p>
<p align="justify">(2) It is a defence for the accused to prove —</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) that he was inside a dwelling-house and had no reason to believe

    that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation

    displayed, by him would be heard or seen by a person outside that dwelling-house or any

    other dwelling-house; or</p>
<p align="justify">(b) that his conduct was reasonable. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>Harassment, alarm or distress</b><br/>

  13B. --(1) Any person who in a public place or in a private place —</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; or</p>
<p align="justify">(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is

    threatening, abusive or insulting,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">within the hearing or sight of any person likely to be caused

  harassment, alarm or distress thereby shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on

  conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(2) It is a defence for the accused to prove —</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) that he had no reason to believe that there was any person within

    hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) that he was inside a dwelling-house and had no reason to believe

    that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation

    displayed, would be heard or seen by a person outside that dwelling-house or any other

    dwelling-house; or</p>
<p align="justify">(c) that his conduct was reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54 Therefore, under that Act, if a person uses words that are abusive,

insulting or threatening or behaves in that manner in any place and as a consequence

causes harassment, alarm or distress to another person, the former may have committed an

offence under the Act. However it would appear that similar words expressed by the

perpetrator over the mobile phone which causes harassment, alarm or distress to the victim

would not be an offence under this Act. Of course the victim can always switch off his

mobile phone if he does not want to receive such calls and therefore it is not necessary

to make that behaviour an offence. But this suggestion restricts the victim’s right

to use his mobile phone or any other device through which the perpetrator’s

communications are sent. In my opinion there is a need to address this lacuna in the law.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55 I do not believe that it is not possible for the common law to

respond to this need. In Singapore we live in one of the most densely populated countries

in the world. And the policy of the government is to further increase the population. It

will make for an intensely uncomfortable living environment if there is no recourse

against a person who intentionally makes use of modern communication devices in a manner

that causes offence, fear, distress and annoyance to another. Mehta had embarked on such a

course of conduct by making the mobile phone calls along with his other acts of nuisance.

He ought reasonably to know that such acts would cause worry, emotional distress,

annoyance to Malcomson. In the law of negligence, a person has a duty to ensure that he

does not cause any damage to others. Such acts are unintentional but they result in

physical harm to the victim. Surely in respect of intentional acts that cause harm in the

form of emotional distress, the law is able to provide a recourse. The fact that in such

cases it is difficult to quantify damages should not, in my opinion, hinder the court from

giving the appropriate relief. In the present case, as I suspect will generally be the

situation in most cases of this nature, what the Plaintiffs essentially want are not

damages but an injunction restraining Mehta from continuing with such acts. I see no

reason of policy against ordering Mehta to stop such behaviour. They do not further the

common good. Instead they cause the plaintiffs to lose time and emotional energy which can

be better spent on more productive activities. Just as importantly, those acts do not

contribute anything to the welfare of Mehta and an injunction from the court would in all

probability steer him into a positive direction and at the very least make him get on with

his life.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56 There is of course the need to balance the Plaintiffs’ right to

privacy against Mehta’s right to free speech. However the latter right has always

been subject to the existing law, e.g. defamation, sedition and, as I have demonstrated

above, the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisances) Act. Freedom of speech, as

with any other freedom, extends to where it begins to impinge on another person’s

rights. If Mehta has any cause of action against the Plaintiffs he should seek his

recourse in the courts. What the Plaintiffs ask here, apart from orders in respect of the

well established tort of private nuisance, is for Mehta to be prohibited from keying

several combinations of numbers in his telephone. I can see no reason why the law cannot

come to their aid in the circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57 I would note also that there appears to be an increasing number of

cases of what is known as "stalking", i.e. the harassment by individuals of the

objects of their fantasies or desire. The latter are mostly celebrities, i.e. people such

as entertainment figures who are glamorised by the mass media. In some countries such

cases sometimes end tragically. Although that situation does not obtain in the present

case, recognition of a tort of harassment could nip many of those cases in the bud. In <i>Robert

Fine v. Eileen May McLardy</i> <nobr>[1998] EWCA 3003</nobr> (6 July 1998), Millet LJ commented as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In the past, the absence of a tort of interference with privacy has

  been a serious blot on our jurisprudence. It has made it difficult to uphold injunctions

  of the present kind, necessary though they are, on any rational basis. With the imminent

  incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the privacy of

  the individual, his or her home and correspondence, this may be a thing of the past. It

  will not be long before this court is called on to consider whether, in the new

  circumstances, injunctions of the present kind can be granted generally to prevent

  harassment and stalking wherever it may take place, and without having to base this

  jurisdiction on the law of nuisance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In my opinion that time has come in Singapore.</p>
