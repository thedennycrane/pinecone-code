<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns an action by Tam Chee Chong
                    and Keoy Soo Earn (“the plaintiffs”) to set aside a charge given
                    by Jurong Hi-Tech Industries Pte Ltd (under judicial management)
                    (“JHTI”) over certain shares to DBS Bank Ltd (“the
                    defendant”) on the grounds that the charge constituted an unfair
                    preference under s 227T of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Companies Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       JHTI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jurong
                    Technologies Industrial Corporation Ltd (under judicial management)
                    (“JTIC”), the latter of which is an investment holding company.
                    JHTI and JTIC (“the Companies”) were placed under judicial
                    management by orders of court on 20 February 2009. The plaintiffs were
                    appointed as judicial managers of the Companies and it is in that capacity that
                    they bring this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Sometime in the last quarter of 2006, the
                    defendant approached JTIC with an offer of banking facilities. Yeo Pek Heng
                    (“Yeo”), a director of JTIC and JHTI, informed the defendant that
                    the facilities from the other banks, such as ABN AMRO Bank NV (“ABN
                    AMRO”), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (“BTMU”), Malayan
                    Banking Berhad (“Maybank”), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation
                    Ltd (“OCBC”), Rabobank International Singapore Branch
                    (“Rabobank”), RHB Bank Berhad (“RHB”) and United
                    Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) were all unsecured but that each of the
                    banks had been given a negative pledge and a <em>pari
                        passu</em> undertaking. The defendant was willing to lend on a similar
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By a letter of offer dated 27 December
                    2006, the defendant granted banking facilities to the Companies, jointly and
                    severally. The banking facilities were revised and supplemented with additional
                    banking facilities over the next few years. Each of the defendant’s
                    letters of offer provided that the facilities granted to the Companies were
                    unsecured and contained the additional negative pledge and <em>pari passu</em> clauses similar to those on which facilities were
                    granted to the Companies by the other banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       When Ms Lin Li Fang, then already a
                    director of both JTIC and JHTI, took over as chairperson of the JTIC group of
                    companies (“the Group”) in March 2008, she was concerned about the
                    high debt level of the Group and considered it a priority to
                    “monetise” the assets of the Group and to pay down the loans
                    outstanding to the banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Thereafter, Dr Chung Siang Joon
                    (“Dr Chung”), executive director of finance of JTIC, and Yeo
                    gave similar presentations to the defendant and each of the other banks
                        (<em>ie</em>, ABN AMRO, KBC and KBC Bank NV
                    (“KBC”), Maybank, Rabobank, RHB, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
                    Corporation (“SMBC”), OCBC and UOB) separately, where they stated
                    that some of the Companies’ assets would be sold to pay down the loans
                    from the banks. Those assets included the Electronic Manufacturing Services
                    business, shares in MAP Technology Holdings Ltd (“MAP Shares”) as
                    well as shares in Min Aik Technology Co Ltd (“Min Aik
                    Shares”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant’s willingness to provide
                    funding to the Companies when so requested can be seen from several episodes. In
                    May 2008, JTIC was interested in acquiring a 100% stake in Priver Electric (BVI)
                    Co Ltd (“Priver”) – a company incorporated in the British
                    Virgin Islands. Dr Chung, Yeo and Lin approached the defendant for a short
                    term loan of S$5m for the acquisition (“the 1st Ad Hoc Short Term
                    Loan”). The defendant agreed and disbursed the loan pursuant to the
                    drawdown notice issued by the Companies dated 2 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Another noteworthy instance to illustrate how
                    the defendant was more helpful to the Companies than the other banks
                    occurred in July 2008. ABN AMRO Bank had wanted to reduce the amount of the
                    standby letter of credit (“SBLC”) facility it had granted to
                    JHTI’s wholly owned subsidiary in Brazil – JHT Industrial Jaguariuna
                    Ltda. The Companies approached Rabobank, UOB and the defendant to take over the
                    SBLC facility but only the defendant agreed to do so. The defendant granted the
                    Companies an SBLC facility of US$1.5m on 14 July 2008 which was
                    subsequently increased to US$2m on 15 September 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Yet another example of the defendant’s
                    assisting to the Companies is as follows. At JTIC’s annual general meeting
                    on 30 April 2008, JTIC announced a dividend payment of $0.01 per share. The
                    dividend was to be paid by end September 2008, but JTIC did not have the funds
                    to pay it. Dr Chung, Yeo and Ms Lin approached the defendant for
                    another short term loan of S$10m. The defendant approved a loan of S$7.5m
                    (“the 2nd Ad Hoc Short Term Loan” and collectively with the 1st Ad
                    Hoc Short Term Loan, the “Ad Hoc Short Term Loans”), of which S$6m
                    was disbursed on 26 September 2008 and a further S$0.5m on
                    29 September 2008 pursuant to drawdown notices issued by the
                    Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     By 14 January 2009, the Companies owed
                    the defendant, its largest creditor, approximately S$30m and
                US$44m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In June 2008, ABN AMRO requested that the
                    Companies provide an undertaking to physically deposit the approximately 18
                    million shares in MAP Technology Holdings Ltd (“MAP”) that the
                    Companies owned with ABN AMRO by 1 July 2008 in consideration for ABN AMRO
                    not recalling the facilities and proposing new repayment terms. The Companies
                    agreed and a letter of undertaking dated 30 June 2008 was furnished by JTIC
                    to ABN AMRO. The Companies also physically deposited the non-tradeable
                    share certificate representing approximately 18 million shares in MAP with ABN
                    AMRO. Incidentally, the shares in question were subject to a sale moratorium
                    until 28 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 1 July 2008, Dr Chung informed
                    the defendant that JTIC held 18.8 million shares in MAP which were subject
                    to the sale moratorium as described above. Dr Chung also stated that the
                    shares might be sold to repay the 1st Ad Hoc Short Term Loan. This was somewhat
                    inaccurate as there were in fact 18,661,620 shares, and they were held in the
                    name of JHTI not JTIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Upon the expiry of the moratorium period, ABN
                    AMRO returned the share certificate to JHTI so that the shares could be
                    converted to scripless shares. JHTI also obtained additional shares in MAP from
                    the sale by JTIC of two related companies to MAP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In August and September 2008, ABN AMRO
                    requested that the scripless shares in MAP be transferred to its nominees
                    account, apparently without change of beneficial ownership, but Dr Chung
                    refused the request as he was aware of the negative pledge and <em>pari passu</em> clause given by the Companies to the banks.
                    This was despite ABN AMRO threatening to accelerate repayment by making a formal
                    demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On or about 17 September 2008, the
                    defendant gave JTIC an introduction to DBS Nominees so that JHTI could appoint
                    DBS Nominees as custodian for the shares in MAP. The custody account was duly
                    opened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     From September to November 2008, JHTI found it
                    difficult to pay amounts due on the loans it had taken out. The defendant and
                    other banks that had extended loans to JHTI were pressing the Companies for
                    payment of overdue amounts. However, JHTI was unable to make payment of the
                    outstanding amounts in full. JHTI told its bank creditors, including the
                    defendant, that it would repay the facilities using the proceeds from the sale
                    of the shares in MAP, the sale of the shares in Min Aik Technology Co Ltd and
                    the sale (“the GEM Deal”) of the Electronic Manufacturing Services
                    business to the Global Emerging Markets Group. During this period, trade
                    creditors were also demanding payment of invoices from JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     JHTI did make some payments to the banks,
                    however. All the banks, including the defendant, had received some payments from
                    JHTI from September to November 2008. The defendant had received US$300,000 and
                    US$600,000 on 24 October 2008 and 31 October 2008. However, these
                    payments were made in the ordinary course of business from trade receivables or
                    by drawing on credit lines and not from the disposal of assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant’s requests for payment in
                    September 2008 were merely in relation to the Companies’ overdue trade
                    bills. After the 2nd Ad Hoc Short Term Loan was disbursed on 26 September
                    2008, the defendant requested repayment of the 1st Ad Hoc Short Term
                    Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The 1st Ad Hoc Short Term Loan was originally
                    due on 1 August 2008. Of this amount, S$2.5m was repaid in August and
                    September 2008 with the balance rolled over. Despite the 1st Ad Hoc Short Term
                    Loan not being fully repaid, the 2nd Ad Hoc Short Term Loan was nonetheless
                    disbursed. When the Companies failed to repay the 2nd Ad Hoc Short Term Loan
                    upon its maturity on 10 October 2008, this loan too was rolled
                over.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Even though the defendant was requesting the
                    Companies to make payment of their overdue trade bills and the balance of the Ad
                    Hoc Short Term Loans during this period, the relationship between the defendant
                    and the Companies remained cordial. Ms Lin said she did not feel pressured
                    by the defendant’s requests, especially since the other banks were also
                    asking the Companies for repayment. Moreover, the defendant did not make any
                    formal demand for payment until 14 January 2009, as discussed
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 10 October 2008, the defendant offered
                    to assist the Companies by providing a US$8.5m account receivables facility to
                    the Companies. The defendant issued a letter of offer for this facility on 4
                    November 2008 but the Companies did not accept it. Unbeknown to the defendant,
                    accounts receivable financing had already been arranged with
                Rabobank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Ms Khua Soh Teng Pansy
                    (“Ms Khua”), a vice-president of the defendant’s
                    Institutional Banking Group, sent an e-mail to the Companies on 17 October
                    2008 seeking their settlement instructions “<em>immediately</em>” in respect of several overdue trade
                    bills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Further to instructions given by Ms Tan
                    Ee Lee (“Ms Tan”), the defendant’s managing director of
                    the Institutional Banking Group, Ms Khua impressed upon Ms Lin during
                    a meeting on 17 October 2008 at the defendant’s offices that the
                    Companies’ failure to meet their repayment obligations constituted an
                    event of default which entitled the defendant to recall the banking
                    facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Ms Khua followed up with an e-mail to the
                    Companies dated 20 October 2008 (the Monday after the meeting on Friday
                    17 October 2008) reiterating that there was an <em>event of
                        default</em> under the banking facilities and that <em>the defendant reserved all the rights against the Companies</em>. It
                    will be observed, however, that the defendant stopped short of threatening to
                    call default.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 29 October 2008, Ms Khua sent an
                    e-mail which set the date 14 November 2008 for the repayment of the amounts
                    outstanding under the Ad Hoc Short Term Loans. Ms Khua also noted that
                    repayment was supposed to be from proceeds of sale of the MAP

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     By this time, <em>ie</em>, 29 October 2008, S$2.5m was due under the 1st Ad Hoc Short
                    Term Loan, S$6.5m was due under the 2nd Ad Hoc Short Term loan and,
                    approximately, US$4.2m and S$700,000 were due under the main banking facilities.
                    Ms Khua and Terry Law (“Law”), who was then a deputy manager
                    in the Institutional Banking Group of the defendant, had voiced their
                    displeasure over the Companies’ conduct and were pressing for repayment of
                    all outstandings. In view of the outstanding amount due from the Companies,
                    Ms Tan noted that this was “extremely worrying” and
                    instructed Ms Khua to “push [the Companies] hard for all overdues
                    and excesses to be settled”. Internally, Law was also being pressured by
                    Ms Tan to push the Companies to make repayment. In Law’s
                    words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I guess the build-up [to taking the Charge on 13 November 2008] of this
                        case is also crucial that we [<em>ie</em>, Ms Khua
                        and Law] had to do something to actually get back to <em>my
                            boss, who was breathing down my neck all the time</em>, at
                        that point of time, so ... we were already chasing for payments, ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant subsequently extended the
                    14 November 2008 repayment date by two weeks. According to the defendant,
                    it had only agreed to extend the repayment of the Ad Hoc Short Term Loans by two
                    weeks because JHTI had extended the charge in question (discussed below at
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>) to the defendant. However, the
                    defendant did not inform JHTI of the extension. The defendant also continued to
                    press JHTI for repayment during the extension period. From 14 November 2008
                    onwards, Yeo (not knowing that internal approval had been obtained by the
                    defendant for a two-week extension) made several requests for the defendant to
                    extend the repayment deadline of the Ad Hoc Short Term Loans; each time, the
                    deadline was extended by one or a few days. The defendant continued to grant
                    rollovers of the Ad Hoc Short Term Loans even after the two-week extension
                    period had expired. The defendant continued to rollover the Ad Hoc Short Term
                    Loans until it was ready to recall the facilities and issued a letter of demand
                    on 14 January 2009. As for the Companies’ longer term loans with the
                    defendant, the deadline for payment had already been extended in the months of
                    May to August 2008 to much later dates in the months of November to February
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Besides the defendant, other banks such as ABN
                    AMRO, Rabobank and SMBC were also granting rollovers to the Companies
                    whilst simultaneously demanding repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Sometime in November 2008, Richard Lee of
                    Rabobank asked Ms Lin to place the shares in MAP in an “escrow
                    account” with Rabobank. Ms Lin told him that this could not be
                    done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Some banks eventually began to demand payment
                    of all amounts outstanding. On 7 November 2008, KBC served a letter of
                    demand on the Companies calling default and declaring that all amounts due under
                    the banking facilities were immediately due and payable. On 13 November 2008,
                    Rabobank issued a letter to the Companies which, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, requested that the Companies make payment of any and all
                    sums currently due and outstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is against this background that the charge
                    in question was granted. On 13 November 2008, Ms Lin received a call from
                    Ms Khua, to go to the defendant’s office. There, she was informed
                    that the defendant wanted a charge over the MAP shares owned by JHTI,
                    Ms Lin agreed and signed the Security Memorandum granting the defendant a
                    charge (“the Charge”) over the MAP Shares and arranged for the
                    common seal of JHTI to be affixed thereafter in the presence of Dr Chung
                    and Yeo. Particulars of the charge were lodged for registration with the
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority on 10 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It bears pointing out that at the time the
                    Charge was granted no new loans were extended to the Companies. Nor were new
                    loans extended by the defendant after the grant of the Charge. Regarding the
                    taking of the Charge, it is interesting to note from an entry in a draft of a
                    memorandum dated 17 November 2008 prepared within the defendant (between
                    Ms Khua and Law each of whom pointed to the other as being the author of
                    the said entry) that the defendant was taking the Charge “for whatever it
                    [was] worth” and would then seek legal advice on the defendant’s
                    rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Subsequently, the Companies received letters
                    of demand from ABN AMRO, BTMU, Maybank, Rabobank and OCBC. The defendant
                    too eventually sent a letter of demand on 14 January 2009 to the Companies,
                    demanding immediate repayment of amounts outstanding. As mentioned above, the
                    Companies were placed under judicial management on 20 February 2009. I do
                    not make much of the fact that it was upon the application of the defendant that
                    the judicial managers were appointed. The writing was already on the wall. If
                    they had not done so, another of the creditors would have applied either for
                    JHTI to be wound up or for judicial managers to be appointed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiffs thereafter commenced this
                    action, seeking to set aside the Charge on the ground that the Charge
                    constituted an unfair preference under s 227T of the Companies
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The relevant legal principles are as follows.
                    Section 227T(1) of the Companies Act provides that a charge on property made by
                    a company shall, in the event of the company being placed under judicial
                    management, be void against the judicial manager, if the charge is such that had
                    it been made by a natural person, it would in the event of his becoming bankrupt
                    be void as against the Official Assignee under ss 98, 99 or 103 of the
                    Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the BA”) read
                    with ss 100, 101 and 102 thereof. Section 227T(2) of the Companies Act
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of subsection (1), the date that corresponds with the
                        date of the application for a bankruptcy order in the case of a natural
                        person and the date on which a person is adjudged bankrupt is the date on
                        which an application for a judicial management order is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Of the several provisions of the BA made
                    applicable through s 227T of the Companies Act, the provision that is of
                    most relevance to the present proceedings is s 99, which deals with unfair
                    preference. Section 99(1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to this section and sections 100 and 102, where an individual is
                        adjudged bankrupt and he has, at the relevant time (as defined in section
                        100), given an unfair preference to any person, the Official Assignee may
                        apply to the court for an order under this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 99(3) states that an individual gives an unfair preference to
                    a person when:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    that person is one of the individual’s
                            creditors or a surety or guarantor for any of his debts or other
                            liabilities; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the individual does anything or suffers anything
                            to be done which (in either case) has the effect of putting that person
                            into a position which, in the event of the individual’s
                            bankruptcy, will be better than the position he would have been in if
                            that thing had not been done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A finding that there was an unfair preference shall not be made
                    unless the individual who gave the preference was influenced in deciding to give
                    it by a desire to produce in relation to that person the effect mentioned in
                    s 99(3)(b): s 99(4) of the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As for the period of time during which unfair
                    preferences are caught by ss 99 of the BA, s 100(1) of the BA (read with
                    s 227T(1) of the Companies Act) provides that the time at which an
                    individual gives an unfair preference shall be a relevant time if the preference
                    is given within the period of six months ending on the date of the application
                    for the judicial management order. Section 100(2) of the BA provides that the
                    time period referred to above shall not be a relevant time period unless the
                    individual:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    is insolvent at that time; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    becomes insolvent in consequence of the
                            transaction or preference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The aforementioned provisions can be
                    summarised as follows. In order for the granting of the Charge to be impugned as
                    being an unfair preference, it must be shown that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant was a creditor of
                        JHTI;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        granting of the Charge put the defendant in a better position than it would
                        otherwise have been in in the event of JHTI’s
                    insolvency;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     in
                        granting the Charge, JHTI was influenced by a desire to prefer the
                        defendant, <em>ie</em>, to put the defendant in a
                        better position than it would otherwise been in in the event of JHTI’s
                        insolvency;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Charge was granted to the defendant within a period of six months prior to
                        the date of the application for the judicial management order;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a>(e)     JHTI was either
                        insolvent at the time the Charge was granted or became insolvent as a result
                        of the granting of the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The parties did not
                    dispute that the criteria in (a), (b) and (d) above were satisfied. Therefore,
                    the key issues at trial concerned (c) and (e). I shall address these in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was JHTI influenced by a desire to prefer the defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Section 99 – the provision in the BA
                    dealing with unfair preferences – was enacted in 1995 and is similar to
                    s 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom, which introduced
                    several changes to the law of the United Kingdom: Kan Ting Chiu J in <em>Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation)</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 205 (“<em>Re
                    Libra</em>”), at [36]. Millett J discussed, in great detail,
                    the changes brought about by the new law in the English decision <em>Re MC Bacon Ltd</em> [1990] BCLC 324
                        (“<em>Re Bacon</em>”), which was cited
                    with approval in <em>Re Libra</em>, at [36]–[38], and
                        <em>Amrae Benchuan Trading Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Tan Te
                        Teck Gregory</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 969) at [45]–[51].
                    The provision we are concerned with here is s 99(4) of the BA, wherein the
                    requirement for the requisite desire to have influenced the granting of the
                    charge can be found. In speaking of the English equivalent to s 99(4) of
                    the BA, Millett J stated, at 335, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is no longer necessary to establish a <em>dominant</em> intention to prefer. It is sufficient that the
                        decision was <em>influenced</em> by the requisite
                        desire. That is the first change. The second is that it is no longer
                        sufficient to establish an <em>intention</em> to
                        prefer. There must be a <em>desire</em> to produce the
                        effect mentioned in the subsection. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Millett J then continued to elaborate on
                    the difference between “intention” and “desire” at
                    335:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Intention is objective, desire is subjective. A man can choose the
                        lesser of two evils without desiring either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And at 336:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Under the new regime a transaction will not be set aside as a voidable
                        preference unless the company positively wished to improve the
                        creditor’s position in the event of its own insolvent
                        liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, foreseeing the difficulty involved in proving desire,
                    Millett J insightfully added, at 336, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, of course, no need for there to be direct evidence of the
                        requisite desire. Its existence may be inferred from the circumstances of
                        the case just as the dominant intention could be inferred under the old law.
                        But the mere presence of the requisite desire will not be sufficient by
                        itself. It must have influenced the decision to enter into the transaction.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That does not mean that the requisite desire must have been the factor
                    that “tipped the scales”; that would, in the considered opinion of
                    Millett J, be too high a standard. Rather, the requirement is
                    “satisfied if it was one of the factors which operated on the minds of
                    those who made the decision”: <em>Re Bacon</em>, at 336.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     
          <em>Re Bacon</em> was
                    followed in the English decision of <em>Re Fairway Magazines
                        Ltd</em> [1993] BCLC 643. That case concerned the question
                    whether a debenture granted by a company was a voidable preference.
                    Mummery J stated, at 649, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it does not follow that, because there was a desire to grant the
                        debenture or to make the payment, there was a desire to prefer the creditor
                        in the event of insolvency. If the company is influenced by ‘proper
                        commercial considerations’ and not by a ‘positive wish to
                        improve the creditor’s position in the event of its insolvent
                        liquidation’, then the debenture will be valid. If a desire to prefer
                        is present, however, it is sufficient that it influences the decision. It
                        does not have to be the sole or decisive influence on the decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Therefore, if a company is influenced by
                    “proper commercial considerations” and not a desire to improve the
                    creditor’s position, the security interest granted will not be regarded as
                    a voidable preference. However, it is crucial to note that this is only the case
                    where there is no “positive wish” to improve the creditor’s
                    position; if such a desire to prefer is present and influences the decision,
                    even if it did not “tip the scales” or dictate the decision, that
                    suffices for the purposes of s 99 of the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning then to the facts at hand, there is
                    more than ample evidence that in granting the Charge, JHTI desired putting the
                    defendant in a better position than it would otherwise have been in and that
                    this desire influenced the granting of the Charge. Ms Lin stated in her
                    first affidavit, filed on 22 June 2009, that she was willing to sign the
                    Security Memorandum to grant the Charge as the defendant had helped the
                    Companies by granting the Companies short term loans when no other bank was
                    willing to do so, and the defendant had been very supportive of the Companies.
                    She further stated in her second affidavit, filed on 27 August 2009, that
                    the “fact that DBS wanted to provide financing to the Companies even in
                    November 2008 made me feel that DBS was very supportive of the Companies, and
                    this support contributed to my decision to give the Charge to
                    DBS”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Ms Lin also testified, on re-examination,
                    that JHTI had granted the Charge to the defendant as the defendant was
                    supportive in extending facilities to JHTI when other banks were unwilling
                    to:</p>

                            and that is why you gave the charge, that is a false

                        doesn’t want to continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It was difficult at time to understand
                    Ms Lin’s testimony owing to her command of the English language. She
                    also suffered from memory lapses at several junctures. Nevertheless, I was
                    satisfied that her testimony was credible and reliable with respect to the
                    underlying reason for the granting of the Charge: namely, that the defendant had
                    been very supportive of the Companies in the past.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Ms Lin’s reason for granting the
                    Charge was supported by others at the Companies. Dr Chung and Yeo stated in
                    their affidavits that they supported Ms Lin’s decision to grant the
                    Charge to the defendant as they felt that the defendant had been very supportive
                    of the Companies in the past in granting them short term loans when no other
                    bank was willing to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This is supported too by the circumstantial
                    evidence. JHTI had told its bank creditors that it would be raising funds
                    through the sale of various assets. However, JHTI eventually chose to grant the
                    Charge to the defendant only. The other banks exerted as much, if not more,
                    pressure on the Companies (above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>),
                    yet the Charge was granted to the defendant. Indeed, Ms Khua admitted that
                    the pressure exerted by KBC was greater than that exerted by the defendant as
                    KBC had issued a formal letter of demand. Prior to 13 November 2008, there
                    was no indication that the defendant had approved the recall of facilities to
                    JHTI. Furthermore, no new facilities were granted or disbursed to the Companies
                    as a result of the granting of the Charge. Although the defendant alleged that
                    the Charge was granted by JHTI in exchange for a two-week extension for payment,
                    this was not conveyed to the Companies. In any event, it is questionable that a
                    two-week extension would have constituted a proper commercial consideration,
                    given JHTI’s dire situation (discussed further below at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>). There were, therefore, no valid commercial
                    reasons for JHTI to grant the Charge to the defendant. Thus, there was clearly a
                    desire to prefer the defendant that influenced the granting of the
                    Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The case of <em>Re Sweetmart
                        Garment Works Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [2008] 2 HKLRD 92
                        (“<em>Re Sweetmart</em>”) referred to by
                    counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Sarjit Singh Gill SC, is pertinent. A
                    decision of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance, it concerned an application
                    by the liquidators of a company to set aside a mortgage granted by the company
                    over a pleasure craft owned by it to a creditor bank (“the Bank”)
                    as an unfair preference within the meaning of s 50 of the Bankruptcy
                    Ordinance. Section 50 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> with s 99 of the BA. The Bank had sent various
                    e-mails chasing the company to settle its outstanding facilities – but
                    these were in vain. The Bank then threatened that the consequences of failure to
                    make payment would be “serious”. One of its correspondence
                    included a threat to issue a letter of demand on the company. This was compared
                    to the action taken by several other creditor banks, who had all served formal
                    letters of demand on the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The court in <em>Re
                        Sweetmart</em> held (at [29]) that the steps taken by the other banks
                    were “more concrete, more serious, and instituted much more
                    promptly” than those threatened by the Bank. Furthermore, the court held
                    (at [30]) that given the company’s disastrous financial position, it
                    could not have thought that it would be able to carry on business for any decent
                    length of time so as to benefit from maintaining its relationship with the
                    Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Similarly, in the case at hand, the pressure
                    exerted by the defendant pales in comparison with that exerted by the other
                    banks that had already sent the Companies formal letters of demand (above at
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>). As for the defendant’s
                    attempts to justify the grant of the Charge as being based on commercial
                    reasons, the reasoning in <em>Re Sweetmart</em> is apropos:
                    given JHTI’s overall indebtedness and the letters of demand that had been
                    served on JHTI up to that point, JHTI could not possibly have envisaged carrying
                    on its business for any decent length of time even if it had managed to avoid
                    having the defendant issue a letter of demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Counsel for the defendant, Mr Ashok Kumar, made several arguments. First, he argued that the Charge was granted in order to avert the defendant recalling its facilities and allow the Companies to pursue and close the GEM Deal. (Ms Lin had testified that this deal, had it closed, would have possibly brought in US$160m for the Companies.) The GEM Deal would have been scuttled if the defendant had issued a letter of demand; thus, the Company was influenced by proper commercial considerations in granting the Charge. Furthermore, KBC, one of the two creditors that had served a letter of demand prior to the granting of the Charge, had agreed to a standstill arrangement with the Companies and not to do anything until the GEM Deal had carried through. It emerged at trial that the letter of demand from the other creditor, Rabobank, was never received by the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, this contention was untenable. Realistically, it could not have been a proper commercial consideration to grant the Charge with a view to averting a declaration of default by the defendant when the Companies were heavily indebted to many other banks at the same time. JHTI could not possibly have expected them to wait patiently while the GEM Deal was pursued, and especially not after letters of demand had already been issued – much less after finding out about the Charge. </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On cross-examination, Ms Khua agreed with
                    counsel for the plaintiffs that if the other banks had found out about the
                    Charge, the GEM Deal could not close. It may have been the case that KBC was
                    willing to hold off until the closing of the GEM Deal; but that did not mean
                    that the other creditors, Rabobank included, would have been willing to do so as
                    well. Moreover, once the other creditors discovered that the defendant had been
                    given the Charge, they would have applied either to wind up the company or to
                    place it under judicial management so as to preserve their right to impugn the
                    preference. In fact, it was only after the defendant had lodged the Charge
                    for registration on 10 December 2008 that the other banks, namely, ABN AMRO,
                    BTMU, Maybank and OCBC sent the Companies letters of demand. This is not
                    surprising, as the banks would have found out about the Charge upon its
                    registration. I therefore did not agree with defendant’s counsel that
                    there were proper commercial considerations influencing the decision to grant
                    the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It was also contended that there was pressure
                    exerted on the Companies and that a clear threat was conveyed to them. Counsel
                    for the defendant referred the court to <em>Lin Securities Pte v
                        Royal Trust Bank (Asia) Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 899
                        (“<em>Lin Securities</em>”). There, a
                    stockbroking firm (“LSP”) had made arrangements with Royal Trust
                    Bank (Asia) Ltd (“RTB”) and 20 other banks to obtain credit
                    facilities secured by the hypothecation of shares in its possession. Following a
                    dramatic decline in the stock market, LSP became insolvent. The banks
                    started to demand delivery of the shares charged to them but LSP, for the most
                    part, managed to resist the demands. LSP gave in to pressure from RTB, however,
                    and entered into an arrangement with RTB whereby the shares charged to RTB were
                    to be handed to it to be kept in its custody each afternoon when trading closed
                    and returned the following morning to allow the company to carry on its
                    business. On one occasion, when LSP tried to re-take delivery of the shares in
                    RTB’s custody, RTB refused to return the shares to LSP. LSP went into
                    liquidation. The liquidator challenged the transaction as a fraudulent
                    preference under s 329 of the 1994 Revised Edition of the Companies Act.
                    That challenge failed both before the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The
                    latter held that in entering into the arrangement with RTB, LSP had not acted
                    with a view to preferring RTB over all other creditors. Instead, LSP was merely
                    bowing to RTB’s business like, but effective, pressure or
                threat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Ashok Kumar submitted that the case
                    above illustrates that pressure can be exerted in more ways than one. In that
                    case, a “clear message of a threat had been effectively conveyed to [LSP]
                    in a businesslike manner without uttering any harsh language in the form of a
                    threat or demand”: <em>Lin Securities</em> at
                    [28]. However, the executive director of RTB had stated that LSP was aware that
                    if he did not agree to the “request”, RTB would immediately
                    terminate the facility and call for the payment of the amount owing. This was
                    far from the situation in the case at hand where, in the face of other banks
                    having taken more concrete steps to stress the seriousness of their demands,
                    JHTI nevertheless chose to prefer the defendant over them. The case, therefore,
                    is of little assistance to the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Thus, in conclusion, I was satisfied that JHTI
                    was influenced by a desire to prefer the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was JHTI insolvent at the time the Charge was granted or did JHTI
                become insolvent as a result of the granting of the Charge?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Section 100(4) of the BA states that a person
                    shall be “insolvent” for the purposes of s 100(2) if:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">he is unable to pay his debts as they fall due;
                            or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the value of his assets is less than the amount of
                            his liabilities, taking into account his contingent and prospective
                            liabilities.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first test above may be described as the “liquidity
                    test”, while the second may be described as the “balance sheet
                    test”: <em>Leun Wah Electric Co (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation)
                        v Sigma Cable Co (Pte) Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 227
                        (“<em>Leun Wah</em>”) at [8]. It is
                    trite law that the two subsections of s 100(4) are to be read
                    disjunctively: <em>Velstra Pte Ltd (in compulsory winding up) v
                        Azero Investments SA</em> [2004] SGHC 251 at [89]. I shall
                    apply each of these tests to the facts at hand in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The liquidity test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Leun Wah</em>, the
                    court found (at [8]) that the company was insolvent as it was “pressed
                    for payments at the material time from many quarters and had not been able to
                    pay”. There is sufficient evidence here that from as early as February
                    2008, creditors had been pressing JHTI for payment. Though most of the demands
                    were in the form of e-mail correspondence rather than letters of demand, I am of
                    the view that there is no need for such demands to be made only by way of letter
                    for the purposes of this test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In that respect, I wholeheartedly agree with
                    the proposition put forth by Professor Ian F Fletcher in <em>The
                        Law of Insolvency</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2002)
                        (“<em>The Law of Insolvency</em>”) which
                    was referred to by counsel for the plaintiffs. At para 20-017, Prof
                    Fletcher states (in the context of discussing s 123(1)(e) of the English
                    Insolvency Act 1986, which deals with the proof of a company’s inability
                    to pay its debts as they fall due) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As proof of the debtor company’s state of illiquidity, it will
                        suffice to exhibit to the court some evidence- conveniently, often, in the
                        form of correspondence – showing an unequivocal request for payment
                        made by the creditor, and an absence of any bona fide dispute as to
                        indebtedness on the part of the debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Here there was much in the way of correspondence from creditors,
                    unequivocally requesting payment, and an absence of any <em>bona
                        fide</em> dispute as to indebtedness on the part of
                JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Furthermore, the cash balance of JHTI with its
                    banks as at 13 November 2008 was in the negative. No evidence was provided
                    by the defendant as to what specific assets of JHTI could have readily been sold
                    in order for the proceeds to be taken into account for the purposes of the
                    liquidity test; nor was evidence adduced as to the amount of such proceeds that
                    ought to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The situation at hand may be best summarised
                    thus: JHTI was unable to service its debts as and when they fell due, resulting
                    in several creditors issuing letters of demand at the time the Charge was
                    granted. I am therefore firmly of the view that JHTI was insolvent when it
                    granted the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The balance sheet test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In view of the fact that the test in
                    s 100(4) of the BA is disjunctive rather than conjunctive and that JHTI has
                    failed the liquidity test, it is unnecessary to go into the balance sheet test.
                    I shall nevertheless do so for the sake of completeness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     JHTI’s balance sheets as at
                    30 September 2008 and 31 December 2008 indicated that JHTI was balance
                    sheet solvent. However, the plaintiffs had, while investigating the financial
                    affairs of the Companies, come across dubious accounting entries in the accounts
                    of the Companies. The evidence of the plaintiffs was that had the errors in
                    those accounting entries been taken into account at the time the balance sheets
                    were prepared, it would have been evident that JHTI was balance sheet <em>insolvent</em> at the time the Charge was executed. When
                    those accounting issues were brought to the attention of JHTI’s accounting
                    staff, they proceeded to make adjustments to the accounts with the approval of
                    the directors. The major adjustments were made to the accounts receivable,
                    related party balances, stock and inventory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Leun Wah</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> <em>supra</em>), the court accepted the auditor’s
                    recommendation that adjustments be made to the balance sheet of the company;
                    this resulted in the company being insolvent on the balance sheet
                test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Counsel for the defendant contended that the
                    directors’ view as to the solvency of the company at the time the balance
                    sheets were prepared should not be displaced by the court on the basis of
                    subsequent adjustments. This contention is untenable. The balance sheet test,
                    applying s 100(4) of the BA, is simply whether the value of JHTI’s
                    assets as at the balance sheet date was less than the amount of its liabilities,
                    taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. The test is an
                    objective one and not subject to the vagaries of the directors’ subjective
                    views at that time, much less their erroneous views as demonstrated by their
                    acceptance of the aforesaid adjustments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Counsel for the defendant also submitted that
                    whether JHTI was solvent or not had to be seen in the light of all the
                    circumstances of the case; in particular, the solvency assessment had to
                    take into account what was known or ought to have been known at the relevant
                    time without the intrusion of hindsight. Counsel for the defendant relied upon
                    the Australian case of <em>Lewis (as liquidator of Doran
                        Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) v Doran &amp; others</em>
                    [2005] NSWCA 243 (“<em>Doran</em>”)
                    where Giles JA in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South
                    Wales held at [103]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Solvency or insolvency is a state on which directors and others act in
                        current conduct, for example if the issue is trading while insolvent.
                        Section 95A speaks of objective ability to pay debts as and when they become
                        due and payable, but ability must be determined in the circumstances as they
                        were known or ought to have been known at the relevant time, without
                        intrusion of hindsight. There must of course be ‘consideration ...
                        given to the immediate future’ (<em>Bank of Australasia
                            v Hall</em> [1907] HCA 78; (1907) 4 CLR 1514
                        at 1528 per Griffith CJ), and how far into the future will depend on the
                        circumstances including the nature of the company’s business and, if
                        it is known, of the future liabilities. <b><em>Unexpected</em></b> later discovery of a liability, or later
                        quantification of a liability at an unexpected level, may be excluded from
                        consideration <b><em>if the liability was properly unknown or
                            seen in lesser amount at the relevant time</em></b>. ... [emphasis
                        added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I do not disagree with the statement and would draw attention to the
                    qualifications built into the statement. In particular, later discovery of a
                    liability or later quantification of a liability at an unexpected level may be
                    taken into account if it was not “<em>unexpected</em>” or if it was not “<em>properly</em> unknown or seen in lesser amount at the relevant
                    time”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Giles JA’s reference in <em>Doran</em> to an assessment made “without the
                    intrusion of hindsight” was adopted and elaborated upon by Owen J in
                        <em>The Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v Westpac Banking
                        Corporation (No 9)</em> [2008] WASC 239. At [1115]
                    Owen J held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... when determining the company’s ability to pay, it must be done
                        according to the circumstances or state of affairs which were known or
                            ‘<b><em>knowable</em></b>’ at the time.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge went on to say at [1116] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <b><em>a court can take into account facts available in
                            hindsight</em></b> (that is, after the determinative date of solvency)
                            <b><em>if the facts help determine which version of
                            conflicting accounts as to the state of affairs is the more
                            likely</em></b>. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Owen J then concluded at [1117] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the court can apply its knowledge of post-event facts to determine
                        whether the proffered expectations of the parties (the commercial realities
                        with regard to cash flow) were or were not realistic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The foregoing statements in the two Australian
                    cases were <em>apropos</em> the liquidity test rather than
                    the balance sheet test. Nevertheless, the views expressed in regard to the
                    applicability or otherwise of subsequent facts are, in my opinion, equally
                    applicable to the balance sheet test of solvency. However, as I stated earlier,
                    they do not assist the defendant. It is clear from the evidence of the first
                    plaintiff that the impugned entries in the balance sheets were unrealistically
                    optimistic. When they were brought to the attention of the directors, they
                    agreed to the adjustments without any demurrer. In my view, that showed that the
                    earlier figures were not realistic and the adjustments were not
                    “unexpected”. This can hardly be described as a case where
                    hindsight was allowed to intrude. I am therefore of the view that JHTI was also
                    insolvent on the balance sheet test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In conclusion, the granting of the Charge by
                    JHTI to the defendant was an unfair preference within the meaning of s 99
                    of the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Section 99(2) of the BA provides that the
                    court shall, on an application under s 99, “make such order as it
                    thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that
                    individual had not given that unfair preference”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Subsequent to the granting of the Charge, the
                    MAP Shares were disposed of in two separate batches:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     in the first batch, S$570,439.49 was
                        received as net sale proceeds; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     in the second batch, approximately S$9.68m was received
                        as net sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since I have found the grant of the
                    Charge to be an unfair preference under s 99 of the BA, I hold that the
                    defendant shall pay JHTI the total net sale proceeds received from the disposal
                    of the MAP Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Costs to the plaintiffs shall be taxed unless
                    agreed.</p>
