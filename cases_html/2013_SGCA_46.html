<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present cross-appeals arise from an award
                    made at an assessment of damages by the High Court judge (“the
                    Judge”) on 15 May 2012 in <em>Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and
                        others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie</em> [2012] SGHC 193 (“the
                    Damages Judgment”) pursuant to a decision of this court in <em>Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and
                        another appeal</em> [2012] 1 SLR 506 (the “Merits
                    Judgment”). The Judge awarded a total sum of S$420,000 to the four
                    plaintiffs as damages for defamation with each plaintiff being awarded $70,000
                    in general damages and $35,000 in aggravated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the close of the hearing on 18 March 2013, we
                    reserved judgment and directed parties to file further written submissions on
                    three questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     What is the appropriate approach to
                        take in an assessment of damages for defamation where the plaintiffs are
                        members of a collective group? Is there any specific principle of
                        proportionality which the court should have regard to?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Are there any particular principles
                        which the court should apply in assessing aggravated
                    damages?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Would this
                        Court be entitled to vary the taxed costs awarded to the Plaintiffs on the
                        issue of liability pursuant to the Merits Judgment of this
                    court?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Chan Cheng Wah Bernard@Alif Abdullah
                    (“Bernard Chan”), Tan Hock Lay Robin (“Robin Tan”),
                    Chong Tjee Teng Nicholas (“Nicholas Chong”) and Ho Bok Kee
                    (“Michael Ho”) were members of the 2007/2008 management committee
                    (“the previous MC”) of the Singapore Swimming Club (the
                    “Club”) holding the positions of President, Vice-President,
                    Honorary Treasurer and Facilities Chairman of the Club respectively. They were
                    the plaintiffs in the action below, Suit No 33 of 2009 (“the
                    action”). They are the respondents in CA 63 of 2012 and the appellants in
                    CA 68 of 2012. They will hereinafter be referred to as “the
                    Plaintiffs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Freddie Koh Sin Chong was defendant in the
                    action and is the appellant in CA 63 of 2012/respondent in CA 68 of 2012. He was
                    elected President of the 2008/2009 management committee of the Club (“the
                    current MC”) at the Club’s Annual General Meeting
                    (“AGM”) held in May 2008 (“the May 2008 Elections”).
                    He was re-elected as President for a further one-year term at the AGM held in
                    2009. He will hereinafter be referred to as “the
                    Defendant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the action the Plaintiffs sued the Defendant
                    for defamation. The facts of the case were set out at length in our Merits
                    Judgment and will not be repeated here. Briefly, the present dispute arose from
                    two statements (“the First Statement”, “the Second
                    Statement” and collectively, “the Statements”) made by the
                    Defendant in the course of an investigation carried out by the current MC into
                    certain “emergency” expenditure incurred by the previous MC
                    relating to the purchase of a new water system for the two swimming pools of the
                    Club (“the TWC Expenditure”). These statements were reflected in
                    the minutes of meetings of the current MC held on 29 October 2008 and 26
                    November 2008 (“the Minutes”), which were posted on the notice
                    board of the Club.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the conclusion of the trial to establish
                    liability, the Judge held that while the statements were defamatory of the
                    Plaintiffs, the Defendant was successful in his plea of justification. She also
                    held that the statements were made on an occasion of qualified privilege. On
                    appeal by the Plaintiffs, we reversed the decision of the Judge and held that
                    the defence of justification was not made out by the Defendant and that the
                    defence of qualified privilege was defeated on account of his malice. We further
                    ordered that damages be assessed by the Judge. Costs for that appeal and for the
                    trial were awarded to the Plaintiffs on a standard basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Following the Merits Judgment, the Statements
                    were republished as part of a narration of events surrounding the TWC
                    Expenditure in a Press Publication concerning the Club’s matters dated 8
                    February 2012 (“the Facts Sheet”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the nature and gravity of the defamation, the
                    Judge held that the Statements were grave as they imputed dishonesty on the part
                    of the Plaintiffs, notwithstanding this court’s finding of minor
                    inaccuracies in the representations made by the previous MC when it sought
                    ratification of the TWC Expenditure. However, she also observed that the sting
                    of the charge was diluted as dishonesty was not imputed to the Plaintiffs
                    individually but to the previous MC as a whole. Further, the suggested
                    dishonesty related to persuading members to ratify expenditure which had been
                    incurred on the Club’s behalf, rather than a more serious level of
                    dishonesty such as the taking of funds for their own direct financial benefit or
                    the commission of a criminal offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge also held that the fact the
                    Plaintiffs, as Club members, were defamed in the eyes of other Club members by a
                    person holding a position of authority, was a factor which should enhance the
                    quantum of damages to be awarded to the Plaintiffs, even though they were not
                    public figures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Emphasis was placed by the Judge on the less
                    than widespread publication of the defamatory statements. Crucially, she noted
                    that the form of publication was passive in the sense that the Minutes were
                    simply put on the Club’s notice board as a matter of course and would not
                    have been read except by members interested in the Club’s affairs. She
                    further found it likely that the Minutes did not remain on the board for more
                    than a month. Although she recognised that the dispute was a live one and the
                    Statements were thus <em>possibly</em> published to quite a
                    number of people, she was not satisfied that the Plaintiffs had discharged the
                    burden of proving that there was more than a moderate dissemination of the
                    defamatory statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Aggravating factors considered by the Judge
                    included the Defendant’s failure to apologise; the presence of malice as
                    noted by this court in the Merits Judgment; and the conduct of the Defendant at
                    the trial, in particular the prolonged and aggressive cross-examination of the
                        Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In light of these factors and our finding
                    in the Merits Judgment that the dominant motive of the Defendant in publishing
                    the defamatory statements was to injure the Plaintiffs, the Judge awarded
                    aggravated damages. However, she held that the Defendant’s plea of
                    justification was not “bound to fail” as it succeeded in the first
                    instance and thus could not be considered as a factor aggravating
                        damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Judge also placed no weight on the
                    republication of the Statements in the Facts Sheet in February 2012, as this
                    took place after the the Plaintiffs had been vindicated by the Merits Judgment.
                    Hence, the republication would not have further damaged the Plaintiffs’
                        reputations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Having considered all these factors as well as
                    the awards given in <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and
                        another and another appeal</em> [2010] 4 SLR 357 (“<em>Peter Lim</em>”) and <em>Arul Chandran
                        v Chew Chin Aik Victor</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Arul Chandran</em>”), the two precedents which the
                    Judge thought were most germane to the present case, the Judge awarded each of
                    the Plaintiffs S$70,000 as general damages and S$35,000 as aggravated
                        damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Both
                    the Plaintiffs and Defendant have appealed against the Judge’s award, with
                    the Defendant seeking to reduce it and the Plaintiffs to have it
                    increased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The issues which arise in the present appeals
                    on the Judge’s assessment may be categorised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Judge erred in her
                        assessment of general damages and/or aggravated damages;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the same quantum of damages
                        needed to be awarded to each of the Plaintiffs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether this Court would be justified
                        in varying the award of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessing damages where the plaintiffs are part of a collective group
                defamed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As the Plaintiffs in the present case were
                    defamed as members of an unincorporated group (<em>ie</em>,
                    members of the previous MC), a preliminary point which we need to address is how
                    damages should be awarded in favour of such a group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span><em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> (Patrick Milmo &amp; W
                    V H Rogers eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008, 11<sup>th</sup> Ed)
                        (“<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em>”)
                    at para 8.28 states the following in relation to defamation involving
                    unincorporated associations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Where the members of such a group are defamed, each has his own
                        action if sufficiently identified by the libel. An action for libel will not
                        lie against an unincorporated association or body of persons in its
                        collective name, for as an entity it can neither publish not authorize the
                        publication of a libel. Nor can it sue for it lacks sufficient
                        personality…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence where an unincorporated group is defamed, members of the group
                    must bring an action in defamation in their individual names. There is no
                    concept of representative action; members of the group may not bring an action
                    in defamation on behalf of the group or the other members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, the Defendant submits that the
                    correct approach for the court to adopt in assessing damages where an
                    unincorporated body is involved is to assess damages collectively and make a
                    single award to the group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Apportionment between the
                    individual claimants comprising the group can then be carried out, taking into
                    account factors such as who was principally targeted and who within the group
                    was most closely associated with the defamatory remarks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Defendant also seeks to distinguish
                    between the defamation of a strictly organized and homogeneous group which acts
                    collectively, which he argues was the case here, and the situation where
                    individuals bring an action in defamation by virtue of their identity with a
                    group which is the subject of defamation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It seems to us that the Defendant’s
                    submission is not borne out by the authorities. In the earlier case of <em>Booth v Briscoe</em> (1877) 2 QBD 496 (“<em>Booth</em>”), Bramwell J held at 497-498 :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here <em>there is no joint damage</em>. Each man's
                        character, if there is a libel, has been separately libelled... But although
                        they might all join, I think, as their damages are several, <em>their damages ought to have been severally assessed</em>,
                        instead of which, 40s. has been given to the whole of them. [emphasis

<em>Booth</em> concerned eight trustees of a
                    charity who had been libelled by a letter written and published by the defendant
                    in a newsletter commenting on the improper management of the charity by the
                    trustees. The court held that the damage was inflicted on each trustee
                    separately, although the libel attacked them jointly as trustees. Likewise in
                    the present case, notwithstanding the defamatory statements harmed the
                    Plaintiffs jointly as members of the previous MC, damage was inflicted to their
                        <em>individual</em> reputations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Our case law has shown that where several
                    persons in an unincorporated group are defamed, the correct approach as regards
                    assessment of damages would be to assess the award due to each plaintiff
                    separately: see for instance <em>A Balakrishnan and others v
                        Nirumalan K Pillay</em> and others [1999] 2 SLR(R) 462
                        (“<em>Balakrishnan</em>”) which concerned
                    the defamation of a committee of persons and <em>TJ System (S)
                        Pte Ltd and Others v Ngow Kheong Shen (No 2)</em> [2003] SGHC 217
                        (“<em>TJ System</em>”) which concerned a
                    group of employees being defamed. The same approach has also been adopted in
                    other common law jurisdictions like Australia (see <em>Vlasic and
                        Others v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd and John Fairfax and
                        Sons Ltd</em> (1976) 9 ACTR 1 and <em>Nikolopoulos v
                        Greek Herald Pty Ltd</em> [2003] NSWSC 1060)); and Canada (see
                        <em>Alberta Union of Provincial Employees et al v Edmonton
                        Sun et al</em> [1986] CarswellAlta 269)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Defendant seeks to rely on <em>Bou Malhab v Diffusion Métromédia CMR inc</em> [2011] 1 SCR
                    214 as authority for the proposition that where several persons are defamed as a
                    group, the assessment of damages due to each of the plaintiffs should be carried
                    out on a group basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> However, we find
                    that this case does not support the Defendant’s contention. First, it does
                    not deal with the assessment of damages but with the threshold question of
                    whether the claim in defamation was actionable. The impugned remark targeted
                    taxi drivers in Montreal whose mother tongue was Arabic or Creole. Second, where
                    the court at [55] referred to “choosing the appropriate recovery method,
                    whether individual or collective”, the collective recovery method it was
                    referring to was a class (representative) action and not an assessment of
                    damages on a group basis as argued by the Defendant. The court in fact
                    emphasised at [48] and [53] that even for a class action, proof of injury in
                    respect of each member of the group must be established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Defendant also seeks to distinguish
                        <em>Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew and another and other
                        appeals</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 576 (“<em>Tang
                        Liang Hong</em>”) where this court assessed damages
                    individually, on the basis that the reference there to “the PAP
                    leaders” would be understood as a reference to the individual leaders and
                    not a collective group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> We think,
                    however, that this distinction drawn by the Defendant is wholly artificial.
                    According to the Defendant’s own argument, had the defamatory statements
                    in the present case referred to “members of the previous MC”
                    instead of just “the previous MC”, it would have been different
                    and damages could be assessed separately for each plaintiff. In our opinion, it
                    should not matter how the individuals comprising the group are referred
                    to— this is purely a matter of semantics. Reference to the previous MC
                    would naturally refer to the members of the previous MC. After all, the previous
                    MC was not a separate entity in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Further, we accept the Plaintiffs’
                    contention that the assessment of damages as a group might lead to difficulties
                    in quantification and absurd results. There is no law which compels all members
                    of a group who have been defamed to sue in the same action or at the same time.
                    In fact, another two members of the previous MC have since commenced a
                    defamation action based on the same defamatory statements following the delivery
                    of the Merits Judgment by this court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> If damages were to be collectively assessed
                    and a single award granted to the previous MC as a group, other members of the
                    previous MC could be precluded from commencing any future actions based on the
                    same statements given that the damages have already been assessed for the whole
                    of the previous MC and distributed to the existing Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Moreover, an award made based on a
                    group of eleven persons may lead to an unfair result of a windfall if
                    distributed only amongst the four Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the light of the authorities and for the
                    aforementioned reasons, we find that the harm caused to the previous MC should
                    not be collectively assessed as a group with the award being apportioned between
                    the Plaintiffs. The basic principle as elucidated in <em>Tang
                        Liang Hong</em> at [188] applies—
                    <em>each</em> claimant who has proven that he has been
                    defamed is entitled to a sum which would sufficiently compensate him for the
                    harm done to his reputation, as well as to console him for the distress he
                    suffered from the publication of the statements.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This court also held in <em>Peter Lim</em> at [8] (citing Lord Hoffman’s words in <em>The Gleaner Co Ltd v Abraham</em> [2004] 1 AC 628 at 646)
                    that another relevant consideration is the intended deterrent effect of the
                    award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[D]efamation cases have important features not shared by personal injury
                        claims. <em>The damages often serve not only as compensation
                            but also as an effective and necessary deterrent</em>. The
                        deterrent is effective because the damages are paid either by the defendant
                        himself or under a policy of insurance which is likely to be sensitive to
                        the incidence of such claims. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Nature and Gravity of the Defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Regarding the gravity of a defamatory
                    statement, it was held by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <em>John v MGN
                        Ltd</em> [1997] QB 586 (“<em>John v
                        MGN</em>”) at 607 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the more closely it touches the plaintiff’s personal
                        integrity, professional reputation, honour, courage, loyalty and the core
                        attributes of his personality, the more serious it is likely to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both the Plaintiffs and Defendant argued that the Judge erred in her
                    assessment of the nature and gravity of the defamatory statements. We will
                    consider the Plaintiffs’ arguments first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Plaintiffs submitted that the Judge erred
                    in finding that the dishonesty imputed by the sting of the libel was less
                    serious as it did not relate to the taking of funds for the Plaintiffs’
                    own direct financial benefit or the commission of a criminal offence. They
                    argued that the dishonesty imputed by the Statements did in fact allege the
                    commission of a criminal offence and implied that the Plaintiffs had practised
                    deception on the Club members in order to obtain the benefit of securing their
                    own re-election as office bearers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In this regard, it is pertinent to turn to our
                    Merits Judgment, where we found that the sting of the libel lay in the
                    imputation of <em>dishonesty and misconduct</em> on the
                    part of the Plaintiffs (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, the sting of the charge is essentially that the
                        Previous MC had <em>deliberately misrepresented</em>
                        the circumstances relating to the expenditure on the TWC Package <em>with the aim of deceiving the Club members into ratifying the
                            expenditure</em>. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And at [50]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...However, the sting which the defendant has to justify (see [45] above)
                        is not so much that there were errors in the Annual Report or its Appendix,
                        but that <em>the Plaintiffs had uttered the erroneous
                            statements deliberately, knowing that they were false and that by such
                            falsehood, the Plaintiffs had hoped to hoodwink the AGM into ratifying
                            the expenditure</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We were further cognizant of a paragraph in
                    the Minutes of the meeting of the current MC held on 26 November 2008 meeting
                    which stated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e) President suggested that the discrepancies discovered by the Treasurer
                        be documented in an addendum to the Special Audit Report to be released to
                        the general membership. <em>Should there be findings of any
                            irregularities in contract award and payment, the matter ought to be
                            reported to the authorities</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We thus held that a reasonably interested member would get the
                    impression that the previous MC was suspected of wrongdoing and that the
                    Defendant was prepared to “report them to the authorities if the relevant
                    evidence was found”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Indeed it transpired that a report
                    to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was filed against Michael
                        Ho.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is clear that the defamatory statements
                    struck at the Plaintiffs’ competence and integrity as leaders of the Club
                    and questioned their fitness for office by implying that the Plaintiffs had set
                    out to deliberately deceive Club members into ratifying an improper use of Club
                    funds. Further, we observe that the statements, when read holistically with the
                    aforementioned background facts, insinuate that the alleged dishonesty verges on
                    some criminal misconduct on the part of the Plaintiffs. Hence, the Judge was not
                    entirely correct in holding that the dishonesty imputed did not relate to
                    “criminal offence”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Nonetheless, we are of the view that the
                    allegation of dishonesty here does not rise to the level of “extremely
                    dangerous and vicious fraud” as in the case of <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em>, or “a conspiracy to misappropriate funds
                    amounting to fraud and gross misconduct” as in the case of <em>Ei-Nets Ltd v Yeo Nai Meng</em> [2004] 1 SLR 153
                        (“<em>Ei-Nets Ltd</em>”) (at [67]). Nor
                    was there an allegation of bribery as in the case of <em>Ng Koo
                        Kay Benedict &amp; anor v Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 860 (“<em>Ng Koo Kay</em>”) (at
                    [23]). Moreover, there was also no suggestion of any <em>financial</em> benefit to the Plaintiffs in this case unlike that in
                        <em>Peter Lim</em>. In <em>Peter
                        Lim</em> this Court held at [28] that although there was no allegation
                    of fraud, the statements nonetheless did suggest that the appellant there had
                    caused the company’s financial losses through mismanagement for his own
                    financial gain in the form of excessive dividends. Even if the Plaintiffs’
                    allegation that the defamatory statements imputed benefit to the Plaintiffs in
                    the form of securing their re-election as office bearers was
                        correct,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> we find that this still falls below the
                    level of seriousness of obtaining a direct <em>financial</em> benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Statements do not exist <em>in
                        vacuo</em>. The nature and gravity of the statements should also be
                    considered against the context in which they were made. In this regard, we agree
                    with the approach taken by Belinda Ang J in <em>Segar Ashok v Koh
                        Fon Lynn Veronica and another suit</em> [2010] SGHC 168
                        (“<em>Segar Ashok</em>”), at [100]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where there is common knowledge that the relationship between the

                        publication and to discount what is said disparagingly of the plaintiff when
                        he knows that the words were said by his enemy [see <em>Chiam

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Defendant contended that the nature and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The parties are on common ground that the TWC
                    expenditure was at the time of the 2008 AGM a highly contentious matter.
                    However, we think it significant that the Statements were made in MC meetings
                    held 5 to 6 months <em>after</em> the May 2008 Elections.
                    In particular, the Second Statement was made during a discussion about the
                    findings of the Special Ad-Hoc Audit Committee tasked with carrying out an
                    independent review of the TWC expenditure. Significantly, these statements were
                    not emotional, off-the-cuff statements made in the heat of battle. On the
                    contrary, it was likely that the Club members would in the circumstances have
                    accorded the Statements more weight, thus arguably <em>compounding</em> the gravity of the sting. Further, we find that
                    common knowledge is not made out here. Unlike in <em>Segar
                        Ashok</em> where the defamation was made to a small number of close
                    associates who were privy to the plaintiff’s and defendant’s
                    acrimonious relationship and their ongoing heated exchanges, dissemination here
                    was to a group of recipients to whom cannot be imputed an intimate knowledge of
                    the relationship between the Defendant and Plaintiffs. Thus, we find that there
                    is no basis for the Defendant’s contention that such an adverse statement
                    would be “taken with a pinch of salt”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> by the general
                    membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the reasons given above, we reject both
                    the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s submissions that the Judge erred in
                    assessing the nature and gravity of the defamatory statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Standing, Position and Conduct of the Plaintiffs and
                Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     A preliminary issue arose here as regards
                    whether this court should consider the Plaintiffs’ standing within their
                    individual professions in its assessment of damages. We note that in <em>Peter Lim</em> the plaintiff claimed that the libel attacked
                    his professional reputation as a prominent and reputable businessman. This court
                    agreed and found at [26] that the libel called into question his competence,
                    integrity and business acumen which damaged his reputation and standing in his
                    profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The present case, however, is distinguishable
                    from <em>Peter Lim</em>. First, as the learned Judge below
                    noted at [24] of her judgment, the Plaintiffs did not ask to be differentiated
                    on the basis of their individual professions. Indeed the Plaintiffs’ own
                    Statement of Claim appears to have limited their claims to damage to their
                    reputation and standing in the Club <em>as members of the
                        previous MC</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Second, we made no
                    finding in the Merits Judgment as regards the effect of the libel on the
                    reputation and standing of the Plaintiffs in their respective professions. On
                    the contrary, we appeared to limit the sting of the libel to the
                    Plaintiffs’ position as former office bearers in the Club.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Thus, we are of
                    the view that for the purposes of assessment of damages, we should only take
                    into account the Plaintiffs’ standing and reputation <em>in
                        the Club</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is well established that the higher the
                    standing and reputation of the plaintiff in the community prior to the libel,
                    the greater the measure of damages that should be awarded. Correspondingly, the
                    word of a defendant in a high position socially is likely to be accorded more
                    weight, and thus be more injurious to a plaintiff, than that of a person of
                    humbler status:see Harvey McGregor, <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2009,
                        18<sup>th</sup> Ed) at para 39-064 and <em>Peter Lim</em> at [11]. The courts have differentiated between
                    categories of plaintiffs for the purpose of determining the amount of damages to
                    be awarded for defamation. As observed by this court in <em>Peter
                        Lim</em> at [12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Singapore courts have consistently awarded higher damages to public
                        leaders than other personalities for similar types of defamation because of
                        the greater damage done not only to them personally, but also to the
                        reputation of the institution of which they are members. The expression
                        “public leaders” in this context would be a reference to
                        political and non-political leaders in the Government and public sector and
                        private sector leaders who devote their careers and lives to serving the
                        State and the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Evidently, and the Plaintiffs conceded this,
                    damages awards in cases involving public leaders such as politicians are
                    inapplicable here.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs argued that as
                    well-known personalities in the Club and former office bearers, they are
                    effectively “public figures” in the eyes of the Club
                        members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    Accordingly, it follows that the Defendant is also effectively a “public
                    figure” in the Club.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Defendant argues, however, that being an
                    office bearer in the Club was not indicative of status and standing in the Club.
                    Rather, status and standing in the Club was best measured by the daily
                    interaction between members of the Club and the conduct of the
                        individual.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> He further alleges that the fact that the
                    Plaintiffs were not re-elected at the 2008 AGM indicated that they did not have
                    a high standing in the Club at the material time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In our judgment, the contention of the
                    Plaintiffs is more in line with reason and logic. Given that office bearers,
                    both past and present, are persons elected by Club members to be leaders and
                    decision-makers of the Club, the logical conclusion to draw is that they are
                    persons of higher status and standing in the Club. We would reiterate that the
                    Plaintiffs’ competence and integrity as leaders in the Club were
                    essentially what the Statements struck at. Although the Plaintiffs were not
                    re-elected at the 2008 AGM, their status as former office bearers and
                    long-standing members of the Club remained unchanged. Needless to say, the Club
                    members would have accorded substantial weight to the statements of the
                    Defendant, who as President was the highest authority in the Club at the
                    material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We thus conclude that the Judge’s
                    finding on this issue should not be disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Mode and Extent of Publication</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is trite law that the wider the extent of
                    publication, the greater would be the harm caused to the plaintiff. The award of
                    damages for defamation should therefore reflect this. This court in <em>Peter Lim</em> at [33] endorsed the decision in <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur John and others</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R)
                    840 where the amount of damages awarded was increased as the defamatory
                    statements were published in a publication with wide circulation and of high
                    standing, which rendered the libellous allegations more likely to be
                    believed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Al Amoudi v Brisard and
                        another</em> [2007] 1 WLR 113 (“<em>Al
                        Amoudi</em>”) at [33] it was held that there is no presumption
                    in law that substantial publication has taken place even where the defamatory
                    statements were placed on a generally accessible Internet website. The extent of
                    publication is proved either by direct proof or by establishing a
                    “platform of facts” from which the court could properly infer that
                    substantial publication has taken place. This proposition was adopted in
                        <em>Ng Koo Kay</em> at [27]. Both the Plaintiffs and
                    Defendant agreed that the principles elucidated above apply to the present case
                    and that the burden of proving the extent of publication would fall on the
                    Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Plaintiffs rely on several factual
                    findings made in the Merits Judgment to establish a “platform of
                    facts”:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     The unbudgeted TWC expenditure and
                        its subsequent non-ratification was “widely publicised and hotly
                        debated within the Club”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that
                        over 2,000 members attended the 2008 AGM, although the Defendant claims that
                        by the time the vote was taken on the motion to appoint the Audit Committee
                        only 307 members remained.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     Following the 2008 AGM, members were kept updated of the
                        appointment and work of the Audit Committee investigating the TWC
                        expenditure as well as of the current MC’s further discussions on the
                        issue through the Minutes. Information about a dispute between the parties
                        concerning a water system, which the Merits Judgment referred to as
                        “the NWS Dispute”, was also available through the Splash
                        magazine distributed to all Club members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> In any event, it was
                        clear that the TWC expenditure remained a live issue up until the two MC
                        meetings where the Statements were made.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Minutes that contained the
                        defamatory statements were displayed on the Club’s notice board and
                        library, where Club members, staff and visitors, could access them.
                            <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The
                        Plaintiffs thus claimed that around 10,000 Club members could form the pool
                        of “general viewership”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     As acknowledged by the Defendant, the Club’s notice
                        board was meant to “inform members and staff of the Club on issues,
                        discussions and decisions of the MC affecting or relevant to the
                            Club”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> A “reasonably
                        interested member” would thus have been generally aware of
                        information disseminated on the Club’s notice boards, including
                        minutes of MC meetings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Although the Plaintiffs did not lead evidence
                    on the length of time the Minutes remained posted on the board, the learned
                    Trial Judge held in her Damages Judgment at [25] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…generally, minutes posted on the board would be removed when the
                        next set of minutes was ready. Since MC meetings took place once a month, it
                        is likely that the minutes did not remain on the board for more than a
                        month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">She further noted at [26], correctly in our view, that “some of
                    those persons [who had read the minutes] may have informed others of the
                    contents of the minutes.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     While the Plaintiffs assert that the
                    dissemination of the Statements was wide and that it was similar to what had
                    transpired in <em>Peter Lim</em>, we are not persuaded that
                    that was so in the present case. What is critically different is that the main
                    mode of publication in the present case was <em>via</em>
                    posting the Minutes on the Club’s notice board. The publication of the
                    Statements remained in a single, fixed location which has to be physically
                    accessed by the viewer. The same applies to the Minutes left in the Club’s
                    library. Therefore, this is a far more passive mode of dissemination as compared
                    to the sending of and/or circulation of defamatory statements directly to member
                    recipients. The present case is clearly distinguishable from that of <em>Peter Lim</em> where the defamatory statements were sent
                        <em>directly</em> to over 17,000 club
                members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, we must also stress that in order to
                    read the Statements which were contained in the Minutes, a Club member would
                    have to leaf through the document posted on the notice board. This, coupled with
                    the inconvenience of physically accessing the notice board, made it all the more
                    likely that most of the Club members would have obtained information about the
                    TWC dispute through other media like the Club’s website or the Splash
                    magazine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We thus find that it could not be properly
                    inferred that substantial publication had taken place and concur with the
                    Judge’s finding that whilst publication was wider in this case than in
                        <em>Arul Chandran</em> where it was limited to the
                    committee of the club concerned, it was definitely far below the 17,000 figure
                    in <em>Peter Lim</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> We would imagine that in
                    the nature of things it is likely that only a modest percentage of the members
                    would have taken the trouble to leaf through and peruse the Minutes which were
                    posted on the Club’s notice board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Vindication</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     A prior narrative judgment rejecting a defence
                    of justification and so holding the libel to be established is capable of
                    providing some vindication of a claimant’s reputation. This principle was
                    set out in <em>Purnell v BusinessF1 Magazine Ltd and
                        another</em> [2008] 1 WLR 1 where the Court held at [29]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The effect of such an earlier judgment no doubt depends on all the
                        circumstances and, generally speaking, the effect in relation to vindication
                        will I think most likely be marginal. Where there has been a fiercely
                        contested trial on the facts, perhaps attended with much publicity, and the
                        defendant’s witnesses have been roundly disbelieved and there is a
                        positive and unequivocal finding in the claimant’s favour on the
                        merits, those circumstances will be relevant as amounting to some
                        vindication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We agree with the Defendant that in the light
                    of the findings in our Merits Judgment there is some vindication for the
                    Plaintiffs. But it does not follow that just because the court has vindicated
                    the plaintiff in a defamatory action that therefore the damages should be
                    substantially reduced. Otherwise the law will unduly favour the defendant
                    – if the defendant wins he pays no damages and if he loses he need not
                    have to pay substantial damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aggravated Damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The factors to be taken into account for the
                    purposes of determining aggravated damages are well established. It suffices for
                    us to refer to <em>Arul Chandran</em> at [55] where this
                    court endorsed the following passage from <em>Gatley on Libel and
                        Slander</em> where some of the circumstances warranting the award of
                    aggravated damages are set out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The conduct of a defendant which may often be regarded as aggravating the
                        injury to the plaintiff’s feelings so as to support a claim for
                        ‘aggravated’ damages includes a failure to make any or any
                        sufficient apology and withdrawal, a repetition of the libel; conduct
                        calculated to deter the plaintiff from proceeding, persistence by way of a
                        prolonged or hostile cross-examination of the plaintiff... a plea of
                        justification which is bound to fail; the general conduct either of the
                        preliminaries or of the trial itself calculated to attract wide publicity;
                        and persecution of the plaintiff by other means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     We reject the Defendant’s contention
                    that an award of aggravated damages is not made out<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> as being
                    wholly without merit. Even if the NWS Dispute was not created by the Defendant,
                    it was nonetheless kept alive by his conducting of a “witch hunt”
                    for the purpose of injuring the Plaintiffs and “soiling their reputation
                    in the Club”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Following from that we cannot see
                    how it could be asserted that the Defendant had no quarrel with the Plaintiffs.
                    Everything shows that he had an agenda of sorts. Furthermore, it is also untrue
                    that at the trial on liability the Defendant did not accuse the Plaintiffs of
                    dishonesty. To substantiate this contention, the Defendant cited his own
                    evidence in cross-examination, where he stated that he had no reason to believe
                    at the material time that the Plaintiffs had made deliberate
                        misrepresentations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> We note, however, that his evidence
                    was given in response to queries about his genuine or honest belief in the truth
                    of the Statements. In this regard, we refer to our findings at [91] of our
                    Merits Judgment concerning the Defendant’s malice. Finally, the notes of
                    evidence of the trial show that the Plaintiffs were accused of being on a
                    “campaign of disinformation”, “massaging the facts”
                    and called “liars” by Defendant’s counsel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> It is thus disingenuous of the
                    Defendant to now seek to distance himself from the words of his counsel who took
                    instructions from him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Thus, we see no ground to disturb the Trial
                    Judge’s finding that a clear case for aggravated damages has been made out
                    for the reasons set out at [30] of the Damages Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We also reject the Defendant’s
                    contention that the Plaintiffs’ provocative conduct, in particular that of
                    Robin Tan, should mitigate the quantum of aggravated damages
                        awarded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Amongst several things, the Defendant
                    alleged that Robin Tan spearheaded a no-confidence motion against him whilst he
                    was still new in office. This motion was defeated. Undeterred, Robin Tan also
                    filed criminal defamation charges against the Defendant and some members of the
                    MC led by the Defendant. The Attorney General eventually had to intervene to
                    have the cases withdrawn. There was, as the Defendant describes, a constant
                    “nibbling at the heels”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Damages may be significantly reduced to take
                    into account the claimant’s conduct, see generally <em>Campbell v News Group Newspapers Ltd</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 1143.
                    However, we observe that neither this court nor the Judge on the merits had
                    found provocation on the part of the Plaintiffs. As for the other conduct raised
                    by the Defendant, namely the no confidence motion and criminal defamation
                    charges, they do not relate to the subject of the Statements and are therefore
                    not relevant to mitigation. In <em>Segar Ashok</em> it was
                    held at [101] that “the expressions relied on to show the provocation
                    must relate to the same subject as the words complained of”. We thus find
                    that the Defendant has failed to make out a case for reducing aggravated damages
                    on account of the Plaintiffs’ conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is appropriate at this juncture for us to
                    turn to the Plaintiff’s contention that the Judge had erred in finding
                    that the Defendant’s plea of justification was not bound to
                        fail<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>, and in failing to take into account the
                    republication of the First and Second Statements in February 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> In the
                    Plaintiffs’ submission these should also be regarded as aggravated
                    factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     A reckless plea of justification that is bound
                    to fail is a classic aggravating factor as held by this Court in <em>Peter Lim</em> at [38] and in <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em> at [56]. In fact this appeared to be the main reason for
                    an award of aggravated damages of $50,000 in <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em> (at [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Some guidance as to the circumstances where it
                    could reasonably be said that a justification plea is bound to fail can be
                    obtained from <em>Bonnard v Perryman</em> [1891] 2 Ch 269.
                    In that case, it was held at 284 that the defence of justification which is
                    bound to fail is one which, “on the facts which may be before them, the
                    jury may find to be wholly unfounded”. To put it another way (at 288),
                    “there must be strong <em>prima facie</em> evidence
                    that the statement is untrue”. These propositions have been applied by
                    our High Court in <em>Kwek Juan Bok Lawrence v Lim Han
                        Yong</em> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 675 at [4].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     We are conscious that in the Merits Judgment
                    this court had said that the Defendant had:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…effectively admitted that he <em>did not know of
                            any basis</em> to allege that the erroneous statements were
                        deliberately made with that aim in mind. In the circumstances, we could not
                        see how it can be said that the sting in the two defamatory statements has
                        been justified.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and further:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[t]his explains why the Defendant fought so hard to urge the Judge
                        to find that the two Statements did not bear the defamatory sense attributed
                        by the Judge to them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Nonetheless, we are of the view that this
                    finding must be balanced against the fact that there was a long trial on the
                    merits and the Defendant succeeded in making out the defence of justification at
                    the first instance. Subsequently, we also had to deal with the arguments
                    pertaining to the defence of justification at length in the Merits Judgment. We
                    therefore do not think it fair to say that the defence was one that is
                    “wholly unfounded” or to adopt the language of striking out
                    applications, “plainly and obviously legally and factually
                    unsustainable”: see <em>The “Bunga Melati
                        5”</em> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [42]. We thus do not find that the
                    Judge was wrong in refusing to regard the failed plea of justification as a
                    factor to be taken into account when assessing aggravated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We now move to consider the Plaintiffs’
                    contention in relation to the republication of the defamatory statements.
                    Evidence may be led of subsequent publications in respect of which no separate
                    action has been brought where they substantially repeat the same imputation and
                    help to prove the existence of a malicious motive or establish the existence of
                    malice: see <em>Collins Stewart Ltd v The Financial Times (No
                        2)</em> [2005] EWHC 262 (QB) (“<em>Collins
                        Stewart Ltd</em>”) and <em>Clarke (t/a Elumina
                        Iberica UK) v Bain</em> [2008] EWHC 2636 (QB).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     However, we are not persuaded that this
                    particular republication is evidence of the Defendant’s
                    “unrepentant persecution”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> of the Plaintiffs in light of
                    the <em>context</em> in which republication was made. As
                    observed earlier at [7] above, the defamatory statements were republished in a
                    Facts Sheet as part of a narration of events surrounding the unbudgeted
                    expenditure starting from 2007 up to this court’s decision on the merits
                    of the suit. It was essentially a historical account of events. At most, the
                    lack of apology included in the publication shows a lack of remorse which the
                    Judge had already taken into account. We are thus of the view that the
                    Judge’s findings on this issue cannot be faulted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proportionality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The English Court of Appeal recently
                    reiterated in <em>Cairns v Modi</em> [2013] 1 WLR 1015 at
                    [24], that “[t]he process of assessing damages [for defamation] is not
                    quasi-scientific and there is rarely a single “right”
                    answer.” Be that as it may, we think it is worth repeating the dictum of
                    this court in <em>Tang Liang Hong</em> at [158]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, we wish to stress that damages, even for defamation, should fall
                        within a reasonable bracket so that what is awarded represents <em>a fair and reasonable sum which is proportionate to the harm
                            and injury occasioned to the victim who has been unjustly
                            defamed</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This court further expressed the need to guard against the trend of
                    allowing defamation damages to rise with each successive case and stressed that
                    damages awarded should fall within a reasonable bracket.With this in mind, we
                    turn now to consider the question of proportionality in the context where a
                    group is being defamed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Where the plaintiffs are part of a collective group</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We have previously held at [15]-[22] above
                    that damages should be severally assessed even where the plaintiff is part of a
                    collective group defamed. A further question which arises in this group context
                    is <em>whether the harm and injury occasioned to each claimant
                        should be moderated by virtue of the fact that the sting of the libel had
                        affected them as a group</em>. The Defendant submits that that should
                    be the case, as a multiplicity of individual actions for group defamation could
                    potentially expose a defendant to liability severely out of proportion to the
                    harm that has actually been inflicted on each claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The above question has not been expressly
                    addressed by our courts. In <em>Tang Liang Hong</em>, this
                    court noted at [188] that the multiplicity of victims defamed by a single
                    defamatory statement <em>would not in itself</em> justify
                    the moderation or lowering of damages. The question was also not considered in
                        <em>Balakrishnan</em>. Jurisprudence on the point from
                    other jurisdictions is also lacking; no explicit consideration was given to the
                    size of the group in the award of damages in the abovementioned group defamation
                    cases cited at [18].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Gary Chan in “A Tort Analysis of Group
                    Defamation: Defining and Refining <em>Knuppfer</em>
                        [<em>sic</em>]” (2006) 14(2) TLJ 176 observed at
                    para 3 that “the adverse impact on the reputation of the individual
                    member may be ‘diluted’ or ‘submerged’ where a large
                    group is targeted by the defamatory publication”. In this regard, it is
                    settled law that the size of the group is a relevant consideration in
                    determining whether the threshold requirement that the defamatory words against
                    a group complained of can reasonably be understood as being published “of
                    and concerning the plaintiff” has been met in order to be actionable at
                    the instance of the individual: see <em>Knupffer v London Express
                        Newspaper Ltd</em> [1944] AC 116 (“<em>Knupffer</em>”) at 124 <em>per</em> Lord
                    Porter. <em>Knupffer</em> has been endorsed locally in the
                    case of <em>DHKW Marketing and another v Nature’s Farm Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 774 at [18].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Several American cases like <em>Brady v Ottoway Newspapers</em> 445 NYS (2d) 786 have held that a
                    determination of the threshold question would require an assessment of the
                    “intensity of suspicion” that the defamatory statements could
                    reasonably be thought to create in the mind of a person that the words refer to
                    the plaintiff. In <em>Butler v Southam Inc</em> [2001] NSCA
                    121 (<em>“Butler</em>”), a Canadian case, the
                    Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia considered the “intensity of
                    suspicion” approach. Pertinently, it observed at [68] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Assessing the intensity of this suspicion is helpful because it
                        tends to focus the analysis on <em>the strength of the link
                            between the allegedly defamatory words and the individual
                            plaintiff’s reputation</em>. This, in turn, helps ensure
                        that as the judge rules on the outer limits of permissible recovery in
                        defamation, the analysis is rooted firmly in the law’s fundamental
                        purpose, the protection of the plaintiff’s personal reputation.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As the court in <em>Butler</em> pointed out, this inquiry is consistent with the decision
                    in <em>Knupffer</em>. There, Lord Porter provided a list of
                    relevant considerations to guide the determination of whether a statement about
                    a group libels an individual member of it (<em>Knupffer</em> at 124). The considerations, which include the size of
                    the group and the generality and extravagance of the allegations, relate to the
                    strength of the link between the allegedly defamatory words and the individual
                    plaintiff’s reputation. Contrary to the Plaintiffs’
                        assertion,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> such an inquiry
                    would not contradict the principle that the law of defamation focuses on the
                    individual’s hurt and damaged reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The pertinent issue in <em>Butler</em> and <em>Knupffer</em> was whether
                    the strength of the link between the defamatory statement and the
                    plaintiffs’ reputation was so weak that any adverse impact on the
                    individual’s reputation was so diluted as to fall below the threshold of
                    legal recognition. We see no reason why, even where legal recognition has been
                    established, those same factors should not be taken into account at the
                    assessment of damages stage. On the contrary, it seems to us that a court can
                    only properly assess the harm and injury occasioned to the individual plaintiff
                    (and by extension the appropriate quantum of damages to award) when it takes
                    those factors into account. In this regard, we are not persuaded by the
                    Plaintiffs’ contention that the reduced effect of a group defamation, if
                    any, would be achieved in their words “by limiting the number of
                    claimants for a single libel, [and that] this would have adequately addressed
                    the issue of proportionality of damages to the harm done by the
                        libel.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> We see two real
                    problems with this contention or approach. First, it seems to completely
                    disregard the fact that where a group is defamed, each plaintiff must still
                    fulfil the legal recognition requirement and only when he has done so will the
                    court turn to the question of assessment of damages. Second, we do not see how a
                    court can deprive an individual, who is not a party before the court, from later
                    suing for defamation arising from the same statement, so long as he can satisfy
                    the threshold legal recognition requirement. This will run counter to all
                    principles of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We think it pertinent to emphasise Lord
                    Porter’s observation in <em>Knupffer</em> at 124
                    that, “[e]ach case must be considered according to its own
                    circumstances”. The size of the group is just one of several
                    considerations or factors and is hardly conclusive. For example, the sting and
                    damage to the reputation of persons from a defamatory statement that a committee
                    were all child-sex offenders would not be diluted in any way by reason of the
                    allegation being made against a group. Conversely, the sting of a defamatory
                    statement that a committee was slipshod in reviewing a tender because they were
                    pre-occupied with getting re-elected might well be diluted because the
                    reasonable reader knows that a statement was made about the quality of the
                    claimants’ work as a group, and that there are likely to be different
                    degrees to which the statement applies to each member. It is the nature of the
                    sting which will be critical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Applying the abovementioned principle to the
                    facts of the present case, we concur with the Judge’s decision that given
                    that the size of the group cannot be said to be small, and the fact that no
                    member of the previous MC was singled out for attack by the statements, it
                    should follow that the harm occasioned to each plaintiff would have been less
                    than if the statements had only defamed one specific plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">In the assessment of aggravated damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     We next consider whether the principle of
                    proportionality should apply to the assessment of aggravated
                damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In their further submissions, the Plaintiffs
                    cited damages awards from various common law jurisdictions in support of the
                    proposition that there is no requirement that aggravated damages should be a
                    fixed proportion of general damages:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     Singapore: In <em>Arul Chandran</em> and <em>Peter Lim</em>,
                        aggravated damages constituted 50% of the general damages. However, in
                            <em>Ng Koo Kay</em>, aggravated damages were fixed
                        at 40% of the general damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     Canada: In <em>Myers v Canadian
                            Broadcasting Corp</em> 2001 CarswellOnt 2037, the amount of
                        aggravated damages awarded amounted to 75% of the general damages awarded.
                        In <em>Leenen v Canadian Broadcasting Corp</em> 2001
                        CarswellOnt 2011, the amount of aggravated damages awarded was 87.5% of
                        general damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_c"></a>(c)     Hong Kong: It was expressly stated in <em>Sin Cho Chiu
                            v Tin Tin Publication Development Ltd &amp; Another</em> [2002]
                        HKEC 50 (at [11]) that there is no fixed proportion between general and
                        aggravated damages. Other cases demonstrate a varying proportion. In
                            <em>Au Yee Ming Ivan v Ng Fei Tip</em> [2010] HKEC
                        1319, the aggravated damages awarded were 67% that of general damages. In
                            <em>Lee Ching v Lau May Ming</em> [2007] HKCU 714,
                        the amount of aggravated and general damages awarded were
                    similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is clear from the above authorities that
                    courts in Singapore and various other common law jurisdictions do not subscribe
                    to any rule that aggravated damages must be a fixed proportion of general
                    damages. Be that as it may, we are nonetheless of the view that there should be
                    some semblance of <em>proportionality</em> between the
                    quantum of general damages and aggravated damages awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Aggravated damages, like general damages, are
                    also compensatory in nature. In the Australian case of <em>Buckley v Herald &amp; Weekly Times Pty Ltd</em> [2009] VSCA 118, the
                    court stated at [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…any amount of aggravated damages awarded would to some extent be
                        informed by the base level of any compensatory damages awarded; for, in
                        principle, <em>aggravated damages are damages to compensate
                            for the aggravation of loss to the plaintiff</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This appears to suggest that aggravated damages are awarded in order
                    to compensate the enhanced hurt suffered by the plaintiff: see also <em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> at para 9.15. Caution,
                    therefore, has to be exercised against double counting or otherwise
                    over-compensating the plaintiff because the distress, humiliation and injury to
                    feelings for which aggravated damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff,
                    are matters that may also properly be taken into account in awarding basic
                    compensatory damages: see <em>Carter-Ruck on Libel and
                        Privacy</em> (Alastair Mullis gen ed) (Butterworths,
                        6<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2010) at para 15.36.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Courts in both the United Kingdom and in
                    Australia appear to have taken this to heart. See for example <em>Collins Stewart Ltd</em>, per Gray J at [24] and <em>Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pte Ltd (No 4)</em> [2012] NSWDC 12
                        (“<em>Habib</em>”). In <em>Habib</em>, the court observed at [430]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In assessing this amount for aggravated damages I am mindful of the need
                        to take care to avoid overlap of general compensatory damages and aggravated
                        damages, both being forms of compensatory damages, as that could lead to
                        over-compensation. Were it not for that factor, my assessments of the
                        separate amounts for aggravated damages would have been significantly
                        increased in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     We endorse the view articulated in <em>Habib</em> that our courts should tread cautiously when
                    determining the appropriate amount of aggravated damages to award. Ultimately,
                    even where aggravated damages are appropriate, the total figure for both general
                    and aggravated damages should not exceed fair compensation for the injury
                    suffered by the claimant, see <em>Thompson v Metropolitan Police
                        Commissioner</em> [1998] QB 498. Aggravated damages are meant to
                    compensate for the aggravation of the injury; they are not an arbitrary top-up
                    unrelated to the desire of the court to compensate the plaintiff for the
                    aggravation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Different Awards to Multiple Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     We now consider the contention raised by the
                    Defendant that the Plaintiffs should not each be awarded the same amount of
                    damages since the evidence showed that Bernard Chan, the first Plaintiff and the
                    President of the previous MC, had borne the brunt of the remarks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant relies on <em>Tang Liang Hong</em> where this
                    court held at [171]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As found by the learned judge (at [112] of his judgment), and we agree,
                        all the utterances made by Mr Tang were mainly directed at Mr Goh and Mr
                        Lee. Thus, in so far as these plaintiffs are concerned, we do not think that
                        there was very much aggravation of the defamations in question, and the
                        element of aggravated damages would not be considerable. For this reason and
                        on the basis of what we have held in [132]–[143], we are of the
                        opinion that the awards to them should in each case be moderated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As has been reiterated throughout this
                    judgment, damages awarded to each of the Plaintiffs would have to be
                    proportionate to the harm and injury actually occasioned to him. It logically
                    follows from this that different awards of damages may be made to multiple
                    plaintiffs. However, we find that the Defendant has not proven his contention
                    that Bernard Chan bore the brunt of the defamatory statements. On the contrary,
                    the Defendant admitted that the defamatory remarks did not single out any member
                    of the previous MC since the defamatory statements targeted the MC as a whole.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> It is irrelevant that Bernard Chan was the
                    most active in defending the libellous allegations since the issue is really
                    whether the sting of the libel could be equally imputed to all of them, which is
                    the case here. Thus we find that no case has been made out for different awards
                    for the different claimants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on assessment of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The general principle guiding an appellate
                    court in varying the damages awarded by the judge below was set out in <em>Arul Chandran</em> at [51], citing <em>Associated Newspapers Ltd v Dingle</em> [1964] AC 371 at 393:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An appeal court rejects his figure only in “very special” or
                        “very exceptional” cases. Such cases are embraced by the
                        formula that the judge must be shown to have arrived at his figure either by
                        applying a wrong principle of law or through a misapprehension of the facts
                        or for some other reason to have made a wholly erroneous estimate of the
                        damage suffered…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The question, therefore, is whether this was a very special or
                    exceptional case or the Judge had arrived at a wholly erroneous estimate of the
                    damages suffered by the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It is further trite law that when assessing
                    damages, the court should have sufficient regard to precedents as they provide a
                    broad guideline for the exercise: see <em>Goh Chok Tong v
                        Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and another action</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 971
                    at [57] (“<em>Goh Chok Tong</em>”). As was
                    observed by Belinda Ang J in <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore
                        Democratic Party and others and another suit</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 642
                    at [73]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Broadly appropriate comparable cases can, if used with discretion, provide
                        some guidance on the appropriate amount of damages to award in a particular
                        case. This approach is especially useful in promoting a rationally
                        sustainable and coherent regime for damages for libel, and, as a corollary,
                        in avoiding “the grossly exorbitant awards so often made by juries in
                        other jurisdictions” (<em>per</em> Thean JA
                            in [<em>Tang Liang Hong</em>]... at
                        [158]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Judge found that the precedents of
                        <em>Peter Lim</em> and <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em> were the “most relevant” in her assessment
                    of the appropriate amount of damages for the present case. While we note that it
                    is true that there is a common factor between <em>Peter
                        Lim</em> and <em>Arul Chandran</em> on the one
                    hand and the present case on the other in the sense that they all concerned
                    squabbles that occurred in clubs, it seems to us that she did not give
                    sufficient weight to the differentiating factors which she herself recognised,
                    namely, the limited extent of publication, the fact that no attack was made on
                    the plaintiffs’ professional reputations, and the fact that the Statements
                    referred to the MC as a whole and did not ascribe specific blame to the
                    individual Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In <em>Peter Lim</em>,
                    this court awarded damages totalling $210,000 to the plaintiff, comprising
                    $140,000 as general damages and $70,000 as aggravated damages. Emphasis was
                    placed on the extensive publication of the defamatory statements and the fact
                    that the statements attacked his professional reputation as a prominent and
                    reputable businessman. These were factors that were clearly absent in our
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In <em>Arul
                    Chandran</em>, the plaintiff was awarded $100,000 as general damages and
                    $50,000 as aggravated damages. Here, although the publication of the defamatory
                    statements was extremely limited, the statements were extremely grave and had
                    attacked the claimant’s professional reputation as a lawyer and imputed
                    criminal conduct on his part. Moreover, the attacks in both <em>Peter Lim</em> and <em>Arul Chandran</em> were
                    not in relation to a group in general but in relation to the specific plaintiff.
                    Furthermore, the defendant in each of those cases had recklessly raised a plea
                    of justification. These circumstances explain why relatively large general and
                    aggravated damages were awarded in each case although the extent of
                    dissemination was very limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Instead, we are of the view that the awards in
                        <em>Ng Koo Kay</em> and <em>Goh Chok
                        Tong</em> are more appropriate precedents for this court to consider.
                    As in the present case, the gravity of the defamation in <em>Ng
                        Koo Kay</em> whilst fairly serious had not been extensively
                    disseminated. The court awarded the plaintiff $25,000 in general damages and
                    $10,000 in aggravated damages. In <em>Goh Chok Tong</em>,
                    we observe that the plaintiffwas a political figure of far higher standing than
                    the Plaintiffs in the present case and yet the court only awarded a sum of
                    $100,000 by way of general damages and another $10,000 in aggravated damages.
                    Nonetheless we do think that a larger quantum of aggravated damages than those
                    awarded in these two cases would be justified in the present case on account of
                    the Defendant’s clear malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In our judgment, the Judge has come to a
                    “wholly erroneous” estimate of the damages to be awarded. For the
                    reasons given above and bearing in mind the need to guard against
                    over-compensation, we find that an award of $50,000 to each Plaintiff,
                    comprising $35,000 as general damages and $15,000 as aggravated damages would be
                    fair and adequate. To this extent, the Defendant’s appeal is allowed.
                    Accordingly the Plaintiffs’ appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The final award of damages in this judgment in
                    favour of the Plaintiffs, was $50,000 each, well within the jurisdiction of the
                    Subordinate Courts. The question that follows is whether the individual amounts
                    recovered by joint plaintiffs should be aggregated to determine the scale of
                    costs applicable in the present case. Several authorities suggest that that
                    should not be done. In <em>Gallivan v Warman</em> [1930] WN
                    96 (“<em>Gallivan</em>”), the plaintiffs, who
                    were husband and wife, sued the defendant in the High Court for damages for
                    negligence following a motor accident where the wife was injured. The action was
                    transferred to the county court and the defendant paid into court 45 pounds to
                    meet the claim of the wife and 5 pounds for the husband. The plaintiffs accepted
                    the payments. The county court judge refused to grant High Court costs because
                    the plaintiffs each recovered less than 50 pounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     
          <em>Gallivan</em> was
                    followed in <em>Haile &amp; Others v West</em> [1940] 1 KB
                    250, where the English Court of Appeal held that in respect of the claims of co-
                    plaintiffs, even though they arose from the same transaction, the amount
                    recovered by each should not be aggregated to determine the appropriate costs
                    order to be made because each of the plaintiffs had a separate cause of action.
                    In the circumstances, the appropriate scale of costs was to be, in the words of
                    Scrutton LJ, “upon the footing that each individual ha[d] brought a
                    separate action” (at 256). The court did not accept the
                    co-plaintiffs’ contention that an action by the co-plaintiffs was a single
                    action resulting in one judgment, and there should therefore be one order as to
                    costs. <em>Gallivan</em> was also followed by the Supreme
                    Court of Victoria, Australia in the case of <em>Brien v
                        Watts</em> [1964] VR 673.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In the light of these authorities, and in
                    accordance with the spirit that a party should not have to incur costs other
                    than what is warranted by the substance or magnitude of the claim, we hold that
                    each of the Plaintiffs would, in principle, only be entitled to costs on the
                    Subordinate Courts scale appropriate to the quantum of damages awarded to him in
                    the present judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">At the liability stage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It will be recalled that in the Merits
                    Judgment this court granted costs to the Plaintiffs as regards the appeal and
                    the trial on liability. Following that judgment, the Plaintiffs proceeded to
                    raise their bills of costs and have them taxed without waiting for the
                    assessment of damages. In <em>Lin Jian Wei v Lim Eng Hock
                        Peter</em> [2011] 3 SLR 1052 (“<em>Lin Jian
                        Wei</em>”) this court clearly expressed the view that trial
                    costs in claims for unliquidated damages should ordinarily not be assessed
                    before damages have been agreed or determined. The rationale for this practice
                    is apparent from Appendix 1 to O 59 of the Rules of Court (R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Rules of Court”) which provides that the taxing registrar in
                    determining the proper amount to be allowed as costs “shall have regard
                    to the principle of proportionality” as well as, inter alia,
                    “where money or property is involved, its amount or value”. This
                    provision clearly suggests that there is an incontrovertible link between the
                    costs to be awarded and the judgment amount. This point was also underscored in
                        <em>Lin Jian Wei</em> at [76]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, though this is not an absolute rule, the concept of
                        proportionality requires that there ordinarily be some correlation between
                        the quantum of damages awarded and the costs taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Here, before the assessment of damages was
                    heard, the Plaintiffs drew up their bills of costs in respect of the trial and
                    appeal relating to liability (“liability stage”) and had them
                    taxed. Before the Assistant Registrar, the plaintiffs were awarded $802,500 for
                    the trial and $102,500 for the appeal. On review, the Judge reduced the costs
                    for trial to $602,500 and left undisturbed the amount awarded for the appeal.
                    Thus the taxed costs came up to a total of $705,000. The Defendant has paid up
                    the total amount of the taxed costs to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The question which we now need to address is
                    whether we should allow the taxed costs for the liability stage (already paid)
                    to remain in the light of the quantum of damages which we have awarded to each
                    of the Plaintiffs and the views which we have expressed above at [89] that each
                    of the Plaintiffs should only be entitled to costs according to the Subordinate
                    Courts scale appropriate to damages awarded to each. We note that sometime in
                    January 2012 when the Plaintiffs raised their bills of costs in respect of the
                    liability stage and sought to have the bills taxed, the solicitors for the
                    Defendant requested that the taxing of the bills be deferred until damages had
                    been assessed, stating that it would be “premature” and also drew
                    the Plaintiffs’ attention to what was said in <em>Lin Jian
                        Wei</em>. Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs insisted on proceeding with the
                    taxation. In the circumstances, we had some concerns and requested the parties
                    to make further submissions on the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     While recognising that he had already paid the
                    taxed costs for the liability stage, the Defendant submitted that the question
                    of costs was still open for review by this court in the light of its decision in
                    the present appeal as to the appropriate quantum of damages which each of the
                    Plaintiffs was entitled to. He advanced two bases for making this submission.
                    The first was pursuant to s 37(5) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap
                    322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) and the second was the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Section 37(5) of the SCJA provides that at the
                    hearing of an appeal, this court may “give any judgment, and make any
                    order which ought to have been given or made, and make such further or other
                    orders as the case requires”. Reading this provision in the context of s
                    37 as a whole it is clear that the powers enumerated in s 37(5) should generally
                    be confined to the issues raised in the appeal. The Defendant argues that the
                    phrase “make such further or other orders as the case requires” in
                    the provision gives this court the power to set aside the two taxed bills of
                    costs if the circumstances so warrant in the light of the damages awarded by
                    this court to each of the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Section 37(5) of the SCJA is identical to s
                    69(4) of the Court of Judicature Act 1964 (Act 91) (Malaysia) (“CJA
                    1964”). This is because the origin of our SCJA was the CJA 1964. When
                    Singapore was a part of Malaysia, the CJA 1964 also became part of the law of
                    Singapore. In <em>Tsoi Ping Kwan v Medan Juta Sdn Bhd &amp;
                        Anor</em> [1996] 3 MLJ 367, the Malaysian Court of Appeal opined that
                    “the power conferred by s 69(4) [of the CJA 1964]is confined to making
                    ancillary orders that would have the effect of completely giving the remedy
                    which this court intends to give when either allowing or dismissing an
                    appeal”. In expressing this view, the court relied on the earlier case of
                        <em>Rama Chandran v The Industrial Court of Malaysia and
                        Anor</em> [1997] 1 MLJ 145 (“<em>Rama
                        Chandran</em>”), where the Malaysian Federal Court, in holding
                    that the dismissal of a workman was wrongful, went on (pursuant to r 51(4) of
                    the Rules of the Supreme Court 1980 (Malaysia), a rule <em>in
                        pari materia</em> with s 69(4) of the CJA 1964) to award compensation
                    instead of remitting the case back to the Industrial Court for follow-up action.
                    The court held that “justice demands that to avoid further delay and
                    expense, [it] determine[s] the consequential relief rather than remitting the
                    case to the Industrial Court for that purpose”. <em>Rama
                        Chandran</em> was also followed in <em>Harris Solid
                        State (M) Sdn Bhd v Bruno Gentil s/o Pereira &amp; Ors</em> [1996] 3
                    MLJ 489, another case involving industrial dispute where the Malaysian Court of
                    Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court which held that the award of the
                    Industrial Court was wrong in ruling that the dismissal of the workmen by the
                    employers was justified. In dismissing the appeal of the employers, the
                    Malaysian Court of Appeal, unlike the High Court, ordered the workmen’s
                    reinstatement instead of remitting the case to the Industrial Court for
                    re-adjudication. In varying the High Court order, the Malaysian Court of Appeal
                    relied on the powers conferred under s 69(4) of the CJA 1964.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In the Indian case of <em>Ganesh Ram v Baikunthesh Prasad Singh And Ors</em> AIR 1951 Pat 291
                        (“<em>Ganesh Ram</em>”) which concerned
                    the then O 41 r 33 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code 1908 (which rule was
                    worded similarly to s 69(4) of the CJA 1964 and our own s 37(5) of the SCJA),
                    the court said (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rule has been newly introduced in the Code of 1908. Its object is
                        clearly to enable the court to do complete justice between the parties. Its
                        terms are very wide and in a proper case it gives the appellate court ample
                        discretion to pass any decree or make any order to prevent the ends of
                        justice from being defeated. Having regard to the wide language of the rule,
                        it is not expedient to lay down any hard and fast rule regarding its true
                        scope. Involving as it does an exercise of judicial discretion, the question
                        whether the court should exercise the powers in a particular case would no
                        doubt depend upon the special facts and circumstances of the case. It may be
                        conceded that the discretion is not to be exercised in an arbitrary manner
                        nor in such a way as to abrogate the other provisions of the Code with
                        respect to the institution of appeals and cross-objections and the like. But
                        there is ample authority for the view that the power contained in r 33
                        extends to those cases where as a result of the appellate court`s
                        interference with the decree in favour of the appellant, <em>further interference is required in order to adjust the rights of the
                            parties in accordance with justice, equity and good
                            conscience</em> (see, for instance, Jawahar Banu v. Shujaat
                        Hussain Beg, 43 ALL 85 : (A. I. R. (8) 1921 ALL 367) and Gangadhar v.
                        Banabashi, 22 C. L. J. 390: (A. I. R. (1) 1914 cal. 722). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     A similarly worded provision to s 37(5) may be
                    found in O 59 r 10(3) of the then English Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1776 of
                    1965) (“ERSC”) (also similar to O 57 rr 13(3) and (4) of our Rules
                    of Court), which related to the powers of the Court of Appeal when hearing an
                    appeal. It read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal shall have power to draw inferences of fact and to
                        give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been given or made
                        and to make such further or other order as the case may require.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In <em>Nicholls v
                        Nicholls</em> [1997] 1 WLR 314 (“<em>Nicholls</em>”), the English Court of Appeal examined a line
                    of cases concerning defects in the application for a committal order. The Court
                    of Appeal held (at 326) as regards O 59 r 10(3) ERSC, read together with s 13(3)
                    of the Administration of Justice Act 1960, that it:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…give[s] a court the power to rectify procedural defects both in
                        the procedure leading up to the making of the committal order and after a
                        committal order has been made. Like any other discretion, the discretion
                        provided by the statutory provisions, must be exercised in a way which in
                        all the circumstances best reflects the requirements of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While this statement referred to “procedural defects”,
                    it should in no way be taken to mean that O 59 r 10(3) of the ERSC only
                    empowered the rectification of procedural defects. That reference must be read
                    in the context of that case which concerned procedural defects. The important
                    thing to note in that statement is that the discretion conferred by O 59 r 10(3)
                    of the ERSC “must be exercised in a way … best reflects the
                    requirement of justice”. This principle uttered in <em>Nicholls</em> is very similar to what was expressed in <em>Ganesh Ram</em> that “further interference is required
                    in order to adjust the rights of the parties in accordance with justice, equity
                    and good conscience” (see [96] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As far as our own authorities are concerned,
                    there is the case of <em>Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v
                        Scanlon Graeme John &amp; others</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 770 which the
                    Defendant also relies on. That was an oppression action under the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) where the court made what was essentially a consent order
                    to enable one party to buy out the shares of the other party (“buy-out
                    order”). The buy-out was not effected due to a dispute as to valuation.
                    When the matter eventually came before this court, it held that the buy-out
                    order could not be implemented and was inoperative and, pursuant to the powers
                    conferred under ss 37(5) and (6) of the SCJA, made the consequential order that
                    the parties were to be “restored to the <em>status quo
                        ante</em>” as if the buy-out order “had never been
                    made” (at [46]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The powers conferred on this court under s
                    37(5) of the SCJA are broad and those powers may be exercised when the justice
                    of the case calls for it. It is a facilitative provision to enable the Court of
                    Appeal to make such consequential orders as the justice of the case requires. We
                    should not seek to circumscribe what those circumstances may be before this
                    court would invoke s 37(5) of the SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Reverting to the present case, we have, at
                    [89] above, ruled that in view of the reduced damages which we have granted to
                    each of the plaintiffs, costs should be awarded to them according to the
                    Subordinate Courts’ scale. As we have mentioned before, the two bills,
                    notwithstanding the objection of the Defendant, were proceeded to be taxed at
                    the insistence of the Plaintiffs. In the light of our decision in this judgment,
                    it is clear that the bills were taxed on a wholly erroneous footing. Justice
                    cries for intervention on the part of this court. While setting aside the two
                    taxed bills was not a specific point raised in the appeal, it is clearly a
                    consequential matter on which this court is entitled to make the necessary
                    adjustment following our decision on the appeal on damages. Pursuant to the
                    powers conferred under s 37(5) of the SCJA, we would accordingly set aside the
                    two taxed bills. In view of this decision, we do not think there is any need for
                    us to proceed to examine the second basis advanced by the Defendant to interfere
                    in the two taxed bills <em>ie</em>, the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In the result, the Defendant’s appeal
                    in CA 63 of 2012 is allowed to the extent that the quantum of damages awarded to
                    each Plaintiff is reduced to $50,000; $35,000 being general damages and $15,000,
                    aggravated damages. The Plaintiffs’ appeal in CA 68 of 2012 is dismissed.
                    As regards the question of costs of the assessment and this appeal, we note that
                    the Defendant has, to some extent, succeeded in the appeal; on the other hand,
                    the Defendant raised a number of points which were not successful and in any
                    case, he would ordinarily have been liable for some part of the costs of the
                    assessment. In all the circumstances, we think the fairest order would be for
                    each party to bear its own costs for both the present appeals as well as for the
                    assessment of damages before the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    As for the two taxed bills which we at [101]
                    have set aside, instead of directing that the bills be re-taxed, we think it
                    more expedient for this court to fix the quantum after hearing the parties. For
                    this purpose, a date will be set for the parties to appear before us. The
                    payment already made by the Defendant pursuant to the two taxed bills shall be
                    regarded as payment towards account. The appropriate refund should be made by
                    the Plaintiffs to the Defendant after this court has fixed the amount of
                    reasonable costs for the liability stage.</p>
