<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The matter before me concerned an issue of law
                    not hitherto considered by any court in Singapore. It was raised as a
                    preliminary issue on the first day of trial by counsel for the first and second
                    defendants (“the Defendants), Mr Harry Elias SC. In a nutshell, it
                    pertained to whether a document disclosed during discovery in a prior suit
                    – and that is thus subject to an implied undertaking not to be used for
                    any collateral or ulterior purpose (the “<em>Riddick</em> principle”) – ceased to be subject to that
                    undertaking once it had been used in open court in the prior suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The relationship of the parties was not relevant
                    to the specific question of law that was before the court. However, for
                    completeness, I would briefly describe the history of their relationship. The
                    plaintiff and the Defendants were shareholders of Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd
                    (“RTC”), ABR Holdings Limited (“ABR”) and Europa
                    Holdings Pte Ltd (“EH”). Their holdings in ABR were through two
                    companies which were incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, namely,
                    Goldhurst Properties Limited and Sullivan Developments Limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff and the first defendant were
                    directors of RTC, ABR and EH. The second defendant was also a director of RTC,
                    ABR and EH, although he ceased to be a director before the plaintiff and
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In 2000, the following suits involving the
                    parties were instituted (collectively referred to as “the Year 2000
                    Suits”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Suit No 742 of 2000 involved a third
                        party, Peter Lim Eng Hock (“Peter Lim”), suing the plaintiff
                        and the Defendants in this case for the specific performance of an oral
                        agreement involving the shares of RTC. According to Peter Lim, the oral
                        agreement involved a promise to him of 40% of the shareholding of
                        RTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Suit No 782
                        of 2000 involved a claim by RTC against the first defendant and Peter Lim
                        for a sum in excess of $51 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Suit No 905 of 2000 involved a claim by RTC against the
                        second defendant for a sum of almost $6 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     Suit No 1000 of 2000 involved a suit in
                        which the Defendants sued the plaintiff and Peter Lim, alleging them of the
                        wrongful conversion of certain bearer share
                certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The trial for the Year 2000 Suits commenced in
                    2001. The trial had been partially heard when the matters were referred to
                    mediation. The mediation sessions at the Singapore Mediation Centre were
                    attended by the plaintiff, the Defendants and Peter Lim, all of whom were
                    involved in the Year 2000 Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       An agreement was finally reached and a Deed of
                    Settlement was eventually executed by the plaintiff, the Defendants, Peter Lim
                    and one Ricky Goh Hoon Kan on 19 April 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The matter did not end there. In 2006, RTC
                    instituted Suit No 46 of 2006 (“the Year 2006 Suit”) against Peter
                    Lim, the plaintiff and the Defendants for breach of directors’ duties owed
                    to RTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Pursuant to discovery obligations in the Year
                    2006 Suit, the Defendants furnished a handwritten document in the Chinese
                    language. This document was titled “Minutes of Meeting” and dated
                    14 April 2001 (“the 14 April Minutes”). The 14 April Minutes had
                    not been disclosed during the mediation process and negotiations leading up to
                    the execution of the Deed of Settlement in 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       During the course of the trial for the Year 2006
                    Suit, counsel for Peter Lim referred to the 14 April Minutes during his
                    cross-examination of the first defendant and second defendant. The 14 April
                    Minutes was also referred to during the cross-examination of the second
                    defendant by counsel for one Margaret Tung (who was added as a third party in
                    the Year 2006 Suit). Parts of the official translation into English of the 14
                    April Minutes were read out during the cross-examination mentioned above. All of
                    these were recorded in the verbatim transcripts of the trial proceedings. It was
                    therefore not disputed that the 14 April Minutes was referred to and used in
                    open court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Year 2006 suit ended with a dismissal of
                    both the claim and the counterclaims by the High Court. On appeal, RTC’s
                    appeal was dismissed but the appeal by the Defendants was allowed in
                    part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     One would not be faulted for thinking that was
                    the end of the saga. It was not to be. The plaintiff instituted this suit
                    against the Defendants for damages for, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, deceit, misrepresentation, conspiracy and for breach of the
                    Memorandum and Articles of Association (“M&amp;A”) of RTC and EH
                    and for breach of the Singapore Exchange Trading Limited Listing Manual
                    (“SGX Rules”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the plaintiff, the 14 April
                    Minutes constituted evidence of an agreement (“the Agreement”)
                    between the Defendants and third parties which provided, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Defendants agreed to sell their shares in
                    RTC, ABR and EH to the third parties for $36 million. The plaintiff claimed,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that the Agreement was in breach
                    of the M&amp;A of RTC and EH, and by failing to disclose the Agreement during
                    the mediation and negotiations leading up to the execution of the Deed of
                    Settlement in 2001, the Defendants had acted fraudulently. The plaintiff also
                    claimed damages for misrepresentation and conspiracy. In addition to the above,
                    the plaintiff claimed that the failure to disclose the Agreement was a breach of
                    the SGX Rules on public disclosure to shareholders since ABR was a listed
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 14 April Minutes became crucial to the
                    plaintiff’s claim. It was the main piece of evidence that the plaintiff
                    was relying on to establish the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     One of the defences raised by the Defendants
                    was that the use of the 14 April Minutes was a breach of the <em>Riddick</em> principle. According to the Defendants, the 14 April
                    Minutes obtained by the plaintiff through discovery in the Year 2006 Suit had to
                    be used only for purposes relating to the Year 2006 Suit. The use of the 14
                    April Minutes in this suit was thus for an improper or collateral purpose and in
                    breach of the <em>Riddick</em> principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the other hand, the plaintiff’s
                    position was that the <em>Riddick</em> principle was not
                    breached because it ceased to apply to the 14 April Minutes once it had been
                    used in open court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Prior to trial, the Defendants took out an
                    application in Summons No 2757 of 2013 to strike out the plaintiff’s
                    statement of claim pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 332, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) on the basis that the use of the 14 April Minutes
                    was a breach of the <em>Riddick</em> principle. The
                    application to strike out was not granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the first day of trial, Mr Harry Elias SC
                    raised this same issue as a preliminary point for determination. As mentioned
                    above (at [13]), the 14 April Minutes was central to the plaintiff’s case.
                    In fact, had I found that the <em>Riddick</em> principle
                    applied to prevent the plaintiff from using the 14 April Minutes, that would
                    have been fatal to the plaintiff’s case. This much was conceded by counsel
                    for the plaintiff, Mr Tan Chuan Thye.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     After hearing both parties, I decided that the
                        <em>Riddick</em> principle did not apply to the April
                    14 Minutes. Accordingly, I ordered the trial to continue. The trial is presently
                    part-heard. As the Defendants appealed against my ruling on the preliminary
                    issue, I now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The sole preliminary issue which concerned the
                    court was whether the <em>Riddick</em> principle ceased to
                    apply once the 14 April Minutes had been used in open court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Riddick principle in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It was not disputed that a party to litigation
                    who had obtained discovery of a document owed an implied undertaking to the
                    court not to use that document for any collateral or ulterior purpose. The
                    principal question concerned the nature of the exceptions (if any) to the
                    general <em>Riddick</em> principle. In <em>Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd</em> [1977] QB 881
                        (“<em>Riddick</em>”), an issue arose as
                    to whether the staff report prepared by the defendant on Riddick, which was
                    disclosed during discovery in an action brought by Riddick for wrongful
                    dismissal, could be used in a subsequent defamation suit that was based on the
                    very report disclosed in the first suit (which was eventually settled before
                    trial). The Court of Appeal held that Riddick was not entitled to use the
                    report. Lord Denning MR explained as follows at 895:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Discovery of documents is a most valuable aid in the doing of justice. The
                        court orders the parties to a suit - both of them - to disclose on oath all
                        documents in their possession or power relating to the matters in issue in
                        the action. Many litigants feel that this is unfair…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The reason for compelling discovery of documents in
                            this way lies in the public interest in discovering the truth so that
                            justice may be done between the parties. That public interest is to be
                            put into the scales against the public interest in preserving privacy
                            and protecting confidential information.</em> The balance comes
                        down in the ordinary way in favour of the public interest of discovering the
                        truth, <em>i.e.</em> in making full disclosure. This
                        balancing act – of weighing the competing public interests – is
                        what I advocated in my judgment in <em>D. v. National Society
                            for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</em>… The thing
                        to do in every case is to weigh the competing public interests and see which
                        way the scales come down…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I proceed to hold the balance in the present case. On the one hand
                        discovery has been had in the first action. It enabled that action to be
                        disposed of. The public interest there has served its purpose. Should it go
                        further so as to enable the memorandum of 16 April, 1969, to be used for
                        this libel action? I think not. The memorandum was obtained by compulsion.
                        Compulsion is an invasion of a private right to keep one’s documents
                        to oneself. The public interest in privacy and confidence demands that this
                        compulsion should not be pressed further than the course of justice
                        requires. The courts should, therefore, not allow the other party – or
                        anyone else – to use the documents for any ulterior or alien purpose.
                        Otherwise the courts themselves would be doing injustice. Very often a party
                        may disclose documents, such as inter-departmental memoranda, containing
                        criticisms of other people or suggestions of negligence or misconduct. If
                        these were permitted to found actions of libel, you would find that an order
                        for discovery would be counter-productive. The inter-departmental memoranda
                        would be lost or destroyed or said never to have existed. In order to
                        encourage openness and fairness, the public interest requires that documents
                        disclosed on discovery are not to be made use of except for the purposes of
                        the action in which they are disclosed. …</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    Such an implied
                            undertaking is owed to <em>the court</em>, and a
                                <em>breach</em> of such an undertaking is a
                                <em>contempt of court</em>, and punishable
                            accordingly. The following elaboration by Hobhouse J (as he then was) in
                            the English High Court decision of <em>Prudential
                                Assurance Co Ltd v Fountain Page Ltd</em> [1991] 1 WLR 756 (at
                            764-765) is illuminating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>This undertaking is implied whether the court
                                expressly requires it or not. The expression of the obligation as an
                                implied undertaking given to the court derives from the historical
                                origin of the principle. It is now in reality a legal obligation
                                which arises by operation of law by virtue of the circumstances
                                under which the relevant person obtained the documents or
                                information. However treating it as having the character of an
                                implied undertaking continues to serve a useful purpose in that it
                                confirms that the obligation is one which is owed to the court for
                                the benefit of the parties, not one which is owed simply to the
                                parties; likewise, it is an obligation which the court has the right
                                to control and can modify or release a party from. It is an
                                obligation which arises from legal process and therefore is within
                                the control of the court, gives rise to direct sanctions which the
                                court may impose (viz. contempt of court) and can be relieved or
                                modified by an order of the court.</em> It is thus a
                            formulation of the obligation which has merit and convenience and
                            enables it to be treated flexibly having regard to the circumstances of
                            any particular case. Treating the duty as one which is owed to the court
                            and breach of which is contempt of court also involves the principle
                            that such contempts of court can be restrained by injunction and that
                            any person who knowingly aids a contempt or does acts which are
                            inconsistent with the undertaking is himself in contempt and liable to
                            sanctions: see <em>Distillers Co. (Biochemicals) Ltd. v.
                                Times Newspapers Ltd</em>. [1975] Q.B. 613.</p>

<em>The rational basis for the rule is that where one
                                party compels another, either by the enforcement of a rule of court
                                or a specific order of the court, to disclose documents or
                                information whether that other wishes to or not, the party obtaining
                                the disclosure is given this power because the invasion of the other
                                party's rights has to give way to the need to do justice between
                                those parties in the pending litigation between them; it follows
                                from this that the results of such compulsion should likewise be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     A few local cases would require more
                    attention. In <em>Manghardt</em> (see [21] above), the
                    plaintiff had initially instituted a suit against a company, Interfood Ltd, for
                    damages for breach of contract and for procuring another party (Khee San Food
                    Industries Sdn Bhd) to breach its contract with the plaintiff. However, the
                    plaintiff also started a fresh suit for defamation against the defendant, who
                    was Interfood Ltd’s “director-general adjoint”. The latter
                    case arose as in the course of discovery for the initial suit, Interfood Ltd
                    disclosed a letter that was addressed to the managing director of Khee San. The
                    letter, which contained allegedly defamatory statements, had been signed by the
                    defendant (although it did not indicate if he had written it in his personal
                    capacity). Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) struck out the plaintiff’s
                    defamation action on the ground of abuse of the process of court. He based this
                    on the <em>Riddick</em> principle. Counsel for the
                    plaintiff contended that the <em>Riddick</em> principle
                    only applied to limit the use of a disclosed document against the same party or
                    parties to the action where discovery of it had been given. After surveying the
                    relevant authorities, Chan JC rejected her argument, citing <em>Sybron Corp v Barclays Bank Plc</em> [1985] Ch 299 (“<em>Sybron</em>”) (at 328):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are two additional matters that I would refer to. Mr Brodie
                        suggested that, since the implied undertaking was imposed for the benefit of
                        the party giving discovery, the bank ought not to be allowed to inhibit use
                        of the documents against third parties, the employees. I do not accept that.
                        It is, in my view, an understandable and legitimate object of the bank that
                        its discovered document should not be used to base actions against its
                        staff. The decision in the <em>Riddick</em> case [1977]
                        QB 881 would surely have been the same if the person sued for defamation had
                        been the employee who drafted the memorandum rather than the employer
                        itself. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It must be noted that no reference was made to the manner in which
                    the document was used in the prior suit. Chan JC was merely dealing with the
                    argument raised by counsel, that the <em>Riddick</em>
                    principle only applied between parties to the suit in which discovery had been
                    ordered. Chan JC was not required to consider the effect of using the document
                    in open court on the <em>Riddick</em>
                principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second local case was that of <em>Reebok International Ltd v Royal Corp and another action</em>
                    [1991] 2 SLR(R) 688. The plaintiff in the main action, Reebok, sued the
                    defendant, Royal, for trademark infringement by importing shoes bearing the
                    “REEBOK” trade mark into Singapore. An Anton Piller order was
                    granted in favour of Reebok, resulting in some 35,832 pairs of shoes in four
                    different models being taken into safe custody. Pursuant to an order of court, a
                    random sample of the seized shoes was selected to be preserved until trial.
                    While the main action was pending, Reebok applied for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, liberty to send ten pairs of each of the four models of
                    shoes to Japan, Taiwan, and the USA. Reebok wanted to use them as evidence in
                    the foreign legal proceedings it was involved in. Chan Sek Keong J (as he then
                    was) dismissed the immediate application before him. In considering the
                        <em>Riddick</em> principle, Chan J observed as follows
                    (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Riddick</em> principle is not an absolute
                        principle. The court has a discretion to release or modify the undertaking,
                        whether express or implied. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I turn next to the case of <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 555. In that
                    case, Beckkett applied to be released from its implied undertaking not to use
                    the documents obtained through discovery in its on-going suit with the bank. It
                    sought leave to use the documents to apply for an injunction in Indonesia
                    against a third party, which it had also added as a defendant in the on-going
                    suit. In the High Court, Woo Bih Li J reversed the assistant registrar’s
                    decision to grant leave, mainly for the reason that disclosing the documents in
                    Indonesia would render the defendant bank liable to criminal prosecution in
                    Indonesia. Beckkett appealed. The Court of Appeal, in dismissing the appeal,
                    made the following observations (at [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It seems to us that, generally, before leave to be released from
                        the implied undertaking is given, two conditions must be satisfied. First,
                        cogent and persuasive reasons must be furnished for the request. Second, it
                        must not give rise to any injustice or prejudice to the party who had given
                        discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is clear that the court may, in the appropriate circumstances,
                    give leave in order for a party to be released from the implied undertaking.
                    Even though the <em>Riddick</em> principle was initially
                    stated in absolute terms, the court can modify the undertaking and grant leave
                    in order for a party to be released from the undertaking. However, the
                    contention by Mr Tan Chuan Thye went even further. He submitted that leave was
                    not required because the implied undertaking ceased once the document had been
                    used in open court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The following observations can be distilled
                    from the discussion above. The <em>Riddick</em> principle,
                    as it was originally espoused, comes about as a result of a balancing exercise
                    (see emphasis in [20] above). On one side of the scale is the public interest in
                    the administration of justice while on the other, there is the need to protect
                    privacy and confidential information. Next, the Court of Appeal pointed out in
                        <em>Pertamina</em> (see [22] above) that the
                    undertaking is owed to the Court, not to the party against whom discovery is
                    ordered. Therefore, it is not an absolute principle and the court has the
                    discretion to release or modify the undertaking (see <em>Reebok</em> at [24] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, none of the local cases have decided
                    on the specific issue that was before me. In the light of this, the task fell on
                    me to determine where the appropriate balance should be struck in Singapore. In
                    arriving at my decision, I first considered the positions in other common law
                    jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">England</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Common law position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Harman v Secretary of
                        State for the Home Department</em> [1983] 1 AC 280 (“<em>Harman</em>”), the House of Lords, by a bare majority
                    of 3-2, decided that the <em>Riddick</em> principle
                    continues to apply even to documents which had been used in open court. In
                        <em>Harman</em>, the plaintiff’s solicitor passed
                    to a journalist documents which had been obtained through discovery in a suit in
                    which she was acting as solicitor for the plaintiff. These documents had already
                    been read out in open court in the course of the hearing. The majority (Lord
                    Diplock, Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Roskill) held that the solicitor was
                    nevertheless guilty of contempt for having disclosed the document in breach of
                    the <em>Riddick</em> principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Lord Scarman (with whom Lord Simon of
                    Glaisdale agreed), in delivering a speech disagreeing with the majority, said
                    (at 313):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A balance has to be struck between two interests of the law - on
                        the one hand, the protection of a litigant's private right to keep his
                        documents to himself notwithstanding his duty to disclose them to the other
                        side in the litigation, and, on the other, the protection of the right,
                        which the law recognises, subject to certain exceptions, as the right of
                        everyone, to speak freely, and to impart information and ideas, upon matters
                        of public knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, a just balance is struck if the obligation endures only so
                        long as the documents themselves are private and confidential. Once the
                        litigant's private right to keep his documents to himself has been overtaken
                        by their becoming public knowledge, we can see no reason why the undertaking
                        given when they were confidential should continue to apply to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Later in his speech, Lord Scarman said (at 316):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To sum up this part of the argument, the common law by its recognition of
                        the principle of open justice ensures that the public administration of
                        justice will be subject to public scrutiny. Such scrutiny serves no purpose
                        unless it is accompanied by the rights of free speech, i.e. the right
                        publicly to report, to discuss, to comment, to criticise, to impart and to
                        receive ideas and information on the matters subjected to scrutiny. Justice
                        is done in public so that it may be discussed and criticised in public.
                        Moreover, trials will sometimes expose matters of public interest worthy of
                        discussion other than the judicial task of doing justice between the parties
                        in the particular case. It cannot be desirable that public discussion of
                        such matters is to be discouraged or obstructed by refusing to allow a
                        litigant and his advisers, who learnt of them through the discovery of
                        documents in their action, to use the documents in public discussion after
                        they have become public knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The difference between the majority and
                    minority lies in the latter’s recognition of the place of the principle of
                    open justice in the balancing exercise. The principle of open justice is
                    traceable to the seminal House of Lords decision in <em>Scott v
                        Scott</em> [1913] AC 417. Moore-Bick J provided the following summary
                    of the principle of open justice in <em>Dian AO v Davis Frankel
                        &amp; Mead (a firm) and another (OOO Alfa-Eco and another
                        intervening)</em> [2005] 1 WLR 2951 (at [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    … For the reasons set out in the speech of
                            Lord Shaw in <em>Scott v Scott</em>… it has
                            long been recognised that if justice is to be properly administered it
                            is essential that the decisions of the courts and the decision making
                            process itself be open to public scrutiny. It is for that reason that in
                            all but exceptional cases hearings are conducted in public, judgment is
                            delivered in public and proceedings can be freely
                        reported.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The majority in <em>Harman</em> was of the opinion that the principle of open justice did
                    not feature in the balancing exercise. Lord Diplock (who formed part of the
                    majority) said at the very beginning of his speech (at 299):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, in a case which has attracted a good deal of publicity it may
                        assist in clearing up misconceptions if I start by saying what the case is
                            <em>not</em> about. It is <em>not</em> about freedom of speech, freedom of the press, openness
                        of justice or documents coming into “the public domain”; nor,
                        with all respect to those of your Lordships who think the contrary, does it
                        in my opinion call for consideration of any of those human rights and
                        fundamental freedoms which in the European Convention on Human Rights are
                        contained in separate articles each starting with a statement in absolute
                        terms but followed immediately by very broadly stated exceptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The majority then reasoned that the <em>Riddick</em> principle did not terminate even when the documents had
                    been used and read in open court as holding otherwise would discourage full and
                    frank discovery of documents and thus impede the proper administration of
                    justice (<em>eg</em>, <em>per</em>
                    Lord Keith at 308–309). The minority, on the other hand, was of the view
                    that allowing such an exception to the <em>Riddick</em>
                    principle would not impede discovery proceedings and the administration of
                    justice because litigants would be aware of the risk produced by public trial
                        (<em>ie</em>, the near certainty that their documents
                    would be produced and read in the course of proceedings, thus entering the
                    public domain) and such an exception would not diminish that risk (<em>per</em> Lord Scarman at 315–316).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     A difficulty faced by the majority in
                        <em>Harman</em> was the treatment of transcripts of
                    court proceedings. Transcripts are clearly not subject to any implied
                    undertaking because of the principle of open justice. Therefore, had the
                    solicitor disclosed to the journalist transcripts (which captured the entire
                    document since it had been assumed that the entire document was read out in
                    court), she would not have been in contempt. Yet by disclosing the document
                    itself, she would be in contempt. Lord Diplock said that this was a hypothetical
                    in the extreme (at 305). Lord Keith said that whatever the position might have
                    been with transcripts, the solicitor was not in a position to disclose the
                    documents and save the journalist time (by not having to wait for the
                    transcripts) (at 309). Lord Roskill noted the strength of these arguments.
                    However, he also pointed out at 324 that as it might be a matter of chance
                    whether the document was actually read in court, the exception, in whatever way
                    crafted, might operate capriciously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The House of Lords also took judicial notice
                    of a common practice, which involved counsel in civil litigation allowing
                    reporters present at the hearing to view the copies of documents disclosed by
                    either party and read out in court to allow the reporters to check the accuracy
                    of the reports of the proceedings that they were preparing. Lord Diplock dealt
                    with the practice as follows(at 307):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether this be so or whether, as Dunn L.J. preferred to put it in the
                        Court of Appeal, any contempt of court that might be involved, if not
                        excluded under the de minimis rule, would at most be only technical is not,
                        however, of any practical importance. As was held in <em>Scott v. Scott</em> any contempt of court of this kind would be
                        civil. The court would not have jurisdiction to deal with it except on
                        motion by the other party to the action and if the person showing the
                        document to the reporter had no reason to suppose that the party whose
                        document it was would object to his doing so, the court in the proper
                        exercise of its discretion could dismiss the motion with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Lord Keith, though, was of the view that there were hazards in the
                    practice. If there was doubt as to whether the party who had disclosed the
                    documents would approve of it being shown, the documents should not be disclosed
                    to journalists without approval (see 309). Lord Roskill, on the other hand, was
                    of the view that such a practice was not in contempt of court and admitted an
                    exception “in favour of those who engage in day-by-day reporting”
                    (at 327).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Sybron</em>, Scott
                    J added a further gloss on the holding of <em>Harman</em>.
                    He said (at 321–322):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Brodie accepts that these three attendance notes, each of which was
                        contained in a document produced by the bank in the main action pursuant to
                        the subpoena, were together with all the other documents so produced or
                        subsequently discovered protected by the implied undertaking. He submits,
                        however, that once documents have been incorporated into a judgment of which
                        there is a written record, such as a transcript, the undertaking does not
                        prevent information being obtained from that record and used for any purpose
                        the extractor of the information may wish. The undertaking, he submits,
                        prevents the use of information obtained directly from the discovered
                        documents but it does not, he says, prevent the use of information if the
                        information is obtained from some other source. In the instant case the
                        other source is the transcript of Walton J.'s judgment. The source might
                        equally well, in another case, take the form of counsel's or a journalist's
                        notes of an extempore judgment. The principle would, if Mr. Brodie is right,
                        apply also to written records of counsel's speeches or witnesses' testimony.
                        If in the course of such speeches or such testimony the contents of a
                        discovered document were read, the undertaking would not, submits Mr.
                        Brodie, prevent the use of information about the documents derived from a
                        written record of the speech or testimony. And the same would presumably be
                        said to be the case if reliance were placed on the memory rather than on a
                        written record of what has been said in open court. I am unable to accept
                        the submission. It is necessary, in my judgment, to distinguish between the
                        party on whom the undertaking is imposed on the one hand and third parties
                        on the other hand. The undertaking binds the former, it does not bind the
                        latter, who have given no undertaking. … Mr. Brodie seeks from this
                        premise to argue that if the solicitor had obtained a transcript of the
                        proceedings she could have used such information about the documents as
                        could be derived from the transcript without regard to the undertaking that
                        she had given. It is correct that nothing in <em>Home Office
                            v. Harman</em> expressly states the contrary. Mr. Brodie's
                        proposition was not in point in that case. But his proposition does not, in
                        my judgment, follow from his premise. The reason why the journalist or any
                        third party could have used information derived from a transcript is that
                        third parties have not given and are not bound by any undertaking. If
                        proceedings are held in open court information derived from any record of
                        those proceedings can be used by third parties without regard to
                        undertakings which may bind the parties thereto or their solicitors. But the
                        position of the parties themselves depends not on what third parties may be
                        able to do but on the scope of the undertaking that binds them. The purpose
                        of the undertaking is to protect, so far as is consistent with the proper
                        prosecution of the action, the confidentiality of the party's private
                        documents, and thereby to encourage the full and proper disclosure of
                        documents that the administration of justice requires. It seems to me
                        unacceptably inconsistent with that purpose that the protection of the
                        undertaking should be lost on account of the fortuitous reading in open
                        court of the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The effect of <em>Sybron</em> was that court
                    transcripts could be used by third parties but not by the party who had obtained

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Statutory change in England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The position in <em>Harman</em> and <em>Sybron</em> no longer
                    represents the position in England. The impetus for the change was neatly
                    summarised in <em>SmithKline Beecham Biologicals SA v Connaught
                        Laboratories Inc</em> [1999] 4 All ER 498:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law as established in <em>Home Office v
                            Harman</em> was challenged before the European Commission of Human
                        Rights, and the challenge was amicably settled on an undertaking by Her
                        Majesty’s Government to seek to change the law so that it would no
                        longer be a contempt of court to make public material contained in documents
                        compulsorily disclosed in civil proceedings once those documents had been
                        read out in open court (see <em>Bibby Bulk Carriers Ltd v
                            Cansulex Ltd, The Cambridgeshire</em> [1988] 2 All ER 820 at 824,
                        [1989] QB 155 at 159 per Hirst J). That undertaking was honoured by the
                        introduction of what is now Ord 24, r 14A, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Any undertaking, whether express or implied, not to use a
                            document for any purposes other than those of the proceedings in which
                            it is disclosed shall cease to apply to such a document after it has
                            been read to or by the Court, or referred to, in open Court, unless the
                            court for special reasons has otherwise ordered on the application of a
                            party or of the person to whom the document belongs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The English position is now captured in the
                    Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (“CPR”) in r
                    31.22, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) A party to whom a document has been disclosed may use the
                        document only for the purpose of the proceedings in which it is disclosed,
                        except where –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the document has been read to or by the court, or referred to, at
                            a hearing which has been held in public;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the court gives permission; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the party who disclosed the document and the person to whom the
                            document belongs agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The court may make an order restricting or prohibiting the use of a
                        document which has been disclosed, even where the document has been read to
                        or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which has been held in
                        public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) An application for such an order may be made
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) by a party; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) by any person to whom the document belongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As is immediately evident, Lord
                    Scarman’s position in <em>Harman</em> is now the law
                    in England. Through r 31.22 of the CPR, the English legislature enshrined the
                    principle of open justice (since documents can be used only if they are read to
                    or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which is held in <em>public</em>) in the balancing exercise. It must be noted that
                    an application can still be made to the court - by the party against whom
                    discovery is ordered or the person to whom the document belongs - to prevent
                    further use of such documents. It is also worthwhile to note that no reference
                    has been made to the treatment of transcripts. However, it stands to reason that
                    if the party who had obtained a document through discovery can use the document
                    once it is aired in open court, no legitimate reason exists to prevent the use
                    of transcripts which refer to that document.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At the federal level, the current position is
                    similar to the minority position in <em>Harman</em> and the
                    current English approach. Rule 20.03 of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Australia)
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    If a document is read or referred to in open court
                            in a way that discloses its contents, any express order or implied
                            undertaking not to use the document except in relation to a particular
                            proceeding no longer applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    However, a party, or a person to whom the document
                            belongs, may apply to the Court for an order that the order or
                            undertaking continue to apply to the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There are various positions taken among the
                    Australian states. Rule 21.7 of New South Wales’ Uniform Civil
                    Procedure Rules 2005 is similar in its effect to the federal legislation. The
                    positions in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are still governed
                    by common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>British American Tobacco
                        Australian Services Ltd v Cowell</em> (<em>No
                        2</em>) (2003) 8 VR 571 (“<em>British American
                        Tobacco</em>”), the Victorian Court of Appeal followed and
                    applied the majority approach in <em>Harman</em>. The court
                    found no reason why a party would be freed of the implied undertaking only
                    because the document had been used in open court (at [48]). The court at [36]
                    also agreed with Lord Roskill’s criticism in <em>Harman</em> of the concept of “public domain” as
                    “of doubtful precision”. However, the court in <em>British American Tobacco</em> expressed doubt as to the correctness
                    of the proposition in <em>Sybron</em> that the party under
                    the implied undertaking was prevented from even making use of transcripts of
                    proceedings (at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On the other hand, in <em>K

                    considering the position taken in <em>British American
                        Tobacco</em>, declined to follow the majority approach in <em>Harman</em> and instead adopted Lord Scarman’s approach
                    (at [68]). The court was persuaded that the majority approach in <em>Harman</em> created a rule which operated unequally between
                    the person who had obtained the document through discovery and third parties;
                    this would be “likely to erode confidence in [the rule]” (at
                    [65]). The court opined that Lord Scarman’s approach was more consistent
                    with the principle of open justice (at [66]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In <em>Uniflex (Australia) Pty

                    Australia cited Lord Scarman’s approach in <em>Harman</em> with approval (at [144]–[149]). However, the court
                    was not required to decide the issue or to adopt Lord Scarman’s approach
                    as it decided that “the information reflected in the document was not
                    brought to light as a consequence of the requirements of the Court concerning
                    discovery” and thus the principle had no application in the case (at
                    [148]–[149]).</p>

                    Canada (hearing an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia)
                    declined to follow the majority in <em>Harman</em>.
                    According to the Supreme Court, the undertaking is spent when “an adverse

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In Ontario, the position is governed by

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Ontario position is broader than the English position since in
                    the former, the implied undertaking ceases the moment the document is <em>filed</em> in court or given or referred to during a hearing.
                    In the latter, the document must have actually been used in open court. This
                    difference, however, was not material to the issue that was before me since the
                    14 April Minutes had been referred to in open court (see [9]
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Hong Kong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In Hong Kong, O 24 r 14A of the Rules of the
                    High Court (Chapter 4A, GN 25/1998) provides the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any undertaking, whether express or implied, not to use a document for any

                        otherwise ordered on the application of a party or of the person to whom the
                        document belongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This provision was modelled after the previous versions of the
                    current English statute. Furthermore, in <em>Allied Group Ltd v
                        Secretary for Justice</em> [2003] HKEC 1221 (at [38]), the Hong Kong
                    Court of Appeal criticised the decision of <em>Sybron</em>
                    in deciding that a party could only be prevented from using “unused
                    material” of a prior proceeding but could not be prevented from making
                    use of transcripts of the prior proceeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">New Zealand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In New Zealand, the position is similar to the
                    current position in England. Rule 8.30(4) of the Rules of High Court (New
                    Zealand) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) A party who obtains a document by way of inspection or who makes a
                        copy of a document under this rule—</p>

                        to any other person (unless it has been read out in open court).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The parenthesis in sub-r (b), which
                    establishes the minority position in <em>Harman</em>, was
                    introduced on 1 February 2012. However, even before this, New Zealand’s
                    Court of Appeal, in <em>Wilson v White</em> [2005] 3 NZLR
                    619 (“<em>Wilson</em>”), had declined to
                    follow the majority approach in <em>Harman</em>. Instead,
                    the court adopted Lord Scarman’s minority approach in <em>Harman</em> (at [48]). This was despite the absence of the
                    parenthesis in sub-r (b) above, which in effect almost created a statutory
                    prohibition (the provision then in force was reproduced in <em>Wilson</em> at [23]). The court adopted the current English position
                    because it gave greater priority to the principle of open justice (at
                    [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate balance in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Before me, considerable arguments were made
                    based on these sections of the Application of English Law Act (Chapter 7A, 1994
                    Rev Ed) (“AELA”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Mr Harry Elias SC submitted that <em>Harman</em> and <em>Sybron</em>
                    represented the common law position before 1993. He further submitted that, by
                    virtue of s 3(1) of the AELA, I was therefore bound to apply the positions
                    established by those cases. He further submitted that s 5(1) precluded the court
                    from considering the legislative changes that had occurred in England following
                        <em>Harman</em>. Mr Tan Chuan Thye, on the other hand,
                    submitted that s 3(1) only applied to import substantive common law and equity
                    principles and not procedural rules of the common law. According to him, since
                    the <em>Riddick</em> principle was procedural in nature, s
                    3(1) had no effect. In the alternative, he submitted that s 3(2) nevertheless
                    provided an avenue for the court to modify the common law principles in their
                    application to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     To me, the correct position is that s 3(1)
                    read with s 3(2) declare that all of the common law of England (including the
                    principles and rules of equity, and other substantive and procedural rules that
                    have become part of the common law of England) in so far as it was part of the
                    law of Singapore immediately before 12th November 1993, shall continue to be
                    part of the law of Singapore subject to such modifications that are required to
                    make it applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants. The
                    effect of s 5(1) is to make clear that English enactments are not automatically
                    part of our law, but it does not prohibit the court from considering the effect
                    of those enactments when developing our own common law and when determining what
                    modifications pursuant to s 3(2) are applicable having regard to the
                    circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     This reading of the AELA is consistent with
                    the speech of the then Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar (“the
                    Minister”), in the second reading of the Application of English Law Bill
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (12 October 1993) vol 61 at cols 611–613)
                    (“the Second Reading Speech”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me now deal with the specific provisions of the Bill. Clause 3 is a
                        declaratory provision of the existing legal position. <em>It
                            preserves the corpus of English common law (including the principles and
                            rules of equity) that now applies or has been received in Singapore as
                            part of the law of Singapore.</em> It is not intended to change
                        the legal position as regards the applicability of the common law of
                        England, which to the extent that it continues to apply, is subject to such
                        modifications as the circumstances may require. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me now deal with clause 5 of the Bill, which is also a key provision.
                        Under this clause, no English enactment shall be part of the law of
                        Singapore except as provided in the Bill. The effect is that no pre-1826
                        English statute and no Imperial Act (other than the three Imperial Acts
                        preserved in the First Schedule) will have <em>any force of
                            law in Singapore</em>. This clause will remove once and for all
                        the possibility of some obscure English statute which no one in Singapore is
                        aware of being one day held to be applicable here.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Furthermore, the Court of Appeal in <em>Review
                        Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another
                        appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 52 (“<em>Review
                        Publishing</em>”) explained the effect of s 3 of the AELA as
                    follows (at [247]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Implicit in s 3(1) of the AELA is the principle that the <b>body of English common law</b> which was part of the law
                        of Singapore immediately before the cut-off date of 12 November 1993
                        (“pre-AELA English common law”) continues to be the law of
                        Singapore, <em>but not otherwise</em>. After that
                        cut-off date, the common law of Singapore would be the common law as
                        declared and developed by our courts. Furthermore, it should be noted that,
                        although pre-AELA English common law continues to be part of our law today
                        by virtue of s 3(1) of the AELA, it continues to be in force here only
                        “[in] so far as it is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore
                        and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances
                        may require” (see s 3(2) of the AELA). In other words, the
                        application of pre-AELA English common law in Singapore <em>both before and after</em> the cut-off date of 12 November 1993
                        is subject to local circumstances (see the Second Charter of Justice
                            <em>vis-à-vis</em> the position prior to 12
                        November 1993 and s 3(2) of the AELA <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                        the position after that date).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Neither the Minister nor the Court of Appeal
                    made any distinction between the substantive and procedural rules of the common
                    law. In fact, the Minister referred to the “<em>corpus</em> of English common law” while the Court of Appeal
                    referred to the “<em>body</em> of English common
                    law”. If it was indeed the intention of s 3 to exclude the procedural
                    rules of the English common law and include only the substantive rules of the
                    English common law, I would imagine that it would be made clearer either in the
                    express words of the statute, the Second Reading Speech of the Minister or even
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Review Publishing</em>. With
                    regards to s 5(1), the Minister in the Second Reading Speech clarified that no
                    English statute would have any <em>force of law in
                        Singapore</em> (other than the three Imperial Acts preserved in the
                    First Schedule). As further explained, this was to “remove the
                    possibility of some obscure English statute which no one in Singapore is aware
                    of being one day held to be applicable here” (see [51] above). However,
                    there is no indication that s 5(1) operates to prevent the court from even
                    considering English enactments when developing the common law in Singapore and
                    when determining what modifications pursuant to s 3(2) are applicable having
                    regard to the particular circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants. If this
                    was indeed the case, an untenable position would ensue since s 5(1) only refers
                    to English statutes and therefore the court would only be precluded from
                    considering English statutes but not statutes from other jurisdictions besides
                    England when developing our common law in a manner that would be applicable to
                    the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Therefore, in the circumstances of the present
                    case, I may adopt either the majority or minority approach in <em>Harman</em> depending on which is applicable and more appropriate to
                    the circumstances of Singapore. In doing so, I may consider any English
                    enactments post-1993 including any other enactments and the common law in other
                    jurisdictions in so far as they are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     After careful consideration, I found that the
                        <em>Riddick</em> principle ceased to apply once a
                    document had been used in open court. I adopted Lord Scarman’s approach
                    for three reasons. Firstly, it gives greater priority to the principle of open
                    justice in the balancing exercise. Secondly, it is not beset with the same
                    difficulties and anomalies as the majority approach in <em>Harman</em>. Thirdly, it is the route by which most common law
                    jurisdictions have gone down, either through the common law or by statutory
                    changes. I thus considered Lord Scarman’s approach to be applicable to the
                    circumstances of Singapore as a progressive common law
                jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The principle of open justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As mentioned above at [26], the <em>Riddick</em> principle and its boundaries are determined by a
                    balancing exercise which requires the consideration of two factors that are on
                    either side of the scale—the administration of justice and the right to
                    privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The administration of justice is what compels
                    discovery since it allows the court to ascertain the truth and do justice
                    between the parties. To this end, those who advocate the majority position in
                        <em>Harman</em> claim that holding that the <em>Riddick</em> principle ceases when a document is used in open
                    court undermines the administration of justice because it impedes proper
                    discovery, as parties would not be forthcoming during the discovery process. I
                    think this argument is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Firstly, discovery is not a voluntary process.
                    Rather, it is an obligation since it a court-ordered process under O 24 r 1 of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). In fact,
                    the significance of the obligation is demonstrated in the consequences of
                    non-compliance. The court, under O 24 r 16, has a whole host of sanctions which
                    include committal proceedings or even the dismissal of the claim or striking out
                    of a defence and entering of judgment. In this regard, it is also pertinent to
                    note that a solicitor under the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules
                    (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed) has an ethical duty to cease to act if he becomes
                    aware of the existence of a document which should have been but has not been
                    disclosed on discovery and the client fails forthwith to disclose it (r
                        58(<em>b</em>)). Therefore, whatever concern that the
                    administration of justice may be impeded because discovery may be discouraged,
                    should the <em>Riddick</em> principle no longer apply once
                    the document is used in open court, would be adequately addressed by the
                    sanctions which may be imposed on the non-complying party or even the errant
                    solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Secondly, even though the <em>Riddick</em> principle ceases once the document has been used in open
                    court, it does not prevent a party from applying to court in order for the
                    undertaking to continue. As mentioned above at [26], the court has the
                    discretion to release or modify the undertaking. In England, the current
                    position is that a party who discloses or owns the document can apply to court
                    for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of a document which has been
                    disclosed even where the document has been read to or by the court, or referred
                    to, at the hearing which has been held in public (see [36] above). Since the
                        <em>Riddick</em> principle has its juridical
                    foundations in the common law and the court can modify the undertaking, I see no
                    reason why such an approach cannot be adopted in Singapore. Therefore, any fear
                    that discovery might be discouraged evaporates once a party realises that it may
                    apply to court for the <em>Riddick</em> principle (and thus
                    the implied undertaking) to continue despite the document being used in open
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The crucial question that remains is whether
                    the principle of open justice is engaged and so, whether it features in the
                    balancing exercise under the rubric of administration of justice. This is to me,
                    the nub of the disagreement in <em>Harman</em> (see above
                    at [30]). In Singapore, the principle of open justice is given statutory
                    recognition in s 8(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev
                    Ed) which provides the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>8.</b>—(1) The place in which any court is
                        held for the purpose of trying any cause or matter, civil or criminal, shall
                        be deemed an open and public court to which the public generally may have
                        access.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The principle of open justice was also discussed in <em>Tan Chi Min v The Royal Bank of Scotland plc</em> [2013] 4
                    SLR 529. There the main question was when court documents, such as affidavits
                    filed pursuant to interlocutory applications, should be made available for
                    public access and inspection. Lee Seiu Kin J observed (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    In sum, the principle of open justice requires that
                            decisions by judges (and Registrars) in court proceedings be amenable to
                            scrutiny by members of the public through the inspection of documents
                            filed in court that were considered in the decision-making process. This
                            serves to promote public confidence in the administration of justice.
                            However, it does not mean that all court documents are open to
                            inspection by members of the public the moment they are filed in court,
                            for the principle of open justice is engaged only when a court has made
                            a decision involving the consideration of those documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the present case, the document in question
                    had been used in open court in a prior hearing. The principle of open justice is
                    clearly engaged. Therefore, by holding that the <em>Riddick</em> principle ceases once a document is used in open court,
                    proper deference and recognition is given to the principle of open
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Difficulties with the majority approach in <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Harman</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Another reason for holding that the minority
                    approach in <em>Harman</em> should be adopted was the
                    difficulties the majority approach was fraught with. As seen above at [32], the
                    majority approach draws a distinction between the document itself and the
                    transcripts (which may contain the entire document if it is read in court). The
                    former is subject to the <em>Riddick</em> principle but not
                    the latter. I, for much the same reasons as the judge in <em>K
                        &amp; S Corporation</em>, find such a distinction between the document
                    disclosed and the transcripts to be untenable. The absurdity of this situation
                    is further shown by <em>Sybron</em> (see [34] above) which
                    held that the party to whom the document was disclosed cannot make use of even
                    the transcripts while third parties may avail themselves of them. Apart from
                    ignoring the principle of open justice, this holding creates an unjustifiable
                    distinction between the party to whom the document was disclosed and third
                    parties when it comes to the use of transcripts. It is also worthwhile to note
                    that even in <em>British American Tobacco</em> (at [40]),
                    where the majority position was preferred, the court criticised the decision of
                        <em>Sybron</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The difficulty with the <em>Harman</em> majority approach is also highlighted by the three
                    different approaches each of the law Lords took with regards to the common
                    practice mentioned at [33]. The minority approach is not beset with such
                    difficulties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     A criticism levelled at the minority approach
                    is that the concept of “public domain” is “of doubtful
                    precision” (see [40] above). I do not share these misgivings. As
                    explained by Debelle J in <em>K &amp; S Corporation</em> at
                    [67], it is simply “used to describe that which was once confidential but
                    which has become public knowledge.” Debelle J further explained that the
                    difficulty lies mainly with deciding, as a question of fact, when the document
                    has become public knowledge. To me, there is sufficient clarity in the view that
                    a document is used in open court if it is read to or by the court, or referred
                    to in the course of a hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Harry Elias SC also directed me to the
                    following passage from the Court of Appeal in <em>Pertamina</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    The principles embodied in <em>Riddick</em> are straightforward enough, and its rationale
                            equally clear (and for a comprehensive and relatively recent summary,
                            see the English High Court decision of <em>Cobra Golf Inc
                                v Rata</em> [1996] FSR 819 at 830-832). There are occasional
                            difficulties surrounding the precise parameters of the principle (see,
                            for example, the House of Lords decision of <em>Harman v
                                Secretary of State for the Home Department</em> [1983] 1 AC
                            280, although the statutory changes effected thereafter (in the UK
                            context) appear to have generated separate difficulties (see <em>Gee</em> ([19]<em>supra</em>) at
                            paras 24.002-24.003)). Fortunately, they do not arise on the facts of
                            the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The main difficulty referred to in Steven Gee, <em>Commercial Injunctions</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th<sup></sup>Ed, 2004) at paras 24.002–24.003 was the width of the
                    release of the undertaking, specifically, whether it went so far “as
                    enabling a person to commence new proceedings based on previously protected
                    information”. In <em>Taylor and Another v Director of the
                        Serious Fraud Office and Others</em> [1999] 2 AC 177
                        (“<em>Taylor</em>”), the House of Lords
                    held that in the context of criminal proceedings, there was an implied
                    undertaking by the defendant not to use the materials disclosed other than for
                    purposes of the defence since allowing otherwise would have a chilling effect on
                    investigative processes. Lord Hoffmann, in accepting the possibility that the
                    new English position might have been drawn too widely, considered at 212 that
                    there was “much force” in the view that the court “should
                    nevertheless retain control over certain collateral uses of the documents,
                    including the bringing of libel proceedings.”
                    <em>Taylor</em> was of limited application in the current
                    case because of the different regimes in place for disclosure of documents in
                    criminal proceedings in England and Singapore. With reference to Lord
                    Hoffmann’s point, I was cognisant of the fact that <em>Harman</em> involved disclosure to a journalist, who subsequently
                    wrote a scathing article, while the situation here was slightly different in
                    that the plaintiff wished to institute a fresh suit based on matters disclosed
                    in the 14 April Minutes. However, I did not believe this difference was
                    significant enough to warrant a different approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The position taken in other jurisdictions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The third and final reason why I favour the
                    minority approach in <em>Harman</em> is that it has been
                    the preferred approach around most of the common law world. Courts in New
                    Zealand, South Australia, Western Australia and the Supreme Court of Canada have
                    taken it upon themselves to develop the common law along the lines of the
                    minority in <em>Harman</em>. In addition to this,
                    legislatures in Australia (both at the federal level and in New South Wales),
                    Hong Kong, Ontario and New Zealand have made changes modelling the current
                    English approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     To summarise, the <em>Riddick</em> principle ceases to apply once a document is used in
                    open court. However, the party who discloses the document or a party who owns
                    the document may apply to the court for the implied undertaking to
                    continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Defendants, who disclosed the 14 April
                    Minutes pursuant to their discovery obligations in the Year 2006 Suit, made no
                    application to the judge during the open court hearing in which the document in
                    question was used to order the continuation of the undertaking so that no party
                    could use that document subsequently in other court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Since the 14 April Minutes was used in open
                    court and the court had not made any order for the undertaking to continue, I
                    accordingly held that the plaintiff could use the document in the current suit
                    and ordered the trial to continue.</p>
