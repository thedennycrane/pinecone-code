<span class="font-italic">Lau </span><span class="font-italic">Keuk Ling William Ignatius v Chan Chun Sheng Gary</span> [2021] SGHC 184 (the “Judgment”).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellant was injured in a road traffic accident on 14 February 2017 when a car, driven by Mr Chan Chun Sheng Gary (the “respondent”) at high speed, collided into the rear of the appellant’s stationary car. This caused the appellant’s car to collide into the rear of the stationary lorry in front; both these vehicles were at a traffic light-controlled junction awaiting the green light. The appellant suffered, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, neck and head injuries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The respondent failed to cooperate with his motor insurer, NTUC Income Cooperative Limited, or take any part in the proceedings. On 11 July 2019, interlocutory judgment was entered with damages to be assessed. The respondent’s insurer, repudiated liability to indemnify the respondent but nonetheless intervened in the action (the “intervener”) as it was liable to satisfy any judgment obtained by the appellant for damages for bodily injuries under the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (the “MVTPR Act”), if the respondent failed to pay the same. Having intervened, the intervener was entitled to raise any defences or raise any arguments open to the respondent in resisting the appellant’s claims, subject of course to costs.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The appellant was 62 years old at the time of the accident and was 66 at the time of the trial for the assessment of damages (though turning 67 years old in 2021). At the time of the accident, the appellant was a driver for Grab Holdings Inc (“Grab driver”) but his contention was that it was only a temporary job. He was diagnosed to have suffered a right frontal subarachnoid haemorrhage and he was discharged after an overnight stay. He subsequently complained of headaches, chest discomfort and nasal discharge and was readmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) for observation and treatment on 17 February 2017. He was discharged six days later on 22 February 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases below </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The appellant made the following claims totalling $2,510,202.40 for general damages (Judgment at [46]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) pain and suffering: $147,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) traumatic brain injury: $70,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) psychiatric conditions: $65,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) left shoulder injury: $5,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) neck/cervical C4-5 and C5-6 disk protrusions (whiplash): $7,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) future medical expenses: $161,702.40;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) future transport expenses: $2,500.00; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(h) loss of earning capacity/future earnings: $2,052,000.00.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The intervener agreed to the following claims:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) left shoulder injury: $5,000.00; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) neck/cervical C4-5 and C5-6 disk protrusions (whiplash): $7,000.00.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The appellant made the following claims totalling $950,091.64 for special damages (Judgment at [47]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) medical expenses (and continuing): $24,132.64;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) transport expenses: $1,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) pre-trial loss of earnings: $861,800.00;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) total loss of car: $37,959.00; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) loss of use of car: $25,200.00.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The intervener agreed to the following claims:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) medical expenses (and continuing): $24,132.64; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) transport expenses: $1,000.00.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The intervener disputed the remaining claims for various reasons, including an alleged overestimation of the <span class="font-italic">quantum </span>of damages suffered and <span class="font-italic">denial of the bodily injury suffered</span> based on their expert’s evidence which we shall deal with below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision below and the parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 A summary of the parties’ respective positions on each of the relevant heads (and sub-heads) of damages as against the Judgment can be conveniently tabulated as follows:

</div> another case relating to the assessment of damages arising from a road traffic accident, for the applicable legal principles to appellate intervention in cases<span class="font-italic"> </span>concerning the assessment of damages. In that regard, the appellate court (at [7]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… may vary the quantum of damages awarded by the judge only if it is shown that the latter: (a) acted on the wrong principles; (b) misapprehended the facts; or (c) had for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As such, while the parties rely on two separate case authorities, the two authorities, when read together, are consistent and applicable to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 We add that the objective of damages is, in turn, meant to compensate the claimant for his loss (<span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siong</span> [2019] 1 SLR 145 (“<span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang</span>”) at [9]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As with any claim in the tort of negligence, the basic principle for determining the quantum of damages for personal injury is to award the claimant “full compensation” for his loss … This means that the award should, as far as money can accomplish, restore him to the position that he would have been in had the injury not been sustained … In the case of pecuniary losses, such as lost earnings, the idea of full compensation gives rise to little difficulty, at least in principle. However, where non-pecuniary loss is concerned, such as pain, suffering and loss of amenity, full compensation is inherently difficult to measure because such loss cannot be assessed by mathematical calculation. The guiding principle, in this context, is therefore that of “fair compensation”, in the words of Field J at first instance in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Phillips v The London and South Western Railway Co</span> (1879) 5 QBD 78 at 80. This means that compensation ought to be reasonable and just, and need not be “absolute” or “perfect” (see <span class="font-italic">Cane and </span><span class="font-italic">Goudkamp</span> at pp 131–132 and the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Fletcher v Autocar and Transporters Ltd</span> [1968] 2 QB 322 (“<span class="font-italic">Fletcher</span>”) at 335A–B per Lord Denning MR).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang </span>thereafter discusses two methods for quantifying damages (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “component method” and the “global method” (at [10])). In the present case, the Judge adopted the “component method” (without mentioning it as such) and the <span class="font-italic">method adopted </span>is not disputed by parties. As such, we highlight the principles applicable to the “component method” (<span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang </span>at [14]–[18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Quantification of individual items of loss, at the first stage, is essential because it requires the court as far as possible to explain its reasons for arriving at the final sum awarded. The court does this by placing a monetary value on compensation for each discrete injury, and explaining why the value is appropriate, having regard to the nature of the injury and its effect on the claimant. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Reference may be made to assessment guidelines at the first stage of the analysis. In Singapore, the main resource is Charlene Chee <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) … The Guidelines are of assistance because they set out indicative assessment ranges for most types of personal injury. However, it should be borne in mind that they are no more than guidelines. As the former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong observed in the foreword (at p vii), they provide a “good starting point” for negotiation. More importantly, the Guidelines’ own premise behind the validity of the indicative assessment ranges is that the injury concerned is the dominant injury or is a distinct injury that the claimant has suffered. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That explains the need for the second stage, which considers whether the aggregate award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate. If either obtains, then the award will have to be adjusted. This is not an impressionistic exercise, but is instead guided by at least two well-defined considerations.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first is what is often called “overlapping” injuries. This refers to the phenomenon of injuries which either (a) together result in pain that would not have been differentially felt by the claimant (<span class="font-italic">Winston Tan</span> ([10] supra) at [16]) or (b) together give rise to only a single disability (<span class="font-italic">Samuel Chai</span> ([10] supra) at [49]). In such circumstances, compensating for each distinct injury would likely result in an excessive award. … Ultimately, the court must be astute in assessing the claimant’s true loss, whether in the context of pain, suffering and loss of amenity or future expenses, in order to avoid making duplicative awards.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The second consideration is precedent. Reference to precedent assists in arriving at a fair estimate of loss by drawing on experience contained in previous decisions. It also ensures that like cases are treated alike. …</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 We now turn to those items of damages that are the subject of the appeal before us, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>:

Weekly statements obtained from Grab showed that the appellant worked as a Grab driver from May to November 2019 after the accident, averaging at $2,100 per month (Judgment at [108]). On 28 September 2020, the appellant received a letter from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) informing him that his TDVL would be expiring on 18 November 2020. If the appellant wanted to renew his TDVL, he would have to first attend a five-hour refresher course conducted by the LTA. However, the appellant failed to do so (Judgment at [111]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The intervener’s position is that the appellant’s loss of earnings was due to his act of giving up his TDVL. Nevertheless, in the alternative, if the court rules in favour of the appellant, then the multiplicand awarded should be based on $2,100 per month. For pre-trial loss of earnings, the appellant should be limited to claim only the days on which he was unable to work (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, sought medical treatment based on his medical bills). This totalled 186 days. As such, the appellant’s pre-trial loss of earnings would be $13,020 ($70 per day multiplied by 186 days) (Judgment at [113]–[114]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Judge accepted the intervener’s submission for pre-trial loss of earnings at $13,020. As for LFE, the Judge declined to use 75 years as the retirement age for the present case. The Judge distinguished the present case from <span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang</span>, on which the appellant sought to rely, in order to claim beyond Singapore’s minimum retirement age of 62 years (Judgment at [115], [118]–[119]). The claimant in <span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang </span>was a carpenter, an occupation which is not limited by one’s age and could very well have worked until 70. While one could indeed request for re-employment for another five years at 62 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, until he is 67 years old), such option was not available to the appellant because he was not in gainful employment at age 62, having left Basler in October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As for the Stanford Publication, the Judge held that the “retirement age in the US has no relevance to Singapore” (Judgment at [121]).

In contrast, loss of earning capacity (“LEC”) compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the claimant would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market (at [20]).

Secondly, such an award essentially allows for some double recovery to the appellant.

The appellant’s contention that he would have worked in a senior management position in a company until he was 75 is without any valid basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The October Doctor’s Memo states the appellant’s date of birth as 16 August 1954. The Judge correctly assessed the evidence as regards his employment history, which we have reproduced above at [20]. The appellant was about 60 years old when he took the severance package from Freescale in 2014. He proceeded to look around for another job in the industry for six months before securing a job at Basler. The appellant’s position was that he tendered his resignation on 21 September 2016 because he was unable to fit in well with the management style and left at the end of October 2016. However, the evidence shows Basler issued the appellant the Notice on 19 September 2016 which stated that his last day of work was 19 September 2016 and that he would be paid severance benefits which came up to $17,719.50. We highlight that the appellant would have been 62 when he left Basler.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As set out at [21]–[22] above, the appellant had contacts with various head-hunters and recruiters but there were no concrete job offers forthcoming up to the time of the accident. The appellant attempts to link the accident to his failure to secure a job offer by two reasons: first, one of those positions was no longer available by the time he had replied; and secondly, that he struggled to recall details and hesitated during a conversation with one head hunter on 9 April 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, about two months after the accident), which prejudiced his chances with that head hunter.

That seems to have coincided with the time he left Freescale. It also transpired that he was working as a Grab driver at the time of the accident. The objective evidence showed that the appellant driving as a Grab driver from May to November 2019 averaging $2,100 per month (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, well over two years after the accident and prior to the assessment of damages).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 We note that the Judge carefully considered the evidence relating to the appellant’s work history, what occurred after the accident and the medical evidence and came to her findings of fact. The undeniable objective fact was that at the age of 62, his employment with Basler ceased. Without being unduly unkind to the appellant, his claims of being at the height of his career are not at all convincing given the evidence of the Notice (as mentioned at [25] above) and it is the appellant’s own evidence that he left because he could not fit in with their management style. The appellant could not find another job up to the time of the accident; and that was not for want of trying.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 We therefore see no reason to intervene on the learned Judge’s finding of fact on this score. Indeed, we agree with the learned Judge that there was no realistic prospect of the appellant being employed in a similar senior management position after he left Basler. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We emphasise that the appellant’s case for his LFE claim <span class="font-italic">on the basis of his intention </span><span class="font-italic">to work</span> <span class="font-italic">in a senior management position</span> is unconvincing and untenable at law. As we mentioned at the hearing before us, such <span class="font-italic">intention </span>to work does not necessarily mean that damages must be awarded <span class="font-italic">based on a claimant’s </span><span class="font-italic">intention</span>. Counsel for the appellant was unable to point us to any local authority in support of his point. On the contrary, as we set out at [14] above, it is trite that compensation should, as far as money can accomplish, restore a claimant to the position that he would have been in had the injury not been sustained. In the circumstances and given the appellant’s employment history at the material time of the accident, we are satisfied that allowing the appeal on LFE <span class="font-italic">based solely on the appellant’s intention </span>without more would put him in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a better position than he would otherwise been in</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 We accordingly dismiss the appellant’s claim for LFE at $2,052,000 based on a multiplier of nine years at $19,000 per month with little hesitation. The learned Judge’s award of LFE at $50,000 based on earning a discounted figure of $10,000 a year for five years was a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence and in our view, must stand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For completeness, we briefly address the appellant’s point that the award based on a multiplier of five years from 62 to 67 years of age essentially <span class="font-italic">overlaps </span>with the appellant’s pre-trial loss of earnings (see [33] above). Nevertheless, the intervener agrees with the Judge’s order for LFE  for a sum of $50,000 and we are of the view that there is no need to disturb the Judge’s order on LFE. We recognise that this would <span class="font-italic">in effect </span>grant LFE from the period of about 2021 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the time of the trial) to 2026, when the appellant would be about 72 years old. We find no basis to disturb such award in principle as the applicable multiplier was based on the appellant’s earnings as a <span class="font-italic">Grab driver </span>– for which he may have continued beyond the retirement age of 67 years if his health allowed it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We qualify that our remarks should in no way be interpreted to mean that a claim for LFE should ordinarily go <span class="font-italic">beyond </span>the prevailing retirement age in Singapore to 72 or otherwise endorsing the Stanford Publication mentioned at [24] above. It is axiomatic that each case must be assessed on its own particular facts. As in the case of <span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang</span>, an occupation is not necessarily limited by one’s age, depending on the <span class="font-italic">precise nature </span>of the job for that occupation (see [29] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The quantum of damages for pre-trial loss of earnings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The appellant faces the same difficulty with the multiplicand for his pre-trial loss of earnings. As we set out at [35], the appellant likewise takes the position that the applicable multiplicand is $19,000 a month in respect of his pre-trial loss of earnings. For the same reasons which we elaborate at [42]–[48] above, we reject the appellant’s position in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It will be noted that the appellant (as we elaborated at [35] above), accepts that for a period of 42 months (from the date of the accident to, presumably, end September 2020), the sum of $2,100 representing his average earnings as a Grab driver should be deducted from the multiplicand of $19,000. The evidence before the court in respect of the appellant’s earnings was that for the period 29 May 2019 to 27 November 2019, the appellant was driving for Grab and the parties accept averaged earnings of $2,100 per month. We also note that the significance of the latter date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, September 2020) is that on 8 October 2020, he was certified medically unfit to drive pursuant to the October Doctor’s Memo and therefore could not work as a Grab driver thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The learned Judge awarded the appellant pre-trial loss of earnings based on his earnings as a Grab driver, at $13,020 or $70 per day and limited to the 186 days when he was not driving but seeking medical treatment. The appellant accepted in cross-examination that he was driving as a Grab driver during that period except for those periods he sought medical treatment (as we reproduced at [39] above) and that same approach was echoed somewhat in his submissions before us but, perhaps with more time for reflection, refined to take into account the period from 8 October 2020 onwards after he was medically certified as unfit to drive. With respect, we do not agree that this award for pre-trial loss of earnings was entirely correct on the facts and evidence before the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For a start, it is undisputed that the appellant was on medical leave from 17 February 2017 to 15 June 2020 (as mentioned at [38]). At the hearing before us, counsel for the intervener admitted that it was likewise highly unlikely that the appellant could have possibly driven immediately after the accident (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from the period of 14 to 16 February 2017). We are satisfied that the appellant’s medical certificates constitute objective evidence which must be accorded some weight. This is consistent with appellant’s contention that on some days, he did not feel so well and could not drive a full day or even not at all. As against that, we have evidence that the appellant was driving substantial hours per day <span class="font-italic">from </span><span class="font-italic">29 May 2019 to 27 November 2019</span> and his admission in court as to his driving everyday save for the 186 days’ during which he was seeking medical treatment. From this, the parties accept and we agree with the Judge, that there is sufficient evidence to show that the appellant’s earnings as a Grab driver is about $2,100 per month or $70 per day. However, we allow the appeal as against the <span class="font-italic">multiplier</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as the Judge’s finding below <span class="font-italic">on the </span><span class="font-italic">applicable multiplier</span> is against the weight of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In our view, the starting point is that the pre-trial loss encompasses the periods for which the appellant was on medical leave between 14 February 2017 to 1 February 2021, which total 1,401 days. We note briefly that, although the appellant was readmitted to TTSH only on 17 February 2017, the intervener does not seriously dispute that from 14 to 16 February 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, immediately following the traffic accident),<span class="font-italic"> </span>the appellant would be unable to work as a driver for Grab. As such, in our judgment, it would be more accurate to take those dates into account when determining the appropriate multiplier. On the evidence before us, the appellant was able to and did drive for a period of about 183 days (from 29 May 2019 to 27 November 2019). If we take this into account in calculating the appropriate multiplier, the result is 1,218 days. We pause to note some discrepancy in the evidence below. In the appellant’s AEIC, he states that he has been “driving Grab for five days a week.” However the parties accepted below that the earnings of the appellant as a Grab driver is $70 per day based on $2,100 per month, which means thirty working days per month. These figures of $70 per day and $2,100 per month are not in contention before us. We will therefore not disturb these figures because this is not contradicted by the evidence from Grab for the period referred to above and it would make little difference to the final figure because any decrease in the number of working days per month would result, in view of the parties’ acceptance of the earnings of $2,100 per month, an increase in the multiplicand.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 We further highlight that, despite the appellant’s evidence, we are not satisfied that the intervener has shown that on a balance of probabilities that the appellant had worked on <span class="font-italic">every single day </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whilst he was on medical leave </span><span class="font-italic">except for the days on which he had sought treatment</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 186 days) on the evidence before the court.<span class="font-italic"> </span>For example, it is undisputed that the appellant was certified medically unfit to drive since 8 October 2020 and his TDVL expired shortly thereafter, on 18 November 2020. If the intervener’s contention was that the appellant had worked beyond the period from<span class="font-italic"> </span>29 May 2019 to 27 November<span class="font-italic"> </span>2019 but simply failed to disclose <span class="font-italic">all </span>of Grab’s weekly statements in his possession, then it was for the intervener to have sought specific discovery for the same and if that was not forthcoming from the appellant, it could subpoena Grab for its records. Counsel for the intervener candidly admitted that neither was done in the proceedings below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 At the hearing before us, counsel for the intervener also admitted that of the four days on which the intervener had conducted a discreet surveillance on the appellant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 29 July 2019, 31 July 2019, 13 August 2019, 20 August 2019), the appellant was seen to be driving <span class="font-italic">only on the </span><span class="font-italic">first two days of surveillance </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but not the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">latter two</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In our judgment, such evidence of the appellant working on certain days (but not all) only buttresses our analysis for our finding. We also take into the account the fact that the appellant was certified medically unfit to drive on 8 October 2020 and his medical certificates ended on 6 April 2021. Accordingly, we award pre-trial loss of earnings of $85,260 based on a multiplier of 1,218 days and a multiplicand of $70 per day.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on loss of earnings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 From the foregoing, we dismiss the appeal against the LFE but allow the appeal against pre-trial loss of earnings in part. The appellant is thus entitled to $50,000 for LFE as the Judge decided below and $85,260 for the pre-trial loss of earnings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Pain and suffering for psychiatric conditions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments below and the Judge’s finding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As we noted at [10] above, the appellant claimed damages of $65,000 for psychiatric conditions. The appellant submitted that he suffers from: (i) MDD, (ii) TRD and (iii) CP. The intervener argued that “notwithstanding the [appellant’s] litany of complaints such as headaches, fatigue and depression, he is fully independent in his activities of daily living and he manages his pain through medication”, which was evident from the fact that he was able to work as a Grab driver (Judgment at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The intervener also referred to Charlene Chee <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (the “Guidelines”) for the quantum of awards in cases of general psychiatric disorders for claims for depressions, avoidant phobias, anxiety attacks etc (Judgment at [80]). The Judge agreed with the intervener that the appellant’s “depression is only moderately severe” but rejected the appellant’s figure of $65,000 and the intervener’s figure of $15,000 (Judgment at [81]). We note that the typical range for quantum awarded for “moderately severe” general psychiatric disorders is $8,000–$25,000 whereas the typical range for “severe” general psychiatric disorders is $25,000–$55,000 under the Guidelines (Judgment at [80]). Although the Judge made no reference to the appellant’s claim for CP, the Judge held that “a more appropriate figure would be $45,000” – which is well beyond the upper limit for a “moderately severe” general psychiatric disorder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Regarding TRD in particular, the Judge found that “it is unlikely that the [appellant] suffers from TRD” as only one doctor, Dr Chan Lai Gwen (“Dr Chan”), has confirmed the same (Judgment at [67]) and Dr Chan based her assessment of the appellant’s intolerance to two drugs based on what the appellant had told her. In that sense, the Judge found that no “clinical trials/tests were conducted to determine if the [appellant] has TRD” (Judgment at [68]). The Judge instead preferred the opinion of another doctor, Dr Lim Yun Chun (“Dr Lim”), who was of the opinion that it was premature to conclude whether the plaintiff has TRD (Judgment at [66] and [69]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Parties disagree whether the appellant suffers from TRD. The appellant submits that the Judge “erred in preferring Dr Lim’s opinion because it is against the weight of the evidence” and instead, “Dr Chan’s testimony that [the appellant] suffers from TRD should have been preferred” for several reasons:

Given Dr Lim’s admission that he had only one short interview with the appellant, Dr Lim would not be in the position to reliably postulate that the basis upon which Dr Chan made her diagnosis was because the appellant did not want to take the previously prescribed antidepressants without first attempting to complete trials for various antidepressants (of the appropriate dosage and duration). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully disagree with the learned Judge that Dr Lim’s opinion is to be preferred over Dr Chan’s.

In that regard, the Judge ultimately awarded the appellant with two years’ worth of rTMS partly “in deference to the views of [his] doctors” (Judgment at [89]).

</div> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $25,000–$55,000). One relevant description for “severe” cases is that “[d]espite treatment, the prognosis remains very poor as the person is unlikely to be able to return to employment permanently or even take charge of his daily affairs”. In contrast, the typical range for “moderately severe” is $8,000–$25,000 where the “prognosis will be much more optimistic” than in the “severe” cases and the person is “able to perform the activities of daily life independently”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In our judgment, the learned Judge was correct to find that the appellant’s general psychiatric disorder can be described as only “moderately severe”. Even if the appellant has TRD, it is undisputed that he is able to conduct the activities of daily life independently. Although the Judge may not have <span class="font-italic">expressly </span>mentioned CP, we are satisfied that such CP is adequately accounted for in the awarded sum of $45,000. We agree with the intervener’s submission that the sum awarded of $45,000, which would be in between the typical range for “severe” cases and an uplift from the typical range for “moderate” cases appropriately recognises the level of the appellant’s pain and suffering. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Accordingly, the Judge cannot be said to have made a “wholly erroneous estimate of the damages” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Heng</span> at [7]). In our view, $45,000 sufficiently compensates for the appellant’s MDD, TRD and CP and we dismiss the appellant’s appeal on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">FME and future transport expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments below and the Judge’s finding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Given that the Judge had found the appellant did not suffer from TRD, the Judge thus remarked that “the rTMS procedure would appear to be unnecessary”. However, the intervener accepted two courses of rTMS a year (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for a sum of $4,560) instead of three courses a year as claimed by the appellant (Judgment at [87]). As such, the Judge awarded the appellant “two years’ worth of rTMS” for a sum of $13,680 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $6,840 for three courses per year multiplied by two years) (Judgment at [89]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As regards the appellant’s claim for lifelong medication, the Judge found that the appellant would be “doing himself a great disservice – if he continues with his cocktail of drugs for the rest of his natural life”. In that regard, the appellant should be “detoxified from opiate-based drugs and if his pain cannot be controlled or eased with conventional drugs, then alternatives such as TCM should be explored” (Judgment at [90]). The Judge expressed that the appellant should not be deprived of medication “in the short term but is loath to award him lifelong medication that would probably do him more harm than good” (Judgment at [91]). The Judge thus reduced the period for which the appellant is awarded medication from 12 years to five years only (Judgment at [92]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The appellant appeals against the Judge’s decision against only the multiplier (and not the multiplicand) for pharmacotherapy, consultations with TTSH psychiatry ($144.00 per year) and rTMS ($6,840.00 per year).

While we understand the Judge’s concern that “lifelong medication” may do the appellant “more harm than good”, we respectfully disagree that it was for the Judge to make such a finding on the long-term effect of the appellant’s prescribed medications in the circumstances – this being <span class="font-italic">a medical </span><span class="font-italic">question for the appellant’s doctors to determine</span>. Rather, the overarching guiding principle for the award of damages in the present case is to restore the appellant into the position that he would have been in, as far as possible, if not for the accident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Having considered the parties’ submissions, we respectfully disagree with the Judge in respect of the applicable multiplier for rTMS. Given our preference for Dr Chan’s evidence that the appellant does indeed suffer from TRD, we see no reason to reject Dr Chan’s evidence that the rTMS treatment would be lifelong. We agree that the appropriate multiplier for rTMS treatment should be 12 years as submitted by the appellant, which is based on the male life expectancy of 84.3 years according to the Ministry of Health’s data on Population and Vital Statistics 2018 (Judgment at [83]) and taking a discount of about 1/3.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Having considered the appellant’s alternative position, we are satisfied that there is no need to disturb the Judge’s multiplier of five years for pharmacotherapy. To be clear, we disagree with the Judge’s holding that the appellant is not entitled to <span class="font-italic">lifelong </span>pharmacotherapy as “that would probably do him more harm than good” (as mentioned at [76] above) and our judgment should not be read as such. It bears emphasising that the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy for a claimant is ultimately a <span class="font-italic">medical decision</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for which judges lack the medical expertise to decide. Rather, we accept the Judge’s multiplier of five years for a wholly different reason – that such pharmacotherapy would likely not be lifelong in view of the lifelong rTMS treatment. As parties agree that pharmacotherapy is meant to be a short-term solution, there is no need to further increase the multiplier from five years to six years. The appellant’s appeal to increase the quantum of damages for pharmacotherapy is accordingly dismissed. The Judge’s award totalling $12,026 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $2,405.20 per year as mentioned at [77], multiplied by five years) for the appellant’s pharmacotherapy stands.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other consequential adjustments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Consequently, consultations with TTSH Psychiatry would likely need to continue for that duration of rTMS treatment and the same multiplier should be adopted as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In respect of psychiatric hospitalisation, the Judge is correct to have omitted it from the award. This is because the appellant has not proved the <span class="font-italic">reasonableness </span>of such expenditure on a <span class="font-italic">yearly</span> basis, especially if the appellant and the appellant’s doctor, Dr Chan, are hopeful that rTMS would be effective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Finally, as the appellant would require lifelong treatment and consultation, we consequently award future transport expenses on a lifetime basis (instead of a five-year basis).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on FME and future transport expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In summary, we:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) dismiss the appeal against the quantum of damages awarded for pharmacotherapy (totalling $12,026, being $2,405.20 per year for five years);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) allow the appeal to increase the multiplier for rTMS (totalling $82,080.00), consultations with TTSH Psychiatry (totalling $1,728.00) and future transport expenses to 12 years (totalling $2,500); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) dismiss the appeal against the dismissal of the claim for psychiatric hospitalisation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Damage to car</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The appellant made a claim for the loss of his car at $37,959. The learned Judge dismissed the claim on the ground that the intervener is only liable to the appellant for claims for bodily injury. With respect, this is not correct. The appellant, as plaintiff, sued the respondent, as the tortfeasor, for damage caused to his car. There can be no doubt that the respondent is fully liable for the accident, interlocutory judgment has been entered on that basis and it follows that the respondent must be liable to the appellant for damage caused to his car as a result of the accident. Judgment is entered against <span class="font-italic">the respondent/defendant</span>, not the intervener, even for those items of loss and damage caused by the personal injuries suffered by the appellant. The appellant did not sue the intervener. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89  The intervener becomes liable to pay the appellant only because s 4 read with ss 7 and 9 of the MVTPR Act provides that if the respondent fails to pay the appellant the loss and damage for personal injury as a result of the road accident, then notwithstanding the fact that the intervener is entitled to repudiate liability to indemnify the respondent, its insured, under the motor vehicle policy, the intervener has to satisfy the judgment provided certain conditions under s 9 of the MVTPR Act are met (this is not in issue here). The MVTPR Act then enables the insurer to seek an indemnity from the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In this case, there was evidence that the appellant ’s car was a constructive total loss. GTG Appraiser Services LLP (“GTG”) noted, in its Inspection Report dated 9 October 2017, that the appellant’s car sustained bad damage to the rear and front portions of the car. There were photographs to evidence the damage. GTG’s licensed appraiser stated that the market value of the car was $79,800 at the time of the accident and the repairer’s estimate to repair the car was $150,000. The car was therefore a constructive total loss and its salvage value was $46,300. The appellant was subsequently informed that the salvage value was $42,941 as stated in a sale and purchase agreement for the wreck and after deducting a service charge of $1,100, the appellant received $41,841. The appellant’s loss was therefore $37,959 ($79,800, less $41,841). This evidence and figures were, for obvious reasons, not challenged below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 We therefore allow the appeal on this item and enter judgment for the appellant for $37,959 in respect of his loss of his car as a result of the respondent’s negligence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Loss of use of the car</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The appellant’s claim for loss of use for 7 months from 14 February 2017 to the date of inspection of his car on 11 September 2017 was also dismissed by the learned trial judge on the same ground, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the intervener was “not liable” for the property damage. With respect, this is wrong for the same reason in respect of the damage to the car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 We have not been told why it took so long for the car to be inspected. There is no evidence as to who caused this delay. As it is the appellant who is making the claim, it is incumbent on him to prove why it took so long to justify a loss of use claim of 7 months. The appellant is entitled to a reasonable period for loss of use of his car. If we take into account the immediate aftermath of the accident and the appellant’s injuries, we take the view that the appellant should have pushed for resolution of inspection and appraisal and therefore decided whether he wished to go into the second-hand market to purchase an equivalent used car. We would therefore award the appellant loss of use for 60 days. This is the equivalent of about two months and we understand this consistent with the practice of the State Courts to have a maximum period of two months barring any exceptional facts that militate a longer period. The appellant’s car was a Category B car (above 1,600 cc) being a Volvo S60 with a two-litre engine and two-wheel drive. The State Courts again peg the loss of use of Category B cars at between $100 to $120 per day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In our view, it would be fair to enter judgment in favour of the appellant against the respondent for $6,600 being 60 days at $110 per day in respect of his claim for loss of use of his car as a result of the accident.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs and disbursements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The appellant appeals against the Judge’s order of costs at $45,000 and disbursements of $8,500 based on the appellant’s Schedule of Costs. The intervener, however, agrees that given the damages awarded and that the proceedings at the court below was limited to <span class="font-italic">only </span>the assessment of damages which took place over three and a half days, the Judge’s award in costs and disbursements are fair.

</div> In response, the appellant submits that a total of $158,000 in costs and $42,981.95 in disbursements would be “fairly commensurate with the work done considering the appeal and quantum submitted in this matter”.

At the time of the assessment of damages, the previous Appendix G was applicable. It does counsel no credit when extravagant claims for costs are put forward which can bear no reference to the guidelines in Appendix G. There is <span class="font-italic">no</span> question of this being a very difficult case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 We have taken note of the issues upon which the appellant succeeded below and upon which he failed to prevail. The largest quantum related to his LFE and pre-trial loss of earnings. On both these items, he failed. Considerable time was spent on these issues. Considerable medical evidence was also called. Bearing all the facts of this case, the course of the assessment of damages below, and the modest success on appeal, we see no reason to disturb the Judge’s exercise of discretion.
