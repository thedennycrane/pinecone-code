<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
appeal before me raised an interesting question of law: does a party
in an action in the District Court require leave to appeal to the
High Court if the subject-matter of the appeal is limited solely
to the issue of costs, and the amount of costs in question does
not exceed $50,000?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This
question arose because an appeal from a decision of the District Court
lies as of right (that is, leave is not required) under s 21(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature
Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) if the amount in dispute or
the value of the subject-matter at the hearing before that District
Court exceeds $50,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As
far as I am aware, there is no clear authority on this point. I therefore
provide the written grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
appeal before me was against costs orders awarded to the Respondent
in two interlocutory applications arising from District Court Suit
No 1366 of 2012 (“the DC Suit”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
first was the Respondent’s application to strike out the appellant’s
Statement of Claim (“the striking out application”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
second was the Appellant’s application to amend its Statement of
Claim (“the amendment application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both applications were heard in the State Courts at first
instance by a Deputy Registrar in Chambers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
Respondent succeeded in both applications, and costs were awarded
to him at $10,000 (excluding disbursements) for the striking out application,
and $1,000 (excluding disbursements) for the amendment application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Appellant chose not to appeal the substantive aspects of the Deputy
Registrar’s decision in relation to both applications. This was notwithstanding
that the effect of the Deputy Registrar’s decision was that the
Appellant’s claim against the Respondent was struck out. Instead,
the Appellant only appealed the costs orders made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
appeal was heard by a District Judge in Chambers on 30 July 2014.
On the same day, the District Judge allowed the Appellant’s appeal and
reduced the costs awarded against the Appellant. The District Judge ordered
that costs be fixed at $3,500 (including disbursements) for the striking
out application, and $1,000 (including disbursements) for the amendment
application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
Appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the District Judge and
sought to further reduce the costs awarded against it by appealing
the matter to the High Court Judge in Chambers, and accordingly
filed a Notice of Appeal to the High Court on 11 August 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Appellant asked that the costs of the striking out application be reduced
from $3,500 to $1,000 (including disbursements) and that the costs of
the amendment application be reduced from $1,000 to $200 (including disbursements).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I
heard the appeal on 25 September 2014. As a preliminary issue, the Respondent
submitted that there was a defect in the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal
in that the Appellant was required to, but had not, obtained leave
to appeal to the High Court. On that basis, the appeal should be
dismissed without a hearing on the substantive merits, that is,
the appeal against the District Judge’s decision (see [7] above).
The Appellant submitted that it did not require leave to appeal
to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After
hearing submissions by the parties, I was satisfied that the Appellant
required leave to appeal. Leave not having been obtained, I held that
the appeal was not properly before me. I therefore dismissed the
appeal with costs to the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before
I address the preliminary issue proper, I set out the relevant statutory
provisions concerning the regime for appeals from a District Judge
in Chambers to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The regime for appeals from
the District Judge in Chambers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As
a starting point, civil appeals from the District Court to the High Court
are dealt with under s 47 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007
Rev Ed) (“SCA”). Section 47 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>General
provision relating to civil appeals</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>47.</b> Subject to the provisions
of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322) relating to civil
appeals from the State Courts to the High Court, Rules of Court
shall regulate and prescribe the procedure on appeals from a District Court
exercising civil jurisdiction to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Section
47 of the SCA is subject to the SCJA. The SCJA in turn sets out
specific rules concerning appeals from the District Court to the
High Court which can be taken up as of right, appeals which require
leave, and matters for which there is no right of appeal at all:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Appeals
from District and Magistrates’ Courts</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>21.</b>—(1) Subject to the provisions
of this Act and any other written law, an appeal shall lie to the
High Court from a decision of a District Court or Magistrate’s Court —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    in any case where <b>the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter</b>,
at the hearing before that District Court or Magistrate’s Court
(excluding interest and costs) <b>exceeds $50,000</b> or such
other amount as may be specified by an order made under subsection (3);
or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    with
the leave of that District Court or Magistrate’s Court or the High
Court, in any other case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2B)  No
appeal shall be brought to the High Court in any case where a District
Court or Magistrate’s Court makes an order specified in the Third Schedule,
except in such circumstances as may be specified in that Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
procedure for bringing an appeal from the District Judge in Chambers
to the High Court in Chambers is in turn set out in O 55C rr 1 and
2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed), which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Appeals
from decisions of District Judges or Magistrates in Chambers (O. 55C,
r. 1)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>1.</b>—(1) Subject to section 21(2B)
of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322), an appeal shall
lie to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers from —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    any judgment, order or
decision of a District Judge in Chambers (not given or made in his
capacity as the Registrar), including a judgment given, or an order
or a decision made, on appeal from the Registrar; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    any
judgment, order or decision of a Magistrate in Chambers (not given
or made in his capacity as the Registrar).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Leave
to appeal (O. 55C, r. 2)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>2.</b>—(1) A party applying for
leave under section 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
(Cap. 322) to appeal against any judgment, order or decision of
a District Judge or Magistrate in Chambers (not given or made in his
capacity as the Registrar), must file his application —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    to the District Judge
or Magistrate in Chambers within 7 days from the date of the judgment,
order or decision; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    in
the event that leave is refused by the District Judge or Magistrate,
to the High Court within 7 days from the date of the refusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    A
party who has obtained leave to appeal under this Rule shall file
and serve the notice of appeal within 14 days from the date on which
such leave was given.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the appeal was properly
before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On
the basis of the foregoing, the question of whether leave was required
for the Appellant to appeal to the High Court depended on whether
the case fell within s 21(1)(<em>a</em>)
(leave not required) or s 21(1)(<em>b</em>) (leave
required) of the SCJA. The main point of contention between the parties
was whether “the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter”
in this case crossed the monetary threshold of $50,000, upon which an
appeal to the High Court would lie as of right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before
I set out the parties’ respective arguments on this, I preface this by
highlighting that their submissions were not entirely focused on
the key aspect in the appeal, that is, that the subject-matter of
the appeal related <em>only</em> to the issue
of costs and how that would affect the determination of “the amount
in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter” for the purposes of
s 21(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
Appellant submitted that “the amount in dispute, or the value of the
subject-matter” was the value of the Appellant’s substantive claim, which
was $167,620.15, being the damages claimed by the Appellant against the
Respondent for the negligence of subcontractors who had allegedly caused
a fire to break out during construction works (the “Appellant’s substantive
claim”). This exceeded the monetary threshold of $50,000 under s
21(1)(<em>a</em>) and leave was therefore
not required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In
support of its submission, the appellant sought to rely on the High Court
decision in <em>Ong Wah Chuan v Seow Hwa Chuan</em> [2011]
3 SLR 1150, where the portions of the parliamentary debates concerning
the 2010 amendments to s 21 of the SCJA (see <em>Singapore
Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (18 October 2010)
vol 87 at col 1371) were cited by the court (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should also be observed that the new
s 34(2)(<em>a</em>) SCJA has similarly had
the phrase “at the trial” deleted and the phrase “at the hearing”
substituted therefor. Sections 21(1)(<em>a</em>)
and 34(2)(<em>a</em>) are now uniform in
so far as the determination of the “amount in dispute” is concerned.
At the second reading of the relevant amendment bill (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (18
October 2010) vol 87 at col 1371), the Senior Minister of State
for Law explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Currently, a party does not require leave
of court to file an appeal to the High Court or the Court of Appeal,
as the case may be, if the ‘amount in dispute or value of the subject-matter’
exceeds $50,000 for appeals to the High Court; or $250,000 for appeals
to the Court of Appeal. Clauses 4(<em>a</em>)
and 9(<em>c</em>) amend section 21 and section
34(2)(<em>a</em>) to clarify that the computation
of this monetary threshold does not include interest or costs ordered
by the court. The amendment also puts it beyond doubt that the respective
monetary thresholds of the High Court and Court of Appeal is computed
by reference to the original amount claimed in the lower court and
not the judgment sum awarded by the court, or the amount in dispute
on appeal. This is consistent with recent Court of Appeal decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
Appellant submitted that the above passage supported his position
for two reasons. First, the parliamentary debates made clear that the
monetary threshold is calculated by reference to the “original amount claimed
in the lower court”. Second, the parliamentary debates confirm what
is stated in s 21(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SCJA,
that is, interest or costs ordered by the court are not included
in the calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
Respondent’s submission, on the other hand, was that “the amount
in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter” in this case was
the quantum of the costs orders (that is, $11,000 in total). The
total costs ordered was lower than the monetary threshold of $50,000
under s 21(1)(<em>a</em>), and leave to appeal
was therefore required pursuant to s 21(1)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
Respondent relied principally on the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Fong Khim Ling </em><em>v
Tan Teck Ann</em> [2014] 2 SLR 659 (“<em>Fong
Khim Ling</em>”). The court held (at [21] and [26]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    …
The operative phrase in both ss 21(1)(<em>a</em>)
and 34(2)(<em>a</em>) is now “the amount
in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter, at the hearing before [the
lower court]”, and Parliament intended that this amount should be
the original amount claimed in the lower court, in accordance with
the <em>Tan Chiang Brother’s Marble</em> line
of Court of Appeal authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    …
[T]he plain words “amount in dispute, or value of the subject-matter”
are nevertheless perfectly capable of meaning the sum in issue between
the parties, <em>ie</em>, the sum of the
claim which is before the lower court. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
Respondent argued that the lower court in this instance referred to
the District Judge, and since the only issue before the District
Judge concerned the quantum of costs awarded for the striking out
application and the amendment application, the amount awarded in
the costs orders ($11,000) should be “the amount in dispute, or
the value of the subject-matter” for the purposes of s 21(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     According
to the Respondent, the determination of “the amount in dispute,
or the value of the subject-matter” ought not to refer back to the proceedings
before the Deputy Registrar. Implicit in this submission is the acknowledgment
that if the determination of the amount in dispute or the value
of the subject-matter ought to refer to the proceedings before the Deputy
Registrar, the amount would be $167,620.15 based on the Appellant’s
substantive claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
Respondent also submitted that because the substantive order made
by the Deputy Registrar in relation to the striking out application
was not appealed to the District Judge, the Appellant’s substantive
claim no longer exists. Therefore, it could not be said that the
“amount in dispute” concerned the Appellant’s substantive claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Despite
the parties’ attempts at relying on what they perceived as the relevant
authorities, I was not sure that the authorities were directly relevant
to the present issue. During the hearing, I asked parties if they knew
of any authority which supported their respective positions on how “the
amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter” should be computed
when the subject-matter of the appeal related <em>only</em> to
costs order(s)<em>.</em> Both parties submitted
that there were none, and admitted that the authorities they cited
were not entirely on point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">How should the monetary threshold
for an appeal solely on costs be calculated for the purposes of
s 21(1)(a) of the SCJA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It
was not in dispute that the Appellant did not succeed in both applications
heard before the Deputy Registrar. The Appellant chose not to appeal
against the substantive outcomes of the applications, and only appealed
the costs orders made. The only live issue thereafter related to
the costs orders made by the Deputy Registrar, and subsequently,
the District Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In
my view, this was significant, and brought to the fore the crux
of this appeal. As a matter of principle, it would not be correct
to conflate the claim made in the DC Suit with the costs orders
that resulted from the applications made in the DC Suit. It is trite
law that costs orders are not awarded to vindicate the rights of
parties as part of the underlying claim in an action, but are instead
a form of compensation for the successful party in litigation for
his legal expenses incurred (see <em>Then Khek
Koon and another v Arjun Permanand </em><em>Samtani
and another and other suits</em> [2014] 1 SLR 245 (at [155]–[158]);
and <em>Ng Eng Ghee and Others v Mamata </em><em>Kapildev Dave and Others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd,
intervener)</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 155 (at [6]–[7])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Therefore,
where the subject-matter in dispute concerns only costs orders made
in the lower court, the value of the main claim should, in my view,
be irrelevant. In the present case, since the only matter that was
on appeal from the District Court concerned the costs orders made,
it follows as a matter of logic that “the amount in dispute, or
the value of the subject-matter” must be the amount of costs ordered
and <em>not</em> the amount claimed in the
DC Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I
found indirect support for this view from the parallel provision
in the SCJA concerning appeals from the High Court to the Court
of Appeal at s 34(2)(<em>b</em>) which provides
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Except
with the leave of a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court
of Appeal in any of the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    where
the <b>only</b> issue in the appeal relates
to costs or fees for hearing dates;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Section
34(2)(<em>b</em>) suggests that costs orders
arising from a claim are conceptually distinct from the claim, and
more importantly, can exist independently of the claim. This is
especially so where the <em>only</em> issue
on appeal relates to costs, as was the situation in the present
case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Understood
in this light, the Appellant’s submissions were, accordingly, mistaken.
The costs orders were conceptually independent of the Appellant’s
substantive claim in the DC Suit, and effectively took a life of
their own when that was the <em>only</em> issue
in dispute. Since the only issue in dispute between the parties
related to the costs orders that were appealed, it would be incongruous
to take the amount claimed in the DC Suit as being “the amount in
dispute, or the value of the subject-matter in [the lower court]”.
Instead, in considering whether the monetary threshold requirement
in s 21(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SCJA had been
satisfied, the amount of costs ordered is the relevant amount as
that is what the parties are truly disputing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
Appellant’s other argument that relies on the phrase “excluding interest
and costs” contained in s 21(1)(<em>a</em>)
(see [20] above), was also misconceived. Although not expressly
mentioned in the parliamentary debates, the inclusion of the phrase
“excluding interest and costs” was most likely a result of the recommendation
of the <em>Report of the Law Reform Committee on
the Rationalisation of Legislation Relating to Leave to Appeal</em> (October
2008), prepared by the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy
of Law chaired by Judith Prakash J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
basis for the recommendation was to give legislative effect to the High
Court decision of <em>Abdul Rahman bin Sharif v
Abdul Salim bin Syed</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 138, where Tay Yong
Kwang JC (as he then was) held (at [24]–[25]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    In
my opinion, the “amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter”
in s 21 does not encompass the non-contractual interest and costs elements
of a claim for a contractual amount or for damages. Interest would usually
be awarded if a plaintiff is successful in his action and costs
would, in the great majority of cases, follow the event. Nevertheless,
they remain discretionary and, if awarded, may fluctuate in amount
according to the period for which interest is given and depending
on the discretion of the trial judge or the Registrar taxing the
costs where the amount of costs is concerned. If interest and costs
are to be included in computing the “amount in dispute or the value
of the subject matter” in s 21, then it follows that they ought
to be taken into consideration also when construing jurisdictional provisions
such as s 20(1) Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1999 Ed) …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Doing so would entail a plaintiff having
to calculate the amount of interest and estimate the costs at the
time of commencement of action to see whether the sum of the claim,
interest and costs exceeds the monetary jurisdictional limit. With
interest and costs increasing as the days pass, an action which
was within the district court or the magistrates’ court limit when
commenced could well breach the respective limits by the time the
action is ready for trial, perhaps even during the course of the
trial! Similarly, a matter which was within the District Court’s
jurisdiction when heard by the Registrar there could be beyond that
jurisdiction by the time an appeal goes before the district judge
in chambers. The action would then have to be transferred to the
High Court for hearing. It does not seem sensible to me to inject
such uncertainties into something so fundamental as the court’s
jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The
reasoning for reading s 21 Supreme Court of Judicature Act as excluding
interest and costs is even stronger in the case of costs. If costs
are ordered to be taxed at the end of a trial, which is frequently
the case, a party appealing to the High Court will not know whether
he can appeal as of right or only with leave of court in a case
where the amount of damages awarded was less than $50,000. The answer
will only be known after taxation and, if there is an application
for review, only after review by the Registrar and the district
judge in chambers. This unhappy and confusing state of affairs does not
even arise if we exclude costs from consideration when deciding
whether a matter is appealable as of right under s 21 Supreme Court
of Judicature Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Therefore,
it was clear that the exclusion of interest and costs from the calculation
of “the amount in dispute, or value of the subject-matter” was meant
to ensure that uncertainty and confusion would not be introduced
in determining questions of jurisdiction. That, however, does not
preclude “the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter”
from being calculated based on the amount of costs ordered where
that is the only issue in dispute. Where “the amount in dispute,
or the value of the subject-matter” is calculated based on the amount
of costs ordered, the exclusion of interest and costs simply means
that any subsequent costs awarded by the court as a result of the
parties’ dispute on the earlier costs orders will be excluded from
the calculation of “the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter”
for the purposes of s 21(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For
completeness, I have two further observations in relation to the submissions
made by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As
regards the Respondent’s first submission (see above at [23]–[24]), his
approach in interpreting the phrase “at the hearing before [the
lower court]” as meaning the hearing before the District Judge (and
not the hearing before the Deputy Registrar) was incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As
explained by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in <em>Herbs
and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd</em> [1990]
2 SLR(R) 685 at [11], the Deputy Registrar derives jurisdiction
and power to hear matters through the District Judge, and therefore
the District Judge when hearing “appeals” from the Deputy Registrar
is merely exercising a form of confirmatory jurisdiction. Therefore,
the hearings before the Deputy Registrar and the District Judge
are effectively one hearing (see also <em>Fong Khim
Ling</em> at [29]). To be clear, this is immaterial to the
present case for the reasons stated earlier. The “amount in dispute,
or the value of the subject-matter” in the present case should be
calculated solely on the amount of the costs orders in dispute and
the amount of the Appellant's substantive claim in the DC Suit has
no bearing on that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
Respondent’s second submission, that the Appellant’s substantive
claim in the DC Suit no longer exists once the striking out application
was not appealed, and therefore “the amount in dispute” could not
be the sum claimed, was not incorrect, but irrelevant. Based on
my earlier reasoning, whether the DC Suit was fully extinguished,
or still exists (for example, if only part of the Statement of Claim
was struck out) is, in my view, immaterial. What was material to
my decision was that the <em>subject-matter of
the appeal</em> related only to the costs orders made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Should leave have been sought?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Since
the amount of costs ordered by the Deputy Registrar in the total amount
of $11,000 was the sole matter in issue between the parties in the District
Court, that was, in my view, “the amount in dispute, or the value
of the subject-matter” for the purposes of ascertaining whether
the monetary threshold requirement under s 21(1)(<em>a</em>)
of the SCJA was satisfied. This requirement not being met, leave
to appeal was therefore required pursuant to s 21(1)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
Appellant should therefore have obtained leave from the District Judge
within seven days from the date of the order made on 30 July 2014 (see
O 55C r 2 cited at [15] above). It did not do so. Neither did the Appellant
seek leave from the High Court. Therefore, I found that the Notice
to Appeal filed on 11 August 2014 was defective, and consequently, the
appeal was not properly before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For
the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal with costs to the Respondent
at $1,000 (including disbursements).</p>
