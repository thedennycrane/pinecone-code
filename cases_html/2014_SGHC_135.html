        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    District Judge (see <em>PP v Chua Boon Chye</em> [2013]
                    SGDC 441 (“<em>Chua</em>”)). The appellant
                    was convicted on 13 November 2013 on a charge of dishonestly receiving
                    stolen property, namely, 105 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil, on 29 October
                    2007, pursuant to s 411 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The fuel
                    was valued at S$69,106.70. On 19 November 2012, the appellant claimed trial to
                    the charge. He was sentenced on 22 November 2013 to 8 months’
                    imprisonment. The appellant appealed against both the conviction and
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant made 8 arguments in his appeal
                    against conviction, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     the charge had not been made out at
                        the close of the prosecution’s case;</p>

                        evidence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        evidence of the prosecution’s fifth witness, Hussein Ahmad bin Abdul
                        Satar (“Hussein”) should not have been taken into
                        account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        fact that the fuel in the charge was off-spec fuel was not

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     there were contradictions in the evidence of critical prosecution
                        witnesses;</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>He also submitted that
                        the sentence of 8 months was manifestly excessive. I will first set out the
                        background facts of the case briefly, before considering each argument.
                        There are three aspects of the background facts that are important: the
                        appellant’s role, the operations at the terminal, and the nature of
                        the fuel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       First, the appellant’s role. The appellant
                    was the director and general manager of Aegean Bunkering (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“AB”). AB was a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegean Marine
                    Petroleum SA (“AM”), incorporated in Liberia. The directors of AM
                    were Greek nationals. AM was in turn wholly owned by Aegean Marine Petroleum
                    Network Inc (“AMPN”), which was incorporated in New York. AB was
                    in the business of purchasing marine fuel oil (“MFO”). Once AB
                    makes the purchase, according to the appellant, it would refer the operational
                    aspects of delivery to a related company, Aegean Breeze Shipping Pte Ltd
                    (“ABS”). Ioannis Sgouras (“Ioannis”), a defence
                    witness, was the director of ABS. ABS was wholly owned by Aegean Shipholdings
                    Inc, which was in turn wholly owned by AMPN. According to the appellant, ABS was
                    part of the “operational arm” of AMPN, whereas AB and AM were part
                    of the “trading arm”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Second, the operations at the terminal. Shanker
                    s/o Balasubramaniam (“Shanker”) was the Operations Executive at
                    the Chevron Singapore Pte Ltd Terminal, a facility at No 210 Jalan Buroh
                    (“the Terminal”). As part of his role, which included taking on
                    the duty of shift superintendent, he would track the movement of fuel at the
                    Terminal. The Terminal had approximately 45 tanks which stored different
                    grades of fuel, and some of these tanks were leased to companies such as
                    Marubeni International Petroleum (S) Pte Ltd (“Marubeni”) and
                    Petrobras Singapore Pte Ltd (“Petrobras”). In the course of
                    operations, minor discrepancies in tank readings could arise, which lead to
                    “gains” and “losses” in fuel. When fuel is pumped
                    into vessels, for instance, there may be a variance between the reading on the
                    shore tank and the reading on the vessel. The tolerance level for this variance
                    is 0.5%. Any amount constituting gains (within this 0.5%) is retained at the
                    Terminal. Shanker, as shift superintendent, was the custodian of these
                    discrepancies. At the end of each shift, he had to record them in a log book and
                    report to his superior, Tan Poo Lee (the prosecution’s eighth
                    witness).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Shanker conspired with two petroleum surveyors,
                    Remy bin Khaizan (the prosecution’s second witness) (“Remy”)
                    and Viknasvaran s/o Kumarasamy (the prosecution’s third witness)
                    (“Viknasvaran”) to siphon off and sell the gains of fuel at the
                    Terminal. As petroleum surveyors, Remy and Viknasvaran had to take measurements
                    of the fuel in a barge before and after loading. However, in siphoning off fuel,
                    their roles were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Shanker identified the gains of fuel
                        which had not been reported to Chevron.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Shanker then informed Remy both of the quantity
                        of gains available, and of vessels that were arriving at the Terminal for
                        loading.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Remy
                        then negotiated with the vessel’s owner or representative (such as the
                        appellant) for the sale of the illicit fuel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     To conceal their wrongful acts either Remy or
                        Viknasvaran boarded the vessels and took measurements of the fuel before and
                        after loading. The figures were adjusted such that the loading of the excess
                        fuel would not be detected (for instance, by inflating the pre-loading
                        figure).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     When
                        the loading was completed, Shanker prepared the Certificate of Quantity
                        – which also excluded the quantity of the excess
                    fuel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     The payments
                        for the excess fuel were made in Singapore dollars, in cash, and without any
                        receipt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       They carried out their plan between 28 and 29
                    October 2007, this plan was set in motion. Shanker was on duty as shift
                    superintendent on 29 October 2007. He identified approximately 105 metric tonnes
                    of fuel (gains) to sell and informed Remy accordingly. He also informed Remy
                    that the MV Milos, a barge operated by ABS, was due at the Terminal to load 2500
                    metric tonnes of MFO of 380CST grade, purchased from Marubeni on the night of 29
                    October 2007. The 2500 metric tonnes, priced at US$439.40 per metric tonne, came
                    up to US$1,100,827. Remy approached a broker, Hussein Ahmad bin Abdul Satar (the
                    prosecution’s fifth witness) (“Hussein”), to sell the excess
                    fuel. Hussein approached the appellant offering this excess fuel. The appellant
                    understood that the fuel came from the “black market” (according
                    to his statement). They agreed on a price of S$180 per metric tonne for the 105
                    metric tonnes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 29 October 2007, the MV Milos berthed at the
                    Terminal. The 105 metric tonnes were loaded onto the barge. Subsequently,
                    the appellant arranged to meet Hussein at a hawker centre to make payment of
                    S$18,900 from AB’s petty cash account. Shanker, Remy, Viknasvaran and
                    Hussein were all convicted of offences of criminal breach of trust in respect of
                    the fuel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The third aspect is the nature of MFO, or fuel.
                    MFO is graded according to viscosity. The unit of viscosity used is the
                    centistoke (“CST”). The three main types of MFO in the industry
                    are 180CST, 380CST and 500CST. 180CST is the most expensive, whereas 500CST is
                    the cheapest. Each of these grades of fuel has to comply with certain quality
                    standards. Fuel that does not is generally known as off-specification, or
                    “off-spec”. Off-spec fuel generally fetches a lower price.
                    Off-spec fuel, however, does not refer to a specific grade of fuel. Rather, it
                    is a residual category that encompasses any fuel that does not meet
                    specifications contracted for. “Off”, in “off-spec”,
                    is hence a relative concept.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The appellant’s case at trial was that
                    none of the elements of the offence of dishonest receipt of stolen property were
                    made out. His arguments were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the fuel was not
                        “stolen property”. “Stolen property” must have
                        been unlawfully taken from someone. The prosecution thus had a burden to
                        prove who the original owners of the property were. In this case, the
                        prosecution had not proven that the fuel belonged to Chevron. Shanker simply
                        pleaded guilty to the charge of criminal breach of trust because he wanted
                        to avoid a more serious sentence. His conviction was no indication that the
                        fuel belonged to Chevron. In fact, the excess fuel could have belonged to
                        Marubeni, Petrobas, or the other vessels at the Terminal. Without proof of
                        the owner, the fuel cannot be said to have been “stolen
                        property”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, it was not the appellant who had purchased the fuel. The
                        appellant was a mere conduit between Ioannis and Hussein. The appellant was
                        never in exclusive possession or control of the fuel. After receiving the
                        call from Hussein, the appellant spoke to Ioannis and conveyed
                        Hussein’s offer. Ioannis told him that ABS was interested in buying
                        the excess fuel, and he duly replied to Hussein. Subsequently, Ioannis
                        passed him the money for the fuel, which he handed over to
                    Hussein.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the
                        appellant was not dishonest, nor did he have reason to believe that the fuel
                        was stolen property. During the conversation with Hussein, he asked for the
                        source of the fuel. However, Hussein did not tell him the source. This was a
                        norm in the industry as brokers did not want to reveal their sources lest
                        render themselves (as middlemen) obsolete. Further, the price did not seem
                        unduly low as Hussein told the appellant it was off-spec, and not
                        380CST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The District Judge accepted the
                    prosecution’s case, namely, that the fuel was stolen property, the
                    appellant had reason to believe it was stolen, and he had indeed received it. I
                    now consider each of the appellant’s grounds of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Grounds of appeal against conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(1) Had the District Judge erred in finding that the charge had been
                made out at the close of the prosecution’s case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appellant first argued that the
                    prosecution had amended the charge several times leading up to trial. First, on
                    28 December 2011, the prosecution charged the appellant with dishonest receipt.
                    In April 2012, the charge was amended to one of abetting Thet Lwin, the bunker
                    clerk on board the MV Milos at the time of receipt. On 15 May 2012, the charge
                    was amended to the original version – dishonest receipt. On the first day
                    of trial, the charge was again amended. This time, the word
                    “approximately” was used to qualify the quantity and the total
                    price of the fuel. The appellant argued that these
                    “prevarications” by the prosecution set the context in which I
                    should question if the charge had been made out. The charge of dishonest receipt
                    in this case required that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The fuel was received by the
                        appellant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        quantity of the fuel was 105 metric tonnes and the quality was 380CST
                        (valued at S$69,106.70);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The fuel was stolen property, belonging to Chevron;

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The receipt
                        by the appellant was dishonest, and the appellant had reason to believe the
                        fuel was stolen property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I consider each
                        of these in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a) Was the fuel received by the appellant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The District Judge found that the appellant
                    had received the fuel, based on his statement to the CPIB dated 15 May 2008
                        (<em>Chua</em> at [34]). The relevant parts of the
                    statement are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. Immediately, I understood that the man was trying to sell me 105MT
                        cheap black market marine fuel. I asked him how much was he offering and
                        after some bargaining he said he will charge me S$180/- per MT. As this was
                        way cheaper than the market price of USD550/MT, I agreed to buy the whole of
                        105MT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8. I then passed instruction to the bunker clerk on board Milos at the
                        Caltex terminal to expect an extra delivery of 105MT on top of the 2500MT
                        which Aegean had ordered from Marubeni. Marubeni is a trader whose stock was
                        kept at Caltex premises and sell off from Caltex terminal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9. After the entire delivery process, I received feedback from Milos
                        bunker clerk that the 105MT extra had been received. As such, a meeting was
                        called with the man and we met up at Block 22 Hawker Centre, Havelock Road.
                        During the meeting, I handed over a sum of S$18,900/- to him. I was shown to
                        a man in CPIB today and I confirmed that he is the man whom I had passed the
                        money to. (Recorder’s note: Hussein Ahmad Bin Abdul Satar.) I knew his
                        name as Hussein as this was the name he introduced himself. After I passed
                        him the money, we went our separate ways.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Before me, the appellant argued that the quoted parts of the
                        statement did not show that he had received the fuel – at best they
                        would only prove that the appellant had abetted Thet Lwin, the bunker clerk
                        (referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement). Second, he argued that
                        the District Judge was wrong to rely on his statement for the content of the
                        conversation between Thet Lwin and the appellant, as this was hearsay
                        evidence. In fact, he maintained that the conversation between him and Thet
                        Lwin had never taken place, and that it was Ioannis instead who had given
                        instructions to Thet Lwin to expect extra fuel. Third, the appellant argued
                        that the District Judge was wrong to infer that the 105 metric tonnes were
                        loaded onto the MV Milos just because the appellant was the one who paid
                        Hussein,</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although subsequent payment may not be
                    sufficient to prove that the fuel was transferred, it was a relevant indicator.
                    As the District Judge noted (<em>Chua</em> at [34]),
                    “otherwise [there would have been] no reason for the payment”. In
                    the appellant’s statement, he also stated that he “received
                    feedback from Milos bunker clerk that the 105MT extra had been received”.
                    It was hence generally uncontroversial that the fuel had been loaded onto the MV
                    Milos. The question was whether this would constitute receipt within meaning of
                    the charge. I found that it did. Receipt need not amount to physical possession.
                    In this case, control was sufficient. The appellant had control over the 105
                    metric tonnes of fuel (through his negotiations with Hussein and the bunker
                    clerk), and he was the one who arranged for it to be loaded onto the MV
                    Milos.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b) Were the quantity and quality of the fuel 105 metric tonnes and
                380CST respectively?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The District Judge had found that the amount
                    of fuel in the charge (105 metric tonnes) was proven (<em>Chua</em> at [34]), as was the grade (380CST) (<em>Chua</em> at [41]). For the amount, the District Judge relied the
                    appellant’s statement (cited, in part, above at [11]). I am of the opinion
                    that he was correct. The appellant’s contention that the amount could not
                    have been established to precision did not raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt
                    in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In determining the quality, the District Judge
                    “considered that the evidence of PW8 confirmed that the Chevron Terminal
                    and Tank 560 which push the fuel through the pipelines, only contain 380CST fuel
                    and all the pipelines to the Marubeni tanks contain [380CST fuel]”. PW8,
                    or the prosecution’s eighth witness, was Tan Poo Lee. The appellant argued
                    that the District Judge was wrong to rely on Tan Poo Lee’s evidence as, in
                    cross-examination, he stated that different grades of fuel were stored at the
                    Terminal and that he may not have been the best person to give evidence about
                    gains in fuel at the Terminal as he only worked office hours and was not present
                    at the time of the transfer, unlike Shanker. Shanker’s evidence was that
                    he was not sure of the source of the excess fuel. What Tan Poo Lee was sure of
                    was that the most common type of fuel in the terminal was 380CST. The appellant
                    did not contest this. On a matter of probability, given that the fuel came from
                    the Terminal, it was likely 380CST. Furthermore, based on the appellant’s
                    statement, he understood that the fuel was 380CST. This can be inferred from a
                    portion of paragraph 7, “… this was way cheaper than the market
                    price of USD550/MT” and paragraph 4 where he stated that (he thought
                    that) the price of 380CST was about USD550 per metric tonne. There was no
                    mention of off-spec – or any other type of – fuel. On the totality
                    of the evidence, I find that the District Judge was correct to find that the
                    fuel was 380CST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c) Was the fuel stolen property?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The District Judge held that “in the
                    definition of stolen property in section 410 of the Penal Code, the emphasis is
                    on possession of property” (<em>Chua</em> at [21]).
                    Section 410, which defines stolen property, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Property the possession whereof has been transferred by theft, or by
                        extortion, or by robbery, and property which has been criminally
                        misappropriated, or in respect of which criminal breach of trust or cheating
                        has been committed, is designated as “stolen property”,
                        whether the transfer has been made or the misappropriation or breach of
                        trust or cheating has been committed within or without Singapore. But if
                        such property subsequently comes into the possession of a person legally
                        entitled to the possession thereof, it then ceases to be stolen
                        property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The expression “stolen property” includes any property
                        into or for which stolen property has been converted or exchanged and
                        anything acquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or
                        otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The District Judge found that Chevron was in possession of the
                        excess fuel at the Terminal, and that Shanker controlled the movement of the
                        fuel. The District Judge also noted that Shanker “had pleaded guilty
                        to criminal breach of trust charges and the charge which involves the MV
                        Milos was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing”
                            (<em>Chua</em> at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The appellant argued that the District Judge
                    erred in law in his interpretation of s 410. He argued the District Judge
                    “failed to take into account [his] contention that the definition of
                    stolen property in s 410 has to be interpreted in its plain sense…
                    consistent with the approach taken by the court in <em>Lim Hong
                        Siang v Public Prosecutor</em> [2009] 3 MLJ 280”. <em>Lim Hong Siang</em> was a Malaysian High Court decision. The
                    appellant in that case had pleaded guilty to a charge of retaining stolen
                    property, namely, five units of handphones which allegedly belonged to an
                    individual named Fong Chew Phein. According to the statement of facts, an armed
                    robbery occurred at a shop. The owner of the shop, Poh Ken Hua, informed the
                    complainant (a police officer on duty) of this. There was no mention in the
                    statement of facts of Poh Ken Hua reporting 5 missing handphones from his shop.
                    As such, it was not clear where the 5 handphones came from. After having been
                    convicted and sentenced, the appellant appealed to the High Court (against
                    sentence). The High Court set aside the plea of guilt. Its reason was that
                    “[n]o evidence was led during the proceedings to show that the
                    [handphones] belonged to Poh Ken Hua” (at [12]). Neither was there any
                    mention of how Fong Chew Phein, the alleged “owner” of the
                    handphones according to the charge, was related to the case. As such, it was
                    apparent that <em>Lim Hong Siang</em> dealt with a
                    different situation. The court in that case held that the prosecution needed to
                    prove that the property (the 5 handphones) was stolen property (<em>Lim Hong Siang</em> at [11]). The case did not stand for the
                    proposition that ownership was a prerequisite to the definition of stolen
                    property in s 410, as the appellant seemed to have alluded
                to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The prosecution’s position was that it
                    was under no obligation to prove the ownership of the fuel in question. It
                    argued that, in this case, the fuel was stolen property as it had been
                    transferred to the appellant by Shanker’s act of criminal breach of trust,
                    which Shanker had pleaded guilty to. As proof of ownership of the property was
                    not an element of the offence of criminal breach of trust, it was immaterial in
                    this case as well. The appellant faulted the prosecution’s (and the
                    District Judge’s) reliance on Shanker’s conviction, as the
                    conviction did not prove that fuel belonged to (presumably in the sense of being
                    owned by) Chevron. In my view, the District Judge correctly applied the
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(d) Was the appellant dishonest, and did he have reason to believe
                that the fuel was stolen property?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The District Judge cited <em>Ow
                        Yew Beng v PP</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 536 (“<em>Ow</em>”) for the proposition that “the two mental
                    elements of dishonesty and knowing or having reason to believe that the property
                    was stolen [can] go together”. Dishonesty refers to acting with the
                    intention of causing gain or loss which the accused has reason to believe was
                    wrongful (<em>Ow</em> at [11]). “Dishonesty”
                    and “reason to believe” can go together because “[a] person
                    who retains property knowing it to be stolen, would naturally possess an
                    intention to cause gain or loss which he knows or has reason to believe is
                    wrongful though there may be situations when these mental elements are not
                    co-extensive” (<em>Chua</em> at [40], citing
                        <em>Ow</em> at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The District Judge found that the appellant
                    had reason to believe the fuel was stolen. He relied on the appellant’s
                    statement, in which the appellant stated that he understood that the fuel was
                    “cheap black market marine fuel” given its relatively low price
                        (<em>Chua</em> at [40] and [42]). The appellant argued
                    that the District Judge had erred in law in conflating the two elements of
                    dishonesty and having reason to believe that the fuel was stolen property. He
                    argued that the District Judge should have applied a subjective test to
                    ascertain if the appellant had, at the material time, intended to cause wrongful
                    gain or loss. I find that the District Judge was correct in his analysis to look
                    at the two mental elements together in this case. The appellant received the
                    fuel, knowing it to be stolen, and hence naturally possessed an intention to
                    cause gain to his business partners (or “Greek bosses”, according
                    to his statement) or loss to the rightful owner of the fuel. In fact, the
                    appellant mentioned in his statement, “I promise not to buy such
                    dishonest stock again”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The appellant also argued that the District
                    Judge was wrong to find that he had reason to believe that the fuel was stolen.
                    The District Judge came to that finding based on the lack of documentation for
                    the purchase, the appellant’s statement, and the low price of the fuel.
                    Before me, the appellant first attempted to justify the lack of documentation by
                    arguing that he was only a conduit, and that “it was not for him to
                    follow up in terms of documentation”. Second, he argued that the District
                    Judge should have placed little weight on his statement, and that he did not
                    state that the fuel was “off-spec” because Bay wanted to
                    “truncate the recording” of the statement. Third, he argued that
                    it was not established that the price of the fuel was (relatively)
                    “low”, as the grade of the fuel was not proven to have been
                    380CST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I dismiss the last contention as I found that
                    the District Judge was correct in determining the grade of the fuel (see above
                    at [15]). I also dismiss the second contention that the District Judge should
                    not have relied on his statement (see below at [25]–[27]). Even if the
                    fuel were “off-spec”, this did not negate the appellant’s
                    “reason to believe” that it was stolen. His remark in his
                    statement that the fuel was “way cheaper” was not adequately
                    explained. At no point did the appellant raise a plausible theory to explain
                    those portions of his statement. As the prosecution had pointed out, “the
                    fact that the fuel is off-spec may or may not result in a discount in
                    price” (see also above at [8]). The appellant seemed to have conflated
                    the two issues of “what the grade of the fuel was” and
                    “what the appellant believed the grade of the fuel was”. The
                    latter – his belief that the fuel was 380CST (and priced significantly
                    below the market price) – was sufficient to establish the mental element
                    of “reason to believe” in s 411. This was apparent from the
                    evidence. With regard to the appellant’s first contention, even if it were
                    not the appellant’s duty to document the transaction, he must have known
                    that the fuel was stolen property based on the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The payment was made in cash in a
                        hawker centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The price was quoted in Singapore dollars, whereas the common currency for
                        trading in MFO is US dollars.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The
                        appellant’s case that Ioannis usually kept all the documents, but in
                        this case assumed that records for the purchase of the 105 metric tonnes
                        would be kept in Greece, was implausible. As pointed out by the District
                        Judge (<em>Chua</em> at [67]), “it is
                        unacceptable to the court that as [Ioannis] had played such an important
                        part in the [appellant’s] explanation that he was a conduit pipe for
                        [Ioannis], yet there was no mention of [Ioannis] by the [appellant] at all
                        during the recording of his statement. Instead, [Ioannis] was only featured
                        during the course of the trial.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2) Had the District Judge failed to appreciate that 3 witnesses were
                not called by the prosecution?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The three witnesses were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Thet Lwin, the bunker clerk on duty
                        on the MV Milos at the material time;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     U Soe Paing, the operations executive of ABS;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     the loading
                        master on duty at the Terminal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The
                        appellant argued that the prosecution’s failure to call Thet Lwin
                        “left a lacuna in terms of an essential ingredient of the offence,
                        namely the element of dishonest receipt of stolen property”; U Soe
                        Paing was “in a position to confirm Thet Lwin’s
                        evidence”, and the loading master “could have had knowledge of
                        the loading of fuel onto MV Milos”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The District Judge, however, found that the
                    prosecution’s decision not to call any of these 3 individuals did not
                    affect its case (<em>Chua</em> at [34]). I agree. There was
                    sufficient evidence before the court without these witnesses having been called.
                    The appellant’s emphasis on Thet Lwin’s direct involvement, and his
                    reference to the prosecution’s previous charge of abetment, are without
                    merit. That the appellant was not on the MV Milos (and Thet Lwin was) at the
                    material time was not detrimental to the prosecution’s case (see above at
                    [13]). If the 3 witnesses were relevant to the defence, it was open to the
                    defence to call them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3) Had the District Judge erred in admitting the appellant’s
                statement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The appellant’s statement was recorded
                    on 15 May 2008, about seven months after the transaction at the terminal, by Bay
                    Chun How (“Bay”), the lead investigator and the
                    prosecution’s seventh witness. At the trial below, an ancillary hearing
                    (formerly known as a <em>voir dire</em>) was conducted to
                    determine if the statement was made voluntarily. The appellant argued that he
                    was led to believe that he was only assisting in the investigations as a
                    witness, and that he would not be charged in court if he cooperated. The
                    District Judge, after hearing oral evidence from both the appellant and Bay,
                    dismissed the appellant’s contentions and admitted the statement
                        (<em>Chua</em> at [46]). This was for two reasons.
                    First, he noted that the appellant was given the opportunity to read his
                    statement, understand its nature, and make amendments (in fact, the appellant
                    made 2 amendments) – which indicated that Bay complied with the procedural
                    requirements in recording the statement. Second, he found that Bay neither had
                    the power to decide whether the appellant would be charged in court, nor did he
                    – as a matter of fact – offer any inducements or promises to the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The appellant argued that the “District
                    Judge’s main reason for rejecting the fact that [the statement] was given
                    as a consequence of Bay’s inducements was that Bay was not in a position
                    to give any inducement as the discretion to charge the [appellant] was that of
                    the Public Prosecutor”, and that the two concepts (that prosecutorial
                    discretion lay with the Public Prosecutor and the existence of an inducement)
                    were mutually exclusive. I am of the view that this was an inaccurate
                    representation of the District Judge’s reasoning. What was crucial was
                    that Bay had not said anything to the effect that the appellant would not be
                    charged if he cooperated. Bay’s description of the appellant as
                    “very forthcoming [and] very cooperative” – which the
                    appellant sought to rely on – did not of itself show that there was any
                    inducement at work. Nor did Bay’s testimony that he told the appellant he
                    was present at CPIB to “assist” in the investigations (the
                    appellant argued that the word “assist” carried certain
                    implications). Second, the two concepts were not mutually exclusive. The test
                    for voluntariness is both objective and subjective. The question of whether
                    there was an inducement or promise is an objective one (see <em>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [53]). As
                    such, in determining (objectively) whether there was an inducement, the context
                    of the recording, and the ability (or lack thereof) of the recorder to influence
                    charging decisions, was not wholly irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The appellant argued, in the alternative, that
                    the District Judge erred in giving the statement “due weight”
                    – instead, he should have given it no weight. The appellant cited
                    “factual inconsistencies” between the statement and oral evidence
                    at trial, such as the organisational structure of the Aegean companies (which
                    the appellant did not mention during the recording), and that these should
                    diminish the weight to be given to the statement. I find that the District Judge
                    was correct to prefer the appellant’s inculpatory evidence in his
                    statement (having found that it was admissible). Not only was the statement
                    recorded shortly after the transaction, the appellant’s reason for not
                    having raised many issues during the interview – that Bay wanted to
                    truncate the recording – was not persuasive. It would not have taken the
                    appellant a significant amount of time to bring up the role of Ioannis, or that
                    he believed the fuel was off-spec.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(4) Had the District Judge erred in considering Hussein’s
                evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The District Judge stated that as Hussein had
                    already been convicted and sentenced for his role in the offence, he did not
                    stand to gain from implicating the appellant (in particular, because he had
                    already served his sentence) (<em>Chua</em> at [53]). At
                    trial, Hussein had given oral evidence that he could not recall the details of
                    the transaction. The prosecution applied under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) to admit the portion of the statement that Hussein gave to
                    the CPIB on 15 May 2008 relating to the quantity of the excess fuel (105 metric
                    tonnes). The District Judge allowed this, reasoning that “the basis for
                    [Hussein’s] ability to remember when his statement was recorded was
                    because of his direct dealings with the [appellant] in this transaction
                    involving the excess fuel” (<em>Chua</em> at
                    [54]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The appellant referred to inconsistencies
                    between Hussein’s statement and oral evidence from other witnesses at
                    trial (such as whether the quantity was exactly 105 metric tonnes, and whether
                    the price of the transaction was in US dollars), and argued that “the
                    [District Judge] erred in accepting Hussein’s evidence on the basis that
                    he would have no motive to minimise his role or exaggerate that of the
                    Appellant, as the [District Judge] did not take into account the contradictions
                    between [Hussein’s statement] and ‘objective facts’,
                    ‘the inherent probabilities and improbabilities’ in the statement
                    and Hussein’s oral evidence”. I disagree with the appellant’s
                    contentions, as well as its interpretation of the District Judge’s
                    argument. The District Judge made a finding that Hussein did not stand to gain
                    from implicating the appellant. This finding was independent of his oral
                    evidence, his statement, or how his evidence tied in with the rest of the
                    evidence. The appellant’s seeming attempt to impute an ulterior motive
                    unto Hussein based on inconsistencies in his evidence was not substantiated.
                    More importantly, the appellant’s arguments regarding the District
                    Judge’s handling of Hussein’s evidence were largely inconsequential.
                    The two important parts of Hussein’s evidence were that it was the
                    appellant who agreed to purchase the fuel, and that it was the appellant who
                    made payment. Neither of these was disputed by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(5) Had the District Judge failed to appreciate the defence that the
                fuel was off-spec?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The District Judge found that the fuel could
                    not have been off-spec because “there was no documentation on the
                    contractual specifications…” (<em>Chua</em>
                    at [40]). The appellant argued that, in making this finding, the District judge
                    did not take into account the evidence of the other witnesses such as Shanker,
                    Remy and Hussein. These witnesses elaborated on what “off-spec”
                    means (see above at [8]). The appellant contended that the prosecution had not
                    led evidence to establish the precise quality of the fuel. He argued that
                    “if the excess fuel [was] indeed off-spec fuel, it [confirmed] the
                    Appellant’s position that he had no reason to believe that the excess fuel
                    was stolen property”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I find that his argument was without merit.
                    For the reasons above, it was clear that the appellant believed he was
                    purchasing 380CST fuel. In fact, he believed the fuel to have been even more
                    expensive that 380CST fuel. There was little doubt that he had reason to believe
                    that the fuel was stolen. Furthermore, the appellant accepted that the most
                    common type of fuel in the Terminal was 380CST, yet raised no evidence to create
                    a reasonable doubt that the fuel in question was not 380CST, let alone
                    off-spec.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(6) Had the District Judge failed to recognise contradictions in the
                evidence of critical prosecution witnesses?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The appellant identified Bay, Hussein, and
                    Badaruddin Bin Mohamed Ibrahim (who knew the appellant since 1992 and introduced
                    Hussein to the appellant) as “critical” prosecution witnesses
                    because they were “the only witnesses who either knew or had dealings
                    with the [appellant]”. Again, the appellant brought up matters relating
                    to the quantity and quality of the fuel. I looked through the evidence of the 3
                    witnesses, and did not come across anything that contradicted the analysis of
                    the District Judge in finding that the charge was made out. I thus agree with
                    the District Judge’s approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(7) Had the District Judge erred in drawing adverse inferences
                against the appellant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The District Judge found that the prosecution
                    had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt (<em>Chua</em> at [72]). In doing so, the appellant alleged, he had drawn
                    adverse inferences which were “not warranted by the evidence”.
                    These inferences were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the appellant had reason to
                        believe that the fuel was stolen based on the lack of documentation,
                        concessions in his statement, and the disparity between the price paid and
                        the market price; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the appellant had indeed received the excess fuel, based on
                        concessions in the his statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The appellant might have misapprehended the
                    term “adverse inference”. It is not a term of art. It is an
                    application of common sense. If an accused was expected to give an explanation
                    but did not, he must explain his omission. If the explanation was accepted, his
                    omission will not harm his defence. If his explanation failed to persuade the
                    trial judge, the judge would be entitled to conclude that the omission
                    incriminated him. The trial judge is generally entitled to draw inferences from
                    the failure of the accused to give evidence on oath, “including the
                    ultimate adverse inference that the [accused] was guilty of the offence
                    charged” (see <em>Oh Laye Koh v PP</em> [1994] SGCA
                    102 (“<em>Oh</em>”) at [14]). The Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Oh</em> dealt with s 196 of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code (Act 10 of 1976), the equivalent of which is s 291(3) of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). Also,
                    inferences can be drawn from the accused’s silence, pursuant to
                    s 261(1) of the CPC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The District Judge did not seem to have drawn
                    any such inference against the appellant with regard to the issues cited (above
                    at [33]). In fact, the District Judge had not used the term “adverse
                    inference” at all in his decision (he did, however, use the term
                    “irresistible inference” at [40]). Based on his reasoning, it
                    seemed clear that he relied on the evidence (or lack thereof) to assess the
                    arguments of the prosecution and defence. The lack of documentation was
                    detrimental to the appellant’s attempt to create a reasonable doubt that
                    the fuel was off-spec. It was not the case that simply because there was no
                    documentation, the District Judge found that the prosecution’s case was
                    proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It could be argued that the District Judge
                    drew an adverse inference from the appellant’s failure to mention Ioannis
                    during the recording of the statement (<em>Chua</em> at
                    [41]). However, this point was not addressed by the appellant. In any case, I
                    find that this was a justified inference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(8) Had the District Judge failed to consider the appellant’s
                defence, in the light of the organisational structure of the Aegean group of
                companies?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The appellant argued, at trial, that the
                    purchaser of the fuel was ABS and not AB. Evidence was led at trial to show that
                    ABS was in charge of the operations of the MV Milos, not AB. These arguments
                    were presumably made in the context of the appellant’s
                    “receipt” of the fuel. The District Judge rejected the
                    appellant’s contentions, having found that he had indeed received the
                    fuel. Before me, the appellant argued erred in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     Finding that ABS and AB were in
                        effect run like a single company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Noting that the appellant made no mention of ABS and
                        Ioannis’ involvement in his statement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     Finding that Hussein’s statement
                        corroborated the price of the fuel as S$18,900; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     Relying on the appellant’s
                        statement that his office maintained a petty cash float of about US$50,000
                        which was accessibly only by him and his operations
                manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In relation to the first point, I note that
                    the District Judge did not make such a finding. At paragraph 35 of his decision,
                    which the appellant quoted, the District Judge merely stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The prosecution has submitted that Aegean Bunkering
                            and Aegean Breeze Shipping share the same office premises and that for
                            all intents and purposes, in reality, the 2 companies were run like a
                            single company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The quoted portion refers to the prosecution’s
                        submission, rather than the District Judge’s finding. Nevertheless, a
                        finding that the two were run like a single company would not contravene the
                        “basic fact that [the two companies] were two separate legal
                        entities” (in the appellant’s words). The appellant argued that
                        AB was not in the business of purchasing small quantities of fuel, such as
                        the 105 metric tonnes involved in this case. Even if that were the case, his
                        reference to the organisational structure of the Aegean group did nothing to
                        explain his involvement in the transaction (from purchase to payment), nor
                        did it substantiate his “conduit”
                argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Second, the District Judge noted that the
                    appellant made no mention of ABS or Ioannis in his statement and (hence)
                    disbelieved the appellant’s account that he was merely a conduit. Before
                    me, the appellant argued he was wrong in doing so, as the statement was simply a
                    truncated account. I find this unconvincing. Further, this did not explain why
                    he stated (at paragraph 20 of his statement) his motivation to buy the fuel as
                    “[needing] to show good business results to [his] Greek
                    bosses”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Third, the District Judge noted that Hussein
                    had stated (at page 6 of his statement) that he “received a sum of
                    $18,900 from [the appellant]”. Another witness, Wang Kin (the recording
                    officer of Hussein’s statement), had given evidence that this sum was in
                    Singapore dollars. The currency was a matter of dispute because the
                    appellant’s account was that Ioannis had handed him a sealed envelope
                    containing US$18,900 and told him to pass it to Hussein. However, in his
                    statement, he mentioned that the sum was S$18,900. The District Judge held that,
                    based on Hussein’s statement, Wang Kin’s evidence, and the
                    appellant’s statement, the sum was S$18,900.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The appellant argued that the District Judge
                    was wrong to rely on these pieces of evidence as there were intrinsic and
                    extrinsic contradictions between Hussein and Wang Kin’s evidence. Minor
                    contradictions are understandable, given the length of time that passed between
                    the transaction and the trial. This currency argument was part of the broader
                    context of the District Judge’s reasoning in determining whose account to
                    believe. The appellant, in his oral evidence, argued that he was simply a
                    conduit. Ioannis said that he was the one who gave the appellant the money to
                    pass to Hussein, and the sum was US$18,900. On the contrary, the
                    prosecution’s case was that the appellant had paid Hussein S$18,900
                    through the petty cash account. The District Judge found that the sum was indeed
                    S$18,900, and this was one of the reasons the District Judge rejected the
                    appellant’s case that he was a mere conduit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Although Ioannis alleged that he provided the
                    US$18,900, and that the sum came from the account of ABS, he was unable to show
                    any documentary evidence of a withdrawal of US$18,900 from the account. He
                    attempted to show that two withdrawals of US$15,225 and US$10,140, made on 28
                    August and 25 October 2007 respectively, were used to make up the US$18,900. The
                    District Judge found Ioannis’ evidence unreliable, and that he was merely
                    giving his evidence in order to support the appellant (<em>Chua</em> at [68]). I agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Even if the sum was US$18,900, based on the
                    totality of the evidence, it still did not mean that the District Judge was
                    wrong in holding that the appellant was not a mere conduit. In any case, I find
                    that the District Judge was correct to prefer the evidence of Hussein, Wang Kin,
                    and the appellant himself (in his statement).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Fourth, and finally, the District Judge found
                    that the appellant purchased and paid for the fuel through the petty cash
                    account which only he and his operations manager had access to. The appellant
                    argued before me that the District Judge was wrong because “the
                    [appellant] had given evidence that there was no person employed as an
                    operations manager with [AB] and the [prosecution] did not cross-examine him on
                    this point”. It seems the appellant was faulting the District Judge for
                    not having drawn an adverse inference against the prosecution’s failure to
                    cross-examine the appellant on a particular point. This would not be tenable. In
                    any case, the District Judge came to his finding based on the words in the
                    appellant’s statement. If the appellant’s oral testimony had
                    subsequently contradicted his statement, it was not clearly explained (even the
                    “truncated” argument would not be relevant here). The District
                    Judge was hence correct to prefer his account in the statement. The appeal
                    against conviction is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Grounds of appeal against sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The maximum imprisonment term for an offence
                    under s 411(1) of the Penal Code is five years. The District Judge
                    sentenced the appellant to eight months’ imprisonment. In doing so, he
                    noted the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The commission of such offences in
                        the bunkering trade would affect Singapore’s reputation as an
                        internationally respected bunkering hub and bring Singapore into
                        disrepute;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        offence was difficult to detect; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appellant stood to gain (in showing good business
                        results to his Greek bosses).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>He also
                        noted that Shanker was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment and Remy
                        and Hussein each to 6 months. The three of them, however, faced criminal
                        breach of trust charges, the maximum term of imprisonment of which is seven
                        years. The District Judge also considered the case of <em>Samad bin Kamis and another v PP</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 450
                            (“<em>Samad</em>”). In that case, the
                        second appellant (a bunker clerk) was sentenced by the District Court to
                        five months’ imprisonment for dishonestly receiving 157 metric tonnes
                        of fuel, pursuant to s 411 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).
                        The fuel was worth about S$62,616.95. The High Court affirmed the sentence.
                        The District Judge distinguished <em>Samad</em> as the
                        “price of [fuel] was very much lower then” (<em>Chua</em> at [76]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Before me, the appellant argued that the
                    District Judge erred in imposing a sentence of eight months because he:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did not apply the principle of
                        parity in sentencing, and failed to consider the sentences imposed in
                        similar cases;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     Misapprehended several facts material to sentencing; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     Did not have due regard to the
                        character references of the appellant submitted in
                mitigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     First, the appellant cited the principle of
                    parity in sentencing. The principle states that “where there are no
                    differentiating factors… public interest demands that there should be
                    some consistency in the imposition of sentences on accused persons committing
                    the same or similar offences” (see <em>Liow Eng Giap v
                        PP</em> [1968-1970] SLR(R) 681 at [3]). The appellant argued that the
                    District Judge had erred in considering the “differentiating
                    factors” between the appellant’s case and <em>Samad</em>, as well as between the appellant’s case and that of
                    Shanker, Remy and Hussein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In comparing this case with <em>Samad</em>, the District Judge observed that <em>Samad</em> “was decided about 20 years ago, and the price of
                    [fuel] was very much lower then”. The District Judge compared the market
                    price of the fuel in this case (US$434 per metric tonne) with the price at which
                    the fuel was sold in <em>Samad</em> (S$185 per metric
                    tonne), and reasoned that since this case involved a much larger sum, the
                    appellant should receive a higher sentence than the second appellant in
                        <em>Samad</em>. The appellant argued that the District
                    Judge erred in comparing the market price in his case with the sale price in
                        <em>Samad</em>. Instead, if market prices in both cases
                    were compared, the difference would not have been as stark. In <em>Samad</em>, the market price was found to have been S$398 per
                    metric tonne (<em>Samad</em> at [76] –
                [77]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The appellant also argued that his case was
                    less serious than <em>Samad</em>. He argued that in
                        <em>Samad</em>, the second appellant had received the
                    fuel for his own personal benefit, had contaminated the fuel he bought for
                    himself with the lower grade of fuel on the barge intended for delivery to the
                    company’s customer, and had purchased more fuel (157, as opposed to 105,
                    metric tonnes).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The appellant then drew comparisons between
                    his case and the cases of Shanker, Remy and Hussein. The latter can be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Shanker faced one charge under
                        s 406 read with s 109 of the Penal Code and three charges under
                            s 6(<em>b</em>) of the Prevention of
                        Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”) read with
                        s 34 of the Penal Code. A further three charges under s 406 read
                        with s 109 of the Penal Code and two charges under s 6(<em>b</em>) of the PCA read with s 34 were taken into
                        consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He faced a total of eight
                        months’ imprisonment and a S$90,000 fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Remy faced 2 charges under s 406 read with
                        s 109 of the Penal Code and two charges under s 6(<em>b</em>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241,
                        1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. A
                        further two charges under s 408 read with s 109 of the Penal Code
                        and two charges under s 6(<em>b</em>) of the PCA
                        read with s 34 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the
                        purpose of sentencing. He faced a total of six months’ imprisonment
                        and a S$60,000 fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Hussein faced two charges at trial under s 408 read with
                        s 109 of the Penal Code. He also pleaded guilty to one charge under
                        s 408 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. He faced a total of six
                        months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Shanker and
                        Remy had pleaded guilty, whereas Hussein had claimed trial to two counts of
                        s 408 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (see <em>PP
                            v Zahfudean Faizal Bin Mohammed Din and another</em> [2011] SGDC
                        223), and pleaded guilty to one count of s 408 read with s 109 of
                        the Penal Code. The appellant argued that the trio faced more charges than
                        him, he was not the “mastermind” in the transaction, and he
                        did not benefit personally (whereas out of the S$18,900, Hussein took
                        S$2,100 and Shanker and Remy each took S$6,000). As such, his sentence
                        should have been significantly lower than theirs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The District Judge, however, found that the
                    role of Shanker could “be equated to the role of the [appellant]”
                        (<em>Chua</em> at [76]), as without the appellant
                    agreeing to receive the [fuel], the transaction would not have occurred. He also
                    disagreed that the appellant did not benefit personally – the
                    appellant’s gain was showing good business results to his Greek bosses. I
                    agree. These were not the only differences between the appellant’s case
                    and the other cases cited. Shanker had pleaded guilty, whereas the appellant had
                    claimed trial to the single charge under s 411. Although the appellant was
                    entitled to claim trial, the manner in which he conducted his defence was an
                    indication that he showed little remorse, and was unwilling to accept personal
                    responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The appellant, in his submissions, went on to
                    “[acknowledge] that the principle of parity is irrelevant once the
                    offenders are charged with different offences, as there is no longer any common
                    basis for comparison” (citing <em>Phua Song Hua v
                        PP</em> [2004] SGHC 33 at [38]). This did not seem to have deterred
                    him from drawing comparisons between his sentence and the sentences of Shanker,
                    Remy and Hussein (none of whom faced s 411 charges). The s 411 cases
                    that he did refer to (<em>PP v Ho Yeong Yeow</em> [2005]
                    SGDC 85, which dealt with the receipt of stolen television sets and electrical
                    devices and <em>PP v Narayanan Palanivellu</em> [2006] SGDC
                    65, which dealt with the receipt of a stolen laptop) concerned entirely
                    different facts and similarly provided little basis for
                comparison.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The case of the second appellant in <em>Samad</em>, admittedly, comes close to the appellant’s
                    case (in terms of involving dishonest receipt of stolen MFO). However,
                    sentencing is not a mathematical endeavour of equating similar criminal
                    transactions. The circumstances of the accused (such as his level of remorse,
                    and how he conducted his defence at trial) could be taken into account as well.
                    I find that the analogy of <em>Samad</em> was not
                    sufficient to warrant appellate intervention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Second, the appellant argued that the District
                    Judge misapprehended certain facts that were material to sentencing. He argued
                    that there was no proof that the fuel was 380CST (and hence the District Judge
                    was wrong to have relied on the market price of 380CST fuel), and that the
                    District Judge incorrectly relied on the appellant’s statement (possibly
                    in determining that he stood to gain by showing results to his Greek bosses).
                    Having found that the District Judge was correct in finding that the fuel was
                    380CST (see above at [15]) and that the statement was an accurate representation
                    of the facts (see above at [25]–[27]), the appellant’s contentions
                    are without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Third, the appellant argued that the District
                    Judge did not have due regard to the character references he submitted in
                    mitigation. The character references came from two individuals: the managing
                    director of a business partner of AM, and a pastor. They stated that the
                    appellant was a diligent and honest person. There is no reason to believe that
                    the District Judge had not already taken these factors into
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In sum, I find that the sentence was not
                    manifestly excessive. The appeal against sentence is also
                dismissed.</p>
