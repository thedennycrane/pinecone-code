</div>. In the court below, a Newton hearing was convened by the DJ to consider two questions. The first being the nature of the appellant’s psychiatric condition and whether it had contributed to the offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At the outset, it bears emphasis that when assessing the extent and nature of an alleged contributory link between an offender’s mental condition and the commission of the offences, the court invariably is required to consider the expert opinion of a psychiatrist (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Mei Xia Hannah v PP and another matter </span>[2019] 5 SLR 978 at [38] (“<span class="font-italic">Hannah Ho</span>”)). Where there is a conflict of opinion between two psychiatrists, it falls to the court to decide which opinion best accords with the factual circumstances, and is consistent with common sense, objective experience, and an understanding of the human condition (see <span class="font-italic">Hannah Ho </span>at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Chong Yee Ka v PP </span>[2017] 4 SLR 309<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the present case, the DJ had thoroughly examined the evidence of both parties’ expert witnesses before concluding that the Prosecution expert’s (Dr Christopher Cheok’s) assessment of the appellant’s psychiatric condition and its contributory link (or lack thereof) to the offences was more reliable. I see no reason to disturb his finding. In particular, the DJ directed his mind to consider the reliability and objectivity of both expert witnesses. The DJ had good grounds to doubt the reliability and objectivity of the Defence’s expert witness, Dr Tommy Tan, who conceded during cross-examination that his assessment appeared to be “lopsided” given the undue emphasis placed on the appellant’s self-reporting and probably self-serving accounts.

Conversely, Dr Tan assessed the severity of the appellant’s MDE to be moderate.

However, both Dr Tan and Dr Cheok noted that he had no past psychiatric history.

</div> “[Dr Cheok] explained that the two offences were ‘very goal directed’ and comprised ‘very complex actions’ including choosing potential targets that gave him the highest probability of success. He had aimed at the gold chain and gold necklace worn by the victims, snatched them and made his escape. He had then pawned both items almost immediately. These actions were not random, accidental, and certainly not impulsive.” Based on the above analysis, the appellant demonstrated that he was cognisant of the nature and wrongfulness of his actions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Further, the appellant’s submission that the DJ had given too much or undue consideration to Defence counsel’s incorrect submission at the Newton hearing that the appellant’s MDE had no contributory link to the offences because “he was doing his first trial”

As I find that the DJ rightly accepted Dr Cheok’s assessment that the appellant’s MDE had no contributory link to his offending, the DJ was therefore correct in disregarding his mental condition in determining the appropriate sentence to impose.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appellant stayed crime free for 10 years</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Next, the appellant submits that he stayed crime free for 10 years between 1992 and 2002.

To this end, I agree with the Prosecution that focusing purely on this crime free period completely overlooks the appellant’s extensive criminal record, which includes two terms of PD served in 1985 and 2010.

It was observed that the appellant presented with limited insight into the consequences of his actions. Pertinently, when asked if he believed that he harmed anyone in his offences, he opined that he had not harmed anyone as he had “returned everything to everyone”. It was clear that the appellant did not assume responsibility over his actions.

This is significant as the appellant has claimed that one of the main triggers behind his criminal offending stemmed from his wife’s association with this third party and her cohabitation with him. It is also relevant that the appellant had entreated his wife to end her relationship with the third party on multiple occasions with no success. Notably, her undertaking merely states vaguely that she intends to look after the appellant and ensure that he stays out of trouble.

</div> citing the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Rosli</span> at [21], the assessment of whether a term of PD is warranted is an intensely fact-centric exercise and relevant case law is more useful from the perspective of general principles as opposed to the resolution of particular factual situations. There is clear sense behind this observation. Whether PD is appropriate in any given case involves an interplay of many different factors. No two offenders would present with the same offending history, background, mental conditions, risk factors and protective factors. I thus find these cases cited by the appellant to be of little assistance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proportionality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Lastly, the appellant argues that given <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">aggravating and mitigating factors present, he should be sentenced up to 16 months’ imprisonment for each charge. Further, after taking into account his antecedents, the sentence should be enhanced by two times, with the sentences to run consecutively. This would bring the global sentence to 64 months’ imprisonment. Based on this calculation, the appellant thus contends that a 9-year term of PD would be </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">disproportionate</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> in comparison.</span>

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 With respect, I am of the view that the appellant’s submissions on proportionality are wholly misconceived. In <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal </span>[2016] SGHC 209 at [97], this court made clear that considerations of proportionality would <span class="font-italic">not</span> apply rigorously in the context of PD. This is because general deterrence and the social value in keeping a hardened criminal out of circulation provide a legitimate basis and operative justification for the application of this regime. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The public interest warrants the imposition of PD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In my view, there is an overwhelming sense that the appellant is a recalcitrant offender incapable of reform who is a menace and danger to the public. This is evidenced by his lengthy history of offending, the nature of the present offences, as well as his blatant disregard for the law. It suffices to note that over the course of 50 years, the appellant has been faced with more than 100 charges. He was sentenced to two terms of PD, and yet he continues to reoffend without compunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Indeed, the present set of offences were committed shortly after his release from his second term of PD. Moreover, his 2010 PD sentence was for offences <span class="font-italic">including</span> snatch theft, which is identical to the present set of offences. This not only shows that the appellant has made no effort to change for the better despite a lengthy term of PD, but also his utter contempt for the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Further, the nature of the present offences was not trivial in the slightest. The appellant targeted vulnerable elderly women and snatched gold jewellery off their necks. It is purely fortuitous that no serious harm resulted. The appellant evidently poses a danger to the public. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 For these reasons, the appellant’s appeal against sentence is dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Vincent Hoong</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right">Bachoo Mohan Singh<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">BMS Law LLC) for the appellant;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Marcus Foo and Benedict Teong</div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
