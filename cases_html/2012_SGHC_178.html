<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff failed to comply with the 26 May 2011 order.
                    Upon the defendant’s application in Summons No (“SUM”) 2571
                    of 2011 filed on 13 June 2011 and pursuant to the orders of AR Terence Tan
                    on 15 June 2011, the plaintiff was to file the supplementary list of
                    documents by 20 June 2011, failing which, the Plaintiff’s Statement
                    of Claim (Amendment No 1) would be struck out without need for a further order
                    (“the first unless order”). The plaintiff failed to comply fully
                    with the first unless order. Instead, the plaintiff filed SUM 2680 of 2011 on 20
                    June 2011 (the date before the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) would have
                    been struck out) requesting for an extension of time to comply with the first
                    unless order and for the first unless order to be varied to the extent that
                    discovery as regards the documents enumerated at paragraphs 2(e) to 2(h) be
                    dispensed with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 29 June 2011, AR Lim Jian Yi dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s application to vary the first unless order, but granted the
                    plaintiff an extension of time until 4 July 2011 to comply with the first
                    unless order, failing which the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No 1) would be struck out without need for a further order and judgment would be
                    entered on the defendant’s Counterclaim (“the second unless
                    order”). The plaintiff failed to comply with the second unless order.
                    Instead, on 8 July 2011, the plaintiff filed SUM 2997 of 2011 requesting for the
                    defendant’s Counterclaim to be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) and/or under the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the Court. On 19 July 2011, the defendant filed SUM 3159 of
                    2011 requesting for the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) to
                    be struck out and judgment to be entered against the plaintiff for the
                    defendant’s Counterclaim. On 15 September 2011 (more than two months
                    beyond the extension of time given in the second unless order), the plaintiff
                    filed SUM 4115 of 2011 requesting for an extension of time to comply with the
                    first and second unless orders. These three applications were heard by AR Shaun
                    Leong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 6 October 2011, AR Shaun Leong allowed the
                    defendant’s application in SUM 3159 of 2011 and ordered that the
                    plaintiff’s third and fourth Supplementary List of Documents filed on
                    10 August 2011 and 15 September 2011, respectively, to be struck out
                    on the basis that the plaintiff had not sought leave to file them . He
                    consequently dismissed the plaintiff’s applications in SUM 2997 of 2011
                    and SUM 4115 of 2011. On 19 October 2011, the plaintiff filed the following
                    Notices of Appeal against all three decisions of AR Shaun Leong:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Registrar’s Appeal No
                        (“RA”) 321 of 2011: Appeal against AR Shaun Leong’s
                        decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s application in SUM 2997 of
                        2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     RA 322 of
                        2011: Appeal against AR Shaun Leong’s decision to allow the
                        defendant’s application in SUM 3159 of 2011; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     RA 323 of 2011: Appeal against AR Shaun
                        Leong’s decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s application in SUM
                        4115 of 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the hearing before me on 4 April 2012,
                    the plaintiff had not disclosed two categories of documents, namely (a)
                    Senemas’ financial statements for the period between May 2009 and March
                    2010; and (b) Senemas’ income tax statements from May 2009 to March 2010
                    (collectively referred to as the “outstanding documents”). The
                    plaintiff explained that they needed to get the outstanding documents from one
                    Mr Takeshi Sawanobori (“Mr Takeshi”), a director of Senemas,
                    who was in Japan. As a final opportunity to redeem itself, I ordered that the
                    plaintiff produce the outstanding documents by 9 May 2012 and adjourned the
                    hearing to 16 May 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the resumed hearing on 16 May 2012, the
                    plaintiff had still not produced Senemas’ financial statements. Although
                    the plaintiff had produced the relevant income tax statements in its affidavit
                    dated 9 May 2012, the disclosure was not proper because only the English
                    translated version of the income tax statements were exhibited. The original
                    documents in Japanese were not disclosed. I therefore ordered the plaintiff to
                    file all the remaining outstanding documents by 22 May 2012 and further
                    adjourned the hearing to 23 May 2012. At the hearing on 23 May 2012, the
                    defendant brought to the Court’s attention that in relation to two of the
                    plaintiff’s bank accounts, the plaintiff had only disclosed the relevant
                    bank passbooks and not the proper financial statements. The bank passbooks were
                    unsatisfactory because they may not be accurate if they are not updated. Having
                    given the plaintiff enough chances to comply with their discovery obligations, I
                    allowed the defendant to amend its submissions to include the new point raised
                    and also allowed the plaintiff to file a short reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the hearing on 25 June 2012, I dismissed
                    RA 322 of 2011 and RA 323 of 2011. In my view, the plaintiff’s
                    multiple breaches of the various court orders, including the two unless orders,
                    were intentional and contumelious. The plaintiff was unable to satisfy me that
                    there were extraneous circumstances that prevented it from complying with the
                    court orders. Under Clause 4 of the Deed of Assignment, Senamas was expressly
                    obliged to assist the plaintiff in enforcing the debt. If the plaintiff had
                    difficulties getting the necessary documents from Mr Takeshi, it could and
                    should have taken steps to enforce its rights under the Deed of Assignment
                    against Mr Takeshi. It therefore did not lie in the plaintiff’s mouth to
                    say that the documents requested for were not in its possession, custody or
                    power. Further, in relation to the various documents that the plaintiff failed
                    to disclose, the plaintiff’s excuses to the Court had included
                    inadvertence and misunderstanding of the court orders. I was also unable to
                    accept the plaintiff’s excuse that their solicitors were unable to handle
                    the voluminous documents which were in Japanese. In my view, the
                    plaintiff’s repeated failure to comply with court orders justified AR
                    Shaun’s order striking out its claim. I therefore dismissed RA 322 of 2011
                    and RA 323 of 2011. As for RA 321 of 2011, I granted the plaintiff’s
                    application to have it withdrawn.</p>
