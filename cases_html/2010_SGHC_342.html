<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant applied for a temporary stay of
                    proceedings pending the resolution of an ongoing action in the Zurich Labour
                    Court (“the Zurich action”) between the same parties. The
                    application was based on the existence of a multiplicity of proceedings, without
                    reference to <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles.
                    After going through the evidence and hearing the submissions of both parties, I
                    granted the temporary stay. The plaintiff has appealed against my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is the international private
                    banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (“the RBS Group”)
                    and was incorporated in Switzerland. The defendant is a Swiss national and was
                    employed by the plaintiff on 1 June 1997 as General Manager of its
                    Singapore branch and Chief Operating Officer, Asia region by a letter of
                    appointment dated 18 April 2007. In 2000, by a letter of appointment dated
                    29 December 2000, which superseded the terms contained in the earlier
                    letter and provided for Swiss law as the governing law, the defendant returned
                    to Zurich and assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer. Subsequently,
                    with effect from 1 September 2006, the defendant was seconded to the
                    Singapore branch of the plaintiff as Chief Executive Officer, Coutts
                    International, in accordance with the terms of an International Assignment
                    Contract (“the IAC”) dated 24 August 2006. The IAC provided
                    that the terms and conditions of the defendant’s employment and secondment
                    were those of the “existing home country contract of employment together
                    with those terms and conditions set out in [the IAC]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2008, as a result of the financial crisis,
                    the RBS Group implemented a plan (“the Deferral Plan”) in which
                    its employees’ bonuses would be paid out by way of RBS bonds to be issued
                    in three separate instalments (“the Deferred Award”). In May 2009,
                    the defendant received a letter from the Group Director, Human Resources of the
                    RBS Group certifying that he had been granted an initial Deferred Award of
                    $427,077.00 and stipulating how this amount would be paid out. The first portion
                    of the defendant’s Deferred Award was to vest on 18 June 2010, the
                    second on 18 June 2011 and the third and last portion on 18 June 2012.
                    The letter also provided that if the defendant was to leave before part or all
                    of his Deferred Award vested, any outstanding instalments would normally be
                    forfeited and he would receive nothing. However, if he left for “specific
                    ‘good leaver’ reasons (e.g. redundancy, retirement, ill-health,
                    injury, disability, or disposal of a business)” any outstanding
                    instalments would vest in line with the normal timetable, subject to any
                    “clawback” that may subsequently be applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Alongside the Deferral Plan, the RBS Group gave
                    some of its employees the option of applying for a cash advance against the
                    value of their Deferred Award. The defendant took up this opportunity and
                    entered into a loan agreement (“the loan agreement”) with the
                    plaintiff on 24 July 2009 whereby he was advanced a sum of $171,022.00. The
                    loan agreement provided that the duration of the loan was the period beginning
                    the day the loan was drawn down and ending no later than 30 days after
                    18 June 2012. As to repayment, the loan agreement stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that the Deferred Award lapses under the terms on which the
                        Deferred Award is granted, the Borrower will be notified by the Lender that
                        this has happened and the whole Loan and accrued interest thereon will
                        become due and will require to be paid within 30 days from the date of the
                        Lender’s notice from the Borrower’s own resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As part of the “loan terms and
                    conditions” comprising the last three pages of the loan agreement, clause
                    1.15 stipulated that the agreement would be governed by Singapore law and that
                    “[t]he courts of Singapore have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
                    dispute arising out of or in connection with [the loan agreement] (including a
                    dispute the existence, validity or termination of [the loan
                    agreement])”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It was not disputed that the defendant’s
                    employment with the plaintiff was terminated on 28 February 2010, before
                    any part of his Deferred Award had vested. The lawfulness of the termination and
                    its effect on the Deferred Award was, however, in dispute and on 7 April
                    2010, the defendant commenced the Zurich action against the plaintiff claiming
                    that the plaintiff had wrongfully or abusively terminated the defendant’s
                    employment under Swiss law. Oral arguments took place on 17 June 2010 in
                    the Zurich Labour Court during which both parties were represented by
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       There, the defendant took the position that the
                    plaintiff’s John Baines had all along wanted to replace the defendant with
                    John Baines’ close friend and had created a situation in which the
                    defendant could be dismissed and his Deferred Award and other bonus payments
                    forfeited. The defendant therefore sought the payment of compensatory damages
                    for his wrongful dismissal. Additionally, the defendant claimed the payment of
                    outstanding bonuses and benefits due him (the Deferred Award included) on the
                    basis that he had effectively been rendered redundant and ought therefore to be
                    regarded as a “good leaver”. The reliefs sought by the defendant
                    in the Zurich action totalled CHF 1,197,972.00 (approximately
                    $1,590,335.14).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In contrast, the plaintiff took the position
                    that because the defendant had refused to return to Zurich when he had been
                    asked to, his termination was justified. Consequently, the defendant’s
                    Deferred Award and other bonus payments were forfeited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The next hearing in the Zurich action has been
                    scheduled for 30 November 2010. Although the plaintiff’s Swiss lawyers
                    viewed the Zurich action as only being in its preliminary stages, the
                    defendant’s Swiss lawyers explained on affidavit that this upcoming
                    hearing was to explore the possibility of an amicable settlement between the
                    parties, failing which judgment on the defendant’s claims would be
                    delivered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Meanwhile, on 29 July 2010, the plaintiff
                    commenced the present action against the defendant to recover the $171,022.00
                    plus interest it advanced to the defendant under the loan
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The two main issues in the present application
                    were: (1) whether the parallel Zurich action resulted in a multiplicity of
                    proceedings; and (2) if so, whether the court should exercise its discretion to
                    grant a temporary stay given the circumstances of the case, including the
                    existence of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the loan
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As a preliminary matter, I note that in its
                    written submissions, counsel for the plaintiff argued that <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles ought to be applicable in the
                    present stay application. However, it did not (and reasonably so) pursue this
                    point in oral submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As recognised by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 1192 (“<em>Chan Chin
                    Cheung</em>”) at [47], the granting of a limited stay order pending
                    conclusion of foreign proceedings did not require the application of <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles because “[u]nder
                    s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act [(Cap. 322, 2007 Rev Ed)]
                    and para 9 of the First Schedule thereto, or alternatively under the
                    inherent jurisdiction of the court, the court has the full discretion, for
                    sufficient reasons, to stay any proceedings before it until whatever appropriate
                    conditions are met.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For ease of reference, s  18 of the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature Act read with para 9 of the First Schedule
                    provides that the High Court has the power “to dismiss or stay
                    proceedings ... where by reason of multiplicity of proceedings in any court or
                    courts ... the proceedings ought not to be continued”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a multiplicity of proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the issue of whether there was a
                    multiplicity of proceedings, counsel for the plaintiff characterised the loan
                    agreement as an independent and stand-alone contract – the only relevance
                    of the Singapore proceedings to the Zurich action was that it raised a potential
                    set off to the claims made by the defendant there. Consequently, there was no
                    risk that different courts may come to differing conclusions on the same
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Counsel for the defendant, however, argued
                    that the issue of whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to payment under the
                    loan agreement (the subject of the present action) was inextricably intertwined
                    with the Zurich action which concerned, in substantial part, the issue of
                    whether or not the defendant was entitled to his bonus payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I agreed with counsel for the defendant.
                    According to the terms of the loan agreement set out in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above, whether or not the loan had become due depended on
                    whether or not the Deferred Award had lapsed. This was in turn governed by the
                    terms of the Deferral Plan and required the Singapore court to determine whether
                    or not the defendant was a “good leaver”. This same issue was
                    already before the Swiss courts in the Zurich action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There was therefore a substantial risk that
                    the Singapore courts and the Swiss courts could reach differing conclusions on
                    the issue of the plaintiff’s entitlement to the Deferred
                Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the court should exercise its discretion to grant a temporary
                stay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The more contentious issue was whether the
                    court should exercise its discretion to grant a temporary stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Referring to <em>Multi-Code
                        Electronics Industries (M) Bhd v Toh Chun Toh Gordon</em> [2009]
                    1 SLR(R) 1000 (“<em>Multi-Code</em>”), which was a case where the same plaintiff was
                    suing the same defendant in multiple jurisdictions, counsel for the plaintiff
                    argued that the threshold for granting a stay would be higher in the present
                    case where the plaintiff was not the plaintiff in the Zurich
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Additionally, on the authority of <em>Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd v UCO Bank</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 6 (“<em>Golden
                    Shore</em>”), counsel for the plaintiff argued that a court should
                    exercise its discretion to assist a party in breaching his contractual
                    commitment to an exclusive jurisdiction clause only where there were exceptional
                    circumstances amounting to strong cause, such as where there was a clearly more
                    appropriate forum and permitting reliance on the exclusive jurisdiction clause
                    may unfairly prejudice one party. These exceptional circumstances were,
                    according to the plaintiff, non-existent in the present
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I did not find the reliance on <em>Multi-Code</em> (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above) persuasive. There (at [33]-[34]), Chan Seng Onn J had distinguished
                    between three different situations involving a multiplicity of proceedings: (1)
                    where the same plaintiff “A” sues the same defendant
                    “B” in two jurisdictions on substantially the same causes of
                    action (<em>ie</em> a <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em>); (b) where the plaintiff “A” sues the
                    defendant “B” in Singapore but “A” is the defendant
                    in a suit brought by “B” in a foreign jurisdiction; and (c) where
                    “A” is the defendant in Singapore but is the plaintiff in the suit
                    in the foreign jurisdiction, and “B” is the plaintiff in Singapore
                    but the defendant in the foreign suit. In Chan J’s view, the legal
                    principles applicable to situation (a) would be quite different from those
                    applicable to situations (b) and (c). Once the defendants established that the
                    case fell within situation (a) the courts would rarely permit, except in very
                    unusual circumstances, the plaintiff to proceed in two different jurisdictions.
                    However, in all likelihood because he was faced with situation (a), Chan J
                    did not elaborate further on the applicable legal principles in situations (b)
                    and (c). Further, what Chan J had before him was an application for a
                        <em>permanent</em> stay rather than a <em>temporary</em> one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As apparent from <em>Chan Chin
                        Cheung</em> (<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), an
                    application for a temporary or limited stay ought to be treated differently from
                    a permanent stay. The facts of <em>Chan Chin Cheung</em>
                    were that the plaintiff had commenced a series of related Malaysian suits
                    (“the Malaysian suits”) against the defendants over the
                    administration of an estate. However, during the progress of the Malaysian
                    suits, the plaintiff made certain statements about the plaintiff and his conduct
                    of the Malaysian suits. The plaintiff then commenced a defamation action in
                    Singapore against the defendants. The defendants applied for a permanent stay of
                    the defamation action in Singapore. The Assistant Registrar hearing the
                    application refused to grant the stay. However, on appeal, the High Court
                    reversed the Assistant Registrar’s decision and granted a limited stay
                    (pending the outcome of the Malaysian suits) instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Court of Appeal endorsed the High
                    Court’s decision as a sensible and practical one (at [46]), <em>inter alia</em>, because it would: (1) minimise the risk of
                    conflicting judgments by enabling the Singapore courts to have the benefit of
                    the findings of the Malaysian court; (2) in doing so promote international
                    comity; and (3) ensure that the work done in relation to the Singapore action
                    would not go to waste. Although these statements were made in the context of its
                    consideration of <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles,
                    the Court of Appeal commented (at [47]) that a limited stay based on s 18
                    of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and para 9 of the First Schedule, or
                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court, was amply justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For a more detailed discussion of the
                    principles relating to when a court should exercise its discretion to grant a
                    limited stay on the basis of multiplicity of proceedings, I found the Australian
                    decisions cited to me by counsel for the defendant very helpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Sterling Pharmaceuticals
                        Pty Ltd v Boots &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd</em> (1992)
                    34 FCR 287 (“<em>Sterling
                        Pharmaceuticals</em>”) at [15], Lockhart J held that as a
                    court of superior record, the Federal Court of Australia had a general power to
                    control its proceedings, which extended to the power to order a temporary stay
                    pending the conclusion of proceedings in another court. The relevant factors to
                    be taken into account in considering such an application were set out at [16] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    Which proceeding was commenced
                        first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    Whether the termination of one proceeding is
                            likely to have a material effect on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    The public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    The undesirability of two courts competing to
                            see which of them determines common facts first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    Consideration of circumstances relating to
                            witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    Whether work done on pleadings, particulars,
                            discovery, interrogatories and preparation might be
                        wasted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    The undesirability of substantial waste of
                            time and effort if it becomes a common practice to bring actions in two
                            courts involving substantially the same issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    How far advanced the proceedings are in each
                            court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    The law should strive against permitting
                            multiplicity of proceedings in relation to similar issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">•    Generally balancing the advantages and
                            disadvantages to each party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In that case, the applicant sought a temporary stay of an action
                    in Australia pending the resolution of a similar action in New Zealand. The
                    Australian action was based on a complaint that a statement on the packaging of
                    a drug called Neurofen, that “Neurofen ... is as well tolerated as
                    Paracetamol”, was false and misleading in breach of ss 52 and 53 of
                    the Australian Trade Practices Act 1974. The New Zealand action related to the
                    same statement but the complaint was based on contravention of ss 9, 10 and
                    13 of New Zealand’s Fair Trading Act 1986. Although the court found that
                    the issues in both proceedings were not precisely the same, there was
                    substantial identity between them, and in order to avoid duplication in the
                    preparation and conduct of both proceedings, which would likely be especially
                    burdensome to both parties and their expert witnesses, the court held that it
                    was in the interests of justice to order an interim stay of the Australian
                    proceedings, which had been commenced about one year after the New Zealand
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     
          <em>Sterling
                        Pharmaceuticals</em> was cited approvingly by the High Court of
                    Australia in <em>Henry v Henry</em> (1996)
                    185 CLR 571 at 590 and in <em>CSR Ltd v Signa Insurance
                        Australia Ltd</em> (1997) 189 CLR 345 at 390-398. More
                    recently, in <em>Bella Products Pty Ltd v Creative Designs
                        International Ltd</em> [2009] FCA 868 (“<em>Bella Products</em>”), the Federal Court of Australia
                    applied the approach in <em>Sterling Pharmaceuticals</em>
                    and posited two propositions that summarised the principles stated in that case:
                    first, that for obvious reasons it is undesirable that two courts should
                    determine the same dispute; and second, practical considerations based on common
                    sense and fairness should dictate which action should proceed
                first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In my view, the considerations taken into
                    account by the Australian courts are consistent with the stance taken by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Chan Chin Cheung</em>, <em>ie</em>, the predominant considerations in applications for a
                    temporary stay of proceedings on the basis of a multiplicity of proceedings
                    would be practical ones relating to international comity, case management and
                    fairness to the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the facts of this case, I took into account
                    that it was undesirable to have both the Singapore and Swiss courts determine
                    the same issue of whether or not the defendant was entitled to the Deferred
                    Award, that the Zurich action had been commenced before the Singapore
                    proceedings and that the Zurich action was at a more advanced stage, with
                    arguments having already been exchanged. In the present action, the defendants
                    had entered an appearance but had not filed their defence. Permitting the Zurich
                    action to proceed before the Singapore action would minimise the risk of
                    conflicting outcomes, and promote international comity. Further, it would be
                    burdensome and oppressive to the parties and their witnesses for both
                    proceedings to progress concurrently as it is likely that there would be a
                    substantial amount of overlap in the facts and issues traversed. This is
                    particularly so in respect of the defendant who was an individual with limited
                    resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As for the exclusive jurisdiction clause in
                    favour of Singapore contained in the loan agreement, in my judgment, this was a
                    neutral factor in the analysis of whether or not a temporary stay ought to be
                    granted. The granting of a temporary stay would not amount to the court
                    assisting in a breach of a contractual arrangement, per <em>Golden Shore</em> at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above,
                    which concerned a <em>permanent</em> stay. After the
                    resolution of the Zurich action, the plaintiff could still continue with the
                    present action in Singapore to determine its rights under the loan
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     For the foregoing reasons, I granted the
                    defendant’s application for a stay pending the final determination of the
                    Zurich action with costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant fixed at
                    $2500, excluding reasonable disbursements.</p>
