<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        At the conclusion of the

trial, I awarded interlocutory judgment to the plaintiff against the defendant on her

claim with costs, on the basis that the defendant was entitled to 50% contribution on

liability, from both Third Parties. As the Third Parties have now appealed against my

judgment (in Civil Appeal No. 108 of 2002), I set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        On 3 August 2000 at about

5pm, Paul Bayliss Brown (the defendant) with his fiance Cindy Sim (the plaintiff) riding

pillion, was riding motorcycle no. FR 8924R (the motorcycle) along Commonwealth Avenue

West in the direction of Clementi Avenue 6. At the junction of the two roads, the

defendant stopped as the traffic light was red, and waited for the light to change to

green before he turned right into Clementi Avenue 6. As he moved off towards the right

after the traffic light had changed to green, lorry no. YG 8791P (the lorry) which was

driven by the first Third Party collided into the rear of the motorcycle.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        As a result of the

collision, both the plaintiff and defendant were thrown off the motorcycle; the plaintiff

landed on a pile of roadwork debris. They were taken to National University Hospital by

ambulance where an emergency operation was carried out on the plaintiff. The defendant

suffered minor injuries (cuts and bruises) but the injuries sustained by the plaintiff

were more serious. She suffered a degloving injury to her right knee, besides bruises to

her left forearm and right arm. The plaintiff was in and out of hospital for abut nine (9)

months thereafter for more operations and treatment, arising from her initial injuries.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The claim </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The plaintiff sued the

defendant (who has since married her) for negligence in his riding, management and control

of the motorcycle. She (inter alia) alleged that defendant had speeded, had failed to keep

a safe distance from the lorry, had failed to keep a proper or any lookout and had paid

insufficient regard to other vehicles at the junction, in particular the lorry, while

waiting to turn into Clementi Avenue 6.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The defendant denied he

was negligent. He contended that it was the first Third Party/lorry driver who was

negligent in the driving, control and management of the lorry and caused the collision.

After he had filed the defence, the defendant issued Third Party proceedings against both

the lorry driver and lorry owners (the second Third Party) and filed a statement of claim

against them. In the event he was found to be liable to the plaintiff, the defendant

claimed to be indemnified by the Third Parties.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        In the defence they filed

to the defendant's statement of claim, apart from admitting that it occurred, the Third

Parties denied the first Third Party caused the accident. Both Third Parties alleged that

it was the defendant who caused or contributed to the collision by his negligent driving

and control of the motorcycle. Consequently, they denied they were liable for any

indemnity or contribution towards the plaintiff's claim or for her costs or, the costs of

the third party proceedings.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The evidence</p>
<p align="justify">(i)    the plaintiff's and defendant's case</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        I will consider the

plaintiff's and defendant's evidence together as their testimony was fairly

straightforward. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        The plaintiff (PW2)

testified that on the day in question, she and the defendant were returning home to West

Coast Road via Clementi Avenue 6, after shopping at International Mega Mart (IMM). She and

the defendant were wearing crash helmets at the material time; this made conversation and

hearing difficult. The defendant was travelling on the extreme right lane which allowed

traffic to turn into Clementi Avenue 6; the lorry occupied the second lane from the right

with its wheels straddling onto the motorcycle's lane slightly (by about 20cm). As the

traffic lights turned green in favour of traffic proceeding straight towards Commonwealth

Avenue West, the defendant rode the motorcycle forward into the box junction preparing to

turn right. Suddenly, the defendant changed direction and proceeded straight ahead. The

motorcycle then travelled along Commonwealth Avenue West before it collided into a road

sign. She and the defendant were thrown off the motorcycle. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        Cross-examined, the

plaintiff (PW2) could not explain why the defendant rode the motorcycle straight instead

of turning right. She was unable to recollect clearly what transpired due to her shock

when she saw the lorry coming very close to her as the motorcycle was proceeding to turn

right. The plaintiff's recollection of events was unclear, no doubt due to the trauma she

experienced from the collision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        In his written testimony

(para 6), the defendant (DW1) had deposed that the traffic light had turned green in his

favour, when he moved the motorcycle forward, travelling in the middle of the extreme

right lane. In court, he corrected that statement and said that the junction did not have

a proper/permanent traffic light but only a temporary one as there were road works; there

was also no separate green arrow for turning traffic.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        Because of the road works

and the erection of a large silver metal siding at the junction, the defendant said it was

difficult to check for on-coming traffic without going forward, which was what he did when

the traffic light turned green. As he did so, he found to his horror that the protruding

(undercarriage) portion of the lorry had locked onto the rear portion of the motorcycle.

He moved forward to wrest the motorcycle free of the lorry's hold. He then leaned to his

right to try to move away from the lorry which was already turning right but, the

handlebars of the motorcycle failed to respond. As he was leaning right, he felt a massive

force at the motorcycle's left rear side. It happened so quickly (in a matter of seconds)

that he was not aware of what hit him. The next thing he knew was, that the motorcycle had

turned 90 angle across the front of the lorry; he had no alternative but to throttle as

hard as he could to get out of the lorry's path. He then felt an even greater force

hitting the left rear side of the motorcycle. The defendant said he managed to avoid the

lorry and headed in the direction of the road-works sign which had been placed at the

junction. He braked very hard and (with the plaintiff) was thrown off the motorcycle; he

went over its handle bars and security screen, was thrown back onto and then underneath,

the motorcycle while the plaintiff landed in a pile of debris.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        Questioned by the court

on the plaintiff's testimony that he had suddenly changed direction and proceeded straight

instead of turning right, the defendant pointed out that the plaintiff was only a pillion

rider, she had no experience in driving a powerful machine (1,200 cc) like the motorcycle.

He, on the other hand, had over 30 years' experience as a motorcyclist. Consequently, it

was only her perception he had changed direction to go straight when in actual fact he was

trying desperately to disengage the motorcycle from the lorry. The defendant explained

that the motorcycle had a 'crumple zone' which enabled him to maintain his balance when

the lorry hit the machine; otherwise he would not have survived the collision. In effect,

the lorry collided twice with the motorcycle.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        The defendant denied the

first Third Party's allegation in the latter's police report, that he had failed to turn

right. On the contrary, the defendant asserted, he had turned right, having first switched

on his signal lights to indicate his intention to do so. It was the lorry driver who had

failed to notice his presence, according to what the first Third Party told the defendant

immediately after the collision. It was the lorry that collided into the motorcycle, not

vice versa. He further denied the first Third Party's allegation that he smelt of alcohol

when he approached the first Third Party after the collision. The defendant contended he

did not consume alcohol at IMM, not even a beer. Neither was he going fast, nor was he in

a hurry as, the plaintiff only needed to be in Bishan two (2) hours later for a dinner

appointment with her mother. He was not travelling too close to the lorry either. He

disagreed with counsel's suggestion that it was the motorcycle which had grazed the lorry

but conceded he could have allowed the lorry to turn right first.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        Cross-examined, the

defendant confirmed that the lorry straddled his lane, even though this fact was omitted

from his affidavit as well as from his police report (which was lodged five [5] days

later). He had stopped at the junction when the lorry drew up alongside about 1.5m away

from the motorcycle. Although he was a foreigner, the defendant had been in Singapore for

about 4 years, at the time of the accident. Questioned by the court, the defendant

clarified that the extreme right lane in which he was travelling was the compulsory

turning lane whereas, the second lane which the lorry occupied was an optional turning

lane, which also allowed traffic to proceed straight to Commonwealth Avenue West. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        The plaintiff had called

as her witness the investigating officer of the accident. However, the evidence of

Sergeant Chong Mui Fong (PW1) was not particularly helpful as, she arrived at the scene at

about 6.30pm, by which time the plaintiff and defendant had been taken to National

University Hospital. She said the first Third Party did not mention in his statement to

the police that the defendant smelt of alcohol at the time. The police damage report (see

1AB9) prepared by Sergeant Chong showed that the motorcycle had its front tyre punctured,

its steering broken and its two (2) side panniers scratched and damaged. The lorry on the

other hand showed no visible damage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(<i>ii)    the Third Party's case </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        I turn now to consider

the testimony presented for the Third Parties by the first Third Party, who was the only

witness for their case. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        The 68 year old first

Third Party (who has more than 40 years' experience as a lorry driver and still drives for

the second Third Party) testified that on the day of the accident, he wanted to get onto

the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) via Clementi Avenue 6. The lorry has an unladen and a

laden, weight of 8 and 16 tons respectively with 6 tyres, two (2) in front and four (4) at

the rear. He said he was then on his way to make a delivery of steel plates to a work-site

at Telok Blangah Road, with two (2) workers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        At the junction of

Clementi Avenue 6 and Commonwealth Road West, the first Third Party said he took the

second lane from the lane as firstly, it would be easier for him to negotiate the turn

into Clementi Avenue 6 (due to the length and size of the lorry) and secondly, there were

road works which precluded him from turning in the extreme right lane. He did not see the

motorcycle in the lane to his right although it was a clear day, the road surface was dry

and traffic conditions were moderate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        The first Third Party

testified that as he approached the junction, the light was red. He stopped the lorry just

before the white line; within seconds, the light changed green in his favour so he moved

forward, looked into his mirror and turned right when he saw no oncoming traffic. Under

cross-examination, the first Third Party clarified he did not look into his rear view

mirror, only in his right wing mirror. He then heard a screeching sound of tyres at which

point, he noticed there was a motorcycle on his right which had grazed the front right

tyre of the lorry; the motorcyclist (the defendant) then rode straight ahead and collided

into a road sign. He stopped the lorry, came out, saw the defendant and the plaintiff and

went forward to see if he could offer any assistance. The defendant appeared to be helping

the plaintiff. He deposed he smelt alcohol on the latter's breath when the defendant

approached him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        After the plaintiff and

the defendant had been taken away to hospital by ambulance, the first Third Party lodged a

police report. He was never charged by the traffic police for any offence in relation to

the accident.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        The first Third Party

insisted he did not collide into the motorcycle at all; he maintained it was the

motorcycle which had grazed the front right tyre of the lorry. He denied the lorry had

straddled the right lane occupied by the motorcycle. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        Re-examined, the first

Third Party explained that the two (2) passengers in the lorry with him that day were

foreign workers who had since left Singapore and gone back to India; hence, their absence

from court. Even so, the Third Parties could have taken statements from the foreign

workers before they returned to India.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        I was of the view on the

evidence, that the acts of omission of both the defendant and the first Third Party

contributed to the collision which resulted in the plaintiff's injuries. On the

defendant's part, he failed to move away from the lorry when the vehicle came too close to

him. On the part of the lorry driver, he failed to notice the motorcycle at all. As I

could not determine further on the evidence who was more negligent, I held the defendant

and the first Third Party to be equally liable. The second Third Party was sued

vicariously for the acts of the first Third Party, who was their servant or agent.

Consequently, the second Third Party was also liable with the first Third Party, for 50%

contribution to the plaintiff's claim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        In counsel's final

submissions made on behalf of the Third Parties, he made much of what he considered were

inconsistencies in the defendant's testimony. He had argued that his clients should not be

liable at all, pointing out that the defendant's police report (lodged on 8 August 2000)

did not mention material particulars adduced from him in court, namely: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the position of the lorry at the time of the accident;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) that the lorry straddled the extreme right lane;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iii) that there was a protrusion from the lorry which locked onto the

    rear portion of the motorcycle.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        Counsel (Anparasan)

submitted there was also a discrepancy between the defendant's police report and his oral

testimony in that in the former, the defendant had stated there was one (1) whereas in

court, he testified there were two (2) collisions. The defendant's oral testimony was also

discrepant with the sketch plan he drew in his police report; the position of the lorry

did not show that it straddled the extreme right lane. Given that the police report was

not lodged on the day itself but 5 days after the accident, the defendant's excuse of

trauma being the reason for the inaccuracies in his sketch/the police report cannot be

true. Counsel said that the alleged straddling by the lorry onto the motorcycle's lane was

a very material fact which, if true, meant that the first Third Party was negligent.

However, such a material fact was not even pleaded in the defendant's statement of claim

against the Third Parties. It was also not reflected in the plaintiff's written testimony.

As such, counsel asked the court to ignore the defendant's allegation that the lorry

straddled the motorcycle's lane.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        I was not persuaded by

counsel's submissions that the discrepancies between the defendant's oral testimony and

his police report were so material as to render the defendant's testimony unreliable. I

would point out that by the same token, the first Third Party's oral testimony was also

discrepant with the police report he himself lodged the very same day. In his written

testimony, the first Third Party had alleged that the defendant's breath smelt of alcohol.

Yet such a material fact was neither mentioned on 3 August 2000 to Sergeant Chong nor

stated in the first Third Party's police report. It was obviously an afterthought

concocted to put the defendant in a bad light. I do not put too much store in what is

stated in a police report, bearing in mind that more often than not (although not

applicable to the defendant here), it is a police officer who helps a party to write out

the report.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        What I noted was, the

damage to the motorcycle recorded in the police damage report and shown in the defendant's

photographs was consistent with the testimony of the defendant. The lorry escaped damage

because the force it applied to the motorcycle was due to its hooking some part of the

motorcycle and it dragged the motorcycle forward when making the right turn; there were no

collisions as such although the defendant felt the sensation of the impacts as if the

motorcycle was being hit in the rear. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        I was mindful of the fact

that the defendant and the plaintiff are now husband and wife but I do not think that fact

per se rendered the plaintiff's testimony any the less credible. She had said she did not

know why the defendant suddenly changed direction to go straight instead of turning right

and left it to him to explain his actions to the court; there was no attempt by her to

cover up for him. The defendant's fault lay in his being too close to the lorry. He owed

himself a duty as a road-user to be careful even if other road-users were careless. Had

the defendant been more observant, even granted he was wearing a safety helmet, he would

have noticed how dangerously close the lorry was, and should have shifted the motorcycle

more to his right.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        As for the first Third

Party, his cross-examination (N/E 21) had adduced the following evidence:-</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: When you were approaching junction, did you see the motorcycle on

    the right lane?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I didn't see the motorcycle and there were no other vehicles as

    well. </p>
<p align="justify">Q: When you stopped at junction, did you see motorcycle to your right?</p>
<p align="justify">A:    There was no vehicle/motorcycle on the right side.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: When was the first time you saw the motorcycle?</p>
<p align="justify">A: When motorcycle grazed front right tyre of my lorry.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The testimony supported my conclusion that the first Third Party failed

to keep a proper lookout for other traffic on the road. Clearly there were other vehicles

or at least one other vehicle (the motorcycle), on the road alongside him; he just did not

see. Neither did he notice he was straddling the lane to his right, nor did he have any

inkling the lorry had hooked onto and dragged the motorcycle along until he was alerted by

the screeching sound.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        I therefore concluded

that the first Third Party was not paying enough attention to surrounding traffic that

day. The lorry was much higher and bigger than the motorcycle and its driver should have

seen the defendant and the plaintiff quite easily had he really checked the right side

mirror (as he claimed) and looked into the rear view mirror. The first Third Party

testified that he did not see any tyre marks on the road. That must mean he did not apply

the brakes of the lorry at all, because he did not see the motorcycle. It would also be

consistent with the defendant's testimony that the motorcycle was dragged along by the

lorry's momentum and the motorcycle's brakes/handlebars were rendered useless, after the

machine became entangled with part of the lorry's undercarriage. The defendant managed to

disengage the motorcycle at one stage and I believe the direction change thereafter was

not voluntary but done to avoid the lorry; otherwise the motorcycle may have gone under

the wheels of the lorry.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        While the defendant was

undoubtedly liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she suffered as a result of the

accident, the first Third Party was equally responsible for what happened. Consequently,

it was only fair to apportion liability equally between the parties, which I did.</p>
