<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal brought by Thong Ah Fat
                    (“the Appellant”) against the decision of the trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>Public Prosecutor v Thong Ah
                        Fat</em> [2010] SGHC 227 (“the Judgment”). The
                    Appellant was charged with committing the following offence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center">That you, <b><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Thong Ah
                        Fat</font></b>,</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">on 12 January 2009, at or about 4.55 p.m., at the Woodlands
                        Checkpoint Green Channel Arrival Car Zone 100% Inspection Pit, Singapore,
                        did import into Singapore a controlled drug that is specified in Class
                        “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter
                        185, to wit, by driving into Singapore a car bearing Malaysian registration
                        number JKQ 7274 with drugs containing not less than 142.41 grams of
                        Diamorphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations
                        made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under
                        section 7 and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs
                        Act, Chapter 185.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge, in a brief judgment of five paragraphs, explained why he
                    found the Appellant guilty of the charge and upon convicting him, sentenced him
                    to suffer the mandatory death penalty. To facilitate the understanding of our
                    grounds, we think it will be helpful to set out the Judgment in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    The accused was a 32-year old Malaysian. He drove to
                            Singapore on 12 January 2009 and arrived at the Woodlands
                            Checkpoint about 4.55pm. His car JKQ 7274 was searched and 142.41g
                            of diamorphine were found in ten packets wrapped in plastic. Five of the
                            packets were found under the driver’s seat and another five were
                            found in the haversack found on the floorboard behind the driver’s
                            seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The prosecution adduced evidence to show that the
                            ten packets contained 142.41g of diamorphine. The accused did not
                            challenge the scientific evidence and the defence was that the accused
                            thought that he was carrying “ice”, the colloquial term
                            for methamphetamine, which is a different drug from
                        diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    The prosecution adduced one contemporaneous
                            statement by the accused and recorded by Senior Staff Sergeant Koh
                            Yew Fie (“SSSgt Koh”) on 12 January 2009, and
                            six other statements recorded by Woman Inspector Wong Jin Shan Agnes on
                            14 January 2009, 15 January 2009, 16 January 2009 (two
                            statements) and 16 September 2009. The accused only challenged the
                            admissibility of the statement recorded by SSSgt Koh. He claimed
                            that the statement was not voluntarily given because SSSgt Koh
                            falsely induced him to admit that he knew that he was carrying
                            diamorphine. The statement referred to the diamorphine as “Beh
                            Hoon”, the common term for heroin, but the accused denied knowing
                            that. <b><em>I disbelieved him and his account of what
                                happened between him and SSSgt Koh because it was neither
                                convincing nor coherent.</em></b> Furthermore, the accused claimed
                            that he gave the statement after he was told by SSSgt Koh
                                “<em>if you want to enjoy you must live with
                                the consequences</em>”. <b><em>His
                                testimony did not convince me that this led to a weakening of his
                                resolve such that he gave answers to SSSgt Koh’s
                                questions which he would not have done so
                                otherwise</em></b><em>.</em> He was also
                            inconsistent as to when this remark by SSSgt Koh was made. The
                            accused’s second assertion was that SSSgt Koh told him that
                            he (SSSgt Koh) would speak to the judge and get the court to
                            sentence the accused to “8 to 10” years imprisonment only.
                                <b><em>The evidence of the accused on this point was
                                weak, and even if I found that this was true</em></b>, he admitted
                            that such a statement was only said once and that it was made after he
                            had already given the answers. Consequently, I admitted the statement as
                            I was satisfied that it was not made under any threat, inducement, or
                            promise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    The accused’s defence was that he had no
                            knowledge that the ten packets contained heroin. He asserted that only
                            one packet was opened and he had no idea that the other nine contained
                            the same white powdery substance. He claimed that he believed he was
                            carrying “ice”, a different drug from diamorphine. He said
                            that he used to smoke “ice” in Malaysia and he had been
                            enticed into smoking it by his supplier. Counsel for the accused
                            submitted that [t]he accused was a gullible person. He did not, however,
                            seem so to me. <b><em>The evidence given by the accused was
                                very thin and did not raise any doubt in my mind that he knew that
                                he was carrying diamorphine</em></b><em>.</em> Additionally, he failed to give a reasonable
                            explanation as to why he did not say in his s 122(6) statement that
                            he thought he was carrying diamorphine. Instead, he said that he had
                            nothing to say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    For the reasons above, I was satisfied that the
                            accused knew that he was carrying diamorphine in the ten packets seized
                            from him on the day of his arrest. I therefore found him guilty as
                            charged and sentenced him to suffer death.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The substantive issue arising from the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant did not dispute that he knew he
                    was importing controlled drugs into Singapore without authorisation at the
                    material time. What was disputed at trial and on appeal was the
                    Appellant’s knowledge pertaining to the nature of drugs found in his
                    possession. The crux of the Appellant’s defence was that while he knew he
                    was importing controlled drugs into Singapore, he thought that he was
                    transporting methamphetamine and not diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>”), this Court observed that there
                    are two possible interpretations of the requisite <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> under s 7 of the Misuse of
                    Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The first is
                    that it suffices that the accused only had knowledge that the drug concerned is
                    a controlled drug (“the first interpretation”): see <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [80] and [83]–[89]. The
                    alternative interpretation is that the requisite knowledge is knowledge that the
                    drug concerned is not only a controlled drug but also the specific drug, which
                    it turns out, the accused was in possession of (“the second
                    interpretation”): see <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [81]
                    and [90]–[91].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Because the parties in <em>Tan
                        Kiam Peng</em> did not make any detailed argument with respect to
                    which of these two interpretations was correct, no definitive conclusion on this
                    point was expressed by this Court then. This Court based its eventual decision
                    on the second interpretation to give the accused person there the benefit of the
                    doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       For completeness, we should mention that since
                    this appeal was heard, an important decision of this Court, <em>Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2011] SGCA 49 (“<em>Nagaenthran</em>”), has clarified the position on this issue. In
                        <em>Nagaenthran</em>, this Court stated that (at
                        [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, while there may be a conceptual distinction between [the
                        first interpretation] (that the knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA refers
                        to knowledge that the drug is a controlled drug) and [the second
                        interpretation] (that the knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA refers to
                        knowledge that the drug is a specific controlled drug, <em>eg</em>, heroin or “ice”), <b><em>the
                            distinction has no practical significance for the purposes of rebutting
                            the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled
                            drug</em></b>. <b><em>To rebut the presumption of
                            knowledge, all the accused has to do is to prove, on a balance of
                            probabilities, that he </em></b><em>did not
                            know</em><b><em> the nature of the controlled drug
                            referred to in the charge.</em></b> The material issue in s 18(2)
                        of the MDA is <em>not</em> the existence of the
                        accused’s knowledge of the controlled drug, <em>but</em> the <em>non-existence</em> of such
                        knowledge on his part. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence adduced</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Given our determination that there should be a
                    retrial in this case, we will confine the scope and detail of our discussion of
                    the evidence to that necessary to explain our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Defence relied on certain events and
                    circumstances which allegedly existed and caused the Appellant to form his
                    mistaken belief that he was carrying methamphetamine. These allegations
                    included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     several occasions where the Appellant
                        consumed drugs at his drug supplier’s place in Malaysia, where only
                        methamphetamine was involved (“the Consumption
                        Incidents”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     a prior trafficking incident (“the First Trafficking
                        Incident”) which he carried out for the aforementioned drug supplier,
                        one Wong Chan Hoong (“Ah Hong”) and allegedly learnt that the
                        trafficked drugs would be methamphetamine;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     the fact that he did not check the contents of
                        the packets on the occasion which resulted in his arrest;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     his own
                        gullibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Prosecution adduced a statement which was
                    recorded from the Appellant shortly after his arrest (“the
                    contemporaneous statement”), a cautioned statement which was recorded
                    pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and various long statements which were
                    recorded during the course of subsequent investigations, pursuant to s 121
                    of the CPC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The contemporaneous statement contained several
                    questions put to the Appellant and his replies to those questions. Its
                    admissibility was challenged by the Defence. The Appellant’s reply to the
                    charge and warning, as recorded in the cautioned statement, was that he had
                    nothing to say. Its admissibility was unchallenged. The long statements revealed
                    the Appellant’s background, his supplier of controlled drugs for
                    consumption and trafficking (namely Ah Hong), Ah Hong’s associates, the
                    particulars of the Consumption Incidents, the particulars of the First
                    Trafficking Incident and the events which took place on the day of his arrest.
                    The admissibility and veracity of the long statements were also unchallenged.
                    The nature and relevance of all these statements will be further discussed where
                    they are germane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s findings of fact and reasoning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge made the following findings of fact.
                    He disbelieved the Appellant’s account of the recording of the
                    contemporaneous statement because “it was neither convincing nor
                    coherent” (at [3] of the
                    Judgment). Pursuant to a <em>voir dire</em>, the Judge held
                    that the contemporaneous statement was voluntarily given and therefore admitted
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The other findings of fact were encapsulated
                    within a paragraph (at [4] of the
                    Judgment). The Judge found that the Appellant “did not …
                    seem” to be a gullible person, as Defence counsel had submitted. The
                    implication of this finding was unclear from the context of the Judgment. This
                    finding seemed to be made in rebuttal to the Appellant’s assertion that he
                    believed himself to be carrying methamphetamine instead of diamorphine at the
                    material time, due to the Consumption Incidents in Malaysia. However, the Judge
                    made no finding on or mention of the First Trafficking Incident at all. The
                    Judge did, however, go on to observe that the Appellant’s evidence was
                    “very thin” and did not raise any doubt in his mind that the
                    Appellant knew that he was carrying diamorphine (at [4] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Judge also held that the Appellant
                    “failed to give a reasonable explanation as to why he did not say in his
                    [cautioned statement] that he thought he was carrying <b><em>diamorphine</em></b>” [emphasis added] (at [4] of the Judgment). We pause to note that
                    this was an incorrect statement. It should have read
                    “methamphetamine” in place of “diamorphine”. In
                    addition, it appears from the Judge’s language that an adverse inference
                    was drawn against the Appellant with respect to this omission to give a
                    reasonable explanation. As a consequence of the Appellant’s “very
                    thin” evidence and his failure to give a reasonable explanation with
                    respect to the omission in his cautioned statement, the Judge was satisfied that
                    the Appellant knew that he was carrying diamorphine in the ten packets seized
                    from him on the day of his arrest (at [4]–[5] of the
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With respect, the Judge’s findings are
                    problematic and his reasoning is unclear. Before we set out our reasons for
                    ordering a retrial of this matter, we think it will be helpful to set out the
                    scope of the judicial duty to give reasoned decisions, as it is our view that
                    this duty has not been adequately discharged in the present
                matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We emphasise that this crucial judicial duty
                    to give reasons prevails in both civil and criminal cases. Although this duty is
                    not expressly stated under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of
                    2010) (“CPC 2010”) or the CPC, which is the applicable
                    statute in this case, it is a duty which is inherent in our common law, at least
                    since the Privy Council’s decision in <em>Lai Wee Lian v
                        Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd</em> [1984] 1 AC 729
                        (“<em>Lai Wee Lian</em>”) (see below at
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). The significance of this duty, it
                    cannot be gainsaid, is even starker in capital cases where detailed reasoning
                    and grounds justifying the outcome ought to be given by the trial judge as a
                    matter of course. Unfortunately, this was not the case here for reasons that we
                    explicate below. We will turn to examine the following aspects of the basis and
                    scope of the judicial duty to give reasons <em>seriatim</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The judicial duty to give reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     About two centuries ago, Lord Mansfield
                    reportedly gave to a general who had to sit as a judge the following advice :
                    “[N]ever give your reasons; for your judgment will probably be right, but
                    your reasons will certainly be wrong”: see Lord Campbell, <em>The Lives of the Chief Justices of England</em> vol 3
                    (James Cockcroft &amp; Co, 1874) at p 481. Today, such advice even from a
                    jurist as eminent as Lord Mansfield, would be regarded as judicial heresy
                    and inimical to sound judicial practice. Judicial decisions that are bereft of
                    reasoning are, of course, impervious to scrutiny and challenge, effectively
                    making judges unaccountable for their decisions. This is plainly unacceptable in
                    any modern society. We note that historically, as the role of juries in
                    fact-finding declined, it has been acknowledged in all mature common law
                    jurisdictions as an elementary principle of fairness that parties are not only
                    to be given a fair opportunity to be heard, but also apprised of how and why a
                    judge has reached his decision. Lord Denning, with his inimitable clarity,
                    incisively pointed out more than half a century ago that (Alfred Denning,
                        <em>The Road to Justice</em> (Stevens, 1955) at
                    p 29):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n order that a trial should be fair, it is necessary, not only that a
                        correct decision should be reached, but also that it should be seen to be
                        based on reason; and that can only be seen, if the judge states his
                        reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is now settled law that a judge must ordinarily give adequate
                    reasons for any decision made, subject to any peculiar circumstances that may
                    prevail. This is not only the case where the decision is on a matter involving
                    questions of law; the trial judge who sits as a fact-finder also has a duty to
                    give reasons for decisions on matters of fact: see H L Ho, “The
                    Judicial Duty to Give Reasons” (2000) 20 Legal Studies 42 (Ho,
                    “The Judicial Duty to Give Reasons”) for a useful overview of the
                    duty under discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Before evaluating the content and scope of the
                    duty to give reasons, it will be useful, at this juncture, to consider the
                    function of a legal decision. A legal decision may operate on several levels. It
                    can declare the institutional fact of guilt/liability or
                    non-guilt/non-liability, assert propositions of facts underlying or constitutive
                    of the alleged guilt or liability and/or ascribe legal character to the facts as
                    found: see H L Ho, “What Does a Verdict Do? A Speech Act
                    Analysis of Giving a Verdict” (2006) 4(2) International Commentary
                    on Evidence 1 (Ho, “What does a Verdict Do?”). In this
                    regard, we agree with Professor Ho that (Ho, “What does a Verdict
                    Do?” at 26):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A verdict can be assessed on many dimensions corresponding to the things
                        that it does; indeed, we should insist that it be <em>defensible on each of those fronts</em>. As a declarative, it can
                        be <em>evaluated</em> as valid or not, and as an
                        assertive, it can be <em>judged</em> as true or false.
                        Further, a verdict can be <em>assessed</em> in terms of
                        right and wrong in its ascription of legal character to the facts of the
                        case. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A legal decision will therefore be deprived of
                    many of its illocutionary forces if no sufficient reason is stated, simply
                    because there can then be no ground for one to stand on to defend its
                    correctness. A <em>legal</em> judgment today cannot be
                    justified solely by the judge’s statement of belief that it is right,
                    without providing any explanation as to why it is so. The days when it sufficed
                    for a judge to say “Because I say so” are well behind us. The
                    legal cogency and coherence of a decision must therefore also be demonstrated to
                    justify it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Coleman v Dunlop
                        Limited</em> [1998] PIQR 398 (“<em>Coleman</em>”), a decision of the English Court of Appeal,
                    Henry LJ neatly summarised the position on the duty to give reasons in the
                    following terms (at 403):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that, in relation to matters in these courts, there is no
                        statutory duty on the judge to give reasons. It is also true that for a long
                        time it has been contended that the common law imposed no such duty. But the
                        common law is a living thing, and it seems to me that the point has now come
                        where the common law has evolved to the point that the judge, on the trial
                        of the action, must give sufficient reasons to make clear his findings of
                        primary fact and the inferences that he draws from those primary facts and
                        sufficient to resolve the live issues before him, explaining why he has
                        drawn those inferences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Australian courts have been even more explicit on this issue. It
                    has been declared that the issue no longer is whether judicial officers owe a
                    duty to state reasons for their decisions, but the extent of that obligation:
                    see <em>Waterson v Batten</em> (13 May 1988,
                    unreported) (New South Wales Court of Appeal) (“<em>Waterson</em>”) (<em>per</em>
                    Kirby P). Henry LJ could also have profitably referred to the
                    English Court of Appeal’s decision of <em>Craven v
                        Craven</em> (1957) 107 LJ 505 as authority for introducing a
                    requirement for trial judges to give judgments which are reasoned to the extent
                    of stating the findings of fact on which they rely. In Singapore, the Privy
                    Council had, in the context of an appeal from Singapore, emphatically
                    underscored the requirement to state reasons at the end of a trial in the
                    following words (<em>Lai Wee Lian</em> at 734):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The need for a judge to state the reasons for his decision is no mere
                        technicality, nor does it depend mainly on the rules of court. <em>It is an important part of a judge’s duty in every case,
                            when he gives a final judgment at the end of a trial, to state the
                            grounds of his decision, unless there are special reasons, such as
                            urgency, for not doing so.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature and rationale for such a duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In Australia, the duty is construed as one
                    aspect of the general duty to act judicially. For instance, it was stated in
                        <em>Pettitt v Dunkley</em> [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 at
                    387–388 that there is as much a judicial duty:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">to give reasons in an appropriate case as there is otherwise a duty to act
                        judicially, such as to hear arguments of counsel and hear evidence and admit
                        relevant evidence of a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, it is now considered an indivisible incident of the
                    judicial process: see, for example, <em>Soulemezis v Dudley
                        (Holdings) Pty Ltd</em> (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 (“<em>Soulemezis</em>”) at 279 and <em>Public
                        Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond</em> (1986)
                    63 ALR 559 (“<em>Public Service Board of
                        NSW</em>”) at 566. Likewise, in England, the Court of Appeal
                    held in <em>Flannery and Another v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd
                        (trading as Colleys Professional Services)</em> [2000]
                    1 WLR 377 (“<em>Flannery</em>”) at
                    381 that the duty is “<em>a function of due process, and
                        therefore of justice”</em> [emphasis added]<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There are several reasons for recognising a
                    duty to give reasons. The English Court of Appeal in <em>Coleman</em> identified three such reasons. First, Henry LJ said
                    (at 403):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Giving reasons is a salutary discipline to all whose judgments may
                        adversely affect their fellow citizens. The giving of reasons ensures that
                        the parties’ relevant submissions are confronted and not
                        avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He quoted Lord Donaldson MR in <em>Tramountana </em><em>Armadora SA v Atlantic Shipping
                        Co SA</em> [1978] 2 All ER 870 at 872, who said that
                    “[h]aving to give reasons concentrates the mind wonderfully.” The
                    recognition of a duty to give reasons, it is hoped, will lead to increased care
                    in the dealing with submissions and analysis of evidence, giving rise to sounder
                    decisions. As Meagher JA stated in <em>Beale v Government
                        Insurance Office of NSW</em> (1997) 48 NSWLR 430
                        (“<em>Beale</em>”) at 442, “[t]he
                    requirement to provide reasons can operate prophylactically on the judicial
                    mind, guarding against the birth of an unconsidered or impulsive
                    decision.” As the fact-finder is reminded through the exercise of stating
                    his reasons that he is accountable for how he decides, mis-analysis of the
                    evidence will be more readily avoided. In short, it has a
                    “self-educative” value, hones the exercise of judicial discretion
                    and encourages judges to make well-founded decisions: see Doron Menashe,
                    “The Requirement of Reasons for Findings of Fact” (2006)
                    International Community L Rev 223 at 230.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Secondly, the duty ensures that when the
                    parties leave the court, after having had their day in court, they know why they
                    have won or lost: see <em>Coleman</em> at 403. From a
                    broader perspective, the legal profession and the community may ordinarily have
                    legitimate interests in knowing these reasons. It enables practitioners,
                    legislators and members of the public to ascertain the basis upon which like
                    cases will probably be decided in the future. It was also observed in <em>Beale</em> at 442 that since “[d]ecisions of courts
                    usually influence the way in which society acts … it is better to
                    understand why one should act [or not act] in a particular
                way.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Thirdly, the duty to give reasons ensures that
                    the appellate court has the proper material to understand, and do justice to,
                    the decisions taken at first instance: see <em>Coleman</em>
                    at 403. The appellate court should not “be left to speculate from
                    collateral observations as to the reasoning upon which a critical decision is
                    made, when the trial judge can and ought directly to reveal it”: see
                        <em>Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission and
                        Another</em> [1977] 1 NSWLR 697 at 701. In <em>Pettitt v Dunkley</em>, Moffitt JA supported this third reason in
                    rather different terms. He observed that the first instance judge not only has a
                    duty to determine and enforce the rights of parties at a trial, but also a duty
                    to, within limits, preserve and facilitate any right of appeal from his decision
                    which a party may have (<em>Pettitt v Dunkley</em> at 388).
                    Unlike Henry LJ in <em>Coleman</em>, Moffitt JA
                    grounded the duty to give reasons entirely on the right of appeal, and held that
                    there was no judicial duty to give reasons except where such a duty could be
                    related to a right of appeal. But his narrow view was repudiated in <em>Soulemezis</em> at 269 and <em>Housing
                        Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar </em><em>Pastoral Co Pty Ltd and Penrith Pastoral Co Pty Ltd</em> [1983]
                    3 NSWLR 378 (“<em>Housing Commission of
                        NSW</em>”) at 386. We prefer the view of Henry LJ, who
                    took a broader view of the policies underlying the duty, to that of
                    Moffitt JA in <em>Pettitt v Dunkley</em>. The duty
                    ordinarily applies even where there can be no appeal against that
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Additionally, a fourth reason was provided by
                    Kirby P in his celebrated dissenting judgment in <em>Soulemezis</em> at 258. Kirby P penetratingly observed that the
                    requirement for judges to give reasoned decisions which can be debated, attacked
                    and defended acts as an important constraint on the judiciary’s exercise
                    of power. The duty to articulate reasons is a means of curbing arbitrariness,
                    and is a facet of judicial accountability: see <em>Beale</em> at 442 (<em>per</em>
                    Meagher JA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Judicial accountability is associated with the
                    notion of open justice. Hence, another foundation of the duty to give reasons is
                    the principle that justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done:
                    see <em>Soulemezis</em> at 278 (<em>per</em> McHugh JA). Where the reasons for an adverse ruling are
                    not revealed, the litigant may think that the judge has not really understood
                    his case, and the public may form the same opinion. The withholding of reasons
                    may therefore affect the legitimacy of the decision. In our view, the
                    requirement to give reasons beneficially increases the transparency of the
                    judicial system.</p>

          <em>Regina v Harrow Crown
                        Court, Ex </em>
<em>parte Dave</em> [1994]
                    1 WLR 98 (“<em>Ex parte Dave</em>”)
                    exemplifies the importance of having reasons adequately stated. The applicant
                    brought an appeal to the Crown Court against her conviction by justices for an
                    offence of assault. The appeal was dismissed. The Crown Court simply stated:
                    “[o]ver the course of three days we have had ample opportunity to hear
                    and to assess the witnesses. It is our unanimous conclusion that this appeal
                    must be dismissed” (<em>Ex parte Dave</em> at 102H).
                    The applicant sought judicial review to quash the decision of the Crown Court.
                    The application was granted by the Queen’s Bench Division, which held
                    that, in principle, enough must be said “to demonstrate that the court
                    has identified the main contentious issues in the case and how it has resolved
                    each of them” (<em>Ex parte Dave</em> at 107A).
                    Although “[e]laborate reasoning was not required” (<em>Ex parte Dave</em> at 107B), the statement made by the Crown
                    Court was clearly inadequate because effectively no reason was given. Against
                    the holding of the Crown Court, one may argue that it was implicit in the
                    dismissal of the applicant’s appeal that there was a finding by the Crown
                    Court that it accepted the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses. But
                    this argument is clearly flawed, because if it is taken to its logical
                    conclusion, no reason needs ever be stated, since it would be implicit in every
                    decision that the judge has accepted the evidence adduced by the party he has
                    ruled in favour of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How appellate intervention in relation to inadequacy of reasons
                differs from appellate intervention in relation to a trial judge’s findings of
                fact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     An appellate court’s treatment of a case
                    where the issue relates to an inadequacy of reasons is different from the
                    approach the appellate court will apply when asked to assess findings of fact
                    made by the trial court. In relation to overturning or modifying findings of
                    fact, it trite that the appellate court will exercise restraint in recognition
                    of the trial judge’s advantage in observing the evidence directly: see,
                    for example, <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor and another
                        appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [16]. Be that as it may, appellate intervention on this basis is
                    still justified under certain circumstances, for example, when the inferences
                    drawn by a trial court were not supported by the primary or objective evidence
                    on record: see <em>Jagatheesan </em><em>s/o
                        Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at
                        [34]–[43]. An extreme scenario was posited in
                        <em>Watt or Thomas v Thomas</em>
                    [1947] AC 484, where Lord Thankerton made his classic statement
                    on when an appellate court may intervene notwithstanding the trial judge’s
                    advantage (at 488):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellate court … because it unmistakeably so appears from the
                        evidence, may be satisfied that he has not taken proper advantage of his
                        having seen and heard the witnesses, and the matter will then become at
                        large for the appellate court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Whilst an error of this degree must be rare, it has been recorded in
                        <em>Choo Kok Beng v Choo Kok Hoe and others</em>
                    [1983–1984] SLR(R) 578.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The principles discussed in these cases apply
                    to a decision which is defective because of certain mistakes in observation and
                    inference, <em>ie</em>, errors in fact-finding. This
                    presupposes that the deliberative process of the trial judge is known and should
                    be distinguished from a case, such as the present, where the issue relates to
                    the inadequacy of the statement of reasons. There is a difference between the
                    failure to <em>make the correct findings</em> and the
                    failure to <em>state reasons for the findings</em>, which
                    must not be confused. The latter failure appears to be characterised by the
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Flannery</em> as being of a
                    more fundamental nature, in the following terms (at 381H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Where because no reasons are given it is impossible to
                            tell whether the judge has gone wrong on the law or the facts, the
                            losing party would be altogether deprived of his chance of an appeal
                            unless the court entertains an appeal based on the lack of reasons
                            itself.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There may be a connection between these two categories of errors, in
                    so far as both categories could arise in the same case. However, it is certainly
                    not necessary that one entails the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Scope of the duty to give reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The duty to give reasons must not be
                    overstated, for it does not refer to the burden of reasoning <em>per se</em> but the burden of setting out the reasons, since we
                    already expect judges in every case to arrive at decisions through proper
                    reasoning. Therefore, what the duty requires is that the judge sets out what has
                    passed in his mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This requirement to set out reasons may
                    increase costs and result in delays. Such consequences are a real concern. The
                    Supreme Court of Canada noted in <em>MacDonald v The
                        Queen</em> (1976) 29 CCC (2d) 257 at 262–263 that
                    “the volume of criminal work makes an indiscriminate requirement of
                    reasons impractical”. It would indeed be undesirable if considerations of
                    form rather than of substance required unnecessary time to be spent in writing
                    rather than in judging. Similarly, the Australian courts, which have imposed
                    such a general duty, are aware of these concerns militating against it. Even
                    while upholding the duty, they recognise the heavy court load and the
                    constraints faced by first instance judges: see, for example, <em>Beale</em> at 444 and <em>Soulemezis</em> at
                    259.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We think that the correct response to these
                    concerns is to have a standard of explanation <em>which
                        corresponds to the requirements of the case</em> rather than to reject
                    the duty totally. The key is to strike an appropriate balance. While such
                    anxieties do not warrant outright rejection of the duty altogether, they have
                    been taken into account quite rightly in dispensing with reasons in certain
                    cases and matters (see below at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>–<a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>), in
                    accepting the appropriateness of abbreviated oral reasons in some situations,
                    and in adjusting the level of detail required of the statement of reasons to
                    suit the circumstances in other cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At this juncture, we would caution against
                    equating the duty to give reasons with a duty to issue a written judgment or
                    provide oral grounds of decision in every case. Where a judge hears a large
                    number of cases during a sitting (for example, a sentencing court making routine
                    sentencing decisions based on benchmark sentences) it would be impractical and
                    unrealistic to expect him or her to issue written judgments or even give oral
                    grounds of decision for every case that is dealt with. In addition, we would
                    echo Kirby P’s pertinent reminder in <em>Waterson</em> that under the pressure of today’s court lists,
                    there is no time for fastidious precision in the drafting of reasons. He quite
                    rightly cautioned against treating a judgment “as if its language had
                    been honed in countless hours of reflection and revision”, emphasising
                    that a “<em>practical standard</em> must be
                    adopted” [emphasis added]. Similarly, Nygh J in <em>In the Marriage Of: John Christopher Towns Appellant/Husband and Deborah
                        Jane Towns Respondent/Wife</em> [1990] FamCA 129 stated that (at
                        [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia] has, on numerous
                        occasions, displayed a considerable amount of latitude towards judges at
                        first instance being mindful that they are often sitting in busy lists and
                        have to deliver their judgments on an extemporary basis which may not make
                        it possible for them to express themselves with the directness and clarity
                        that an appellate tribunal and litigants might wish.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Additionally, there are exceptions to this
                    duty to provide reasons. Thus, in certain instances, a judge may not be in error
                    when he fails to state reasons. In <em>Sun Alliance Insurance Ltd
                        v Massoud</em> [1989] VR 8 (“<em>Sun
                        Alliance</em>”), Gray J pragmatically stated that (at
                    19):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The simplicity of the context of the case or the state of the evidence may
                        be such that a mere statement of the judge’s conclusion will
                        sufficiently indicate the basis of a decision … In such cases, the
                        foundation for the judge’s conclusion will be indicated as a matter of
                        necessary inference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The same was stated in <em>Brittingham v
                        Williams</em> [1932] VLR 237 at 239 and <em>Public
                        Service Board of NSW</em> at 566. But this approach must be confined
                    to very clear cases and in relation to specific and straightforward factual or
                    legal issues. Otherwise, the exceptions would seriously undermine the duty to
                    give reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We also note that the duty has been held not
                    to apply to certain matters of lesser significance. For example, there are some
                    types of interlocutory applications, mainly those with a procedural focus, which
                    a judge can properly make an order without giving reasons: see <em>Capital and Suburban Properties Ltd v Swycher and Others</em>
                    [1976] 1 Ch 319 at 325–326 (<em>per</em>
                    Buckley LJ) and <em>Knight and Another v Clifton and
                        Others</em> [1971] 1 Ch 700 at 721. Buckley LJ had in
                    mind instances where the judge is asked to exercise his discretion on relatively
                    insignificant questions, such as whether a matter should be expedited or
                    adjourned or extra time should be allowed for a party to take some procedural
                    step, or possibly whether relief by way of injunction should be granted or
                    refused. Neither are reasons normally to be expected when a judge exercises his
                    discretion on costs, unless it involves an unusual award: see <em>Eagil Trust Co Ltd v Pigott-Brown and another</em> [1985]
                    3 All ER 119 at 122. It appears that many of these exceptions
                    involve a large element of discretion. However, we do not think that it is their
                    discretionary nature <em>per se</em> which justifies the
                    dispensation of any explanation. Rather, it seems that these exceptions are
                    allowed because they are not decisions that bear directly on substantive
                    matters. For example, even in matters of practice and procedure, where the
                    decision will effectively decide the rights of the parties finally, reasons must
                    be given: see <em>Glen Rees T/as Glynmar Pastoral Co v
                        Walker</em> (13 December 1988, unreported) (New South Wales Court
                    of Appeal) (<em>per</em> Kirby P). However, we would
                    caution against equating non-substantive cases as being necessarily
                    insignificant. The court’s assessment of the significance of a decision
                    should take into account the circumstances of the case, and its importance
                    should not be judged simply by categorising the decision as being substantive or
                    procedural in nature. As a rule of thumb, <em>the more profound
                        the consequences of a decision are, the greater the necessity for detailed
                        reasoning.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Content of the statement of reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Where the duty to state reasons applies, the
                    statement of reasons should ideally adopt the following structure (see also
                    H L Ho, “The judicial duty to give reasons” at
                    56–60). We must stress, however, that the ordering that follows is to be
                    viewed as providing a useful <em>and general</em> guide,
                    and that each case should be explained on its own facts. <em>First, the statement ought to set out in summary form all the key relevant
                        evidence</em>. Not all the detailed evidence needs to be referred to.
                    Sometimes, the volume of evidence is so overwhelming that the judge must
                    necessarily perform a legal triage before he can practicably present his
                    reasons. In cases where conflicting evidence of a significant nature is given,
                    both sets of evidence should be referred to. Otherwise, where a certain piece of
                    evidence is important to the proper determination of the matter but it is not
                    referred to by the trial judge, it will be hard for an appellate court to know
                    whether the judge had considered it or not. With respect to the depth of
                    reference, we agree with Meagher JA in <em>Beale</em>
                    at 443, where he held that “[t]here is no need to refer to the relevant
                    evidence in detail, especially in circumstances where it is clear that the
                    evidence has been considered”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     
          <em>Secondly, the statement
                        should briefly set out the parties’ opposing

                        out the facts found by the judge, both primary and inferential.</em>
                    For example, in <em>Craven v Craven</em>, the English Court
                    of Appeal ordered a new trial in a divorce case because the judge at first
                    instance had dismissed the wife’s charge of cruelty without making any
                    finding as to whether, on a material occasion, she had been deliberately or
                    accidentally hit by her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     
          <em>Thirdly, the statement
                        should examine the relevant evidence and the facts found with a view to
                        explaining the final outcome on each material issue.</em> However, we
                    do not expect the trial judge to make an explicit ruling on each and every
                    factual issue that arises. To place this burden on the trial judge would be both
                    impractical and beyond the demands of justice. For instance, in an accident
                    claim, the central question may simply be whether the defendant was on the wrong
                    side of the road when the accident occurred. The portions of the
                    witnesses’ testimonies to be analysed may then be restricted to those
                    answering the central issue, such as where exactly the debris was found and the
                    position of any skid marks. Also, while the trial judge must relate the saliency
                    of each piece of evidence which he relies on, the expectations of the depth and
                    precision of the judge’s account of his analysis must be realistic. We
                    adopt the following holding of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>John Strbak v Narelle Newton</em> [1989] NSWCA 202:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is going too far to suggest that in every case a judge must submit
                        the material before him or her to the most meticulous analysis and carry
                        into judgment a detailed exposition of every aspect of the evidence and the
                        arguments. What is necessary … is a basic explanation of the
                        fundamental reasons which led the judge to his conclusion. There is no
                        requirement, however, that reasons must incorporate an extended intellectual
                        dissertation upon the chain of reasoning which authorises the judgment which
                        is given.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>Trial judges must always endeavour to balance their duty
                            to explain with their duty to be brief.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     
          <em>Finally, the judge has to
                        explicate how he has arrived at a particular conclusion</em>.
                    Impressionistic statements are not helpful. In some cases, the bald statement
                    that the evidence of a particular witness is accepted may be sufficient. Where
                    the court is faced with two irreconcilable accounts given by two eye-witnesses,
                    in the absence of other corroborating evidence, it may have little to say other
                    than that one witness is more credible than the other. This approach may be
                    acceptable in a straightforward factual dispute which resolution depends simply
                    on which witness is telling the truth about events which he claims to recall.
                    Where the decision is of a nature that has to be made as a matter of overall
                    impression rather than by methodical reasoning, the judge will not be able to
                    particularise the factors which had been taken into account and it would be
                    meaningless to require the judge to do that which cannot be done
                    realistically.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     But the tolerance for
                    “impressionistic” type of reasoning must be constrained by the
                    Court’s wariness of arbitrariness, and it is also limited by the desire
                    for open justice. Hence, the law ordinarily requires the trial judge to explain
                    his assessment of the witness’s testimony. Examples include where oral
                    evidence is accepted even though it is contradicted by contemporaneous writing
                    by the witness (<em>R v MacPherson</em> [1982] 1 NZLR
                    650 at 652) and generally, where only part of a witness’s evidence is
                    accepted (<em>Crowley v Willis</em> (1992) 110 FLR 194
                    at 200). We agree with Kirby P in <em>Soulemezis</em>
                    at 259 that: “<em>Where nothing exists but an assertion of
                        satisfaction on undifferentiated evidence the judicial obligation has not
                        been discharged. Justice has not been done and it has not been seen to be
                        done</em>” [emphasis added]. We should also add that the
                    formulaic reliance on demeanour, without more, to justify a finding of
                    credibility is today often questionable. Not infrequently, this is no more than
                    subjectivity piled upon subjectivity. The courts are full of witnesses whose
                    memory, as time passes, becomes more and more certain and less and less
                    accurate: see J P O Barry, “The Methodology of Judging”
                    (1994) James Cook U L Rev 135 at 142. Objective reasoning is therefore
                    always preferred and it will be a rare case that is truly bereft of any
                    objective evidence and turns entirely on the evidence of a single
                    witness’s recollection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The constituents of judicial reasoning listed
                    above are likely to overlap, and a judgment may be inadequate in relation to
                    more than one constituent. For example, the judge may fail to explain why he
                    prefers the evidence of one witness over another, and at the same time, leave
                    unresolved many significant issues of fact which bear on the question of which
                    of the conflicting testimonies ought to be accepted. In <em>NRMA
                        Insurance Ltd v Tatt and Another</em> (1988) 94 FLR 339
                        (“<em>NRMA Insurance</em>”), the
                    plaintiffs made an insurance claim after a fire destroyed their house. The
                    defence was that the plaintiffs had deliberately set the fire. Both sides called
                    experts who testified in favour of their respective parties’ cases. The
                    trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the primary ground that he
                    believed that the plaintiffs were telling the truth when they denied having
                    deliberately set fire to the house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The majority of the New South Wales Court of
                    Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a retrial. The basis for allowing the
                    appeal was not because the trial judge had committed an “error in making
                    the wrong finding” but because of his “failure to make any
                    findings on material issues” (<em>NRMA
                        Insurance</em> at 351). The first instance decision was based largely
                    on the credibility of the plaintiffs. But as the majority highlighted (<em>NRMA Insurance</em> at 353 (<em>per</em>
                    Samuels JA)), “[i]t is … impossible for a judge to make a
                    finding on credit in a vacuum, as it were, without relating the witness’
                    evidence, demeanour and particular circumstances to the other material evidence
                    in the case”. The plaintiffs’ credibility must be weighed against
                    the strength of the other objective evidence and, in particular, the expert
                    evidence that had been presented at the trial. But that evidence was not given
                    explicit consideration in the analysis of the case and important issues raised
                    by them were not resolved. The majority could not say <em>what
                        view the judge took of the expert and other evidence</em>, and because
                    of “his <em>failure to consider it to the point of
                        conclusion</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>NRMA
                        Insurance</em> at 353), the majority could not review the weight to be
                    given to the finding of credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Standard and scope of explanation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is impossible (as well as unprofitable) to
                    attempt to formulate a fixed rule of universal application. The particularity
                    with which the judge is required to set out the reasons must depend on the
                        <em>circumstances of the case before him</em> and the
                        <em>nature of the decision he is giving</em>. The
                    standard may vary in two cases involving the same type of issues. For instance,
                    with respect to weighing the strength of and choosing between two conflicting
                    testimonies, it was said in one case that this “may have to be a matter
                    of judgment, not of detailed reasoning” (<em>Housing
                        Commission of NSW</em> at 381 (<em>per</em>
                    Hutley JA)), whereas in another case (<em>Lloyd Junior
                        Beckford (An Infant by his Mother and Next Friend Tracy Alleyne) v
                        Dr Trevor ET Weston</em> (22 June 1998, unreported) (English
                    Court of Appeal) (<em>per</em> Lord Bingham)), it was
                    said that the judge has “to give a detailed, reasoned judgment”
                    and that it was “his duty to give reasons which hold
                    water”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Although it is not possible (or desirable) to
                    formulate a rule which, when applied, enables one to decide whether the duty has
                    been breached for each and every case, it is possible to specify some factors
                    which determine the applicable standard and scope of explanation. The extent to
                    which reasons have to be given: (a) is constrained by the legal
                    system’s ability to bear the burden which the duty imposes;
                    (b) should be sufficient to serve the purposes for which the duty was
                    created; and (c) is dependent on the nature of the decision and the
                    decision-making process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     With respect to the first factor, it must be
                    recognised that structural limitations such as jury trials and lay judges no
                    longer exist in Singapore today. While this suggests that the first factor may
                    be of less weight, on the other hand, we recognise that the duty to give reasons
                    may increase costs and result in delays, and that judges are often expected to
                    manage a heavy court list on a daily basis (see above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>). The extent of the duty to provide reasons
                    must therefore always be tempered with the need to ensure that judicial time is
                    used effectively and efficiently. This would entail achieving a balanced mix of
                    time spent by a judge in hearings and in preparing reasons for his or her
                    decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In relation to the second factor, the purposes
                    of the duty should be broadly understood, and care should be taken not to be
                    fixated on a particular purpose, such as the duty to protect the effectiveness
                    of the right to appeal. Otherwise, one might erroneously think that less
                    elaborate reasons are required where legislation does not give a right of
                    appeal. If so, strictly speaking, it would not be necessary for the highest
                    courts to provide reasons for its decisions for the purpose of safeguarding
                    one’s right of appeal since there is none. However, the highest courts are
                    not exempt from the duty. The need for justice to be done and seen to be done
                    should not be dampened by the absence of an avenue for appeal. On the contrary,
                    the inability to alter the decision may make it all the more compelling for the
                    parties to understand how it was reached because, as cogently explained by the
                    Supreme Court of Victoria in <em>Sun Alliance</em> at
                    18:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A litigant], having led a weighty body of incriminating evidence was
                        entitled to have the evidence weighed by the Court and, if rejected, the
                        grounds of its rejection expressed in reasoned terms. To have a strong body
                        of evidence put aside without explanation is likely to give rise to a
                        feeling of injustice in the mind of the most reasonable litigant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ordinarily, for an appellate court, it would be sufficient (when it is
                    satisfied with the outcome and adequacy of the reasoning of the lower court) to
                    simply state in affirming the earlier decision that it agrees with the reasons
                    given in support of it. It is not obliged to reprise the reasons or give
                    additional ones in a fresh judgment if it forms the view that this is not
                    necessary. This must be a matter of judgment for the appellate
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The nature of the decision is also highly
                    relevant in determining the application and ambit of the duty. While reasons may
                    perhaps be dispensed with if the decision is insignificant (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>–<a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>), on the other hand, we would expect an important decision
                    to be even more carefully explained. The latter category would include cases
                    with significant consequences and/or those that result in changes to the
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At this juncture, we would pause to make a few
                    other observations about the duty to provide reasons. First, we repeat that the
                    duty does not require judges to provide <em>written</em>
                    decisions in every case; reasons can be provided orally where appropriate, and
                    no reasons need be given in certain types of cases. Second, Judges are not
                    expected to deliver lengthy judgments. Simplicity out of complexity is always a
                    desirable objective. Third, we would observe that presently this duty to provide
                    reasons is almost always observed by the courts here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application of the duty to this case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Regretfully, we do not think that the judicial
                    duty to state reasons has been satisfied in the present case. In our view, the
                    nature of the case here, which involved a capital charge, necessitated detailed
                    reasons, especially in relation to the findings of fact made and application of
                    the law to such findings of fact. It would enable the Appellant, members of the
                    profession and the public to understand the reasons for the decision. In
                    addition, detailed reasons were necessary to enable this Court to understand the
                    grounds for the Judge’s decision and to appraise its correctness. There
                    were no other countervailing policy grounds that would militate against the duty
                    to provide detailed reasons here. With this in mind, we turn to consider the
                    areas in which the reasons provided were insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     First, we are unable to ascertain what the
                    Judge held was the precise <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> of the Appellant. We cannot discern from the Judgment
                    whether the Appellant was held to have actual knowledge of or was wilfully blind
                    to the nature of the drugs he possessed; or whether he was convicted because the
                    presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted.
                    Although any one of these possibilities is sufficient to satisfy the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> element of the
                    offence, it is important that the Appellant knows what his precise <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> was held to be,
                    in order to exercise his right of appeal effectively, as the corresponding
                    primary facts necessary to satisfy this <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> can then be scrutinised by the
                    appellate court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Secondly, while the Judge described the
                    “evidence given by the accused [<em>ie</em>, the
                    Appellant]” as being “very thin” (Judgment at [4]), we are unable to understand how this
                    conclusion was arrived at. The Judgment does not shed light on whether the
                    Appellant’s evidence was disbelieved because of his demeanour when giving
                    oral testimony in court, or because its content was inconsistent with extrinsic
                    objective evidence or for some other reason. While some of the Appellant’s
                    submissions (<em>eg</em>, the Appellant’s alleged
                    consumption of methamphetamine in Malaysia and his alleged gullibility) were
                    referred to in the Judgment in relation to the finding of “very
                    thin” evidence, no analysis of the evidence that supported these
                    submissions was apparent in the Judgment. This is plainly unsatisfactory given
                    that there is undisputed objective evidence which supported the
                    Appellant’s contention that he was a methamphetamine consumer, and it is
                    unclear if the Judge had considered this piece of evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Thirdly, there are two ambiguities with
                    respect to the Judge’s treatment of the cautioned statement, <em>viz</em>, was an adverse inference drawn against the
                    Appellant, and if an adverse inference was drawn, why was it drawn? With respect
                    to the latter, Defence counsel had submitted at trial that the Appellant’s
                    response in the cautioned statement could be explained on the basis that the
                    Appellant was in a highly soporific state at the time of recording that
                    statement. Whilst we do not and are unable to express any views on the truth of
                    the facts underlying such a submission, we note that there is evidence showing
                    the timings at which the Appellant last consumed methamphetamine and last slept
                    before recording that statement. Hence, if there was evidence which led the
                    Judge to think otherwise, it had to be set out and evaluated. It is apposite to
                    note, in this regard, that the exact <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> that the Appellant is found to
                    possess, or not possess, could possibly have a material bearing on the outcome
                    of the case, especially in the light of this Court’s decision in <em>Nagaenthran</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Fourthly, we neither know what the Judge
                    assessed the contemporaneous statement’s nature to be nor the weight it
                    was given. The contemporaneous statement’s admissibility was subject to a
                        <em>voir dire</em> which spanned one-third of the
                    entire proceedings. The material part of the contemporaneous statement
                        stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Question 1): What is this? (Recorders note: pointing to the 10 packets of
                        granular substances)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Answer: Beh Hoon. (Recorder’s note: Beh Hoon is Heroin) [The
                        Appellant’s mark]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Question 2) Who does it belongs [<em>sic</em>]?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Answer: It belongs to me. [The Appellant’s mark]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Question 3) What are this [sic] drugs for?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Answer: Its [<em>sic</em>] to deliver to somebody
                        else. [The Appellant’s mark]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Question 4) How many occasions has [<em>sic</em>] you
                        delivered drugs into Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Answer: This is my second time [The Appellant’s mark]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Because the recorder of the statement was a
                    Central Narcotics Bureau officer and not a police officer, it would appear that
                    s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (“EA”) was the applicable admissibility provision rather than
                    s 122(5) of the CPC: see <em>Chai Chien </em><em>Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 619. Unlike s 122(5) of the CPC, s 24 of the EA
                        <em>prima facie</em> applies to only
                    “confessions” and not “admissions” – terms
                    which carry different meanings under the EA (see s 258 of the CPC 2010 for
                    the present position). Paradoxically, taking a strict interpretation of the EA
                    alone, one <em>may</em> argue that an involuntary admission
                    would nevertheless be admissible, and no <em>voir dire</em>
                    was necessary. This is not an issue that we need to express any views on at
                    present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, we are unsure if the Judge had
                    undertaken such an exercise of statutory interpretation and arrived at the
                    aforementioned position, which implies that he viewed the contemporaneous
                    statement as a confession because there was a <em>voir
                        dire</em>, or that he took the alternative position which requires
                    both admissions and confessions to be voluntarily given even under the EA, in
                    which case he may have viewed the contemporaneous statement as an admission that
                    still called for a <em>voir dire</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The larger problem lies in that after
                    admitting the contemporaneous statement into evidence, no analysis of its
                    significance in the context of the entire factual matrix was provided. This is a
                    serious omission in the light of “Question 1” and its answer
                    (which is probative evidence of the Appellant’s knowledge of the nature of
                    the drugs in the packets) (see above at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>), and the Appellant’s defence (which claims ignorance of
                    the nature of those drugs). The possible significance of the answer to
                    “Question 1” ranges from being exculpatory, in that the
                    Appellant’s knowledge was only acquired <em>ex post
                        facto</em> by virtue of seeing the contents of the opened packet, to
                    being highly inculpatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Fifthly, there was no reference at all to the
                    Appellant’s allegation that he had carried out a similar delivery in a
                    prior trafficking transaction involving Ah Hong (<em>viz</em>, the First Trafficking Incident) where he allegedly
                    ascertained the nature of the drugs to be methamphetamine. This was highly
                    relevant evidence with respect to the Appellant’s <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> because he relied heavily on
                    the particulars of the First Trafficking Incident as a justification for not
                    checking the contents of the drug packets on the occasion for which he was
                    arrested. However, we are unable to ascertain whether the Judge had considered
                    it because no reference was made to it. The error that the Judge had apparently
                    made at [4] of the Judgment in relation
                    to the Appellant’s <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> (referred to at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above) is also, in the context of the other concerns we have raised,
                    problematic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Finally, there are some other anomalies in the
                    Judgment which cannot be reflexively ignored by this court. There were
                    altogether six long statements recorded from the Appellant over the course of
                    the investigations which particulars were not fully set out in the Judgment (at
                        [3]). Hence, we are unsure whether
                    the Judge had sufficiently evaluated the contents of all those statements, which
                    constitute a substantial and material part of both the Prosecution’s and
                    the Defence’s cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It is also undisputed that, unlike what was
                    implied in the Judgment (at [4]), only
                    six out of the ten packets of drugs found in the Appellant’s possession
                    contained white granular substances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The packet
                    which was first opened and which contents were first seen by the investigators
                    and the Appellant in fact contained brown granular substances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    This is of some significance since the white granular substances were analysed
                    to contain more diamorphine per unit volume, and therefore each same-sized drug
                    packet containing white granular substances contained a larger amount of
                    diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     
          <em>A brief judgment is not
                        necessarily an inadequate one. There is always merit in conciseness and no
                        virtue in prolixity.</em> However, a judgment that does not explain
                    the foundations for findings of facts and/or the basis for the determination of
                    the witness’s credibility on pivotal issues is <em>prima
                        facie</em> inadequate to justify a judicial outcome and could be seen
                    as flawed. For the reasons given above, we are unable to affirm or overrule the
                    Judge’s decision as we do not clearly understand how he arrived at certain
                    primary findings of fact that led to his rejection of the Appellant’s
                    defence. We also do not think it is proper in this matter for this Court to
                    scrutinise the evidence on record in a <em>de novo</em>
                    manner in order to construct a case for the Prosecution or the Defence, much
                    less to make definitive findings of fact without the benefit of observing the
                    presentation of evidence and witnesses’ testimony
                first-hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     These proceedings, it bears emphasis, relate
                    to a capital charge on which the Appellant was found guilty. The judicial duty
                    to give full reasons is therefore even more compelling in such a matter. It is,
                    of course, never a light matter to order a retrial. Much anxiety, inconvenience
                    and even hardship is caused all round and sometimes the ultimate decision may
                    not be different. However, given the lack of clarity in the Judgment and our
                    inability as an appellate court to assess the credibility of the Appellant, we
                    have no alternative but to direct that there shall be a retrial instead before
                    another High Court Judge, who will have the opportunity to closely scrutinise
                    afresh the Appellant’s credibility in the context of all the relevant
                    evidence. We would also emphasise that nothing in this Judgment should be taken
                    as affecting any substantive determination in the subsequent trial and appeal,
                    if any. Finally, we are also constrained to observe that we received little
                    assistance from the Appellant’s counsel in the present proceedings. Their
                    submissions fell well short of the standard that we ordinarily expect from
                    counsel in matters of this nature.</p>
