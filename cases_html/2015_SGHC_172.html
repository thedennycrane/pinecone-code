<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne (“the
                    plaintiff”) took out the above Originating Summons (“the
                    OS”) and applied for the following reliefs in relation to the property
                    situated at Block 10D Braddell Hill #13-14 (“the property”)
                    against Su Emmanuel (“the first defendant”) and Emmanuel Satish
                    Philip Ignatius (“the second defendant”) (collectively “the
                    defendants”):-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     that it be ordered that the title of
                        the property be severed and apportioned according to the respective
                        contributions of the plaintiff and the defendants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     that it be declared that the plaintiff
                        is entitled to a 70% share in the property given that she has contributed
                        approximately 70% of the value of the property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     that it be ordered that the property be sold in
                        the open market and the plaintiff be entitled to receive 70% of the sale
                        proceeds and the defendants be entitled to the balance 30% of the sale
                        proceeds;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     that
                        it be further ordered that the second defendant’s Central Provident
                        Fund (“CPF”) monies that were withdrawn for the purchase of
                        the property be not refunded to her CPF accounts considering that the second
                        defendant is now more than 62 years old;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_e"></a>(e)     alternatively, if a refund of the monies into the
                        second defendant’s CPF accounts is required, that the refund be
                        effected by the defendants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_f"></a>(f)     such further and other relief as this Honourable Court
                        deems fit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_g"></a>(g)     that
                        the defendants pay the plaintiff the cost of the
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The court granted prayers (a) to (c) and (e)
                    above with an additional prayer as follows: in the event that the first and/or
                    second defendant wishes to buy over the plaintiff’s 70% share in the
                    property, such election shall be made within 10 days of the date of the order,
                    and the sale shall be completed within 60 days of the date of
                hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As the property was held as tenants in common by
                    the plaintiff and the two defendants, there was no need to sever the tenancies
                    under prayer (a) but there was a need to apportion the equitable or beneficial
                    ownership vis a vis the legal ownership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first defendant, being dissatisfied with the
                    orders that were granted, has appealed (by way of notice of appeal in CA No 67
                    of 2015) against the whole of this court’s decision. A stay on the orders
                    was also granted to the first defendant pending her appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff is the younger sister of the
                    second defendant while the first defendant is the second defendant’s wife
                    and the plaintiff’s sister-in-law. The plaintiff is presently a retiree.
                    The defendants are not on speaking terms although they remain married and
                    continue to reside at the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According to the plaintiff, the second defendant
                    lost his job in the hotel industry around April or May 2002. The result was that
                    the second defendant encountered difficulties in servicing the mortgage
                    instalments on the loan (“the defendants’ loan”) that he had
                    taken from the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“the Bank”) to
                    part-fund his purchase of the property. The second defendant also utilised his
                    CPF contributions for the same purpose. By then, the defendants were residing at
                    the property. The second defendant informed the plaintiff that he had fallen
                    behind on his mortgage instalments and that the Bank would soon be recalling the
                    defendants’ loan resulting in the defendants losing the property. The
                    second defendant requested the plaintiff’s financial
                assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff (then aged 47) was a teacher in a
                    government school. As she had sufficient funds in her CPF accounts, the
                    plaintiff agreed to help the defendants. According to the plaintiff, the second
                    defendant informed her that the defendants’ lawyers were from Khattar Wong
                    &amp; Partner (“KWP”). According to the plaintiff, the second
                    defendant said that for expediency, KWP should also act for her, and they did
                    so. This was disputed by the first but not the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Thereafter, various proposals were mooted for
                    the plaintiff to buy into the property, namely that she purchases: (i) 60% share
                    with the balance 40% held by the second defendant; (ii) 50% share from the first
                    defendant and 1% share from the second defendant and (iii) 50% share from the
                    second defendant with the balance 50% being held by the first defendant.
                    Alternative (iii) was not approved by the CPF Board which held a charge on the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The parties then applied on 24 April 2003 for
                    approval from the CPF Board for the plaintiff to purchase 49% share in the
                    property (“the 49% share”) with the first defendant holding 50%
                    share and the second defendant retaining 1% share. This was approved by the CPF
                    Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At that time, the property was valued at
                    $530,000 and therefore the price for the 49% share was $259,700. The outstanding
                    sum of the defendants’ loan was around $316,000. On 27 May 2003, the
                    plaintiff and the second defendant signed the sale and purchase agreement
                    (“the SPA”) at the office of KWP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In order to sell the 49% share to the
                    plaintiff, the defendants had to redeem the defendants’ loan. However,
                    they were not in a position to do so as neither defendant was gainfully
                    employed. They could not take up a fresh loan either. However, the Bank agreed
                    to grant a loan to the plaintiff to enable the defendants to settle the
                    defendants’ loan and discharge the Bank’s existing
                mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 14 August 2003, the Bank issued a letter of
                    offer to both the plaintiff and the second defendant. The Bank offered a loan of
                    $165,000 (“the loan”) which was to be used to settle the
                    outstanding sum under the existing mortgage and to pay for the plaintiff’s
                    share. The monthly instalment on the loan was $1,481.56.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In April 2004, $233,730 was also withdrawn
                    from the plaintiff’s CPF accounts to pay for the 49% share. On 16 April
                    2004, the plaintiff paid the second defendant $25,970 being 10% of the purchase
                    price for the 49% share. In the same month, the plaintiff attended at the office
                    of KWP again to sign the mortgage documentation for the loan. KWP’s letter
                    dated 20 April 2004 stated the outstanding sum of the defendants’ loan as
                    of that date was $345,726.03, which the plaintiff paid, using her CPF funds and
                    from the loan she had taken up, in the following manner:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There was a balance of $53,003.97 ($165,000 -
                    $111,996.03) left of the loan. After deducting the sum of $10,395.14 which was
                    paid as legal costs to KWP and Harry Elias Partnership who was acting for the
                    CPF Board, a sum of $42,608.83 was left. KWP issued a cheque for $42,608.83 in
                    favour of the second defendant. Together with the initial 10% payment of
                    $25,970, the second defendant received from the plaintiff a total of $68,578.83.
                    The difference between that sum and the purchase price of $259,700 was only
                    $191,121.17. However, as seen from the figures in [13] above, the plaintiff had
                    paid far more than the purchase price for the 49% share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff serviced the instalments for the
                    loan by monthly payments ranging from $1,572.60 to $1,671.60 after making an
                    initial payment of $6,199.36 in September 2004. When she turned 55 years old in
                    December 2010, the plaintiff was told she could not continue using her CPF
                    contributions to service the loan’s instalment repayments if there were
                    insufficient funds and that she needed to pay cash. All in, the plaintiff paid
                    $155,082.50 on the loan through her CPF funds. Between January 2011 and March
                    2013, the plaintiff paid about $20,000 in cash towards the loan. As of April
                    2013, the outstanding sum on the loan was $21,032.94. This sum was subsequently
                    paid by the defendants’ eldest son who had started working.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     According to the plaintiff, she paid a total
                    of $525,579.10 for the property including interest, based on the following
                    breakdown:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Again, the figures in [15] and [16] show that
                    the plaintiff had paid more than the purchase price for the 49% share. The
                    plaintiff computed the defendants’ contributions of $182,862.33 as being
                    either 34.5% (based on a value of $530,000) or 28.13% (based on a value of
                    $650,000) of the property. She complained that although the first defendant made
                    no monetary contribution at all towards the property, she nonetheless retained
                    50% in the property and benefited further by residing at the property
                    exclusively all these years with her family. The plaintiff, on the other hand,
                    having contributed about 82.03% towards the price of the property (based on a
                    value of $530,000), or 66.88% (based on a value of $650,000), had not received
                    any benefit at all. In fact, the plaintiff informed that she was on the brink of
                    bankruptcy and had to rent a place to stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It was also the plaintiff’s case that
                    besides the payments in [16] for the property, she had also contributed towards
                    the upkeep of the defendants over ten years since 2002, averaging $300 per week,
                    for their expenses which included their children’s school fees and the
                    outgoings for the property such as property tax, maintenance charges and sinking
                    fund contributions. The plaintiff had also given the second defendant lump sum
                    payments of $2,000 each year when she received her bonus. She estimated such
                    payments amounted to $170,000. However, there was no documentary evidence before
                    the court to support these additional payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff deposed that after much pleading
                    on her part, the first defendant agreed on or about 23 October 2012, to sell the
                    property through the first defendant’s appointed housing agent, at the
                    price of $1.6m but there were no buyers. The second defendant had informed her
                    he had no say as he only had a 1% share in the property. In September 2014, the
                    first defendant through her solicitors offered the plaintiff $470,000 to
                    purchase the 49% share; the offer was rejected as unreasonable. The plaintiff
                    then commenced these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In response to the plaintiff’s affidavit
                    supporting her application, the second defendant filed his affidavit in person.
                    He admitted he had difficulties servicing the defendants’ loan after he
                    lost his job in March 2002. He claimed however that he did not approach the
                    plaintiff for assistance to help service the defendants’ loan. Rather, he
                    asserted that it was the plaintiff herself who offered, through his older
                    brother, to use her CPF savings for the mortgage repayments. The second
                    defendant then readily accepted this offer. This contention is so absurd that it
                    merits no consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The second defendant deposed that he did not
                    specifically appoint KWP to act in the sale and purchase transaction with the
                    plaintiff; rather it was done for expediency as the firm acted for the Bank
                    while Harry Elias Partnership acted for the CPF Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The second defendant did not challenge the
                    plaintiff’s assertion that she had paid $525,579.10 (refer to [16] above)
                    for the property. However, he claimed that she knew from the outset that her CPF
                    monies were insufficient to purchase the 49% share and that a bank loan was
                    necessary to cover the shortfall. He deposed he always intended to repay the
                    plaintiff for her payments as soon as he secured a job (which he never did after
                    March 2002).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As for the plaintiff’s payment to him of
                    $42,608.83 (referred to at [14] above), the second defendant claimed he gave
                    back $20,000 from that sum to the plaintiff for her expenses. This was denied by
                    the plaintiff. He further asserted that his son, Andrew Emmanuel, paid
                    $21,032.94 while he himself paid $8,977.88 towards the outstanding mortgage as
                    of April 2013, from the sale proceeds of his Singtel shares and from
                    borrowings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The second defendant believed he had paid cash
                    of $118,140.84 and a total amount of $523,547.29 towards the purchase of the
                    property. However, he did not substantiate the figure of $523,547.29 and when
                    questioned by the court, he said he had no supporting documents. On the other
                    hand, he admitted he utilised his CPF contributions of $3,000 per month to
                    service the defendants’ loan between July 1995 and September 1998, with
                    the last CPF payment being $1,859.16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The second defendant contended that his
                    contributions (and his son’s but excluding interest) totalled $490,803.83

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The sum of $490,803.83 can be equated to 92.61% or
                        75.51% based on the value of the property at $530,000 and $650,000
                        respectively. As observed in [25] above, the second defendant’s
                        alleged cash payments of $523,547.29 were
                unsubstantiated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The second defendant deposed that the
                    plaintiff had never expressed to him a wish to exercise her rights to occupy the
                    property although he would have agreed had she asked to stay with his family. He
                    then relied on clause 10 of the SPA (“clause 10”) for his
                    family’s right of occupation; the clause states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10. Su Emmanuel and her children will not be removed or evacuated by any
                        means (legally or forcefully) by the [plaintiff] or by the direction of the
                        [plaintiff] as the house is the place of dwelling of Su Emmanuel and her
                        children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 11 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Other than Clause 10, a person who is not a party to this Agreement has no
                        rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 to enforce any
                        term of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The plaintiff however contended she was not aware of the
                        purport of clause 10 nor was it explained to her or drawn specifically to
                        her attention by KWP at the time she signed the SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second defendant did not deny the
                    plaintiff had supported him and his family but disagreed that the sum amounted
                    to $170,000. He further argued that in any case, she was not the only sibling
                    who had done so as he also received financial assistance from his three other
                    sisters and a younger brother. The second defendant claimed he had relinquished
                    his one-seventh share of the inheritance of a Robin Road property from his
                    mother so that the plaintiff could occupy it from 1992 onwards. His inheritance
                    approximated $120,000 in value. No supporting documents were produced for this
                    claim. Since losing his job in 2002, the second defendant has not worked at all
                    but was content for his family and himself to live off the generosity of his
                    various siblings who worked, including the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The second defendant requested that the
                    plaintiff sells the 49% share to the defendants based on the current valuation.
                    (As stated at [2] above, the court granted the defendants an option to buy out
                    the 49% share of the plaintiff. However, this option was not exercised simply
                    because the defendants did not or do not have the means to do so. This inability
                    has also caused the plaintiff greater hardship.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The first defendant’s affidavit was
                    replete with irrelevant and inconsequential details pertaining, <em>inter alia</em>, to (i) how she came to marry the second
                    defendant; (ii) her (short-lived) career (before and after marriage); (iii) her
                    (unhappy) married life (iv) the second defendant’s alleged failed business
                    ventures after he lost his job in the hotel industry, (v) the second
                    defendant’s alleged investments with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The first defendant alleged that the second
                    defendant threatened her when she refused to accede to his demands to sell the
                    property, by claiming that they would lose the property as he did not have
                    sufficient funds to service the defendants’ loan. She further alleged that
                    the plaintiff telephoned her and made similar threats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The first defendant dwelt <em>in extenso</em> on how the SPA came to be signed by the three parties
                    after she refused to sign the first three agreements presented to her by the
                    second defendant. She deposed that a close family friend (one Joe Singh) had
                    advised her against signing any of the earlier agreements before the SPA at all
                    costs, as otherwise she and her children would be rendered
                homeless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The first defendant alleged that the plaintiff
                    and the second defendant made various representations to her when she was
                    reluctant to sign the SPA and that the second defendant refused to work, had no
                    job and knew that they would not be able to repay the defendants’ loan.
                    She asserted that the plaintiff and the second defendant assured her
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     based on the SPA, her position and
                        that of her children was secured as none of them would lose the right to
                        live in the property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     she need not worry about repayment of the mortgage loan as the
                        plaintiff would utilise her CPF funds to pay for the property as well as
                        take a small bank loan to cover some portion of the 49% share’s price
                        as well as whatever amounts that were outstanding under the original loan.
                        The plaintiff was a joint borrower (with her and the second defendant) of
                        the loan and the plaintiff knew that neither the first nor the second
                        defendants were in a position to make the loan
                    repayments;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        property would be split into ownership according to the parties’
                        shares and the first defendant would retain 50% ownership so that as a
                        majority owner, she could override any attempts to sell the
                    property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        plaintiff and the second defendant were in any event expecting to receive a
                        large sum of money shortly due to certain investments which meant that the
                        property would be paid up before long.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The first defendant claimed that she was
                    persuaded by the representations in [33] to agree to the arrangements by which
                    the plaintiff came to acquire a 49% share. She suspected the real reason for the
                    sale to the plaintiff was not to help the family but to generate cash for the
                    plaintiff and the second defendant for their investments. (The first defendant
                    dwelt at length on this suspicion but produced no evidence in support
                    thereof).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first defendant deposed that KWP were the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors and acted for her (this was disputed by the
                    plaintiff). In fact, when she attended at the office of KWP, the lawyer doing
                    the transaction advised the first defendant to seek independent legal advice to
                    safeguard her interest (which she never did).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Even though the second defendant did not deny
                    receiving the sums the plaintiff said she had paid him in [13] and [14] above,
                    the first defendant questioned the payments contending that there was no
                    evidence to substantiate the same. She further questioned whether the then value
                    of the property was indeed $530,000 and argued that there was no basis for this
                    valuation apart from what was stated in KWP’s letter dated 18 March
                    2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Interestingly however, the first defendant
                    deposed (in the section in her affidavit of evidence in chief starting from
                    paragraph 48) that to the best of her knowledge, the plaintiff had consistently
                    been repaying the loan. Thus was to support her contention that based on the
                    SPA, she was not to be liable for repayment of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, the first defendant expressed no
                    sympathy for the plaintiff’s present financial predicament. She pointed
                    out that the plaintiff was well aware that neither she nor the second defendant
                    were able to service the loan at the material time. Further, the plaintiff had
                    never demanded that the first and/or second defendants repay the loan. Had she
                    been told that she had to pay the mortgage instalments, the first defendant
                    claimed she would have taken on a job. The court was unable to appreciate how
                    the first defendant’s failure or refusal to be gainfully employed (after
                    her marriage) had anything to do with the plaintiff. Apparently, the first
                    defendant used to work as a flight attendant in her younger days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The first defendant prayed for the application
                    to be dismissed. She contended it was unfair of the plaintiff and the second
                    defendant to renege on their word to her and force her and her children out of
                    their home. Currently, her children are aged 28, 26, 20 and 16 with the oldest
                    two in full-time employment. Only the youngest is still schooling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Returning to the plaintiff’s evidence,
                    she revealed in her reply affidavit that she (and her siblings) hardly had any
                    contact or dealings with the first defendant at least for the past 16 years.
                    Indeed, she had not seen the first defendant even once, in the last ten years.
                    The plaintiff denied making the alleged representations in [33] to the first
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff recalled that in September or
                    October 2012, she had requested the second defendant to speak to the first
                    defendant to arrange an overdraft facility on the property so that the plaintiff
                    could continue to support them while supporting herself and her eldest brother
                    and his daughter. Her request was rejected by the first defendant who however
                    was willing to sell the property, to which intent and purpose, the first
                    defendant appointed her own agent, rejecting the appointee of the second
                    defendant, on the basis the first defendant’s agent could get a price of
                    $1.6m as against $1.4m from the second defendant’s agent. The plaintiff
                    deposed she acceded to the first defendant’s demand and signed a sale and
                    purchase agreement in or about October 2012 at the first defendant’s
                    behest. The plaintiff claimed the agreement then was that the sale proceeds
                    would be distributed in accordance with the parties’ shares in the
                    property after refund of their individual CPF withdrawals utilised in the
                    purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, nothing came out of the above
                    transaction. When the plaintiff inquired of the second defendant in January 2013
                    about the status of the proposed sale, he told her there were no buyers because
                    of the poor state of the property. The plaintiff sent two legal letters to the
                    defendants to which the first defendant replied on 11 March 2013, agreeing to
                    sell the property provided the plaintiff only took back her CPF monies utilised
                    in the purchase, because the first defendant “has four children”.
                    Not surprisingly, the plaintiff rejected the first defendant’s
                    offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     A privatisation exercise of the property took
                    place in August 2014. Like the previous supposed <em>en-bloc</em> potential of the property (for which possibility Joe
                    Singh advised the plaintiff she must not jeopardise at any cost by defaulting on
                    the mortgage), there was no change in the status quo between the parties. The
                    court took note that a valuation report that the plaintiff had obtained gave the
                    open market value of the property as $1.25m as of 17 February
                2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff labelled the first defendant as
                    ungrateful for all that she had done for the first defendant between 2002 and
                    February 2013 for which (judging by the first defendant’s affidavit), the
                    latter not only expressed no gratitude but instead levelled numerous
                    unmeritorious accusations against her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It serves little purpose to review the rest of
                    the plaintiff’s reply to the affidavits of either the first or second
                    defendant since the exercise does not advance either side’s case further.
                    The additional affidavits filed by both sides can equally be ignored for the
                    same reason. Looking at the affidavits, it was difficult to sift through the
                    many allegations and cross-allegation to ascertain the veracity of each
                    side’s version of events apart from what was reflected in the documents
                    before the court. Having said that, it should be noted that if the first
                    defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff made the representations to her
                    in [33] is given any credence, it would appear that the plaintiff did abide by
                    representations (a) to (c). I would however dismiss representation (d) as being
                    unlikely to have been made, in the light of the second defendant’s
                    continued joblessness over the years (which he did not seem to make any efforts
                    to redress), his dire financial straits and in the light of the
                    plaintiff’s ordinary occupation as a teacher at the material
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     This court was mindful of the fact that the
                    plaintiff is the subject of Bankruptcy OS No. B 1134 of 2014 on a petition
                    presented by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
                    (“HSBC”) for a debt of $28,684.29. In addition to the claim of
                    HSBC, the plaintiff revealed she was indebted to seven other banks and her debts
                    to all eight banks totalled $188,681.96. She had obtained a temporary reprieve
                    from her creditors because of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Counsel for the first defendant contended that
                    notwithstanding the undisputed fact that the plaintiff had paid considerably far
                    more than the purchase price for the 49% share (as shown in [16] above), she was
                    not entitled to any relief for having made a bad bargain, however unfortunate
                    her present circumstances may be – she had to live with it. He argued that
                    she was estopped from pursuing her claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Counsel further asserted that his client (and
                    her children) had an unassailable right to reside at the property <em>ad infinitum</em> because of clause 10 (<em>supra</em> [27]) read with s 2 of the Contracts (Rights of Third
                    Parties) Act (Cap 53B) (“the CRTP Act”). The salient portions of s
                    2 of the CRTP state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the contract expressly provides that he may; or</p>

                        a proper construction of the contract, it appears that the parties did not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The third party shall be expressly identified in the contract by name,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The first defendant’s counsel also
                    relied on s 46 of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157) (“the LTA”) which
                    states:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The relevant provision would be s
                        46(2)(<em>b</em>) as that would have enabled the first
                    defendant to enforce clause 10 of the SPA against the plaintiff based on s 2 of
                    the CRTP Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, there is also s 3 of the CRTP Act
                    which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Variation and rescission of contract</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. – (1) Subject to this section, where a third party has a right
                        under section 2 to enforce a term of the contract, the parties to the

                        way as to extinguish or alter the third party’s entitlement under that
                        right, without his consent if —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the third party has communicated his assent to the term to the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the promisor is aware that the third party has relied on the term

                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) the promisor can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the
                        third party would rely on the term and the third party has in fact relied on
                        it (whether or not the third party has knowledge of its precise
                        terms).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     There was nothing before the court to suggest
                    that the first defendant (as the third party) had communicated her assent to
                    clause 10 to the plaintiff. As stated earlier at [27], it was unlikely the
                    plaintiff knew the full implications of clause 10 when she signed the SPA or
                    even later, before these proceedings were commenced. Apart from clause 10, there
                    was no other reference to the first defendant as she was not a party to the
                    agreement. Clause 10 identified the first defendant but not her children
                    although even the youngest was already born by the date of the SPA (<em>ie</em>, 27 May 2003).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The court noted that when it suited her
                    purpose, the first defendant was quite happy to give up her rights under clause
                    10. This was on two occasions:- (i) when she was prepared to sell the property
                    at $1.6m on her own terms (at [42]); and (ii) when there was a possibility of an
                        <em>en-bloc</em> sale of the entire Braddell Hills
                    block. Such conduct spoke volumes of the lack of <em>bona
                        fides</em> in the first defendant’s professed claim to want to
                    continue to reside at the property indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It was the unenviable task of this court to
                    determine the rights to the property between the plaintiff, who from the
                    (undisputed) facts had been unfairly treated by an older (and lazy) brother.
                    Even more so, the plaintiff had a sister-in-law (the first defendant) who not
                    only was short on gratitude for all the financial assistance the plaintiff had
                    provided over ten years that enabled the two defendants and their children to
                    live at the property without shouldering any financial burden relating to its
                    purchase but worse, who levelled unmeritorious accusations against her and
                    denied her of any benefit in the property, despite the plaintiff having 49%
                    share in the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It would be highly unjust for the plaintiff to
                    have no remedy at law because of clause 10 of the SPA. To allow the first
                    defendant to rely on s 46 of the LTA to assert that her 50% share was
                    indefeasible would cause and in fact has caused grave injustice to the
                    plaintiff. The maxim “Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a
                    remedy” would be most apt in this case. The law should step in to assist
                    the plaintiff because:-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     she could not, despite holding 49%
                        share (without the defendants’ consent which they would not give),
                        sell the property to recoup her purchase price and other monies she had
                        expended towards the loan and the defendants’ (prior) loan, let alone
                        make a profit therefrom;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     even if she could sell the property, the plaintiff was
                        faced with clause 10 of the CTPR which precluded her from removing the first
                        defendant and her children from occupation thereat;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff did not and even if she
                        had asked almost certainly would not have been allowed by either the first
                        defendant or second defendant to occupy the property despite the second
                        defendant’s claim to the contrary; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_d"></a>(d)     the plaintiff would be otherwise adjudged a
                        bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This was not a question of the plaintiff
                    having obtained a bad bargain for which she had no recourse at law. Over and
                    above her legal interest of 49% in the property, the plaintiff had an equitable
                    interest equivalent to the further sums she had paid towards the property, to
                    her detriment and for which the defendants had been unjustly
                enriched.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the light of the very unusual facts of this
                    case, the court therefore granted the orders set out in [2] above.</p>
