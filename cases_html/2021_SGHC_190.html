Hence, in relation to such of the goods that YCT proves had indeed to be thrown away, the relevant principle is the measure of damages for destroyed goods. For destroyed goods, the normal measure of damages is their market value at the time and place of destruction: <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> (James Edelman, Jason Varuhas &amp; Simon Colton gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2020) at para 37-063.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Both counsel have referred to the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 541 (“<span class="font-italic">Marco Polo</span>”). That case concerned the measure of damages arising from the conversion of river sand. The principles relating to damages for converted goods are broadly similar to those relating to damages for negligently destroyed goods. There, the Court of Appeal discussed (at [42]) the importance of deciding the relevant market by reference to which the value of the goods is to be determined. In the supply of goods, there will typically be different markets at different links of the supply chain, for example a wholesale market where goods are traded in higher volumes for lower prices and a retail market where goods are sold in lower volumes but at higher prices. As the Court of Appeal noted, the burden of proof is on the claimant to establish the relevant market.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It must be remembered, however, that the normal measure of damages is itself only an expression of the principle that damages compensate the plaintiff’s loss and no more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 FG’s argument is that YCT has failed to prove that it lost any sales as a result of the damage. It was able to fulfil its sales orders because it held more than enough inventory to meet demand. Accordingly, its real loss was having to replace the damaged goods, and hence the claimed cost price was the appropriate measure to adopt. FG supported this argument with the evidence of their expert forensic accountant, Mr Potter. He opined:

In relation to YCT, the evidence shows that at that time it was not in a position to convert its stock immediately into sales, and that on the other hand it was able to replace any destroyed stock without loss of sales. It held ample stock and made sales, including of items that were the same as some damaged items, within a few days of the incident.

</div> Thus, when one is considering a stockist such as YCT, the relevant market is the one in which YCT buys its stock, not the one in which it sells it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 While this is ultimately a question of fact, it is fair to say that the answer I have given ordinarily holds true for a business like that of YCT’s. In the Supreme Court of Victoria decision in <span class="font-italic">Furness v </span><span class="font-italic">Adrium Industries Pty Ltd</span> [1996] 1 VR 668, which was cited with approval in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Marco Polo</span> at [45]–[46], the court was concerned with novelty items wrongly taken by the landlord with a view to selling them to recover arrears of rental, so that the landlord was liable for conversion. The court held that the market value ought to be the value at which the plaintiff can buy the replacement goods from the market. Ormiston J said (at 680 and 682) that “[n]otwithstanding the paucity of reported cases I am convinced that a wholesaler's loss is ordinarily to be assessed by reference to the cost of replacement at the date of conversion”, and “it was not correct for the trial judge to select as the appropriate basis for calculating damages the prices at which the respondent might have sold the goods”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Many casual shoppers are familiar with the retailer’s sign “once broken, considered sold”. Whether this is the correct measure in the event of an accident depends on whether the item is one that is in ample stock, or whether breaking it has deprived the retailer of a sale. If the former, then the careless visitor is only liable for the cost of replacing it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Another illustration may be drawn from the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Sonicare International Ltd v East Anglia Freight Terminal Ltd and Others and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (Third Party)</span> [1997] 2 Lloyd's Rep 48 (“<span class="font-italic">Sonicare</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Sonicare</span>, the lost goods were 294 car radios of an incoming consignment of 1,000. The court said (at 55–56):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In my view, the correct measure of damages is the market value for <span class="font-italic">replacement</span> goods, i.e. prima facie the sound arrived value of the radios … Any contrary conclusion might well involve a claimant recovering an uncovenanted windfall, as can be illustrated from the facts of the present case. Supposing, for instance, that the 706 radios delivered provided Sonicare with ample stock for their immediate requirements; and supposing that Sonicare could speedily have procured replacement radios … to award damages based upon the [selling] price would be to compensate Sonicare for lost sales which were not in fact lost. I appreciate, of course, that an alternative scenario can be advanced: what if demand were so high that all radios delivered could be resold at once, and the absence of stock meant that sales were lost which could never be retrieved? In my view, the answer is that such would represent consequential losses which would have to be proved, based on the absence of an <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> available market. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 To sum up, the measure of damages for destroyed stock is usually its replacement cost. This is the measure of damages applicable in this case. In cases where the source market for the goods is reasonably stable, the original cost of the goods may be sufficient evidence of their replacement cost.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The extent of the damage to the goods</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In relation to this issue, I shall first consider the parties’ submissions on the general state of the evidence, before turning to FG’s specific contentions that certain categories of goods were not proven to be damaged to such an extent that their disposal was warranted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The state of the evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 FG makes robust arguments alleging failures in the investigation of the damage, as well as in the preservation of evidence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I accept YCT’s submission as a general proposition. In the absence of contractual provisions, such as may be found in an insurance contract, governing how claims are to be presented and what evidence is required, the court’s task is simply to decide based on the evidence whether the burden of proof has been met. Contractual provisions governing how an insurance claim is to be presented by the insured against his own insurer in respect of negligently caused loss would not apply to the presentation of claims against a negligent tortfeasor responsible for that loss. To this extent, the criticism of how the loss adjuster and the insurer handled the claim is beside the point. It is also true that it would be sufficient in principle for the court to believe the evidence of a single witness, even if not supported by photographs, notes or other records. Nonetheless, whether a plaintiff has failed to take simple steps to record evidence of loss is material to the court’s assessment. When taking photographs is both expected and simple, as has been the case since smartphones with inbuilt cameras became common, it does raise an evidentiary doubt when proper photographs were not taken or not taken systematically. Similarly, while the fact that Mr Toh did not keep notes or take or instruct the taking of proper photographs does not itself bar YCT from succeeding in its claim, it leaves the evidence in a state that is not fully satisfactory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Ultimately, however, it does come down to what evidence was adduced, and this I will consider in relation to the deductions that FG seeks to make in relation to specific categories of goods. The main goods which FG submits on are cordyceps and codonopsis, but there are some other goods to consider as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cordyceps</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 FG has put in issue whether the cordyceps was properly claimable at all. They make two alternative arguments based on the evidence. The first is that the cordyceps was actually in vacuum-sealed bags and so was not damaged.

Given their high value, it would really be expected of any prudent business in YCT’s position intending to claim for them to take such photographs. Noting that the burden of proof is on YCT, I conclude that YCT has not proved that the packets were not sealed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, there is a further consideration of whether the cordyceps should have been salvaged despite its packaging coming into contact with waste water. After all, the cordyceps was for human consumption.  I accept YCT’s submission that even if it were only the packaging that had been contaminated, it was reasonable to dispose of items like cordyceps that are intended for human consumption. This submission was supported by the evidence of Mr Lee, who accepted that if FG’s products came into contact with waste water, he would throw them away, notwithstanding that their packaging was watertight and airtight, because of the risk of contamination.

Its expert was a general expert on materials, and while he did his best to assist the court, he readily conceded that his opinion was not based on any expert knowledge of cordyceps.

As I have explained at [23] above, what puts the stockist back in its position before the destruction occurred is the cost of replacing the destroyed goods. In an absence of evidence of market changes between purchase and destruction, the replacement cost of a good may be determined by how much it originally cost. However, there is no such absence here: post-incident invoices for YCT’s purchases of replacement goods indicate that their prices had fallen. If these goods could be replaced more cheaply than the price at which they had originally been bought, then it would be overcompensating to assess damages based on the higher original price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mr Potter also considered whether the destroyed cordyceps was all of a particular grade, namely 3,500 grade, or of mixed grades, and whether the ginseng had been correctly priced or mispriced, with these variables affecting his calculations.

Sampling as an exercise undertaken in place of complete analysis may be relied on by the court in appropriate circumstances. A complete analysis may be impractical or disproportionately expensive. Nonetheless, the probative basis for extrapolation needs to be clear before sampling is accepted. Sampling is a more reliable tool where it proceeds on the basis of protocols agreed by the parties before the results of the sampling are known. If that is done, then the parties have agreed in advance about the value of the sampling exercise to be undertaken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The considerations I have outlined have been discussed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, extra-judicially, in his recent address to the 7th Annual Conference of the International Academy of Construction Lawyers entitled “The Role of Commercial Courts in the Management of Complex Disputes”. He explored the issue with these illuminating remarks:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 A second, more radical means of downsizing the dispute might entail the use of representative sampling. In a dispute involving thousands of defects, it may be practically impossible to require proof of each and every defect in the assessment of damages. To deal with such cases, some courts have endorsed an approach under which the result obtained in relation to a smaller, more manageable representative sample may be extrapolated to the wider set. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 Building on this, we might even consider the development of <span class="font-italic">voluntary</span> protocols under which parties might agree certain ground rules, such as carving out a set of “excluded” low-value claims for which recovery is pegged to the percentage eventually recovered in respect of the main “non-excluded” claims.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 Some of these suggestions detract somewhat from the common wisdom that justice requires the fullest possible determination of all the facts. But whilst accuracy is undoubtedly important, it is surely an essential element of justice – in particular, <span class="font-italic">access</span> to justice – that the time and resources expended in that quest are contained within sensible and proportional limits.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I agree that sampling may be appropriate in some cases.

Indeed, common sense suggests otherwise, as the supply of products grown in different parts of the world may change in wholly unrelated ways, and demand for one product may change quite differently from how demand for another product does.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In summary, pending my consideration of any adjustments which should be made for the ageing and deterioration of YCT’s goods in storage prior to the incident, the sum which YCT is to be awarded for the damaged goods is $634,625.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ageing and deterioration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The trial was enlivened by the persistent efforts of FG’s counsel to obtain discovery of the loss adjuster’s file. This was ultimately not objected to by YCT, nor by Crawford, and as a result an earlier report made by Mr Toh to the insurer came to light. In it he had proposed that there be a 10% deduction for “normal deterioration”.

</div> This deduction was dropped from the final version of his report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 That the insurer might have been within its rights to have accepted the claim only with a deduction for the normal deterioration of the goods does not in itself mean that the same deduction should now be applied to YCT’s claim. What it does show however is that Mr Toh, who observed both the damaged goods and other goods at YCT’s premises, including the conditions under which they were stored, contemporaneously considered that there was likely to be some deterioration, such that not all the stock remained fit for sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Mr Potter’s analysis of YCT’s inventory across the different products also supported the inference that YCT’s inventory was overstocked and so at risk of ageing or deterioration.

</div> and this also supported the inference that there was likely to be some deterioration over time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 There is a related point, namely that YCT did not have any proper “first-in-first-out” system and so did not know how long it held stock before sale. For some items, it would at the time of onward sale affix a date before which that particular item should be consumed, but it is hard to ascribe utility to such labelling when the item could have been held in stock by YCT for greatly different periods of time, ranging from months to years, and yet still be labelled with the same “consume-by” date. While this practice seems open to question, it does not lead to the inference that all or most of the goods could not be sold. For this inference to be made out, there would need to be evidence that YCT’s practice resulted in the goods being unfit for human consumption, or at least not meeting an industry standard or legal requirement for sale. FG did not adduce such evidence. However, that there was no proper “first-in-first-out” system supports Mr Potter’s small adjustment for ageing. Not implementing a “first-in-first-out” system does mean an increase in the risk that some of the stock will have deteriorated before it can be sold, where, as here, the stock levels were quite high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I accept Mr Potter’s estimate for the appropriate adjustment for this issue, which is a reduction in value of $1,337.
