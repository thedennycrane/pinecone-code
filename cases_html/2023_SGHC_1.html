</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The SPA arose from the defendant’s intended purchase of the Property for the agreed sale price of $3.089m. An Option to Purchase (“OTP”) was issued by the plaintiff to the defendant on 4 June 2018. On payment of the option fee of $308,900, being 10% of the sale price of the Property, the defendant exercised the OTP on 2 July 2018 and the parties entered into the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Pursuant to cl 1 of the SPA, the sale and purchase was scheduled for completion on 4 June 2020. Prior to completion, the defendant was allowed to take early possession of the Property from 27 July 2018. However, completion did not take place even after several extensions of the scheduled completion date. The defendant made nine requests for extension of time since April 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 26 July 2021, the plaintiff’s solicitors (“Dentons”) gave notice to the defendant pursuant to Condition 15 of the Law Society Conditions of Sale 2012 (the “LSS Conditions”) to complete the sale and purchase of the Property by 16 August 2021, in accordance with the terms of the SPA (the “Notice to Complete”). On 18 August 2021, as the defendant did not meet the deadline stipulated in the Notice to Complete, Dentons notified him that the SPA had been terminated on 17 August 2021 and that the plaintiff was entitled to exercise all its rights under cl 5A.2.3 of the SPA and Condition 15 of the LSS Conditions. The plaintiff requested the defendant to deliver up possession of the Property as soon as possible and in any event no later than 4pm on 20 August 2021. The 20 August 2021 deadline was subsequently extended to 8 October 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 After having already been given an extension of the initial 20 August 2021 deadline, the defendant still did not deliver up possession of the Property by 8 October 2021. Hence, the defendant was informed on 8 October 2021 that the plaintiff would commence legal proceedings. On 26 October 2021, the plaintiff commenced the OS seeking, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a declaration that the SPA had been validly terminated on 17 August 2021 and an order for the defendant to deliver up possession of the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On 18 January 2022, the General Division of the High Court declared that the SPA was validly terminated on 17 August 2021. By way of an Order of Court (HC/ORC 368/2022), it was further ordered that: </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff is entitled to enter into possession of the Property; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendant shall deliver possession of the Property to the plaintiff in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA within one month from the date of the order; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff all outstanding maintenance charges due in respect of the Property and late payment interest at 12% per annum thereon with the quantum to be assessed by the Court together with the other forms of damages to be assessed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff damages arising from the defendant’s breach of contract to be assessed by the Court; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff interest on the damages assessed by the Court; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff costs of $7,500 being the costs of the application inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The defendant did not adhere to the one-month deadline stipulated by the Court for the delivery of possession of the Property. Instead, the defendant applied on 24 February 2022 in HC/SUM 740/2022 (“SUM 740”) to seek an extension of time to 27 February 2022 to comply with the order to deliver up possession of the Property.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> The Court granted the application in SUM 740 on 25 February 2022 with costs to the plaintiff. The defendant was also found liable for the necessary costs of the handover (including any overtime expenses of the plaintiff’s staff), and costs arising from the plaintiff’s attempts to take possession of the </span>Property prior to the date of the hearing, the quantum for which would be decided at the AD hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The defendant delivered up possession of the Property to the plaintiff on 27 February 2022. The plaintiff alleged that, in breach of its obligations under the SPA, the defendant had failed and/or refused to reinstate and restore the Property to its original state and condition as at 30 July 2018, the date of vacant possession as defined in the SPA (“Vacant Possession Date”). The plaintiff hence engaged several contractors to carry out reinstatement works before proceeding to market and sell the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 31 May 2022, the plaintiff issued another purchaser (the “Replacement Purchaser”) an Option to Purchase (the “New OTP”). The Replacement Purchaser duly exercised the New OTP. Completion of the sale of the Property to the Replacement Purchaser had taken place by the time I delivered judgment on 27 October 2022. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The parties relied on the evidence of one witness each in the AD hearing, namely the defendant and Mr Koh Chin Beng (“Mr Koh”), who testified as the plaintiff’s sole witness. Mr Koh was a senior sales manager of Wing Tai Property Management Pte Ltd, which was appointed by the plaintiff to provide, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, marketing services to the plaintiff in respect of the units in the Development.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The breakdown of the amounts claimed by the plaintiff is set out as follows,

</div> While I empathised with the defendant’s predicament resulting from the unfortunate turn of events, I was unable to give weight to any of these considerations in assessing the appropriate measure of damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 At the outset, I should point out that much of the background facts in the parties’ respective affidavit evidence and oral testimony were material to the AD hearing only for a contextual understanding of the disputed claims, given the Court’s prior finding on 18 January 2022 that the plaintiff had validly terminated the SPA. The plaintiff was only enforcing its contractual entitlement to its legal rights. The totality of the background facts demonstrated that the plaintiff had granted the defendant considerable latitude for a substantial duration, including allowance for multiple extensions of the scheduled completion date well beyond 4 June 2020. Moreover, the defendant had been in possession of the Property since July 2018 for some 43 months before he eventually delivered up possession on 27 February 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The AD hearing before me was to determine the appropriate quantum of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff. The issues to be determined therefore pertained to whether the plaintiff had proved its entitlement to the sums in the disputed claims, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) legal costs quantified at $100,268.37;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) costs of reinstatement work quantified at $103,915.48;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) damages for the delayed sale and purchase of the Property quantified at $286,962.27;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) interest on shareholders’ loan quantified at $168,709.33; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) unnecessary expenses quantified at $100,981.64.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As the legal principles pertaining to the award of compensatory damages for contractual breaches are well-settled, I do not propose to elaborate on them. It will suffice to note that the defendant had framed the broad issues to be determined as being questions of remoteness of damage and causation.

However, the plaintiff had not relied on any claim based on a contractual indemnity (arising from cl 5A.2.3 of the SPA) at the hearing before Hoo J.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">CGG</span>, the Appellate Division of the High Court (“ADHC”) considered a claim for indemnity costs based on a contractual provision, where the appellant’s entitlement to rely on the said provision had already arisen at a prior hearing in the lower court. The ADHC applied the rule laid down in <span class="font-italic">Maryani</span><span class="font-italic"> Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeals </span>[2015] 1 SLR 496 (“<span class="font-italic">Maryani</span>”) that unrecovered costs in prior proceedings could not be the subject of a subsequent claim for damages. The ADHC clarified in <span class="font-italic">CGG </span>at [16] that “the law on costs makes no distinction of principle between a claim for costs as damages and a claim for costs based on a primary payment obligation”. On the facts in <span class="font-italic">CGG</span>, the ADHC observed that the appellant’s claim was in substance one for unrecovered legal costs, and thus the rule in <span class="font-italic">Maryani</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>would apply to preclude the appellant’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Reverting to the present case, with respect, the defendant’s submission reflected a fundamental misconception on his part. To begin with, the hearing of the OS was bifurcated, with the AD hearing before me only proceeding after the Court had found that the SPA was validly terminated by the plaintiff. As such, the plaintiff’s arguments as to its entitlement to rely on the contractual indemnity provision in cl 5A.2.3 of the SPA would only have arisen at the AD hearing, and not during the initial hearing to determine whether the SPA had been validly terminated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff did not purport to invoke the Court’s discretionary power to order costs at the AD hearing, and hence the defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">CGG </span>or <span class="font-italic">Maryani</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was wholly misplaced. The plaintiff’s claim was premised on its contractual entitlement pursuant to cl 5A.2.3 of the SPA. The provision is worded in clear and unambiguous terms. At the AD stage, the plaintiff was fully justified in seeking to be indemnified for reasonable and necessary legal costs that had been expended. There was no reason why the parties’ contractual agreement on indemnity costs ought to be overridden, and there was no “manifest injustice” that the defendant was able to point to in any case. There was no relevant issue of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or issue estoppel, much less any question of abuse of process or double-claiming, to prevent the plaintiff from making its claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I was satisfied that the quantum of $100,268.37 claimed by the plaintiff was supported by the invoices from Dentons that the plaintiff had adduced through Mr Koh.

It was patently clear that he had stoutly resisted the plaintiff’s various demands to deliver up possession of the Property. Evidently, he did not see it fit to carry out any reinstatement or restoration works either. Even if the parties had been attempting some negotiations up until October 2021 to resolve the issue of completion of the sale and purchase, it would have been obvious by the time the plaintiff commenced the OS on 26 October 2021 that any prior negotiations had been unproductive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The defendant eventually had to be compelled to deliver up possession by a court order on 18 January 2022, declaring that the SPA was validly terminated on 17 August 2021. Even then, he still had over a month to reinstate the Property but failed to do so before delivering up possession of the Property on 27 February 2022. In fairness, I accepted that some COVID-19-related restrictions may have been operative at the time to limit the number of people allowed to enter the Property. Nevertheless, I did not see how, other than from the defendant’s bare assertion, these limitations would necessarily have precluded him from making the appropriate arrangements for reinstatement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Clause 5A.2.3 of the SPA obliges the defendant to reinstate the Property to its original state and condition, excepting damage from fair wear and tear. There was no evidence from the defendant that any of the damage to the Property that the plaintiff had to rectify was the result of fair wear and tear. I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the burden of establishing this lay on the defendant as the tenant: see <span class="font-italic">Brown v Davies</span> [1958] 1 QB 117. The defendant did not discharge this burden. He also did not dispute that fixtures and items were left behind in the Property and were not removed. According to the plaintiff, these included, among various items, (a) a partition wall, loft structure, additional doors, and a fixed panel in the living hall; (b) additional cabinets in the study, kitchen and utility rooms; and (c) modifications to the electrical system and distribution box.

This plainly ignored the fact that he had enjoyed early possession prior to completion, but was <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> a trespasser since he had failed to complete the sale and purchase by the stipulated final date for completion after having taken possession of the Property since July 2018.

Nevertheless, I noted that notwithstanding that s 5 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (“the COVID-19 Act”) provided temporary relief in respect of the performance of certain prescribed contracts, the plaintiff’s rights would continue to accrue during the prescribed period of temporary relief, from 20 April 2020 to 30 June 2021. This is clear from s 7A(2) of the COVID-19 Act. There was also no basis for the defendant’s suggestion that he should be granted rental relief pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020. As the plaintiff aptly put it, “it cannot be the case that the defendant would be entitled to stay in the Property free of charge during this period”.

</div> The SPA did not exclude the operation of Condition 15.10(c). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I noted that the defendant had not offered any direct response to the plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> or Condition 15.10(c) in the reply submissions. Nonetheless, despite the absence of any countervailing arguments from the defendant, I assessed that the plaintiff’s claim for <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages was without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 On basic compensatory principles, the plaintiff should be placed in a position as if the contract had been performed, and be compensated for its expectation loss. By the operation of Condition 15.10(c) of the LSS Conditions, the plaintiff was entitled to retain its profit from the resale, without having to account to the defendant. However, there was no necessary corollary that the profit gained is irrelevant in assessing the plaintiff’s claim to be entitled to <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages. At any rate, the plaintiff had not pointed to any authority suggesting otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I was not persuaded that this is a suitable case for the award of <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages. In <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>”), the Court of Appeal had made it clear (at [177]) that <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages are a limited and exceptional remedy. In the present case, orthodox compensatory damages based on the plaintiff’s expectation loss were in theory available. As such, the first requirement specified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> (at [217]) was not satisfied. In this connection, it was undisputed that the Replacement Purchaser had agreed to buy the Property at a substantially higher price than what the defendant had previously agreed to. The profit from resale far outstripped the <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages claimed. The plaintiff had thus successfully mitigated its loss. By its own admission, no discernible actual loss was suffered.

</div> Thus, there was no basis for the plaintiff’s claim of <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages as compensation for loss of its performance interest, when it had successfully obtained substitute performance at a considerable profit instead. In short, there was no remedial lacuna to fill (see [215] of <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The second requirement outlined in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> (at [217]) is that there should, as a general rule, be a breach of a restrictive or negative covenant. This clearly was not made out on the facts. The plaintiff conceded that the damages sought relate instead to a positive covenant on the defendant’s part to complete the sale and purchase.

</div> This is the third requirement laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> (at [217]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In support of the proposition on a “hypothetical bargain”, the plaintiff highlighted that the parties had previously agreed to delay completion on the condition that the defendant pays late completion interest. With respect, I found this argument unconvincing and contrived in the context of this case, since the defendant had already breached the sale and purchase by his failure to complete. It was unrealistic and irrational to speak of a “hypothetical bargain” (presumably, to release the defendant from the obligation to complete the sale and purchase) when the defendant was already in breach and had delivered up possession. As the plaintiff conceded, there was no continuing benefit to the defendant and no discernible loss to the plaintiff. Hence, the third requirement outlined by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> was also not met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To my mind, the three requirements laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> are conjunctive. The plaintiff had failed to establish that all three requirements had been fulfilled. I therefore allowed the plaintiff’s claim for damages for the delayed sale and purchase of the Property but excluded the sum of $51,761.80 claimed as <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages. The plaintiff was thus only entitled to a reduced sum of $235,200.47.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Item 7 – Interest on shareholders’ loan: $168,709.33</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The plaintiff claimed the additional interest on shareholders’ loans as a result of the defendant’s failure to complete the sale and purchase. This was the interest cost incurred arising from financing obtained by the plaintiff from its shareholders to fund the construction of the Development. The interest rate on the shareholders’ loan was 3% per annum, compounded monthly, translating into $168,709.33 being the interest on the outstanding amount of the purchase price of the Property for the period from 5 June 2020 (after the original completion date) to 25 May 2022, when the loan was fully paid using the funds obtained from the sale and purchase of other units in the Development.

</div> This was also the more likely outcome in accordance with the practical realities. On the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff would have had to incur the costs of the real estate agents and its conveyancing solicitors in relation to the sale and purchase of the Property. Upon the defendant’s failure to complete the sale and purchase, these costs were wasted and the plaintiff should be entitled to recover them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I allowed this head of claim as there was sufficient evidence adduced by the plaintiff to show that the expenses were reasonably incurred and paid.
