<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This litigation is between two sets of brothers
                    who share a father but have different mothers. The brothers are now locked in a
                    struggle for control of two companies: Siem Seng Hing &amp; Company (Pte.)
                    Limited (“SSH”) and Kenson Enterprise (Pte) Ltd
                    (“Kenson”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This litigation comprises three sets of
                    proceedings. The main proceedings are Suit No 1005 of 2012
                    (“S1005”). I will, for convenience, refer to the parties
                    throughout this judgment by their position in S1005. The four plaintiffs seek
                    relief in S1005 under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) arising
                    from what is said to be the oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct of the
                    first and second defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Before the plaintiffs commenced S1005, however,
                    the first and second defendants had brought separate proceedings by way of two
                    originating summonses against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     In Originating Summons No 1042 of
                        2012 (“OS1042”), the defendants seek a declaration that an
                        Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) of the shareholders of
                        SSH on 25 October 2012 and the resolutions passed at that meeting are
                        invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
                        Originating Summons No 1050 of 2012 (“OS1050”), the defendants
                        seek a declaration that a meeting of the directors of Kenson held on 25
                        October 2012 and the resolutions passed at that meeting are
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I have dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim in
                    S1005 and granted the first and second defendants the relief which they seek in
                    OS1042 and OS1050. The plaintiffs have appealed against my decision. I now set
                    out my grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">LKH and the Lim family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       All of the natural persons who are parties to
                    the proceedings before me are sons of Mr Lim Khai Huat @ Lim Ngam
                    (“LKH”). LKH died in 2001 at the age of 88.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> His enduring wish was that his sons would remain
                    united, come what may. This litigation would undoubtedly have been a profound
                    disappointment to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       LKH had two wives and 13 children. He had the
                    following nine children by his first wife, Mdm Choo Chee Lan (“Mdm

                    second wife, Mdm Ng Hong Mui (“Mdm Ng”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Mdm Lim Bee Leng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Throughout LKH’s lifetime, and in fact for
                    almost a decade after his death, the two branches of his family lived and worked
                    harmoniously together. Their relationship started deteriorating in or about late
                    2010. Before tracing the circumstances which led to this deterioration, it is
                    convenient to introduce the corporate defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SSH </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The initial years </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       LKH, together with other like-minded
                    entrepreneurs, incorporated SSH on 26 February 1957 to carry on the business of
                    selling and supplying building materials.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The other founders of SSH are
                    not related to the Lim family. Their identities are inconsequential to this
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     None of LKH’s children was involved in
                    the business of SSH at the time of its incorporation and for a decade after
                    that. At that point, LKH (and the other founders) either allotted shares or
                    transferred a portion of their own shares to their respective sons. The founders
                    thereby drew in the next generation into the family business. It was also during
                    this period that LKW and LKK as well as LKL and LBY were appointed directors and
                    thereby became involved in managing the business of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In 1975, LKH incorporated Kenson to be,
                    effectively, the family holding company for both branches of his
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the 1980s, LKH acquired all the shares in
                    SSH from all the other shareholders who were not part of his family. He held
                    these shares either in his own name or through Kenson. By 30 December 1993, all
                    of the shares in SSH were owned either by members of the Lim family or by
                        Kenson.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ involvement in SSH </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As was typical with many men of LKH’s
                    generation, he drew in only his sons as directors and shareholders in SSH. LKH
                    passed away intestate. It was only by reason of his intestacy that his wives and
                    daughters came to hold shares in SSH.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Up to 2001, the plaintiffs collectively held
                    20.55% of the shares in SSH whilst the defendants held 13.98% of those
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    The remaining 65.47% of the shares in SSH were held by LKH (<em>ie</em>, 49.87%) and by Kenson (<em>ie</em>,
                    15.60%). The table below sets out the shareholding in SSH from 30 December 1993
                    until LKH’s death in 2001, in order of magnitude.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> For
                    ease of reference, the plaintiffs’ names are in bold and the
                    defendants’ names are in italics.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     LKH’s sons have all served as directors
                    of SSH at one time or another. The details of their appointments as directors
                    are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     LKW was appointed a director in
                        1978.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     LKK was
                        appointed a director in 1978. He was not re-appointed in 1982 but returned
                        to the board in 1983. He remained a director for three years and ceased to
                        be a director in 1986.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     LHS was appointed a director in 1993.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     LBT was appointed a director in
                        1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     LBY was
                        appointed a director in 1978 but ceased to hold office in 1981. He was
                        re-appointed in 1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_f"></a>(f)     LKL was appointed a director in 1984 but ceased to hold office in
                        1986. He was re-appointed in 1993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     All of LKH’s sons, apart from LKK,
                    served as directors of SSH until this litigation began. It is a matter of record
                    that LKK ceased to serve as a director in 1986 and was never re-appointed to the
                    board. The parties, however, dispute the reason for LKK’s departure from
                    the board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     LKH was the managing director of SSH until the
                    time of his death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    Although the extent of the involvement of the other plaintiffs in SSH is in
                    dispute, it is common ground that LKW and LBY took the lead in managing SSH, at
                    first under LKH’s supervision from 1993 until his death in 2001, and
                    thereafter on their own.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> They were appointed the chairman and the
                    managing director respectively of SSH on 22 August 2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Kenson </p>

                    1975. LKH and his two wives, Mdm Choo and Mdm Ng, were its initial shareholders
                    and directors. As with SSH, LKH was Kenson’s managing director until he
                    died in 2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>

                    each son was allotted 3,333 shares. In 1978, LKH appointed all of his sons as
                    directors of Kenson. They remain directors to the present day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In

                    Kenson to four of his sons: LKL, LBY, LHS and LKW. He transferred 140,897 shares

                    appointed LKL as its corporate representative to attend and vote for Kenson at

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to this litigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Cracks in the relationship between the two
                    branches of the family started to surface a decade after LKH’s death. A
                    series of events which had their genesis in events in 2008 and which took place
                    in late 2012 saw the tension build up between the two branches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">2008 Rights Offer </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 18 June 2008, a special resolution was
                    passed at an EGM of SSH approving a rights issue to the existing shareholders to
                    raise $1,700,007 (“the 2008 Rights Offer”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Although it was
                    not appreciated at the time, the 2008 Rights Offer had implications for the
                    control of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the same resolution, the directors were
                    empowered to allot the rights shares that were not taken up by the existing
                    shareholders to any persons whom they considered suitable. On the next day, 19
                    June 2008, the shareholders were notified by letter of the 2008 Rights
                    Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The deadline for SSH’s shareholders to
                    accept their entitlement to the rights shares was 30 June 2008. All of the
                    existing shareholders, save for LKH’s estate, subscribed for their
                    entitlement under the offer. However, the shares under the 2008 Rights Offer
                    remained unallotted for more than four years, until 25 October 2012 (see [36]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Distribution of LKH’s shares in SSH </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 20 January 2011, nearly a decade after
                    LKH’s death, his shares in SSH were finally distributed to his
                    beneficiaries in accordance with the law of intestacy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> But 79,787 shares
                    in SSH, representing 1.92% of its share capital, were not distributed. These
                    shares were earmarked for distribution to LMK, LKH’s daughter with Mdm
                    Choo. But they could not be distributed to LMK because Mdm Choo took the
                    position that LMK had agreed to sell the shares to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This bloc of 1.92% of the shares in SSH holds
                    the balance of power in SSH. After the first round of distribution of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 6 February 2012, the plaintiffs convened an
                    EGM of SSH to consider and pass an ordinary resolution to return the sum of
                    $852,300 that had been received by SSH under the 2008 Rights Offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> It will be recalled that
                    LKH’s estate failed to subscribe for the shares in 2008. At the EGM, LKW
                    asked that the 2008 Rights Offer be cancelled and the share application monies
                    be returned to the shareholders on the grounds that the estate had not
                    subscribed for its entitlement in 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Presumably, the
                    plaintiffs had become aware of the implications of this omission and were
                    seeking to negate the consequences of the 2008 Rights Offer by passing this
                    resolution. 2,011,915 votes were cast in favour of the motion. 2,068,481 votes,
                    which included Kenson’s votes exercised by LKL, were cast against the
                    motion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This EGM could not proceed due to an impasse
                    as to how the votes in respect of the shares earmarked for LMK were to be
                    exercised. It was decided that the vote on the resolution would be held in
                    abeyance. The minutes of the EGM record the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [t]he results of the vote would be held in abeyance while the

                        resolution to return the share application monies was not deemed to be
                        passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     LMK eventually commenced litigation against
                    LKH’s estate and won. On 2 February 2012, the court ordered the estate to
                    transfer the shares earmarked for LMK to her. The transfer was effected on 1
                    March 2012. Around the same time, on 27 February 2012, the plaintiffs commenced
                    a suit against LMK claiming that she had reneged on an agreement to sell her
                    shares to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Failure to re-elect LHS and LBT to SSH’s board</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Things came to a head when the third and

                    This was the catalyst for the minority oppression claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Under Article 95 of SSH’s articles of
                    association, directors are obliged to retire from office at each AGM. Ever since
                    the Lim family took full control of SSH, the retirement and re-election of
                    directors at AGMs had been a formality. But at SSH’s 56th Annual General
                    Meeting (“AGM”) held on 20 September 2012, LBY asked for the
                    re-election of directors to be done by poll. The first and second
                    defendants’ branch of the family and Kenson, through LKL, voted against
                    the re-election of LHS and LBT. Crucially, LMK (acting by proxy) also voted
                    against re-electing these two plaintiffs. With the majority (<em>ie</em>, 51.64%) voting against their re-election, LHS and LBT ceased
                    to be directors of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Interestingly, this AGM was held less than two
                    weeks before the conclusion of the plaintiffs’ suit against LMK (see [31]
                    above). On 2 October 2012, the court ordered LMK to transfer her shares in SSH
                    to Mdm Choo. The transfer was eventually effected on 18 October 2012. Following
                    this transfer, the plaintiffs’ branch of the family became the majority
                    shareholders of SSH. The shareholding in SSH after 18 October 2012 was as

                    notice for this board meeting was issued on 19 October 2012. This was the day

                    control of SSH which they had held for the brief period of 23 days from 2
                    October 2012 to 25 October 2012. The allotment had the following effect on the
                    shareholding of SSH:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     LHS convened a meeting of the directors of
                    Kenson on the same day, 25 October 2012, at 2.15 pm. The principal purpose was
                    to pass two resolutions: (i) for LHS to replace LKL as the corporate
                    representative of Kenson to attend and vote at all shareholders’ meetings
                    of SSH; and (ii) to instruct LHS to vote in favour of reinstating LHS and LBT as
                    directors of SSH at an EGM of SSH which was to be held later that day. Notice of
                    this meeting was served only a day before, on 24 October 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Only
                    the plaintiffs were present at this meeting. Unsurprisingly, the resolutions
                    passed.</p>

                shareholders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     LKW convened an EGM of SSH to be held fifteen
                    minutes after the meeting of Kenson’s directors. The purpose of this EGM
                    was to pass resolutions to elect LHS and LBT as directors of SSH. The notice of
                    this EGM was dated 19 October 2012. It is in dispute whether the notice was
                    served on 18 or 19 October 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Once again, neither of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     At the EGM, the plaintiffs’ branch of
                    the family and Kenson, whose votes were now cast by its newly-appointed
                    corporate representative LHS, voted in favour of the resolutions. LHS and LBT
                    were re-elected as directors in LKL’s and LBY’s
                absence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proposed EGM of SSH on 5 November 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Thereafter, on 27 October 2012, the plaintiffs
                    convened a meeting of the directors of SSH to pass a resolution to convene an
                    EGM on 5 November 2012. The purpose of the EGM was to consider a resolution to
                    authorise the directors of SSH to allot 847,707 shares in SSH to any persons
                    whom they thought fit. This was the number of shares that LKH’s estate
                    would have been entitled to if it had taken up its entitlement under the 2008
                    Rights Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     LHS and LBT, who had been elected directors of
                    SSH on 25 October 2012, voted in favour of the resolution together with LKW. The
                    defendants voted against the resolution. The plaintiffs treated the resolution
                    as having been passed and caused SSH to issue a notice to its shareholders
                    informing them that the EGM would be held on 5 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In response, the defendants commenced OS1042
                    and OS1050 against the plaintiffs on 1 and 6 November 2012 respectively. They
                    also obtained an <em>ex parte</em> injunction restraining
                    the EGM scheduled for 5 November 2012 from proceeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I now move on to address in turn the three
                    proceedings which comprise this litigation.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In OS1050, LKL and LBY seek the following
                    relief:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that the meeting of
                        the directors of Kenson on 25 October 2012 is invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     A declaration that the proceedings and
                        resolutions passed at that meeting are void and of no
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     A
                        declaration that LKL is and continues to be Kenson’s corporate
                        representative to attend and vote at all of SSH’s shareholders’
                        meetings until further resolved by Kenson’s
                    directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     An
                        injunction restraining LHS from representing himself as Kenson’s
                        corporate representative and from attending and voting at all of SSH’s
                        shareholders’ meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As I have mentioned, only the plaintiffs
                    attended the board meeting on 25 October 2012 at which the four resolutions were
                    passed. As a result of those resolutions, LHS replaced LKL as the corporate
                    representative of Kenson to attend and vote at SSH’s shareholders’
                    meetings. The notice of the board meeting was served on LKL and LBY on 24
                    October 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     LKL and LBY complain that as a result of the
                    late notice, it came to their attention only on the morning of 25 October
                    2012 that a board meeting was going to be held that afternoon. LKL and LBY
                    immediately wrote a letter to the plaintiffs objecting on the grounds that
                    inadequate notice had been given and recording that they would not be able to
                    attend the meeting because of prior commitments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>
                    Despite receiving this letter, the plaintiffs went ahead with the board meeting
                    at 2.15 pm in LKL’s and LBY’s absence and removed LKL as
                    Kenson’s corporate representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Notice of the board meeting was irregular</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I accept the defendants’ submission that
                    notice of the board meeting was issued and served irregularly on LKL and LBY in
                    that inadequate notice of the meeting was given to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Article 106 of Kenson’s articles of
                    association states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106. A Director may … at any time, <em>by notice
                            duly given</em> summon a meeting of the Directors to be held but
                        it shall not be necessary to give notice of a meeting of the Directors to a
                        Director who is not in Singapore or Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Article 106 requires merely that notice must be “duly
                        given”, without stipulating the number of days of notice that must be
                        given. Nevertheless, it is well-established that reasonable notice must be
                        given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Chow Kwok Ching v Chow
                        Kwok Chi and others and other suits</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 577, Judith
                    Prakash J made the observation at [200]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… As there were no notice periods prescribed in the articles, only
                        reasonable notice of board meetings needed to be given. In most cases a few
                        days’ notice (not seven days) would have been sufficient but I do
                        agree that in relation to the meeting of 16 January 2004, the notice was
                        short and since the plaintiff had clearly indicated he had a prior
                        appointment, the meeting should not have proceeded on that date.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Tan Lee Meng J made a similar observation in
                        <em>Tan Choon Yong v Goh Jon Keat and others and other
                        suits</em> [2009] 3 SLR 840. Tan J stated at [74]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… unless the articles require otherwise, notice of a board meeting
                        may, depending on the need, be called at a short notice so long as it is
                        sufficient to enable directors to attend it. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It is clear to me that in the present case,
                    the directors’ meeting of 25 October 2012 was called at such unreasonably
                    short notice that there was insufficient time for LKL or LBY to attend. Notice
                    of the meeting was sprung on them, giving them less than a day to react to it.
                    Moreover, the plaintiffs went ahead with the meeting even though LKL and LBY put
                    them on notice expressly by letter that they were unable to attend the meeting.
                    I thus find that notice of the meeting was issued and served
                irregularly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The irregularity cannot be cured</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The next question is whether this irregularity
                    can be cured under s 392 of the Companies Act. Section 392 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Irregularities</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>392.</b> – (1) In this
                        section, unless the contrary intention appears a reference to a procedural
                        irregularity includes a reference to –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the absence of a quorum at a meeting of a corporation, at a
                            meeting of directors or creditors of a corporation or at a joint meeting
                            of creditors and members of a corporation; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) a defect, irregularity or deficiency of notice or time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A proceeding under this Act is not invalidated by reason of any
                        procedural irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the
                        irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot be
                        remedied by any order of the Court and by order declares the proceeding to
                        be invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The defendants argue that the failure to give
                    proper notice was a substantive rather than procedural irregularity and is
                    therefore incapable of being validated under s 392. In the alternative, they
                    argue that even if the failure to give proper notice was a mere procedural
                    irregularity, it cannot be cured under s 392 because the irregularity caused
                    them substantial injustice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The defendants submit that the
                    plaintiffs’ actions were deliberately calculated to exclude them from the
                    board meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The irregularity is procedural</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is not easy to determine if a particular
                    irregularity is procedural or substantive. This was recognised in the Court of
                    Appeal decisions of <em>Chang Benety and others v Tang Kin Fei
                        and others</em> [2012] 1 SLR 274 (“<em>Chang
                        Benety</em>”) and <em>Thio Keng Poon v Thio Syn
                        Pyn and others and another appeal</em> [2010] 3 SLR 143
                        (“<em>Thio Keng Poon</em>”). Both cases
                    found the principles in the New South Wales Supreme Court case of <em>Cordiant Communications (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Communications
                        Group Holdings Pty Ltd</em> [2005] NSWSCC 1005 (“<em>Cordiant</em>”) instructive. The following paragraphs
                    from <em>Cordiant</em> were cited in both cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What, then, is the substantive irregularity as distinct from
                        a procedural irregularity? In my view, the cases concerning the distinction
                        between a substantive law or rule and a procedural law or rule provide some
                        guidance. In <em>John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson</em>
                        (2000) 203 CLR 503, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said
                        (at 543-544):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">matters that affect the existence, extent or enforceability of the
                            rights or duties of the parties to an action are matters that, on their
                            face, appear to be concerned with issues of substance, not with issues
                            of procedure. Or to adopt the formulation put forward by Mason CJ in
                            McKain ‘rules which are directed to governing or regulating the
                            mode or conduct of court proceedings’ are procedural and all other
                            provisions or rules are to be classified as substantive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of this observation and of the decisions in <em>Industrial Equity, ANZ Nominee</em>, <em>Scullion</em> and <em>Link
                        Agricultural</em>, I think that the following general proposition may
                        be formulated for the purposes of the application of the Corporations Act, s
                        1322:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">-</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">what is a ‘procedural irregularity’ will
                            be ascertained by first determining what is ‘the thing to be
                            done’ which the procedure is to regulate;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">-</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">if there is an irregularity which changes the
                            substance of ‘the thing to be done’, the irregularity will
                            be substantive;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">-</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">if the irregularity merely departs from the
                            prescribed manner in which the thing is to be done without changing the
                            substance of the thing, the irregularity is procedural.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application of such a proposition in any particular case will depend
                        upon the starting point, <em>ie</em>, defining
                        ‘the thing to be done’. Different answers to the question will
                        be found depending on how broadly or narrowly one defines ‘the thing
                        to be done’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The defendants submit that the failure to give
                    proper notice is a substantive irregularity because it amounted to a wrongful
                    exclusion of the LKL and LBY from the meeting. They contend in turn that the
                    improper and wrongful exclusion of LKL and LBY constitutes a breach of: (i)
                    Articles 91 and 107 of Kenson’s articles of association; and (ii) the
                    plaintiffs’ fiduciary duties to Kenson.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I do not agree with the defendants. To my
                    mind, the deficiency of the notice or the notice period is a procedural
                    irregularity. The defendants have conflated two issues in their submission by
                    treating the failure to give adequate notice and the wrongful exclusion of LKL
                    and LBY as being one and the same. The irregularity in question is the failure
                    to give adequate notice, not the improper or wrongful exclusion of LKL and LBY
                    from the meeting. Whether this irregularity led to the improper or wrongful
                    exclusion of LKL and LBY from the meeting is a separate inquiry. That separate
                    inquiry arises if I find that the irregularity is a procedural one, because it
                    will go to the issue of whether substantial injustice resulted. But at this
                    stage, the focus is on the fundamental nature of the irregularity and not its
                    consequence. The consequence should be set aside for the time
                being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On a plain reading of s 392(1), a deficiency
                    of notice or time is a procedural irregularity “unless the contrary
                    intention appears”. The length of the notice does not “affect the
                    existence, extent or enforceability of the rights or duties of the
                    parties”. Employing the terminology set out in the passage cited at [55]
                    above, the “thing to be done” is giving notice to the directors
                    that a board meeting is to be held at a certain time and place. An irregularity
                    in giving notice does not change the substance of the notice which is given.
                    Instead, it is a departure from the prescribed manner in which notice is to be
                    given. In other words, notice has been accurately given, but the notice period
                    is inadequate. The substance of the “thing to be done” – the
                    giving of notice – remains unchanged. Therefore, the failure to give
                    adequate notice is a procedural, and not a substantive,
                irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Substantial injustice has resulted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Even though I have found that the failure to
                    give adequate notice is a procedural irregularity, the board meeting may still
                    be invalid if I find that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial
                    injustice that cannot be remedied by any order of the court: s 392(2) of the
                    Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Court of Appeal observed at [58] in
                        <em>Thio Keng Poon</em> that whether the irregularity
                    is accidental or deliberate is of secondary importance. Instead, the focus
                    should be on the significance and the materiality of the non-compliance and
                    whether “substantial injustice” was caused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The court went on to provide guidance on what
                    constitutes “substantial injustice”. The following principles can
                    be distilled from the judgment (at [75]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, it is axiomatic that there
                        must be a direct link between the procedural irregularity in question and
                        the injustice suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the injustice must be of a
                        ‘substantial’ nature. This means that the injustice must be
                        real, rather than theoretical or fanciful. There must be some basis or
                        indication on the face of the evidence before the court that the aggrieved
                        party had suffered injustice or would suffer injustice as a result of the
                        procedural irregularity occurring.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the aggrieved party must show that there may or
                        could have been a different result, if not for the procedural
                        irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_d"></a>(d)     The determination of substantial injustice under s 392 involves a holistic
                        weighing and balancing of the various interests of all the relevant
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The defendants submit that the irregularity
                    caused substantial injustice to them and therefore the meeting was invalid. They
                    argue that as a direct result of the plaintiffs’ failure to provide
                    adequate notice, LKL and LBY were unable to attend the board meeting and the
                    resolutions were passed in their absence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> They contend that if
                    adequate notice had been given, they may have been able to attend the meeting
                    and the resolutions may not have been passed. They submit that this was because
                    LHS and LBT, who were both in a position of a conflict of interest, were not
                    entitled to vote. On the other hand, LKL, who was the chairman of Kenson, would
                    have had a second vote in the case of an equality of votes under Article 108 of
                    Kenson’s articles of association. In the alternative, they submit that if
                    adequate notice had been given, LKL and LBY could have taken steps as the
                    majority shareholders to remove some or all of the plaintiffs from the board of
                    Kenson or to seek injunctive relief after commencing an oppression claim against
                    the plaintiffs in order to prevent the resolutions being passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiffs in turn submit that the
                    defendants did not suffer any prejudice even though they were given only a
                    day’s notice because an EGM of SSH had been scheduled to take place that
                    same afternoon at 2.30pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Both meetings were fixed
                    at the same location and were 15 minutes apart. I do not accept this submission,
                    not least because notice of the EGM of SSH itself was problematic as I go on to
                    find when I consider OS1042. The fact remains that LKL and LBY were notified of
                    the board meeting at a late hour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I accept the defendants’ submissions
                    that, had they been given adequate notice, they could have taken other actions
                    which were likely to have led to a different result. The manner in which the
                    plaintiffs sprang the notice of the meeting on LKL and LBY was clearly intended
                    to take them by surprise and to deprive them of time to react. In these
                    circumstances, I am of the view that plaintiffs’ failure to provide
                    reasonable notice of the meeting of the directors of Kenson did cause
                    substantial injustice to the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     To conclude, the plaintiffs’ failure to
                    provide adequate notice cannot be cured under s 392 of the Companies Act. The
                    Kenson board meeting on 25 October 2012 and the resolutions passed in the
                    meeting are therefore invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OS1042: the meetings of SSH’s directors and
                shareholders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I turn now to consider OS1042. In that
                    application, the defendants seek the following relief:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that the EGM of SSH
                        held on 25 October 2012 is invalid and that all proceedings and the
                        resolution passed at the meeting are void and of no
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        declaration that the directors’ meeting of SSH held on 27 October 2012
                        is invalid and that all proceedings and the resolution passed at the meeting
                        are void and of no effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     An injunction restraining LHS and LBT from acting or
                        purporting to act as directors of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_d"></a>(d)     An injunction restraining the plaintiffs from proceeding
                        with the EGM fixed for 5 November 2012, as notified in the notice of EGM
                        dated 27 October 2012, and from passing the proposed resolutions set out in
                        the notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The defendants argue that the notice of EGM
                    dated 19 October 2012 was defective as they were given only six days’
                    notice of the EGM. They submit that this is defective under s 177(2) of the
                    Companies Act, which requires at least 14 days’ notice to be
                        given.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> They argue that a company cannot
                    circumvent the minimum period stipulated in s 177(2) by providing for a shorter
                    period of notice in their articles of association. Thus, Article 62 of
                    SSH’s articles of association which provides that seven days’ notice
                    suffices cannot displace s 177(2) of the Companies Act. The defendants further
                    submit that in any event, the notice was also defective under Article 62 as only
                    six days’ notice was given.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Further and in the alternative, the defendants
                    submit that Kenson was not properly represented at the EGM of SSH on 25 October
                    2012 because the Kenson board meeting on 25 October 2012 itself was not properly
                    convened and thus the appointment of LHS as corporate representative was
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The plaintiffs, on the other hand, submit that
                    proper notice was given. Although the notice is dated 19 October 2012, the
                    plaintiffs assert that it was in fact mailed on 18 October 2012 and that the
                    date is misstated on the notice due to a clerical error.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Their
                    position is therefore that seven days’ notice was given as required by
                    Article 62, with the result that the notice is not defective.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Notice of the EGM was irregular</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Article 62 of SSH’s articles of
                    association stipulates that at least seven days’ notice of an EGM must be
                    given. The article states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NOTICES OF MEETINGS</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62. Seven days’ notice at the least (inclusive of the day on which
                        the notice is served or deemed to be served but exclusive of the day for
                        which notice is given) specifying the place, the day and the hour of meeting
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Although SSH’s articles of association
                    pre-date the repeal of the Companies Ordinance (Cap 174, 1955 Rev Ed) (<em>ie</em>, 29 December 1967), s 3(2) of the Companies Act
                    provides that the continuity of its status, operation or effect is not
                    disturbed, “unless the contrary intention appears in the [Companies]
                    Act”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I agree with the defendants that s 177(2) of
                    the Companies Act sets out such a “contrary intention”. Article 62
                    must be read subject to s 177(2) and cannot supersede it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Section 177(2) of the Companies Act
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Calling of meetings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>177.</b> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A meeting of a company or of a class of members, other than a meeting
                        for the passing of a special resolution, shall be called by notice in
                        writing of not less than 14 days or such longer period as is provided in the
                        articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The wording of s 177(2) is clear. It requires
                        <em>at least</em> 14 days’ notice to be given,
                    while permitting a company’s articles to require a notice period that is
                        <em>longer</em> than 14 days. The implied effect of
                    s 177(2) is that a company’s articles cannot provide for a notice
                    period that is <em>shorter</em> than the prescribed minimum
                    period of 14 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     This conclusion is supported and reinforced by
                    s 177(3). That subsection sets out the exceptions to the requirement that at
                    least 14 days’ notice must be given. It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A meeting shall, notwithstanding that it is called by
                        notice shorter than is required by subsection (2), be deemed to be duly
                        called if it is so agreed –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) in the case of a meeting called as the annual general meeting, by
                            all members entitled to attend and vote thereat; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the
                            members having a right to attend and vote thereat, being a majority
                            which together holds not less than 95% of the total voting rights of all
                            the members having a right to vote at that meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As the defendants submit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> s 177(3) sets out
                    specific situations in which a meeting is deemed to be duly called even if the
                    notice period is shorter than that prescribed in s 177(2). The wording of
                    s 177(3) suggests that the two exceptions set out in this subsection are
                    exhaustive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I therefore find that the notice dated 19
                    October 2012 of the EGM of SSH to be held on 25 October 2012 is defective as it
                    contravenes s 177(2) of the Companies Act. Given my finding that the prescribed
                    minimum period in s 177(2) cannot be overridden by a company’s
                    articles of association, it makes no difference whether the notice was served on
                    18 or 19 October 2012 (<em>ie</em>, whether six or seven
                    days’ notice was given).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The irregularity cannot be cured</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Unless the irregularity in giving notice can
                    be cured under s 392 of the Companies Act, the EGM of SSH on 25 October 2012 and
                    the resolution that was passed to appoint LHS and LBT as directors will be
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I note that the defendants sent the plaintiffs
                    a letter on 25 October 2012 stating that inadequate notice had been given to
                    them of the EGM of SSH and warning that steps would be taken to invalidate the
                    meeting and the resolutions passed if the plaintiffs proceeded with the meeting.
                    As is the case with the Kenson board meeting on 25 October 2012, the plaintiffs
                    ignored the defendants’ letter and carried on with the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I find that the plaintiffs’ failure to
                    provide adequate notice in relation to the EGM of SSH on 25 October 2012 caused
                    substantial injustice to the defendants. This is especially so when the
                    plaintiffs’ actions in relation to both Kenson and SSH are considered as a
                    whole. The plaintiffs sprang the two meetings on LKL and LBY. They gave LKL and
                    LBY inadequate notice of both meetings. As a result of the plaintiffs’
                    actions in relation to both meetings, the resolution to appoint LHS and LBT as
                    directors of SSH was passed in LKL’s and LBY’s absence. The purpose
                    of s 392 is to balance “the twin considerations that proceedings are not
                    invalidated for minor reasons, and that procedural irregularities do not result
                    in unjust situations that cannot be remedied by the courts”: <em>Chang Benety</em> at [37]. I do not think that the purpose of
                    s 392 is to cure situations like the present. Thus, I find that s 392 does not
                    cure the deficiency in the notice of the EGM of SSH. The EGM and the resolution
                    that was passed at the EGM are thus invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Kenson was not properly represented at SSH’s EGM</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Additionally, the defendants submit that the
                    resolution passed at the EGM to appoint LHS and LBT as directors are invalid
                    because Kenson was not properly represented at the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I have declared in OS1050 that the Kenson
                    board meeting held on 25 October 2012 is invalid because inadequate notice of
                    the meeting was given. I have also declared that the appointment of LHS as
                    Kenson’s corporate representative is invalid. Following my decision in
                    OS1050, the votes cast by LHS at SSH’s EGM in favour of electing LBT and
                    himself as directors of SSH are void and ought not to have counted. The
                    resolution that was passed at the EGM to appoint LHS and LBT as directors is
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consequences that flow from my findings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It will be recalled that following the EGM of
                    SSH on 25 October 2012, the plaintiffs called a SSH board meeting on 27 October
                    2012 in order to pass a resolution to call for an EGM on 5 November 2012. All
                    six parties attended the board meeting. The plaintiffs voted in favour of the
                    resolution while the first and second defendants voted against the resolution.
                    The resolution to convene the EGM on 5 November 2012 was deemed to be passed by
                    the plaintiffs and a notice of the EGM was thereafter issued to the shareholders
                    of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I accept the defendants’ submission that
                    LHS and LBT, who attended the SSH board meeting held on 27 October 2012 and
                    voted in favour of the resolution, were not lawfully appointed as directors of
                        SSH.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> Thus, the
                    board was not properly constituted for that meeting. The meeting is invalid and
                    the resolution passed is also invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     To the extent that it is still necessary, I
                    also grant an injunction against the holding of the EGM of SSH that was
                    originally scheduled for 5 November 2012 for the purpose of passing the
                    resolution to authorise SSH’s directors to allot the 847,707 unsubscribed
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I now turn to consider the plaintiffs’
                    claim under s 216 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">S1005: minority oppression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     S1005 involves two distinct minority
                    oppression claims. One arises from the way in which the affairs of SSH have been
                    conducted. The other arises from the way in which the affairs of Kenson have
                    been conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ positions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The plaintiffs argue that both SSH and Kenson
                    are quasi-partnerships or are akin to quasi-partnerships. As a result, it is
                    said, the court should look beyond the confines of the parties’ strict
                    legal rights and obligations and instead look for informal or implied
                    understandings between the parties which give rise to legitimate expectations
                    between them. The plaintiffs submit that they each have a legitimate expectation
                    of participation in the management of each company. They submit also that all of
                    the shareholders of SSH have a legitimate expectation that its profits will be
                    shared amongst them relatively equally, in the sense that the profits will be
                    shared in a manner proportionate to their shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Relying on these legitimate expectations, the
                    plaintiffs complain that the following actions of the defendants in SSH
                    oppressed and unfairly prejudiced their interests: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     LKL and LBY caused the third and
                        fourth plaintiffs (<em>ie</em>, LHS and LBT) to be
                        removed as directors of SSH in its AGM held on 20 September 2012. This, the
                        plaintiffs argue, is contrary to the common understanding held by both the
                        plaintiffs and the defendants that they would each be entitled to remain
                        involved in the management of SSH and defeats their legitimate expectation
                        that they would be directors of SSH until they no longer wished to be
                        involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        defendants, especially LBY in his capacity as the managing director of SSH,
                        made and executed major business decisions for SSH without first getting
                        consent or approval from the plaintiffs who were the directors and
                        shareholders of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_c"></a>(c)     LBY, in his capacity as the managing director of SSH, caused a
                        drastic shift in SSH’s core business, resulting in a significant
                        increase in SSH’s risk profile. LBY did this, the plaintiffs submit,
                        without first getting consent or approval from the plaintiffs who were
                        directors and shareholders of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendants caused SSH to declare inadequate or
                        insufficient dividends over a period of more than a decade after LKH’s
                        demise in 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_e"></a>(e)     At the same time, LBY drew excessive directors’ fees from SSH. The
                        amount of fees he drew significantly increased after LKH’s demise. The
                        plaintiffs submit that the alleged gap between the financial benefits
                        received by LBY and the plaintiffs is contrary to the common understanding
                        and legitimate expectations of the shareholders that there would be a
                        relatively equal sharing of profits by the shareholders of SSH in a manner
                        proportionate to their shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_f"></a>(f)     LBY made self-serving business decisions which were in
                        conflict of interest with the group of companies comprising SSH, Kenson and
                        their subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The plaintiffs make similar complaints in
                    relation to Kenson, which can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     LKL and LBY acted in breach of the
                        parties’ common understanding and legitimate expectation that they
                        could remain as directors and participate in the management of Kenson for as
                        long as they wanted by threatening to remove LKK and LBT from participation
                        in the management of Kenson as directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendants, especially LKL as the managing
                        director of Kenson, made and executed major business decisions without the
                        approval of the plaintiffs who were directors of Kenson.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     Inadequate dividends were declared in
                        Kenson since 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_d"></a>(d)     Further, LKL received excessive directors’ fees. The plaintiffs
                        argue that the gap between the financial benefit received by LKL is contrary
                        to the common understanding and legitimate expectations they had that there
                        would be a relatively equal sharing of profits by the shareholders of SSH in
                        a manner proportionate to their shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The defendants make the following submissions
                    in response:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     SSH and Kenson cannot be
                        characterised as quasi-partnerships or as companies that are akin to
                        quasi-partnerships. Even if they were a quasi-partnership when LKH was still
                        alive (which the defendants deny), the companies ceased to be
                        quasi-partnerships after LKH’s demise in 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further, there was never any mutual
                        understanding or legitimate expectation among the shareholders of either SSH
                        or Kenson that the plaintiffs, as LKH’s sons, are entitled to
                        participate in the management of the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The defendants further submit that even if I
                    find against them on these two issues and find that the plaintiffs were entitled
                    to participate in the management of the two companies, the plaintiffs’
                    claim should still fail for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the defendants have not
                        unfairly excluded the plaintiffs from participating in the management of SSH
                        or Kenson.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, each of the six acts which the plaintiffs cite as being oppressive
                        or unfairly prejudicial to them were not in fact so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the plaintiffs had control of
                        the board of SSH and of Kenson and could have readily put an end to any acts
                        of oppression. The defendants submit that the plaintiffs, having chosen not
                        to use their management control to stop the oppressive or unfairly
                        prejudicial acts that were allegedly committed, cannot now seek the
                        court’s protection under s 216 of the Companies
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the
                        plaintiffs cannot assert that the defendants acted oppressively in causing
                        LHS and LBT not to be re-elected in SSH’s AGM on 20 September 2012.
                        The first and second defendant’s branch of the family held only 34.12%
                        of the shares in SSH. They further argue that they cannot be held
                        responsible for the way in which LMK voted, not least because she is from
                        the <em>plaintiffs’</em> branch of the family and
                        not from the defendants’.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, they submit that LKW and LHS do not have standing
                        to bring a claim under s 216 of the Companies Act in relation to SSH against
                        the defendants. In a similar vein, they submit that LKW also has no standing
                        to bring such a claim in relation to Kenson.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, they argue that the plaintiffs are not
                        entitled to rely on s 216 of the Companies Act because there is a
                        mechanism available under the articles of association of SSH and Kenson for
                        them to sell their shares in the companies at a fair
                value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The issues that fall to be determined are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, whether either SSH or Kenson
                        is a company that is subject to equitable considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, whether the parties have a
                        legitimate expectation that the plaintiffs, as LKH’s sons, are
                        entitled to participate in the management of SSH or Kenson and a legitimate
                        expectation that there would be a relatively equal sharing of profits by the
                        shareholders of SSH in a manner proportionate to their
                    shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, whether the plaintiffs have been treated in such a manner by the
                        defendants as to warrant relief under s 216 of the Companies
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Before going into the parties’
                    submissions in detail, I set out the general legal principles that are
                    applicable in deciding whether relief under s 216 of the Companies Act
                    ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on minority oppression </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 216(1) of the Companies Act </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I begin with s 216 itself. Section 216(1) of
                    the Companies Act was enacted with the objective of protecting minority
                    shareholders from being unfairly treated by majority shareholders. The section
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Personal remedies in cases of oppression or
                            injustice</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>216.</b> — (1) Any member or holder of a
                        debenture of a company … may apply to the Court for an order under
                        this section on the ground —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) that the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of
                        the directors are being exercised in a manner <em>oppressive</em> to one or more of the members or holders of
                        debentures including himself or <em>in disregard of his or
                            their interests</em> as members, shareholders or holders of
                        debentures of the company; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) that some act of the company has been done or is threatened or that
                        some resolution of the members, holders of debentures or any class of them
                        has been passed or is proposed which <em>unfairly
                            discriminates</em> against or is otherwise <em>prejudicial</em> to one or more of the members or holders of
                        debentures (including himself).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     On a literal reading, s 216(1) of the
                    Companies Act provides four alternative limbs under which relief may be granted:
                    (i) oppression; (ii) disregard of a member’s interest; (iii) unfair
                    discrimination; and (iv) conduct that is otherwise prejudicial to the
                    member.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Commercial fairness is key</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     It is settled law that the touchstone in a
                    minority oppression claim is fairness. This was emphasised in <em>Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another</em> [2010] 2
                    SLR 776 (“<em>Over &amp; Over</em>”) (at [81]
                    and [130]) where the Court of Appeal provided a clear summary of the principles
                    that govern a minority oppression claim. The common thread that underpins all
                    four limbs under s 216 of the Companies Act is that the members must have
                    been treated in an unfair manner. There is therefore little utility in reading
                    the four limbs disjunctively and attempting to draw a distinction between each
                    limb.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Even though prejudice to the claimant is an
                    important factor in the overall assessment of unfairness, it is not an essential
                    requirement to make out a claim under s 216 of the Companies Act: see <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at [72]. In this respect, Singapore law
                    differ from English law where both unfairness and prejudice must be shown in
                    order to establish an unfair prejudice claim: see s 994 of the English
                    Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK) and <em>Re Saul D Harrison &amp;
                        Sons plc</em> [1995] 1 BCLC 14 at 31 (“<em>Re
                        Saul Harrison</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The courts have consistently held that the
                    test of “commercial unfairness” involves a consideration of
                    whether there has been a “visible departure from the standards of fair
                    dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is
                    entitled to expect”: see <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at
                    [77] and <em>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</em>
                    [1978] 2 MLJ 227 citing a passage from <em>Elder v Elder &amp;
                        Watson Limited</em> [1952] SC 49. The concept of fairness has to be
                    applied judicially and the content which it is given by the courts must be based
                    upon rational principles: <em>O’Neill v Phillips</em>
                    [1999] 1 WLR 1092 (“<em>O’Neill</em>”)
                    at 1098. It is not sufficient that the conduct is considered unfair by applying
                        <em>subjective</em> notions of commercial or other
                    morality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    It is also important to distinguish
                    unfairness from unlawfulness. Conduct that is technically unlawful may not be
                    unfair; in the same vein, conduct may be unfair without being unlawful:
                        <em>Re Saul Harrison</em> at 19 and <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at [85]. Therefore, a majority shareholder may
                    act entirely in accordance with his strict legal rights, yet the manner in which
                    the rights are exercised may warrant the court’s intervention. Conversely,
                    conduct that is not lawful because it involves some trivial or technical
                    infringement of the articles or even of the Companies Act may not be
                    unfair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The Court of Appeal also observed in
                        <em>Over &amp; Over</em> (at [74]) that, even though in
                    the majority of cases a claim under s 216 of the Companies Act is based on the
                    cumulative effect of a course of action, it is not inconceivable that a single
                    isolated act could amount to oppression.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The starting point of a minority oppression claim </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Showing unfairness is no doubt crucial and
                    essential to succeed in a minority oppression claim. But the starting point in
                    establishing a claim based on minority oppression is not to show unfairness.
                    Instead, a member must first show that the company in question is subject to
                    equitable considerations, arising either at the time the parties’
                    relationship commenced or subsequently, which make it unfair for those
                    conducting its affairs to rely on their strict legal powers and rights under the
                    company’s articles of association and under the Companies Act. The
                    applicable standard of fairness differs depending on the nature of the company
                    and the relationships of the shareholders. What is unfair in conduct in one
                    company may not be unfair conduct in another.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    After deciding if equitable considerations
                    apply, the next stage of the inquiry is to examine whether the member has shown
                    sufficiently that (i) he has certain legitimate expectations derived either from
                    the articles of association, or in the case of a quasi-partnership from the
                    parties’ interactions and personal relationships; and (ii) the conduct
                    complained of is contrary to or has departed from such expectations to the
                    extent that it has become unfair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Bearing these principles in mind, I turn to
                    consider the issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is either company subject to equitable considerations?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In <em>Ebrahimi v Westbourne
                        Galleries Ltd and others</em> [1973] AC 360 (“<em>Ebrahimi</em>”), Lord Wilberforce identified a number
                    of elements which may result in the superimposition of equitable considerations.
                    He stated at 379E:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Certainly the fact that a company is a small one, or a private
                        company, is not enough. There are very many of these where the association
                        is a purely commercial one, of which it can safely be said that the basis of
                        association is adequately and exhaustively laid down in the articles. The
                        superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more, which
                        typically may include one, or probably more, of the following elements:
                            <em>(i) an association formed or continued on the basis
                            of a personal relationship, involving mutual confidence</em>
                        – this element will often be found where a pre-existing partnership
                        has been converted into a limited company; <em>(ii) an
                            agreement, or understanding, that all, or some (for there may be
                            “sleeping” members), of the shareholders shall participate
                            in the conduct of the business; (iii) restriction upon the transfer of
                            the members’ interest in the company – so that if confidence
                            is lost, or one member is removed from management, he cannot take out
                            his stake and go elsewhere</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    If the member fails to show that equitable
                    considerations are superimposed on the company, the measure of commercial
                    unfairness is defined by the parties’ legal rights and their legitimate
                    expectations derived from and enshrined in the company’s constitution. But
                    the situation is different if the member succeeds in showing that equitable
                    considerations are superimposed on the company. The archetype of this, of
                    course, is the quasi-partnership, <em>ie</em> a company
                    within Lord Wilberforce’s first category in the passage quoted above at
                    [105]. In this special class of companies, an extended measure of unfairness
                    will take into account otherwise unenforceable expectations which arise from the
                    members’ personal relationship of mutual confidence rather than from the
                    company’s constitution, and which expectations are not necessarily
                    submerged in the company structure: <em>Over &amp;
                        Over</em> at [79] citing <em>Ebrahimi</em> with
                    approval. This was unequivocally recognised by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Lim Swee Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and
                        others</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 (“<em>Borden</em>”) at [83]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where a company has the characteristics of a quasi-partnership
                        and its shareholders have agreed to associate on the basis of mutual trust
                        and confidence, the courts will insist upon a high standard of corporate
                        governance that must be observed by the majority shareholders vis-à-vis the
                        minority shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Court of Appeal also accepted in
                        <em>Over &amp; Over</em> (at [83]) that the courts have
                    “consistently applied a stricter yardstick of scrutiny [in the context of
                    quasi-partnerships] because of the peculiar vulnerability of minority
                    shareholders in such companies”. The Court of Appeal went on to explain
                    in the same paragraph that greater scrutiny is needed in the case of
                    quasi-partnerships because the members of a closely-held company based on a
                    personal relationship of mutual trust and confidence are inevitably prepared to
                    accept a great degree of informality in spelling out the fundamental
                    understandings and expectations underlying their investment and are more
                    vulnerable to being locked into that investment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <b>First</b>, those who enter into a corporate
                        structure often do not always spell out their rights and obligations in
                        their entirety, in part because they are unable to anticipate all the
                        eventualities that may arise, but also because it would be
                        disproportionately expensive and time-consuming to do so even if they could.
                            <em>Naturally, this problem is particularly acute in
                            respect of those who set up business with others essentially on the
                            basis of mutual trust and confidence – they would have operated on
                            the belief that the majority would take their interests into account and
                            that any such problems would be readily and civilly ironed
                            out.</em> Ironically, often these understandings are not
                        documented, let alone spelt out in legal terms, as it might be perceived
                        that the very documentation of the understanding might betray a lack of
                        trust. …
                        <b>Second</b>, the <em>reality of the
                            nature of a closed company makes it susceptible to exploitative conduct
                            by the majority</em> simply because the minority has no obvious
                        legal remedies spelt out in the memorandum and articles of association. At
                        the risk of stating the obvious, it bears mention that minority shares in
                        private companies are often difficult to dispose of, and even if there was a
                        market for them they would often have to be sold at a substantial
                        discount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold and in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Therefore, in cases involving
                    quasi-partnerships, the courts will take into account even informal and
                    undocumented understandings and expectations in determining whether the minority
                    has been unfairly treated: <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at
                    [84]. The reason for this was best explained by Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) in
                        <em>Re Saul Harrison</em> at 19-20, where he
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>the personal relationship between a shareholder and those
                            who control the company may entitle him to say that it would in certain
                            circumstances be unfair for them to exercise a power conferred by the
                            articles upon the board or the company in a general meeting.</em>
                        I have in the past ventured to borrow from public law the term
                        ‘legitimate expectation’ to describe the correlative
                        ‘right’ in the shareholder to which such a relationship may give
                        rise. <em>It often arises out of a fundamental understanding
                            between the shareholders which formed the basis of their association but
                            was not put into contractual form</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The plaintiffs take the position that SSH
                    and Kenson are subject to equitable considerations because they are family
                    companies and are therefore quasi-partnerships or share the characteristics of a
                    quasi-partnership. For this proposition, the plaintiffs rely on the cases of
                        <em>Chow Kwok Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi and another</em>
                    [2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 (“<em>Chow Kwok
                    Chuen</em>”) and <em>Fisher v Cadman</em>
                    [2005] EWHC 377 (Ch). They submit that Kenson has always been a
                    quasi-partnership while SSH became a quasi-partnership between LKH and his sons
                    in 1993 when LKH bought out all the other shareholders who were unrelated to the
                    Lim family (see [12] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    On the other hand, the defendants argue that
                    neither company is a quasi-partnership. They submit that neither company was
                    incorporated or operated on the basis of any relationship of mutual trust and
                    confidence between the members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Instead, LKH alone made all
                    the final management decisions in the two companies while he was alive and the
                    companies operated according to the members’ strict legal rights after he
                    died.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    There is no doubt that SSH and Kenson are
                    “family companies” in the broad sense that all its members who are
                    natural persons are members of a family. However, I accept the defendants’
                    submission that neither SSH nor Kenson is a quasi-partnership. The facts show
                    that LKH ran both companies as an autocratic patriarch. He decided whom to
                    appoint as a director and decided when they should cease to be a director. On
                    this issue, I accept the defendants’ evidence that it was LKH who decided
                    that LKK, the second plaintiff, should resign as a director of SSH (see
                    [15]–[16] above and [127] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Importantly, even though the parties are
                    family members, their relationship in the two companies was not based on mutual
                    trust and confidence between the members. Unlike the companies in <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em>, LKH did not set up and run SSH and
                    Kenson “with the inherent assumption … that the shareholders and
                    directors, as descendants of the patriarch, would work in concert to grow the
                    [companies], enhance the family fortune and perpetuate the legacy”
                        (<em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> at [33]). Quite the contrary:
                    LKH had an overriding say in both companies until his death in 2001. All the
                    parties accepted LKH’s authority and his decisions unquestioningly. So
                    while it is undoubtedly true that there existed in each company a bilateral
                    relationship of mutual trust and confidence between LKH and each son, I find
                    that there was no such relationship between each son and all of the other
                    sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In particular, even as between each son and
                    LKH during his lifetime, there was never any expectation or any basis for any
                    expectation that each son would be involved in managing SSH so long as he wished
                    or even that each son would be entitled to hold the office of director so long
                    as he wished. In fact, only LKW and LBY assisted LKH in managing SSH while LKH
                    was alive. After LKH’s death, the two took over the management of SSH
                    without objection. In contrast, LHS, LBT and LKL were non-executive directors
                    who did not participate, who did not expect to participate and who did not ask
                    to participate in the management of SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    As for Kenson, there is even more evidence
                    to show that it is not a quasi-partnership. LKH established Kenson on his own
                    and determined unilaterally who would be a shareholder and who would be a
                    director. From the 1980s, LKL was the only son of LKH who was involved in
                    managing the business of Kenson. The remaining parties were non-executive
                    directors. It appears, in fact, that even LKH did not play an active or
                    substantial role in Kenson. He and the other members were content to leave the
                    company to be managed by LKL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In these circumstances, I find that neither
                    SSH nor Kenson is a quasi-partnership or a company that is akin to a
                    quasi-partnership. There is no scope of the superimposition of equitable
                    considerations. The measure of commercial unfairness is defined by the
                    parties’ legal rights and their legitimate expectations derived from and
                    enshrined in the company’s constitution. The plaintiffs do not allege that
                    there has been any breach of their legal rights under SSH’s or
                    Kenson’s articles of association or the Companies Act. Against the
                    applicable measure, therefore, I find that LKL and LBY have not treated the
                    plaintiffs unfairly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In case I am wrong in these findings, I now
                    consider the plaintiffs’ case on the assumption that that the
                    parties’ relationships as members of SSH and of Kenson were personal
                    relationships based on mutual trust and confidence, as a result of which they
                    did not document the fundamental understandings and expectations underlying
                    their investment in these two companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legitimate expectations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The plaintiffs’ case is that
                    LKL’s and LBY’s actions in SSH and in Kenson are in breach of the
                    plaintiffs’ legitimate expectations. They submit that there was an
                    informal or implied understanding amongst the parties that they, as LKH’s
                    sons, are entitled to participate in the management of SSH and
                        Kenson.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> These informal or implied understandings in
                    turn gave rise to the following legitimate expectations:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the plaintiffs are entitled to
                        act as directors of SSH and Kenson until and unless they no longer wish to.
                        This, they submit, follows from the fact that s 157A(1) of the Companies Act
                        state that the powers of management of a company are vested in its
                        directors; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the plaintiffs are entitled to participate in the making of major
                        business decisions and are entitled to have their consent or approval sought
                        on such decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    On the plaintiffs’ account, the
                    implied understanding and legitimate expectation arose from the way LKH gave the
                    shares in the companies to the parties and how he repeatedly communicated to
                    them his wish and intention that all of them should stay united and run the
                    companies together. This, the plaintiffs explain, was the reason LKH appointed
                    and retained all of them as directors of SSH (save for LKK, who ceased to be a
                    director in 1986) and of Kenson. They further argue that the fact that none of
                    LKH’s sons ever objected to the appointment of their brothers as directors
                    or to their own appointment as directors shows that they were in tacit agreement
                    that all of them are entitled to be part of the management of the
                        companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> As additional support for this submission, the
                    plaintiffs rely on the fact that the re-election of directors in each company
                    took place as a matter of routine, without a poll, each year up until the EGM of
                    SSH on 25 October 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In response, the defendants argue there was
                    never any such understanding or expectation. They point out that the
                    plaintiffs’ pleaded case and the evidence that they have tendered are
                    contradictory and submit that it is telling that the plaintiffs are unable to
                    pinpoint the exact genesis of the alleged understanding or
                        expectation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    They further submit that the fact that LKH’s sons were all appointed
                    directors of SSH and Kenson at different periods and were removed as directors
                    of SSH for certain periods of time during LKH’s lifetime militates against
                    the existence of any such understanding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Instead, they argue that the
                    evidence shows that LKH had the sole power to decide who was to be appointed
                    director and when he should be appointed. In a similar vein, the fact that LKK
                    ceased to be a director of SSH and was unable to counter the defendants’
                    objections when he sought to be re-elected subsequently militates against such a
                    mutual or implied understanding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> They submit that such an
                    understanding or expectation could not have existed considering that only LKW
                    and LBY were involved in the management of SSH and only LKL was involved in the
                    management of Kenson.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The concept of “legitimate
                    expectations” arose from the judgment of Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) in
                        <em>Re a Company (No 00477 of 1986)</em> [1986] BCLC
                    376 at 378. He later used the phrase again in <em>Re Saul
                        Harrison</em>. But subsequently in <em>O’Neill</em>, Lord Hoffmann cautioned against using the concept
                    too loosely and deprecated the phrase. I quote the relevant passage from
                        <em>O’Neill</em> (at 1102) in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was probably a mistake to use [the term “legitimate
                        expectations”], as it usually is when one introduces a new label to
                        describe a concept which is already sufficiently defined in other terms. In
                        saying that it was “correlative” to the equitable restraint, I
                        meant that it could exist only when equitable principles of the kind I have
                        been describing would make it unfair for a party to exercise rights under
                        the articles. <em>It is a consequence, not a cause, of the
                            equitable restraint. The concept of a legitimate expectation should not
                            be allowed to lead a life of its own, capable of giving rise to
                            equitable restraints in circumstances to which the traditional equitable
                            principles have no application.</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The concept of “legitimate
                    expectations” is thus of limited scope. It cannot be used as a legal mask
                    for what may have been nothing more than a party’s <em>subjective</em> expectations, even if there is a reasonable basis for
                    that subjective expectation. Showing that a subjective expectation has been
                    defeated cannot, in itself, suffice to make out a claim under s 216 of the
                    Companies Act. The plaintiffs cannot rely on any subjective expectation that
                    they may have harboured that they would be entitled to participate in the
                    management of the business of SSH or of Kenson. They can succeed in their case
                    only if they can show an informal agreement or a clear understanding shared by
                    the parties that they were each entitled to participate in the management of
                    each company and to hold the office of a director until they elect
                    otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The evidence before me shows that there was
                    no such implied or informal understanding between LKH’s sons. It is not
                    necessary for me to make a conclusive finding on whether LKH communicated to the
                    parties his intentions for them to all remain involved in the companies. First,
                    even if LKH had such an intention, it does not necessarily follow that the
                    parties shared it. The understanding has to be one that was shared by them all,
                    and not one that was <em>imposed</em> upon them. Further,
                    LKH passed away a decade before the dispute arose. Even if I accept that the
                    parties shared such an informal understanding in 2001 out of respect for their
                    father, that does not in itself mean that the understanding persists more than a
                    decade after his death. What is important is thus whether the parties had such
                    an implied or informal understanding at the material time, <em>ie</em> in 2012, independent of the wishes that LKH allegedly
                    had.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The plaintiffs’ case is also weakened
                    by the fact that only a few of LKH’s sons were actively involved in
                    managing each company. If the plaintiffs could show that they had each
                    consistently been involved in managing each company, I would find more
                    convincing their case that an informal understanding existed between all of
                    LKH’s sons that each son should have a right always to involve himself in
                    management. But the evidence shows that only LKW and LBY were involved in
                    managing SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    It is true that some of LKH’s other
                    sons manage SSH’s subsidiaries. For example, LHS is the managing director
                    of Sim Seng Hin Sawmill Company (Pte.) Limited (“SSH Sawmill”) and
                    LBT was the managing director of another subsidiary, Kitchen &amp; Kitchen Pte.
                    Ltd (“Kitchen &amp; Kitchen”) up till 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> But participation in
                    the management or in the business of a subsidiary is distinct from a right to
                    participate in the management or business of the parent and cannot in itself
                    give rise to an expectation of such a right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    As for Kenson, the evidence shows that only
                    LKL was involved in the management and operations of the company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> This explains why
                    LKH gave the majority of his shares in Kenson to LKL instead of his other sons.
                    The other sons were merely non-executive directors. The plaintiffs had to resort
                    to reciting dated and contrived examples in an attempt to argue that they had
                    been involved in managing Kenson. For instance, LKW asserts that he helped LKL
                    run the company in the 1980s when Kenson was sharing premises with SSH by
                    answering calls on LKL’s behalf when the latter was not available. I agree
                    with the defendants that this hardly counts as being involved in the management
                    of Kenson.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    LHS also claims that he was involved in the
                    business of Kenson because he was in charge of procuring timber for Kenson and
                    further, that the goods were placed at SSH Sawmill’s
                        warehouse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> He also claims that he oversaw
                    Kenson’s customer orders which required the processing of timber.
                    LHS’s involvement in Kenson must be seen in the context of Kenson’s
                    contractual relationship with SSH Sawmill. His supposed acts of involvement in
                    Kenson are in fact either unsolicited services provided by LHS in his capacity
                    as the managing director of SSH Sawmill or business transactions between Kenson
                    and SSH Sawmill, for which the evidence shows that SSH Sawmill was remunerated
                    at arm’s length. It suffices to say that participating in the management
                    of a company is clearly distinct from performing <em>services</em> for that company as delegated by its managers or on
                    one’s own accord.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I also find that there was no implied or
                    informal understanding shared by the parties that they were entitled to remain
                    on the board of each company. When he was alive, it was LKH who decided which of
                    his sons should be appointed to the boards of the companies and when that should
                    be done. It was also LKH who decided when they should cease to be directors (see
                    [15] above). In this regard, I accept the defendants’
                        submission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> that the second plaintiff, LKK, did not
                    voluntarily resign his office as a director of SSH but was removed by LKH
                    because LKH was displeased with him. Although LKK produced a letter of
                    resignation, the letter simply states that he was resigning as manager but did
                    not state that he was resigning from the office of a director. After he ceased
                    to be a director in 1986, LKK was never reinstated as a director of SSH. This is
                    strong evidence which militates against any suggestion of an understanding or
                    agreement between the sons or with LKH that any of them was entitled to be a
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Further, LKK conceded in cross-examination
                    that when his attempts to be reinstated to SSH’s board after LKH’s
                    death were met with objections from the defendants, at no point did he suggest
                    that he and his brothers from both branches of the family had any sort of
                    legitimate expectation to hold office as a director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The evidence contradicts the
                    plaintiffs’ submission that such a legitimate expectation exists. Instead,
                    the evidence shows that no such expectation existed when each company was first
                    formed, when LKH took control of SSH and when LKH appointed his sons to the
                    board of SSH. The plaintiffs have also not shown that there was any change after
                    LKH’s death which gave rise to such an understanding or
                    expectation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In these circumstances, I find that the
                    plaintiffs did not have any legitimate expectation that they are entitled to
                    participate in the management of SSH or Kenson or to be appointed as directors
                    of the companies for so long as they wished.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Commercial unfairness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Having found that the plaintiffs have no
                    basis for a legitimate expectation to participate in the management of the
                    business or to hold office as a director of either company, I turn now to look
                    at whether the specific acts of oppression alleged against the defendants were
                    indeed commercially unfair. As discussed at [99] above, “commercial
                    unfairness” involves a consideration of whether there has been a visible
                    departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions
                    of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Removal of LHS and LBT from the board of SSH</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    My finding that the plaintiffs do not have a
                    legitimate expectation to be directors of SSH deals directly with the
                    plaintiffs’ first complaint that the defendants unfairly caused the
                    failure of LHS and LBT to be re-elected as directors at the AGM of SSH held on
                    20 September 2012. It is not suggested that the voting or the AGM was in any way
                    invalid. What the plaintiffs are unhappy about is the fact that the defendants
                    voted against LHS’s and LBT’s re-election, with the result that they
                    ceased to be directors. Given that the plaintiffs have no legitimate expectation
                    to hold or to continue to hold office as director, there is nothing unfair in
                    the defendants exercising their votes to bring about that result together with
                    other shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">LBY’s and LKL’s decision-making </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The plaintiffs also complain that it is
                    unfair that LKL and LBY do not consult them before making important business
                    decisions. They allege that they made and executed major business decisions
                    without first obtaining consent or approval from them. The business decisions
                    include the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>

                        Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    It is not necessary for me to examine the
                    merits of each decision or the reasons behind them. The role of the court on an
                    application under s 216 is not to assess the business merits of the
                    company’s management’s decisions. The court’s role is to
                    assess whether the decision has been attended by commercial
                unfairness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The plaintiffs have not shown why LBY, who
                    after all is the managing director of SSH, must consult the plaintiffs before
                    making business decisions which he views as commercially sound. In fact, Article
                    103 of SSH’s articles of association stipulates that the managing director
                    has the power to “do and execute all such contracts acts deeds matters
                    and things [sic] as may be considered by him requisite or expedient” in
                    the management of the ordinary business of the company, subject to any
                    directions that may be given by the board from time to time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    It also cannot be said that the plaintiffs
                    were completely excluded from executive decision-making in SSH. The evidence
                    shows that LBY included LKW, as the representative of his branch of the family,
                    in decision-making. Further, the board of SSH was eventually informed of the
                    respective transactions and in most instances, ratified the acts of LBY and LKW
                    or signed resolutions of approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> I find that the plaintiffs
                    have failed to make out their claim that they were unfairly excluded from the
                    decision-making process. It does not lie in the mouth of a director who chooses
                    not to take an active part in the management of the company to argue that it is
                    unfair that the company’s executive directors have taken or implemented
                    business decisions without involving him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The situation in Kenson is similar. As I
                    have found, LKL was the only one actively involved in running Kenson. He cannot
                    be faulted for making decisions for the company as its managing director without
                    consulting the plaintiffs. Further, the plaintiffs’ complaint in relation
                    to Kenson is even weaker than that in relation to SSH. They are able to point
                    only to an isolated act – the purchase of 17 Joo Koon Road – as a
                    basis for their complaint that LKL acted oppressively by excluding them from the
                    business decisions in Kenson. While I accept that an isolated act can amount to
                    oppression (see [101] above), there are no surrounding circumstances of
                    commercial unfairness here. I therefore find that there has been no oppression
                    in Kenson.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The plaintiffs also complain that LBY caused
                    a drastic shift in the core business of SSH from 2005 onwards without the
                    consent or approval of the plaintiffs. This, they say, resulted in a significant
                    increase in the risk profile of SSH. Again, I do not need to go into the
                    commercial merits of LBY’s decision in order to evaluate whether this
                    amounts to oppression. Whether the change in SSH’s core business from
                    supplying a wide range of building materials to supplying mainly steel bars and
                    steel beams caused an increase in SSH’s risk profile or a drop in its
                    profits is therefore not of consequence. What matters is whether it was
                    oppressive or unfairly prejudicial not to seek the consent or approval of the
                    plaintiffs in making this change.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I have already found that the plaintiffs do
                    not have a legitimate expectation to be involved in the management of the
                    business of SSH. Further, I accept LBY’s submission that the plaintiffs
                    were aware of the shift in SSH’s business direction. At the very least,
                    this would have been clear from the annual audited financial statements that
                    were sent to all the shareholders. Even if I accept the plaintiffs’
                    account that LKW and LKK raised their concerned by cautioning LBY that the
                    change was risky<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> and that LBT told LBY that there should not be
                    such a change<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>, the fact remains that no objections were ever
                    placed on record at any AGM or any board meeting. It is also telling that even
                    though this shift took in 2005, the plaintiffs did not allege that this was
                    oppressive, prejudicial or unfair until the parties fell out in 2010. This
                    complaint is an afterthought formulated by the plaintiffs to bolster their claim
                    against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Excessive director fees and inadequate dividends </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The plaintiffs argue that LKL and LBY acted
                    unfairly in paying themselves excessive directors’ fees whilst declaring
                    inadequate dividends. They submit that in the years prior to LKH’s death
                        (<em>ie</em>, 1994 to 2000), the directors of SSH
                    received only $5000 in directors’ fees every year. Yet starting from 2004,
                    LBY started receiving an additional fee as a director which was equivalent to
                    10% of the net profit of SSH. As for Kenson, the plaintiffs point out that after
                    LKH’s death, LKL received on average about 42.81% of the directors’
                    fees paid out each year whilst the remaining directors each received only about
                    7% to 13% of the fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The plaintiffs also point to the fact that
                    SSH and Kenson have not paid significant dividends during the same period. For
                    instance, SSH paid dividends only twice over a period of more than ten years
                    since 2002. On the plaintiffs’ calculations, only about $1.2m has been
                    paid to the shareholders in the period of more than 10 years, even though the
                    accumulated revenue reserve of SSH as of December 2011 was as high as $21m and
                    includes a substantial sum of cash and cash equivalents amounting to more than
                        $5.7m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Kenson too did not pay significant dividends
                    over the same period. It paid dividends only on three occasions over the same
                    ten year period from 2002, with the total dividends amounting to only $507,308
                    even though it had much higher reserves.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs further point
                    out that the dividends paid in both companies coincided with the
                    companies’ issuance of share capital by a rights issue. As a result, a
                    significant portion of the dividends distributed to the shareholders of Kenson
                    and SSH was returned to the companies by the shareholders as part of its
                    enlarged share capital.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The plaintiffs argue that the practice of
                    paying excessive directors’ fees, coupled with the practice of declaring
                    inadequate dividends amounts to oppression as it is contrary to their common
                    understanding or legitimate expectation that there would be a relatively equal
                    sharing of profits amongst the shareholders, subject only to the proportion of
                    shares which they hold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I accept that a policy of declaring
                    inadequate dividends coupled with an overly generous policy of remunerating
                    directors may cumulatively result in conduct that is oppressive or commercially
                    unfair: <em>In re Gee Hoe Chan Trading Co Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1991] 2 SLR(R) 114 and <em>Re Sam Weller &amp; Sons
                        Ltd</em> [1990] Ch 682. An example of such a situation is where,
                    through directors’ fees and remuneration, the majority shareholders
                    receive sums that far exceed the amounts that the minority shareholders, who do
                    not receive such fees and remuneration, receive as dividends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    However, I am unable to accept the
                    plaintiff’s submission on the facts of the present case. I take as my
                    starting point the fact that directors have no obligation to declare dividends
                    and shareholders correspondingly have no right to receive dividends: <em>Burland v Earle</em> [1902] AC 83. The failure to recommend
                    or effect the declaration of dividends does not by itself amount to unfair
                    conduct which is impeachable under s 216 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Further, it cannot be said that LKL and LBY
                    have unfairly enriched themselves by adopting a policy of generous payments to
                    directors and suppressed dividends to shareholders. First, it is the plaintiffs
                    who controlled the board of directors of both SSH and Kenson at the material
                    time. Whether to declare dividends, as well as the quantum to declare, is a
                    decision for the board. The plaintiffs could therefore, at any time, have passed
                    the necessary resolutions to declare dividends should they have wished to do so.
                    The fact that they did not do so suggests, again, that there in fact was no
                    unfairness of any kind and that the complaint of unfairness is made now purely
                    as an afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Second, I accept the defendants’
                    submission that the additional directors’ fees which LKL and LBY receive,
                    though substantially more than the other directors’ fees, is not without
                    reasonable justification. The defendants submit that it is the policy in all SSH
                    group companies for each company’s managing director to be awarded 10% of
                    the net profit for that year if the company earns a profit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> This is to
                    incentivise the managing director who plays a vital role in running the company.
                    This is not disputed by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Third, the evidence shows that the
                    plaintiffs did not object to the directors’ fees paid to LKL and LBY even
                    though they controlled the board and so could have voted it down at any time.
                    The plaintiffs tried to explain that they did not voice their dissatisfaction or
                    grievance because they did not want to affect the relations between the two
                    branches of the family. In the absence of any threat or unreasonable behaviour
                    on the part of the defendants, however, I am of the view that if the plaintiffs
                    chose, for whatever reason, to remain silent for the past decade and accept the
                    policies on dividends and remuneration of LKL and LBY instead of exercising
                    their power to change the situation, the court should be slow to find that the
                    policies had an oppressive effect, whether in any given year or over all the
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Additionally, the plaintiffs submit that
                    there was a common understanding among the shareholders that there would be a
                    relatively equal sharing of profits by the shareholders in relation to both
                    companies. But the plaintiffs fail to adduce sufficient evidence to show that
                    such an understanding existed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> They were unable to
                    state the circumstances in which the understanding arose or explain why it is
                    not shared by the other shareholders such as their sisters. The plaintiffs have
                    also failed to explain why they approved the directors’ fees awarded every
                    year without protest, instead of insisting on their rights under this mutual
                    understanding or legitimate expectation. I find that no such legitimate
                    expectation exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In conclusion, the practices in SSH and
                    Kenson in relation to the declaration of dividends and payment of
                    directors’ fees were not commercially unfair and did not oppress the
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Self-serving business decisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The plaintiffs further allege that LKL and
                    LBY made self-serving business decisions that were in conflict with the
                    interests of the SSH group of companies. Sometime in 2010, a subsidiary of SSH,
                    Kaiwatt Development Pte Ltd (“Kaiwatt”), undertook a project to
                    develop a property at Pegu Road. The plaintiffs’ complain that the
                    following acts of LBY were self-serving and were against the interests of
                    SSH:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_a"></a>(a)     Kaiwatt nominated Style Line Pte
                        Ltd (“Style Line”) instead of SSH Sawmill, SSH’s
                        subsidiary, as sub-contractor for the flooring for the project. Style Line
                        is a company that LKL and his nephew collectively owned.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_b"></a>(b)     Kaiwatt did not nominate another
                        subsidiary of SSH, Kitchen &amp; Kitchen for the kitchen works in the
                        project. Kitchen &amp; Kitchen had to bid for the sub-contracting works with
                        other sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    There is no need to look into these
                    decisions in detail. First, the decisions do not concern SSH or Kenson directly.
                    Any decision made by LKL and LBY in relation to Kaiwatt is made by them in their
                    capacity as directors of Kaiwatt. They thus fall outside of the scope of the
                    present minority oppression claims, which relate to Kenson and
                SSH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Second, if these two SSH subsidiaries have
                    in fact suffered any loss as a result of these decisions, that is a matter for
                    those companies to pursue as the proper plaintiff. I have thus far rejected each
                    of the plaintiffs’ allegations of oppression. Even if I were to assume
                    that this narrow allegation in relation to Kaiwatt is well-founded, it is all
                    that now remains of the plaintiffs’ case on oppression. In those
                    circumstances, it ought to be for the subsidiaries to pursue this allegation in
                    proceedings for breach of fiduciary duty rather than for the members of those
                    subsidiaries’ holding companies to do so under s 216. Any loss suffered by
                    the members would be merely reflective of the subsidiaries’ and the
                    holding company’s loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Third, even if LKL and LBY made these
                    decisions in their capacity as the managing directors of Kenson and SSH
                    respectively, the acts cannot be said to be oppressive or unfair to the
                    plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have failed to show that LKL and LBY acted in bad
                    faith in making the decisions. With regard to Kitchen &amp; Kitchen, it is hard
                    to conceive how a decision to call for bids in order to award a sub-contract can
                    be a self-serving or oppressive act, save in the most exceptional of situations.
                    As for the decision to nominate Style Line instead of SSH Sawmill, the
                    defendants have provided a commercially justifiable explanation for this which I
                    accept: SSH Sawmill did not have the expertise to carry out bamboo flooring
                    works. The role of the court on a s 216 application is not to judge the
                    commercial merits of business decisions made by a company’s management.
                    With the exception of LKW, who was involved in SSH, the plaintiffs have had
                    little involvement in the business of SSH and Kenson and do not have a
                    legitimate expectation to participate in the management of the business of the
                    companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    For all of these reasons, I reject the
                    plaintiffs’ allegation of unfairness in respect of these two
                    decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the minority oppression claims </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    I have found that none of the acts
                    complained of by the plaintiffs amount to commercial unfairness. There has been
                    no oppression of the plaintiffs, no disregard of their interests as members, no
                    acts which unfairly discriminate against them and no acts which are unfairly
                    prejudicial to them. That remains my view even if I take into account these acts
                    cumulatively and consider LKL’s and LBY’s conduct holistically. The
                    defendants have not acted in such a way that departs from the standards of fair
                    dealing or violates the conditions of fair play which the plaintiffs are
                    entitled to expect, even after I take into account equitable
                    considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    There is therefore no need for me to examine
                    the further defences raised by the defendants (at [92(c)] to [92(f)]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In the circumstances, I have made the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_a"></a>(a)     In respect of S1005, the
                        plaintiffs’ minority oppression claims are
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
                        respect of OS1050, the Kenson board meeting held on 25 October 2012 and
                        the resolutions passed therein were invalid. The notice of that meeting was
                        issued and served irregularly, and this irregularity cannot be cured under s
                        392 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_c"></a>(c)     In respect of OS1042, the EGM of SSH on 25 October 2012
                        and the resolutions passed therein were invalid because the notice of the
                        meeting was defective and Kenson was not properly represented. The
                        consequence is that the board meeting of SSH held on 27 October 2012 is
                        invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_d"></a>(d)     I
                        also grant an injunction against the holding of the EGM of SSH that was
                        originally scheduled to take place on 5 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    As costs should follow the event, I have
                    ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants’ costs of and incidental to
                    the three proceedings before me, such costs to be assessed as a single set of
