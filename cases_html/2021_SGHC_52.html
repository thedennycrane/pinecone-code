The words of the late Johann Kaspar Lavater, uttered more than two centuries ago, were as sombre as they were prescient. This court has witnessed, on occasions aplenty, the unfortunate legal wars waged between the living over the property of the dead. The present case involves precisely that. On its face, it pertains to a simple application for a declaration of trust. The simplicity of the application, however, belies a bitter dispute between eight siblings over their late father’s property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The late Mr Lim Guan Heong (“Mr Lim”) was the owner of a Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat at 2 Jalan Batu #08-69, Singapore 430002 (“the Property”). At the time of his passing on 4 September 2015, Mr Lim held the Property as joint tenants with Ms Lim Sai Ing Peggy, one of his eight children and the respondent in the present case. As such, upon Mr Lim’s passing, title to the Property devolved to the respondent, who remains the sole registered proprietor to this day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Following some back-and-forth by way of text messages and strongly-worded letters, the present application, HC/OS 168/2020 (“the Application”), was filed on 6 February 2020. By way of the Application, Ms Lim Choo Hin, also a daughter of Mr Lim and the applicant in the present case, seeks a declaration that the Property is held on trust by the respondent for the estate of Mr Lim (“the Estate”). The respondent disagrees, and claims that she is the true beneficial owner of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In addition, on 2 October 2020, the respondent filed HC/SUM 4277/2020 (“SUM 4277”), seeking leave to file a reply affidavit. On 21 October 2020, after hearing the parties’ oral submissions, I reserved judgment on the Application and SUM 4277. Having considered the parties’ respective affidavits and submissions, this is my Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The evidence in the Application was adduced by way of the affidavits of Mr Lim’s children; their assertions therein have not been tested in cross-examination. Unsurprisingly, the children offer dissonant accounts of what occurred, and level multiple scathing allegations at one another. Mr Lim, who would have best known of the precise circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the Property and the subsequent transfers of title to his children, was unable to give evidence as he had passed on as at the time of the Application. I set out in this section what is apparent, to me, to be the actual events that took place. In so far as either party has disputed aspects of these facts in its case, I will explain why the version of events set out herein is to be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background facts and acquisition of the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mr Lim was the father of eight children.

Mr Lim also bequeathed his share in the Property to LKY. After Mr Lim passed on, Grant of Probate was obtained on 21 November 2016 in FC/P 4350/2016.

The law in this regard is uncontroversial; the <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">classicus </span>has been regarded as <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated (at 708A):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of a joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contributions…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observations have been accepted locally on numerous occasions: see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Kiat v Mohammad Sarman bin Saidi </span>[2020] SGHC 253 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Estate of Yang Chun (Mrs) née Sun Hui Min, deceased v Yang Chia-Yin</span> [2019] 5 SLR 593 (“<span class="font-italic">Yang Chia-Yin</span>”) at [55]; <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The considerations undergirding the rule in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are important. The court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) stated that the presumption of resulting trust is equity’s response to the lack of intention by the transferor to benefit the transferee: at [38] and [44]. As a consequence, equity regards each party as holding a beneficial interest in the property equivalent to their respective financial contributions to the same <span class="font-italic">at the time the property was acquired</span>: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [53]. This stands to reason as a matter of principle: a <span class="font-italic">bona fide purchaser for value</span> is regarded as equity’s darling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The presumption of resulting trust, and the beneficial interest that accompanies it, can be displaced in several ways, namely, (a) by evidence of the transferor’s intention to make a gift to the transferee (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(d)]); (b) due to the operation of the presumption of advancement (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(e)]); or (c) by evidence of a common intention of the parties, either at or subsequent to the acquisition, to hold the beneficial interest in a proportion other than that which corresponds with the parties’ respective financial contributions (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(b)] and [160(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Having considered the parties’ submissions and the documentary evidence available, it is apparent to me that Mr Lim bestowed <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a gift</span> to the respondent when he added her name to the property register. The documentary evidence, in particular the title deed to the Property, makes this clear. The parties’ arguments on the presumption of resulting trust, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, are inapplicable, given the way events unfolded. For clarity, I address the relevant events in chronological order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I begin with the events of 1976. The key question is <span class="font-italic">who paid the purchase price</span> for the Property. It is the financial contributions of the parties that equity responds to; a purchaser for value is <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> regarded as a beneficial owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The evidence, in my view, quite clearly points to the conclusion that it was Mr Lim alone who paid the purchase price of the Property.

Nor has she provided any documentary evidence to this effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I find that the respondent has not proved on a balance of probabilities that she made any financial contribution towards the purchase price of the Property. First, as noted, there is a dearth of evidence to this effect. Second, the evidence of the other siblings is unanimous and unequivocal. Third, there is also some documentary evidence that Mr Lim, and Mr Lim alone, made the relevant payments.

</div>
</div> These three points, in my view, dispose of the issue. Accordingly, as at the time of purchase, the legal and beneficial interest in the Property was held by Mr Lim alone; they were never bifurcated, as there was no other legal owner of the Property up until 1981. There was therefore no trust to speak of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I then turn to the events of 1981. The issue of beneficial interest turns on one pivotal question: what was the legal (and equitable) significance of Mr Lim adding the respondent’s name to the property register in 1981? This issue is resolved by a critical document: the title deed of the Property, which indicates the nature of the relevant transfers made (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1981 transfer, the 2001 transfer and the 2014 transfer).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The title deed indicates, by way of a stamp by the Registrar of Titles, that the Property was transferred to the respondent <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by gift</span>, as joint tenants with Mr Lim. The stamp states “TRANSFER TO LIM SAI ING <span class="font-underline">(BY GIFT)</span> AND LIM GUAN HEONG AS JOINT TENANTS OF THE WITHIN LEASEHOLD ESTATE (WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LESSOR)” [emphasis in original].

</div> The words “BY GIFT” were in fact written into the stamp, and the stamp was duly endorsed by the Registrar of Titles. The parties have not challenged the authenticity and/or accuracy of the relevant documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The effect of the transfer instrument was therefore this: by way of the 1981 transfer, Mr Lim conferred his beneficial interest in the Property to the respondent and himself as joint tenants. They held the beneficial interest in the Property, from that point on, in equal and undivided shares. While the respondent did not pay Mr Lim consideration in 1981 when her name was added to the property register, this is immaterial. A gift suffices to confer the beneficial interest in a property to the recipient of such gift; it is for this reason that the courts have recognised an unequivocal gift as a valid means of displacing the presumption of resulting trust (see [30] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Subsequently, by way of the 2001 transfer, the Property was bestowed to Mr Lim, the applicant and the respondent as joint tenants, <span class="font-italic">also</span> by way of gift.

</div> This is reflected on the stamp by the Registrar of Titles. Then, in 2014, the Property was transferred to Mr Lim and the respondent, <span class="font-italic">again</span> by way of gift. This, likewise, is reflected on the stamp by the Registrar of Titles.

</div> Thus, as at 2014, the respondent was a joint tenant of the Property, and held the legal and beneficial interest in the Property in equal and undivided shares with Mr Lim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 There is admittedly some uncertainty as to Mr Lim’s subjective state of mind when the relevant transfers were effected. It is for this reason that the applicant has made arguments on <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> Mr Lim being unaware of the significance of the formal transfers of title to the Property, and him being unconcerned with issues of inheritance and how the Property would devolve upon his passing. These are, however, irrelevant. The documentary evidence, which can tell no lies, is unequivocal. In the face of clear transfers effected <span class="font-italic">by way of gift</span>, as <span class="font-italic">per </span>the title deed (see [37]–[39] above), it would be inappropriate for the court to attempt to divine some other intention on Mr Lim’s part in an attempt to rebut the ordinary meaning of the documents. Even then, the applicant’s arguments assume that Mr Lim’s subjective state of mind <span class="font-italic">would</span><span class="font-italic"> be sufficient</span> to contradict the title deed and properly executed transfer instruments; I express serious doubts in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Being the surviving joint tenant upon Mr Lim’s passing on 4 September 2015, the entirety of the interest in the Property, legal and beneficial, devolved to the respondent by operation of the rule of survivorship. This, likewise, is accurately reflected on the title deed to the Property, via a stamp by the Registrar of Titles in 2017 (upon the lodgement of the Notice of Death).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is thus clear to me that there is no need to engage in any analysis involving the presumption of resulting trust and/or whether it was displaced. There was never a trust over the Property. By virtue of the right of survivorship, the entirety of the beneficial interest in the Property vested in the respondent upon Mr Lim’s passing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As for Mr Lim’s intended bequeathing of his “share” of the Property to LKY in the Will, it suffices for me to note that I do not see how this can displace the rule of survivorship and its operation in the context of a joint tenancy such as the one at present. I say no more on this issue, given that I have not been asked, in these proceedings, to pronounce on the validity of the Will and its contents – the relief sought, as noted, pertains only to a declaration of trust over the Property. Given my findings above, I am unable to grant the applicant such a declaration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remaining issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Based on the foregoing, the issues concerning the presumption of advancement and the HDA are self-evidently moot. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 4277</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With my decision as indicated above, there is no need for any further evidence to be introduced by way of affidavit.

Unless parties wish to be heard on costs, I order as follows: (a) costs of the Application are to be paid to the respondent by the applicant, to be taxed if not agreed; and (b) parties are to bear their own costs for SUM 4277. If parties wish to be heard on costs, they are to inform the court within seven days of the date of this Judgment, and file written submissions on costs limited to five pages each within 14 days of this Judgment. The court will then inform parties of a suitable date for the hearing on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In closing, I strongly urge parties to reach an amicable settlement over the outstanding issues relating to the Estate. It will benefit all involved to avoid a bitter, protracted and costly litigation. I dare venture to suggest, even, that the late Mr Lim would not have wished to see his children cavil with such vitriol.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Kwee Sain Pauline (P Tan &amp; Co) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Cheng Hock Lawrence (Matthew Chiong Partnership) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
