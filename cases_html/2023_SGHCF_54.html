Crucially, in relation to the Matrimonial Flat, which is the subject of the present appeal, the DJ noted that while the transmission of the Matrimonial Flat wholly to the Husband by way of survivorship occurred two years after the date of IJ, the Matrimonial Flat remained the same asset and 100% of its value ought to be added into the pool of matrimonial assets.

Indeed, matrimonial homes are subject to the court’s power of division upon the dissolution of marriage, even if they were acquired before the marriage: <span class="font-italic">UJF v UJG</span> [2019] 3 SLR 178 at [79]. The Matrimonial Flat was a matrimonial home. The Husband does not dispute that he and the Wife resided in the Matrimonial Flat since 1989, with the wife leaving the flat only in 2018.

In making these points, the Husband appears to be going <span class="font-italic">one step further</span> to argue that the Agreement, having contractual force between the parties, <span class="font-italic">requires</span> this Court to give effect to it. Stated in this manner, it became plain to me that the validity of the Husband’s points hinges on an affirmative answer to this question: “In exercising its powers to divide matrimonial assets, is this Court bound by the Agreement entered into between parties as to the proper division of their matrimonial assets?” In my view, the answer must be “no”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Section 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the WC provides that the court must consider “any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce” in deciding what are the just and equitable proportions of their division between the spouses. To my mind, there was little doubt that parties had come to an agreement falling within the meaning of s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the WC, as it was an agreement entered into for the purpose of dividing the assets in the context of a specifically contemplated divorce: see <span class="font-italic">Lian </span><span class="font-italic">Hwee Choo Phebe v Tan Seng Ong</span> [2013] 3 SLR 1162 at [21(a)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, parties’ agreement is but <span class="font-italic">one</span> factor in the overall assessment. It remains critical for the court to consider all the circumstances of the case when determining the proper weight to be given to such an agreement: see <span class="font-italic">UKA v UKB</span> [2018] 4 SLR 779 at [24]; <span class="font-italic">TQ v TR and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 at [75] and [77]. After all, the court’s power to divide matrimonial assets originates not from the parties’ agreement, but from statute, in particular, s 112(1) of the WC. The authors of <span class="font-italic">Halsbury's Laws of Singapore</span> vol 11 (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) at para 130.830 states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While there is no doubt that an agreement between the spouses with regard to the division of property is valid and one made in contemplation of divorce may even be encouraged given that the Family Court seeks the harmonious resolution of disputes between spouses, this is just one factor towards the just and equitable proportions of division of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 From the above, the overarching inquiry, therefore, is whether the DJ’s decision to include 100% of the Matrimonial Flat into the matrimonial pool was “just and equitable” as stipulated by s 112(1) of the WC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In both his written and oral submissions, counsel for the Husband sought to impress upon me the relevance of the Court of Appeal’s holding in T<span class="font-italic">ND v TNC and another appeal </span>[2017] SGCA 34 (“<span class="font-italic">TND</span>”) at [24] that “[w]here, with the benefit of legal advice, the parties agree on a particular date as the date of valuation of the matrimonial assets, a judge should generally adopt that agreed date unless there is good reason not to do so.” Counsel for the Husband reasoned that if parties’ agreement as to a particular date of valuation should generally be adopted, then logically, the parties’ Agreement on the inclusion of the notional amount of 50% of the Matrimonial Flat to the matrimonial asset pool ought also to be adopted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I did not consider <span class="font-italic">TND</span> to be helpful. In the first place, <span class="font-italic">TND</span> has no direct application in the present case because the parties did not, in fact, reach any agreement on the date of valuation of matrimonial assets. Counsel’s extension of the holding in <span class="font-italic">TND</span> so that an agreement as to the identification of a matrimonial asset ought generally to be adopted by this Court does not advance the Husband’s case much. While I accept that an agreement can feature significantly in the Court’s assessment of the proper division of matrimonial assets, it must be borne in mind that this is only where such an agreement amounts to a comprehensive financial arrangement. <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 130.830 states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It bears noting first than an agreement is of significance only where it conforms to at least two characteristics; that is it intended as a <span class="font-italic">comprehensive financial arrangement so that there are no longer any residual financial matters and of the division of matrimonial assets</span><span class="font-italic">, it achieves a “just and equitable” division of the spouses’ matrimonial assets</span>. Where the agreement is of such character, the courts have demonstrated that they have the option of either dismissing the application to leave the parties to their agreement or alternatively the court can incorporate the terms of the agreement into a consent order of division of matrimonial assets. ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Agreement can in no way be said to be a “comprehensive financial arrangement” as to the issue of the division of matrimonial assets. Indeed, as counsel for the Wife pointed out at the hearing, even on the Husband’s own case, the Agreement of 50% had been arrived at merely to represent the Husband’s “<span class="font-italic">notional</span>” share in the Matrimonial Flat. This was necessary for the purpose of allowing the division of matrimonial assets to proceed in the face of an impasse arising from the fact that the Husband’s mother had an interest in the Matrimonial Flat as a joint tenant. This is the true nature and purpose of the Agreement which I found to be critical in my decision to reject the Husband’s submission that this Court should uphold the Agreement. In other words, I considered that the background as to how the parties had entered into the Agreement meant that it was just and equitable in the circumstances not to confine the division of the Matrimonial Flat to only the 50% provided under the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It is perhaps appropriate for me at this juncture to set out the background to the Agreement. This background was undisputed by the parties.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Appellant’s Case at paras 16–20.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As early as 8 December 2020, counsel for the parties had been specifically directed to commence a separate legal action in the General Division of the High Court to resolve the Husband’s mother’s share in the Matrimonial Flat. However, the parties attempted to resolve the matter through mediation without recourse to a separate legal action. Parties could not reach a resolution at mediation. That being the case, at the Status Conference on 24 November 2021, parties were again directed to resort to separate legal action. To move the case forward, the Family Court requested counsel to take instructions from the parties on their position on the Husband’s mother’s share of the Matrimonial Flat. Pursuant to this, parties agreed that a 50% share should be “notionally” included in the matrimonial asset pool for division. Having entered into the Agreement, parties no longer needed to take up separate legal action to determine the Husband’s mother’s share in the Matrimonial Flat, allowing the Family Court to give directions for parties to proceed with filing their affidavits of assets and means in support of their respective claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 From the background above, it must be emphasised that the Agreement was merely entered into for the sake of representing the Husband’s “notional” share in the Matrimonial Flat for the purpose of facilitating the division of matrimonial assets. It would have come as a surprise to the Wife that in entering into the Agreement she had thereby waived her rights under s 112(10) of the WC to lay claim to her proper share of the Matrimonial Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I am fortified in my conclusion by the point made by counsel for the Husband at the hearing that the Agreement was not conditioned on the mortality of the mother. Parties had simply not directed their minds to what would happen to the Husband’s entitlement to the Matrimonial Flat should the Husband’s mother pass away after the Agreement was entered into. This was not a term of the Agreement. To therefore visit upon the Wife the consequence that she is entitled to share in only 50% of the Matrimonial Flat notwithstanding the fact that the Husband had since become entitled to 100% of the property by way of survivorship would, in my view, not be just and equitable. Furthermore, the alternative of including 50% of the Matrimonial Flat would not have resulted in a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. I illustrate this by way of a comparison between two scenarios as to how the matrimonial assets would be divided where the proportion of the Matrimonial Flat to be included was 100% and 50% respectively. I shall call these scenarios the “First” and “Second Scenario”, respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Dealing with the First Scenario, the DJ’s decision to include 100% of the Matrimonial Flat into the matrimonial pool had achieved a final division where the Husband was entitled to $346,425.66 and the Wife, $391,278.04, out of the total asset pool of $737,703.71. As the DJ noted, this result reflected closely the total value of the assets that each party possessed in their own names. The DJ accordingly directed that both parties retain the assets held in their own names, with the Husband retaining all rights and interests in the Matrimonial Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Moving on to the Second Scenario, where we assume that only 50% of the Matrimonial Flat is to be included in the matrimonial pool. Under this scenario, as can be seen from the calculations in the table below, the Husband’s direct contributions would be $188,250.31. The Wife’s direct contributions would stand at $396,953.40. </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Bank accounts</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$3.27</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$32,200.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">CPF accounts</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$35,747.04</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$364,753.40</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Husband’s flat</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$152,500.00</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">(Instead of $305,000.00 which represents 100% of the Matrimonial Flat)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">-</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Total direct contributions (=$585,203.71) (100%)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$188,250.31</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">(32.2%)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$396,953.40</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">(67.8%)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Based on these figures and assuming for present purposes that the weightage between direct and indirect contributions remains at 80:20 as determined by the DJ, the Husband would retain all his assets while the Wife would be required under the Second Scenario to transfer a sum of $21,018.53 to the Husband. This can be seen from the calculations in the following table:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct Contributions</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(32.2/100) x 0.8 = 25.76%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(67.8/100) x 0.8 = 54.24%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect Contributions</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(50/100) x 0.2 = 10%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(50/100) x 0.2 = 10%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Result</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">25.76% + 10% = 35.76%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">54.24% + 10% = 64.24%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Share of the total asset pool</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">($585,203.71)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">35.76% x $585,203.71=</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$209,268.847</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">64.24% x $585,203.71=</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$375,934.863</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Parties’ net entitlement after deducting assets in their sole name</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$209,268.847 - $188,250.31 = </div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">$ 21,018.53</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$375,934.863 – </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$396,953.40 = </div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">$-21,018.53</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The outcome under Second Scenario would become even worse for the Wife if the weightage of 80:20 between the parties’ indirect and direct contributions were to be changed to 50:50 as advanced by the Husband in this appeal. For reasons I will explain in greater detail below at [44]–[47], I settled on a ratio of 2:1 as a more appropriate weightage of the parties’ respective direct and indirect contributions. Applying this ratio of 2:1, the inequity which would befall the Wife under the Second Scenario is still evident. As can be seen from the table of calculations below, under the Second Scenario, the Wife would then be expected to pay $34,907.37 to the Husband. With her bank account balance standing at $32,200, this would deprive the Wife of her entire savings. On the other hand, the Husband would get to retain all his assets (including the Matrimonial Flat) and receive an additional $34,907.37 to boot. There was no doubt in my mind that the First Scenario results in a more just and equitable outcome for both parties. This was the way the DJ had approached the division of the Matrimonial Flat, and I did not find that he was wrong in doing so.</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct Contributions</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(32.2/100) x (2/3) = 21.47%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(67.8/100) x (2/3) = 45.2%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect Contributions</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(50/100) x (1/3) = </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">16.67%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(50/100) x (1/3) =</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">16.67%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Result</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">21.47% + 16.67% = 38.13%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">45.2% + 16.67% = 61.87%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Share of the total asset pool</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">($585,203.71)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">38.14% x $585,203.71=</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$223,157.68</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">61.87% x $585,203.71=</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$362,046.03</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Parties’ net entitlement after deducting assets in their sole name</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$223,157.68 – </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$188,250.31 =</div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">$ 34,907.37</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$362,046.03 - </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$396,953.40 = </div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">-$34,907.37</span></div><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Addressing the Husband’s Point (d) more specifically, I found no fault with the DJ’s reasoning that the Matrimonial Flat had <span class="font-italic">already</span> been earmarked for inclusion in the pool of matrimonial assets as of the date of IJ on 9 September 2020.

</div> In other words, the Husband’s interest as a <span class="font-italic">joint tenant</span> of the Matrimonial Flat had been identified for inclusion in the matrimonial pool. The hallmark of a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship: <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching</span> [2018] 4 SLR 208 at [20]. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Shafeeg bin Salim Talib and another v Fatimah bte Abud bin Talib and others </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1123<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39] and [40], each of the two joint tenants possesses a <span class="font-italic">concurrent</span> interest in the whole such that on the death of one of the joint tenants, the sole interest in the whole <span class="font-italic">remains</span> to the survivor; it is not the case that the deceased joint tenant’s interest <span class="font-italic">passes</span> to the survivor. The fact that the Husband’s mother had passed away only after the date of IJ did not change the conclusion that the Husband’s joint interest (and his interest as sole owner of the Matrimonial Flat upon his mother’s death) had already been earmarked for inclusion in the matrimonial pool as of the date of IJ. The enjoyment of this right of a joint tenant to the right by survivorship is of course subject to there being no issue of severance arising in respect of the property (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching</span> [2018] 2 SLR 84 at [18]) or other disputes between the joint tenants as to their respective shares in the property. However, no such issue of severance or other disputes had been raised between the Husband and his mother. In these circumstances, I saw no reason to disturb the DJ’s decision to include 100% of the Matrimonial Flat in the matrimonial pool.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the DJ erred in his assessment of the proper weight to be given to the direct and indirect contributions of the parties to the marriage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Notwithstanding the long marriage in this present case, the DJ appeared to have considered it critical that there was a long period of separation between the parties (“26 years out of 31 years of their marriage”) and that they had only contributed to the family in matters related to the child.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 On appeal, counsel for the Husband submitted that the DJ erred in applying an 80:20 weightage in favour of direct contributions against indirect contributions instead of assigning equal weight to both. Counsel for the Husband stressed that while the parties had separated in 1994, they continued to reside in the Matrimonial Flat until the Wife left in 2018. Furthermore, parties both contributed to the upbringing of their daughter, [B] throughout this period. [B] had turned 21 in 2014 before the Wife left the Matrimonial Home. These must be considered in calibrating the weightage between the direct and indirect contributions of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I agreed with counsel for the Husband that the longer the marriage, the greater the indirect contributions tend to feature. Indeed, this was one important factor stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 at [27] in determining the appropriate weight of the parties’ direct contributions as against their indirect contributions. It appeared that the DJ had given short shrift to the Husband’s argument in favour of equal weightage. Due regard must be given to the parties’ contribution to [B]’s care. Based on [B]’s affidavit, it was clear that both the Husband and the Wife had contributed to [B]’s care and upbringing. I note in passing that while [B]’s evidence appeared to suggest that the Wife had been less involved in the care of [B] than the Husband,

</div> Therefore, the question of whether the DJ had rightly determined the parties’ indirect contributions did not arise in this appeal. The question here was only whether the DJ had erred in applying an 80:20 weightage in favour of direct contributions against indirect contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As counsel for the Husband accepted in both his written submissions

</div> and in the hearing before me, the court’s power to divide matrimonial assets is to be exercised in broad strokes with regard to what is just and equitable in the circumstances. From the points considered above, it appeared that the DJ assigned too little weightage to indirect contributions. Put another way, it cannot be said that the weight given to direct contributions ought to be <span class="font-italic">four</span> times that given to the parties’ indirect contributions. It was, after all, a relatively long marriage, notwithstanding the parties’ early separation. Furthermore, the parties’ indirect contribution to the care of [B] for a lengthy period of 20 years was undoubtedly substantial. However, I did not agree with counsel for the Husband that a 50:50 weightage was therefore appropriate. I was of the view that a ratio of 2:1 in favour of direct contributions was more appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This meant that the parties’ entitlements to the matrimonial assets were to be varied as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct Contributions</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(46.2/100) x 2/3 = 30.8%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(53.8/100) x 2/3 = 35.87%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect Contributions</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(50/100) x 1/3 = 16.66%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(50/100) x 1/3 = 16.66%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Result</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">30.8% + 16.67% = 47.46%</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">35.87% + 16.67% = 52.54%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Share of the total asset pool</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">($737,703.71)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">47.46% x $737,703.71 =</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$350,114.18</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">52.54% x $737,703.71 =</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">$387,589.53</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Parties’ net entitlement after deducting assets in their sole name</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$350,114.18 -$340,750.31 = </div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">$9,363.87</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">$387,589.53 - $396,953.40 = </div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">-9,363.87</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Therefore, the Wife needed to pay $9,363.87 to the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the reasons above, I dismissed the Husband’s appeal against 100% of the value of the Matrimonial Flat being included in the pool of matrimonial assets but allowed the appeal partially on the issue of the proper weightage of the direct and indirect contributions of the parties.
