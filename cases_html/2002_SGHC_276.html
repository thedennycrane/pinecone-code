<p xmlns="">  quantity of high speed diesel. Judgment was thus entered in JY’s favour. The only

  remaining issues left to be resolved were JY’s claim for losses suffered under their

  sub-contracts with third parties in the DPRK and SST’s claim in relation to a

  set-off. JY opted to claim only the loss under their sub-contract with Sasan Farm

  ("Sasan"). </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p>Held, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claim for consequential losses and dismissing the

first defendants’ claim for set-off:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></b><p align="justify" xmlns="">JY’s claim for consequential losses in relation to their

  contract with Sasan did not rest on solid ground. It was not established that JY made

  known the special circumstances of their contract with Sasan to SST. It was not

  established that SST were aware of JY’s sub-contract with Sasan or of the terms of

  that sub-contract. If all the cases on remoteness of damages were taken into account,

  there could be no doubt that JY’s loss under their sub-contract with Sasan was too

  remote a consequence of SST’s breach of contract (See [11] – [19]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In any case, what actually transpired in the investigations in relation

  to Sasan’s claim against JY was not known. The DPRK Central Public Prosecutor’s

  Authority furnished no grounds for requiring JY to compensate Sasan. Although a

  representative from Sasan filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and was listed as a

  witness, JY chose to close their case without calling him as a witness. As such,

  SST’s counsel was denied the opportunity to question him. After having taken into

  account all the circumstances of the case and the evidence of the witnesses, the court had

  no hesitation whatsoever in dismissing JY’s claim for consequential losses (See

  [19]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">SST was in fact alleging that JY was guilty of fraud and that the DPRK

  Central Prosecutors’ Authority was colluding with JY to defraud them. Apart from the

  fact that fraud was not pleaded by SST, the officer in the Central Public

  Prosecutors’ Authority who took charge of the investigation regarding Danny ‘s

  breach of the DPRK’s laws testified that the "apology money" had been paid

  into JY’s account because the company had the requisite foreign exchange account and

  had prior dealings with SST. He also confirmed that JY had transferred the sum in question

  to the relevant government authority. In <i>Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A M Luther v James

  Sagor &amp; Co</i> [1921] All ER 138, 146, Warrington LJ said: "It is well settled

  that the validity of the acts of an independent sovereign government in relation to

  property and persons within its jurisdiction cannot be questioned in the courts of this

  country." It was for SST to prove their assertion that they were entitled to a

  set-off with respect to the "apology money." As they failed to do so, the said

  sum could not be deducted from the damages payable to JY for their breach of contract (See

  [24]-[25]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">SST accepted that JY were entitled to damages for breach of contract if

  they had no right to set-off the "apology money." JY were entitled to costs as

  far as this claim was concerned (See [26]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Different considerations arose with respect to the costs in relation to

  JY’s claim for consequential losses and SST’s alleged set-off. After taking all

  the circumstances into account, the court ordered that with respect to JY’s claim for

  consequential losses under their sub-contracts and SST’s claim regarding a set-off,

  the parties would bear their own costs (See [27]).</p>

        The plaintiffs, Korea Jonmyong Trading Co

("JY), a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ("DPRK") company,

claimed damages from the first defendants, Sea-Shore Transportation Pte Ltd

("SST"), and the second defendant, Mr Sharafdeen s/o Abdul Rasak

("Deen"), a director of SST, with respect to breach of a contract for the supply

of around 3,000 metric tonnes of Indonesian high speed diesel. JY also alleged that the

defendants were guilty of fraud. </font>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></p></i></u> 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        On 15 February 2001, JY agreed to purchase

"3,000 metric tonnes +/- 5%" of high speed diesel of Indonesian origin from SST

at USD215 per metric tonne. The contract provided for the cargo to be shipped to JY in

February 2001 and Nampo was nominated as the port of discharge. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        SST entrusted the task of procuring the

Indonesian high speed diesel to one Mr Danny Moorthy ("Danny"), who did not

succeed in obtaining the required quantity of cargo. Only 400 metric tonnes of high speed

diesel were loaded at Surabaya while slightly more than 900 metric tonnes of the said oil

were loaded at Pulau Kambing. The vessel that carried the cargo to DPRK, namely <i>MT

Princess Sarah, </i>had her share of problems. Time was lost as she had to be repaired

before she sailed from Indonesia. She then deviated to the Philippines and she finally

reached Nampo, the port of discharge, on 17<sup>th</sup> June 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        JY did not expect their cargo to arrive as late

as 17<sup>th</sup> June 2001. They also did not know that <i>MT Princess Sarah </i>did not

have the agreed quantity of high speed diesel on board because SST had furnished them with

bills of lading which showed that more than 3,000 metric tonnes of the cargo had been

shipped. Apart from being shocked at the shortfall of cargo, they alleged that the limited

quantity of high speed diesel oil that was delivered to them at Nampo was not of the same

quality as that specified in their contract with SST.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        SST asserted that the problem of a shortfall in

the cargo delivered at Nampo could have been minimised had Danny, who was on board the <i>MT

Princess Sarah, </i>been allowed to return to Indonesia to load more high speed diesel.

However, Danny could not leave the DPRK as he was accused by the North Koreans of having

committed a number of offences. Among other things, he was accused of having firearms and

satellite phones in his possession without declaring them to the authorities. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        According to JY, Danny, who faced a long term

of imprisonment if he was convicted of the offences in question, offered the DPRK Central

Public Prosecutors’ Authority the sum of USD230,000 as "apology money" if

he was allowed to leave DPRK. SST’s Deen was made aware of Danny’s problems with

the DPRK authorities by Kosa, their agent in Nampo, and by Mr Kwon Chang Hyok

("Kwon"), JY’s manager. Danny also spoke to Deen about his predicament. In

due course, Deen arranged for a total of USD230,000 to be transferred to JY in late 2001

and early 2002 to secure Danny’s release. JY asserted that after they received the

USD230,000, they transferred the "apology money" to the relevant government

authority. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        Subsequently, JY claimed from SST damages in

relation to, inter alia, their loss of profits and sums which they paid to third parties,

to whom they sold the high speed diesel that SST failed to deliver. They asserted that the

total loss to date amounted to USD1,515,494.50. When SST failed to pay the amount claimed,

JY commenced the present action. SST denied liability to JY and added that if they are

liable in damages to JY, the USD230,000 paid by them to secure Danny’s release must

be taken into account as it was in fact a partial refund of the money which JY paid to

them for the high speed diesel oil ordered in February 2001. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Claim against second defendant

withdrawn</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        During the trial, JY withdrew their claim

against Deen on terms which were recorded in a consent order dated 10 October 2002. As

such, this judgment will only concern JY’s action against SST.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SST admits breaching the contract</font></p></i></u><b xmlns="">
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        SST admitted at the trial that they breached

their contract with JY by failing to deliver the agreed quantity of high speed diesel. It

was then agreed that if the claim for consequential losses under JY’s sub-contracts

with third parties and SST’s alleged set-off of USD230,000 are not taken into

account, SST would pay JY USD600,200 as damages for breach of contract. Judgment was thus

entered in JY’s favour for this amount. Interest at the rate of 6% per annum is

payable with respect to this judgment sum as from the date of the writ.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        As a result of the narrowing of differences

between JY and SST, the only remaining issues left to be resolved were JY’s claim for

losses suffered under their sub-contracts with third parties in the DPRK and SST’s

claim in relation to a set-off. These will be considered below.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">JY’s claim for losses under

their sub-contracts with third parties</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        Although JY initially asserted that they

suffered losses under a number of sub-contracts with third parties in the DPRK, they opted

to claim only the loss under their sub-contract with Sasan Farm ("Sasan"), a

large rice farm in the Pyongyang area. JY’s case is that they breached a contract to

deliver 1,000 metric tonnes of high speed diesel to Sasan because of SST’s failure to

deliver the agreed amount of high speed diesel to them. Sasan complained to the DPRK

Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority, claiming that JY owed them USD1,290,800 for

the cost of additional manpower and USD1,507,840 for a shortfall in rice production. The

Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority ordered JY to pay USD620,000 to Sasan. JY

sought to recover this sum as well as legal expenses incurred in relation to Sasan’s

claim from SST. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        SST asserted that this claim by JY is invalid

because of the rule on remoteness of damage, which was summed up by Alderson B in <i>Hadley

v Baxendale</i> (1854) 9 Exch 341, 354-55 in the following oft-cited words:</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></i><p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Where two parties have made a

    contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive

    in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be

    considered as either arising naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things, from

    such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the

    contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result

    of the breach of it. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        JY’s claim for consequential losses in

relation to their contract with Sasan does not rest on solid ground. For a start, it was

not established that JY made known the special circumstances of their contract with Sasan

to SST. Admittedly, JY’s manager, Kwon, initially claimed that SST’s Deen knew

about JY’s sub-contract with Sasan Farm. In paragraph 28 of his affidavit of

evidence-in-chief, he stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">During the extensive discussions

    between the Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant prior to the execution of the

    Contract, namely between 15 January 2001 to 16 February 2001, Jon and I had long and

    detailed discussions with Deen on various issues and topics relating to the role of the

    Plaintiff in DPRK and its customers including :- </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) details of the

    including … [Sasan]</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        However, Kwon’s position shifted when he

was cross-examined. He said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Did you tell the defendant you

    had a sub-contract?</font></p>

    contracts, one of which was Sasan. I <u><i>told him in general </i></u>and <i>sometimes I

    put in the name of Sasan</i> as one of my sub-purchasers.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. You did not tell him every

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. I said I have a contract with

    Sasan. I did not mention Sasan every time. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        In contrast, Deen steadfastly maintained that

he was unaware of JY’s sub-contract with Sasan and the ramifications of this

sub-contract. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Did the plaintiffs discuss who

    their customers were?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Never.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Did you try to find out more

    about the sub-sale of oil in North Korea?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. The only thing they said was

    market and who controls the prices?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. No. ….</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        Mr Ameer Sadique Mohamed Zaheer, a former sales

executive of SST, who said that he was present during most of Deen’s meetings with

the North Koreans, also knew nothing about JY’s sub-contract with Sasan. He impressed

me as a truthful witness. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Did you recall conversations

    about JY’s sub-sale to a farm?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. No.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. During the extensive

    discussions, did you hear any talk about a sale of oil to a farm?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. No.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Was there any discussion on

    market conditions and the plaintiffs’ duties?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. In the meetings I attended,

    none of these was discussed. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        I hold that it was not established that SST

were aware of JY’s sub-contract with Sasan or of the terms of that sub-contract. The

effect of a party not knowing the special circumstances surrounding the other contracting

party’s sub-contract with third parties must be viewed in the light of <i>Hadley v

Baxendale, </i>where Alderson B said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now, if the special circumstances

    under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the

    defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such

    a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which

    would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so

    known and communicated. On the other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly

    unknown to the party breaking the contract he, at the most, could only be supposed to have

    had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and in the

    great multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of

    contract.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        The principles laid down in <i>Hadley v

Baxendale </i>have been restated in subsequent cases, including <i>Victoria Laundry

(Windsor) Ltd. v Newman Industries Ltd </i>[1949] 2 KB 528 and <i>Koufos v C Czarnikow </i>[1969] 1 AC 350, where the House of Lords did not agree on a single reformulation of the rule on

remoteness of damage<i>. </i>The combined effect of all the cases on remoteness of damage

was summed up in <i>Chitty on Contracts, </i>28<sup>th</sup> ed, p 1291, in the following

terms:</font><i></i></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A type or kind of loss is not

    too remote a consequence of a breach of contract if, at the time of contracting (and on

    the assumption that the parties actually foresaw the breach in question), it was within

    their reasonable contemplation as a not unlikely result of that breach.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        If all the cases on remoteness of damage are

taken into account, there can be no doubt that JY’s loss under their sub-contract

with Sasan is too remote a consequence of SST’s breach of the contract to supply JY

with 3,000 metric tonnes of Indonesian high speed diesel. In any case, what actually

transpired in the investigations in relation to Sasan’s claim against JY is not

known. The DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority furnished no grounds for

requiring JY to compensate Sasan USD620,000. Although a representative from Sasan, Mr Nam

Jong Ok, filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and was listed as a witness in the

present action against SST, JY chose to close their case without calling him as a witness.

As such, SST’s counsel was denied the opportunity to question Mr Nam, whose answers

could have shed more light on the ramifications of Sasan’s petition to the Central

Public Prosecutors’ Authority. After having taken into account all the circumstances

of the case and the evidence of the witnesses, I have no hesitation whatsoever in

dismissing JY’s claim for consequential losses under their sub-contract with Sasan.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SST’s claim regarding a set-off</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        I now turn to SST’s assertion that they

are entitled to set-off USD230,000 from the amount payable by them to JY for breach of

contract. As has been mentioned earlier on, Deen arranged for the transfer of USD230,000

to JY in late 2001 and early 2002 to secure the release of Danny, who was then being

investigated by the DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority. SST contended that

this sum was actually a partial refund by them of the money paid by JY for the high speed

diesel and that it should be taken into account for the purpose of computing the damages

payable. JY disagreed and asserted that the question of a set-off of the USD230,000 does

not arise because this sum was Danny’s "apology money" with respect to the

criminal charges faced by him. JY referred to Order No 572 of the DPRK Central Public

Prosecutors’ Authority dated 12 November 2001, which is the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Central Public

    Prosecutors’ Authority of DPRK have investigated into the matters concerning [Danny],

    the Captain of MT "Princess Sarah" which called at Nampo Port on 17<sup>th</sup>

    June 2001, … and discovered and confirms the following criminal and illegal behaviour

    committed by [Danny] and his crew.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">-    Captain has

    organised illegal international voyage by being involved in chartering a vessel without

    Nationality Certificate …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">-    Captain did not declare

    weapons, ammunition and satellite phones and concealed 3 pistols, ammunition, knives and 2

    sets of satellite phones.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">-    Captain used

    satellite phones from time to time and without permission even shot 1 bullet in the Nampo

    Port area, thus violating the safety of the country and being afraid of his crime, he

    threw away 1 pistol into the sea</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">-    Captain and

    his crew violated public order in the Nampo area sea bathing resorts, insulting ladies and

    gentlemen there and destroying some of the resort facilities, thus several protests were

    made from several diplomats and the local people.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All the above criminal and

    illegal behaviour have been clearly proved by … scientific and objective evidence.

    Therefore, the Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority informed [Danny] that he would

    be charged for minimum 10 years’ imprisonment under … Article 116 of the

    Criminal Law of the Republic.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[Danny] confessed and recognised

    his crimes and the correctness of the law of the Republic but suggested that as he eagerly

    wished to return to his family in Singapore, he wished a compound in which he would pay

    USD230,000.00 for his apology and not … be prosecuted.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… [T]he Central Public

    Prosecutors’ Authority decided to accept his apology amount … and … orders

    as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1. [Danny] to arrange remittance

    of transfer of apology amount of USD230,000.00 to the Credit Bank of Korea, Pyongyang in

    favour of [JY] not later than end of December 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. [JY] to arrange transfer of

    this amount immediately upon credit to the national treasury account with the Foreign

    Trade Bank of DPRK.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        Danny, who denied that he had committed many of

the offences referred to in the Order of the DPRK Central Prosecutors’ Authority,

admitted that he had breached the DPRK’s laws in relation to possession of firearms

and satellite phones. Deen accepted that he had been informed about Danny’s

predicament by SST’s Korean agent, Kosa, and that he had been urged to help secure

Danny’s release. Contemporaneous documents with respect to the transfer of the

USD230,000 from Deen’s account indicate that the money was paid to secure

Danny’s release. On 24 December 2001, Danny’s wife, Jenny, wrote to JY as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please be informed that I am

    trying my best to look for financial help for my husband (Capt. Danny Moorthy) and will be

    able to remit the balance money to you by end December 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please bear with me during this 1

    week period and arrange to send my husband back to Singapore once you receive my

    remittance.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        On 21 January 2002, Deen wrote to JY’s

Kwon as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Captain’s wife came to

    our office this morning crying and desperately seeking our help in releasing her husband

    from your custody. She says that so far she had borrowed the money from your relatives and

    friends to arrange for the US$200,000/- and now she needs to settle this amount by Chinese

    New Year. (14/02/2002). She says it would be better for her husband to be released earlier

    (before Chinese New Year) so that he can help her in settling the debts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Though the original amount asked

    by you was US$200,000/- and now you are asking for further US$30,000/- she says she will

    try somehow to get the loan by the end of this week.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please try to arrange to get her

    husband released by this week as she is anxious for his safe return.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        SST contended that the above-mentioned letters

from Danny’s wife, Jenny, and Deen were written because they were told that Danny

would only be released if the USD230,000 was forwarded to JY on the basis that it was in

respect of Danny’s release from custody. What is strange is that when cross-examined,

Danny admitted that his wife had tried to borrow money to secure his release. JY’s

counsel, Mr Andre Arul, rightly pointed out that if the USD230,000 in question was

intended to be a partial refund of the purchase price paid by JY to SST, there was no

reason for Danny’s wife to try and raise money to secure his release.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        What SST is in fact alleging is that JY is

guilty of fraud and that the DPRK Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority is colluding

with JY to defraud them. SST submitted that it should not be overlooked that the

"apology money" was transferred to JY’s account. Apart from the fact that

fraud was not pleaded by SST, it is pertinent to note that Mr Yun Jun Hi, the officer in

the Central Public Prosecutors’ Authority who took charge of the investigation

regarding Danny’s breach of the DPRK’s laws, testified that the "apology

money" had, for convenience, been paid into JY’s account because that company

had the requisite foreign exchange account and had prior dealings with SST. He also

confirmed that JY had transferred the USD230,000 in question to the relevant government

authority. It ought to be borne in mind that in <i>Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A M Luther v

James Sagor &amp; Co</i> [1921] All ER 138, 146, Warrington LJ said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is well settled that the

    validity of the acts of an independent sovereign government in relation to property and

    persons within its jurisdiction cannot be questioned in the courts of this country:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Every sovereign State is

      bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign State, and the courts of one

      country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its

</blockquote>
<i><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">per </font></p></i>Clarke J, delivering

    the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in <i>Oetjen v Central

    Leather Co … </i>(1917) 246 US Rep at p 303. 

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        It is for SST to prove their assertion that

they were entitled to a set-off with respect to the USD230,000 "apology money".

As they failed to do so, the said sum cannot be deducted from the damages payable to JY

for their breach of contract. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Costs</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        As has been mentioned, SST accepted that JY are

entitled to the sum of USD600,200 for breach of contract if they had no right to set-off

the USD230,000 paid by them to JY in late 2001 and early 2002. JY are entitled to costs as

far as their claim for USD 600,200 is concerned.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        Different considerations arise with respect to

the costs in relation to JY’s claim for consequential losses and SST’s alleged

set-off. JY’s counsel pointed out that the alleged set-off occupied more time than

their claim for loss suffered under their sub-contract with Sasan. However, it must be

borne in mind that JY started off with three claims for consequential losses and a number

of representatives of those who entered into sub-contracts with JY filed affidavits of

evidence-in-chief. None of these representatives appeared in court to give evidence. After

taking all circumstances into account, I order that with respect to JY’s claim for

consequential loss under their sub-contracts and SST’s claim regarding a set-off, the

parties shall bear their own costs.</font></p>
