        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The four appeals before us all arise out of awards made by the arbitrator
                    (“the Arbitrator”) in Singapore International Arbitration
                    Centre (“SIAC”) Arbitration No 37 of 2002
                    (“the Arbitration”) between Kempinski Hotels SA
                    (“Kempinski”) and PT Prima International
                    Development (“Prima”). Three of the appeals –
                        <em>viz</em>, Civil Appeal No 94 of 2011
                    (“CA 94”), Civil Appeal No 95 of 2011
                    (“CA 95”) and Civil Appeal No 96 of 2011
                    (“CA 96”) – are brought by Prima, while
                    the fourth appeal, Civil Appeal No 98 of 2011
                    (“CA 98”), is brought by Kempinski. Kempinski had
                    earlier applied to the High Court to set aside the Arbitrator’s third
                    interim award dated 20 May 2008 (“the Third
                    Award”), fourth interim award dated 20 October 2008
                    (“the Fourth Award”) and costs award dated
                    15 April 2009 (“the Costs Award”). In
                    CA 94, CA 95 and CA 96, Prima is appealing against
                    the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) setting
                    aside, respectively, the Costs Award, the Third Award and the Fourth Award. As
                    for CA 98, it is Kempinski’s cross-appeal against the
                    Judge’s decision not to set aside the Third Award and the Fourth Award
                    on some of the grounds which it had relied on in its application to set aside
                    those awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Judge’s decisions setting aside the Third Award, the Fourth
                    Award and the Costs Award are reported in, respectively, <em>Kempinski Hotels SA v PT Prima International
                        Development</em> [2011] 4 SLR 633 (“the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Prima, an Indonesian company, is the owner of the Plaza Hotel at Jalan
                    Jenderal Sudirman, Jakarta (“the Hotel”). Kempinski is a
                    Swiss company which manages and operates hotels around the world. On
                    15 April 1994,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Kempinski and Prima entered into an Operating and Management
                    Contract (“the Management Contract”) under which Kempinski
                    was given the right to operate and manage the Hotel for 20 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Kempinski commenced managing the Hotel after its soft opening in
                    June 1998.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Management Contract was subject to Indonesian law. It contained the
                    following arbitration agreement in Art 20:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with or
                        resulting from [the Management Contract], its application or interpretation,
                        where an amicable settlement cannot be reached, shall be referred to and
                        determined by arbitration under the Rules of the [SIAC]. The arbitration
                        shall be governed by the laws of Indonesia. All proceedings shall be in the
                        English language. The place of arbitration shall be Singapore. The arbitral
                        award shall be final and judgement thereof may be entered in any Court
                        having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the applicable version of the SIAC’s
                    Arbitration Rules for the purposes of the Arbitration was the SIAC Rules
                    (2nd Ed, 22 October 1997) (“the SIAC Rules
                    (1997 Ed)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, the business relationship between the parties soured. On
                    6 February 2002,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Prima gave Kempinski written notice of termination of the Management
                    Contract on the ground that Kempinski had failed to perform its obligations
                    under the Management Contract. Prima then entered into another management
                    contract with a different company to manage the Hotel in place of Kempinski in
                    April 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Commencement of the Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The purported termination of the Management Contract by Prima led Kempinski to
                    commence the Arbitration on 20 May 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In its Points of Claim, Kempinski sought the following
                        remedies:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    declarations to the effect that:–</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">i.    [Prima] had wrongfully and unjustifiably purported to terminate
                                the [Management] Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">ii.    [Kempinski was] not in material breach of the [Management]
                                Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iii.   [Kempinski] should be entitled to continue with the [Management]
                                Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    an injunction restraining [Prima] from entering into or continuing
                            with any contract for the operation and management of the Hotel with any
                            third party in place of or in addition to [Kempinski], or otherwise
                            interfering with the [Management] Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c)    further or alternatively, an order/award for the specific performance
                            of the [Management] Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d)    further or alternatively, the full extent of the loss and damage
                            caused to [Kempinski], including loss of profits for the remainder of
                            the term of the [Management] Contract, if [Kempinski is] not to continue
                            with the [Management] Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">e)    if for any reason, [Kempinski is] not to continue with the
                            [Management] Contract, the sum of about US$86,700.00 being the balance
                            of the full amount of the management fees due to [Kempinski] as against
                            the discounted figure, which discount was given on the basis of a
                            continuation of the [Management] Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">f)    interest at such rate and for such period as the Arbitrator deems fit
                            and just;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">g)    costs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">h)    such further and/or other relief which the Arbitrator deems
                            fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In September 2002, Prima filed its Points of Defence and Counterclaim in which
                    it pleaded that the termination of the Management Contract was valid under
                    Indonesian law and counterclaimed for damages against Kempinski for breach of
                    the Management Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the course of the Arbitration, Prima applied to the Arbitrator for leave to
                    amend its pleadings to include the defence that the Management Contract had
                    become illegal under Indonesian law because of three decisions issued by the
                    Indonesian Ministry of Tourism in, respectively, November 1996, June 1997 and
                    May 2000 which changed the regulatory conditions for the management of hotels in
                    Indonesia (“the Three Decisions”). In substance, the Three
                    Decisions made it illegal for a foreign entity to manage hotels in Indonesia
                    unless it set up a company incorporated in Indonesia (a “PMA
                    company”) or entered into a joint venture with Indonesian
                    partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As either means of managing the Hotel had negative tax implications for
                    Kempinski, it had, after the second of the Three Decisions was issued, sought
                    legal advice on how to carry on managing the Hotel without contravening the
                    altered regulatory framework. Kempinski’s legal counsel had advised
                    that Kempinski would not contravene the altered regulatory framework if it
                    managed the Hotel without having a commercial presence in Indonesia or without
                    bringing any monetary assets into Indonesia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Kempinski’s legal counsel had further advised that since
                    the general manager of the Hotel was employed by Prima (although he was
                    nominated by Kempinski, which was then the industry practice),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that meant that Kempinski did not have a commercial presence within
                    Indonesia, and, as such, would not be acting in contravention of the altered
                    regulatory framework.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Acting on such legal advice, Kempinski had continued to manage the
                    Hotel without any objection from Prima.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Prima’s purpose in applying for leave to amend its Points of Defence
                    and Counterclaim to plead supervening illegality was not to rely on it to deny
                    liability for breach of contract should Kempinski prove that Prima had indeed
                    terminated the Management Contract wrongfully. Instead, Prima’s
                    purpose was to rely on supervening illegality to limit the period for which
                    Kempinski could claim damages. Specifically, Prima sought to argue that the
                    relevant period should end on the date when the Management Contract began to be
                    performed illegally by Kempinski. As Prima conceded that a reasonable period of
                    time within which to comply with the Three Decisions would be one year from the
                    date on which the last of the Three Decisions was issued (<em>viz</em>, 3 May 2000), it took the position that the period
                    for which Kempinski could claim damages (in the event that it succeeded against
                    Prima on the issue of liability) should end on 3 May 2001. The
                    Arbitrator gave leave to Prima in June 2003 to make the aforesaid
                        amendment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> On 18 August 2003, Prima filed its Points of Re-Amended
                    Defence and Counterclaim specifically pleading supervening illegality and
                        <em>force majeure</em> under Art 1245 of the
                    Indonesian Civil Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Shortly thereafter, Prima applied for the issue of illegality to be tried as a
                    preliminary issue for the reason that if Kempinski were not entitled to damages
                    from 3 May 2001 onwards, it would be moot for the Arbitration to
                    continue further on the issue of whether Prima was liable to Kempinski for
                    breach of contract since the alleged wrongful termination of the Management
                    Contract took place only after 3 May 2001 (specifically, on
                    6 February 2002). The Arbitrator granted Prima’s application
                    and issued Procedural Order No 1 dated 8 July 2003<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> directing that the issue of illegality be tried after Kempinski had
                    closed its case in the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Arbitrator’s first interim award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Arbitrator heard arguments on the issue of illegality in two tranches. The
                    first tranche was heard between 26 and 28 July 2004, followed by two
                    rounds of written submissions by the parties. Prima’s submission that
                    the Management Contract had been rendered illegal by the Three Decisions was met
                    by Kempinski’s response that, first, there was no doctrine of
                    supervening illegality in Indonesian law and, second, the Three Decisions were
                    constitutionally invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 18 February 2005, the Arbitrator published his first interim award
                    (“the First Award”), which dealt with the issue of
                    illegality as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    … [T]he [Management] [C]ontract remains valid but has
                            become impossible of performance as a result of the [Three]
                            Decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Any benefits passed by [Kempinski] to [Prima] under the [Management]
                            [C]ontract may be recoverable, subject to existing pleadings
                            accommodating such relief and subject to counterclaims by

<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that although the Arbitrator decided that the Management
                    Contract had become “impossible of performance as a result of the
                    [Three] Decisions”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> what he actually meant was that it had become impossible to perform,
                        <em>save in a manner that </em><em>conformed </em><em>with the Three
                    Decisions</em>. This can be seen from para 68 of the First Award,
                    where he stated that “[i]t [was] clear that the [Three] Decisions
                        <em>[did] not prevent the performance of the [Management]

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Arbitrator’s second interim award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The First Award did not settle the issue of how lawful performance of the
                    Management Contract – <em>ie</em>, performance in
                    a manner which complied with the Three Decisions – could be carried
                    out. To settle this issue, the parties requested the Arbitrator to answer the
                    four questions set out in the quotation at [15] below. The Arbitrator considered
                    those questions in the second tranche of the oral hearing on the issue of
                    illegality from 6 to 8 February 2006. Both parties adduced expert
                    evidence on Indonesian law, and the experts called by the parties were also
                    cross-examined. The parties also tendered further written submissions. In
                    particular, Kempinski’s expert witness, Prof Mariam Darus
                    (“Prof Darus”), opined that there were three
                    methods of performing the Management Contract that were permitted by the Three
                    Decisions, namely:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>

                    Award”) on 12 December 2006 in which he answered the four
                    questions referred to him by the parties as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Question One: Given the finding [in the First
                            Award] that the [Management] Contract is valid but is not capable of
                            performance except in the manner prescribed in the [Three] Decisions,
                            are any claims to damages arising from the [Management] Contract still
                            available to [Kempinski] under Indonesian law?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The answer that must be given is that there are alternative methods of
                        performance which would be consistent with the [T]hree Decisions. Given that
                        the [Management] Contract is valid, recourse to these alternative methods of
                        performance is viable. Their existence rules out <em>force
                            majeure</em>. Failure to give effect to them raises the
                        possibility of a remedy by way of damages. Thus, claims for damages arising
                        from the [Management] Contract are still available to [Kempinski] under
                        Indonesian Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Question Two: If … claims to damages
                            are still available to [Kempinski,] what are the bases for computation
                            of such damages?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to any defences which arise from the pleadings and other
                        counterclaims, the normal basis for damages would be for the loss of
                        profits. The life of the [Management] Contract has to be determined in the
                        light of the circumstances. Other matters that may affect damages are
                        matters for further evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Question Three[:] If … claims for
                            damages are not available to [Kempinski], are there any other remedies
                            (including a declaration) available to [Kempinski]?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This question need not be answered in view of the finding that there is a
                        remedy by way of damages still open.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Third Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After the Second Award was published, Prima discovered that Kempinski had
                    entered into a contract dated 28 April 2006 (as later admitted by
                    Kempinski) to provide hotel management services in respect of another hotel in
                    Indonesia (“the New Management Contract”). This contract
                    was entered into after Kempinski incorporated a company in Indonesia. On
                    28 March 2007, Prima’s solicitors wrote to the Arbitrator to
                    seek “clarification”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> of the Second Award in the light of this newly-discovered
                    information. Specifically, Prima requested the Arbitrator to consider whether
                    the three modes of performing the Management Contract set out at [14] above were
                    still possible in view of the New Management Contract,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> which, it contended, was in breach of the exclusivity clause in
                    Art 21 of the Management Contract. A conference was held on
                    10 April 2007 to decide how the Arbitration should proceed. Following
                    that conference (“the April 2007 Directions Conference”),
                    Kempinski failed to comply with the Arbitrator’s order for it to give
                    full disclosure of the salient terms of the New Management Contract, and only
                    disclosed that it would be managing the Grand Hotel Indonesia Kempinski under
                    the New Management Contract. Dissatisfied with the extent of
                    Kempinski’s disclosure, the Arbitrator issued further discovery
                    orders. This led to Kempinski’s statement that the New Management
                    Contract was entered into on 28 April 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The parties subsequently tendered written submissions and expert
                    opinions to the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 20 May 2008, the Arbitrator published the Third Award, which held
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>

                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  As a result the methods of performance that remained open after the
                            Three Decisions are no longer possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  The possibility of damages for the period between the date of the
                            alleged termination of the [M]anagement [C]ontract and
                                [28<sup>th</sup>] April, 2006 still
                            remains. When submissions on this issue are completed, the [Arbitrator]
                            will make an award as to damages and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Consequent upon the Third Award, the Arbitrator directed the parties on
                    20 May 2008 to file submissions on whether, in the event that Kempinski
                    succeeded against Prima on the issue of liability, any damages would be payable
                    to Kempinski for the period between the date of the alleged wrongful termination
                    of the Management Contract by Prima and the date on which the New Management
                    Contract was entered into by Kempinski (“the Intervening
                    Period”). Kempinski did not comply with the Arbitrator’s
                    direction within the stipulated timeframe. Instead, it filed Originating Summons
                    No 903 of 2008 (“OS 903”) on
                    4 July 2008 to set aside the Third Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Fourth Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 27 June 2008, pending the hearing of OS 903, Prima
                    tendered its submissions as directed by the Arbitrator and requested the
                    Arbitrator to decide, as a matter of law, whether any damages were payable to
                    Kempinski for the Intervening Period should Prima be found liable for breach of
                    contract. Prima contended that the Three Decisions had to be complied with
                    within a reasonable period of time. In this regard, Prima conceded that a
                    reasonable period of time would be one year from the date on which the last of
                    the Three Decisions was issued, but submitted that since that period had already
                    expired by the time the Intervening Period commenced, the Management Contract
                    had ended by operation of law even before the start of the Intervening Period.
                    As such, Prima argued, Kempinski could not claim any damages for the Intervening
                    Period. Prima further contended that any award of damages in favour of Kempinski
                    for the Intervening Period would be offensive to the public policy of
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Notwithstanding the absence of any arguments from Kempinski on the aforesaid
                    question (<em>viz</em>, whether any damages would be
                    payable to Kempinski for the Intervening Period should Prima be found liable for
                    breach of contract), the Arbitrator proceeded to consider that question. He took
                    the view that awarding damages to Kempinski for the Intervening Period would
                    involve overlooking the fact that during that period, Kempinski performed the
                    Management Contract in a way which was contrary to the law of Indonesia as set
                    out in the Three Decisions. For this reason, the Arbitrator held, any award of
                    damages in favour of Kempinski for the Intervening Period would be against the
                    public policy of Indonesia and would not be enforceable. In the result, the
                    Arbitrator published the Fourth Award on 20 October 2008 holding that
                    Kempinski could not claim any damages for the Intervening Period and,
                    accordingly, its claims for relief in the Arbitration, including its claim for
                    specific performance of the Management Contract, had wholly failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 29 January 2009, Kempinski filed Originating Summons
                    No 121of 2009 (“OS 121”) to set aside
                    the Fourth Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Costs Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     After the issue of the Fourth Award, the Arbitrator requested the parties to
                    make submissions on costs. On 15 April 2009, he issued the Costs Award,
                    which was in favour of Prima. On 6 July 2009, Kempinski filed
                    Originating Summons No 766 of 2009
                    (“OS 766”) to set aside the Costs Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision on OS 903, OS 121
                and OS 766</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before the Judge, Kempinski made the following arguments in support of its
                    application to set aside the Third Award, the Fourth Award and the Costs Award
                    in, respectively, OS 903, OS 121 and OS 766:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Arbitrator lacked the jurisdiction to issue the Third Award and the
                        Fourth Award because the matters determined in those awards had already been
                        determined in the First Award and the Second Award (referred to hereafter as
                        “the <em>functus officio</em>
                        argument”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Prima was barred by issue estoppel from raising any issue relating to the
                        New Management Contract in the Arbitration after the Second Award was made
                        (referred to hereafter as “the issue estoppel
                        argument”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     in the Third Award and the Fourth Award, the Arbitrator had decided issues
                        that had not been formally pleaded, thereby acting beyond the scope of his
                        authority (referred to hereafter as “the pleadings
                        argument”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     there was apparent bias on the part of the Arbitrator in conducting his
                        own line of inquiry into the New Management Contract, and
                        Kempinski’s right to be heard had been violated by (<em>inter alia</em>) the Arbitrator’s refusal to
                        allow cross-examination of the respective parties’ legal experts
                        on the legal effect of the New Management Contract (referred to hereafter as
                        “the natural justice argument”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Prima contested all the above arguments and further submitted that even if any
                    of them were made out, Kempinski had not suffered any prejudice, and the Third
                    Award, the Fourth Award and the Costs Award (collectively, “the Three
                    Awards”) should therefore not be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Judge set aside the Third Award on the basis that the New Management
                    Contract, which had a significant impact on the Arbitrator’s decision,
                    had not been pleaded. As for the other three arguments that were raised by
                    Kempinski in challenging the Third Award, the Judge found that they either did
                    not apply or consequential prejudice was not made out. The Judge likewise set
                    aside the Fourth Award on the ground that it was based on an unpleaded matter.
                    Since the Third Award and the Fourth Award were set aside, the Costs Award was
                    also set aside as a corollary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In CA 94, CA 95 and CA 96, Prima is in effect
                    seeking to restore, respectively, the Costs Award, the Third Award and the
                    Fourth Award. On its part, Kempinski is cross-appealing in CA 98
                    against the Judge’s decision on the ground that the Third Award and
                    the Fourth Award should have been set aside based on the other three arguments
                    set out at [23] above (other than the pleadings argument) as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CA 95</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As mentioned earlier, in the court below, Kempinski raised four arguments in
                    support of its contention that the Three Awards should be set aside. The
                    pleadings argument is the subject matter of CA 95, while the other
                    three arguments come within the purview of CA 98. Should we decide to
                    allow CA 95 in respect of the Third Award, it will be necessary for us
                    to deal with the arguments raised by Kempinski in CA 98 to consider
                    whether that award (as well as the Fourth Award) should remain set aside, albeit
                    on a different ground from that relied on by the Judge. However, if
                    CA 95 is dismissed, then CA 98 need not be addressed. For this
                    reason, we shall deal with CA 95 first.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within
                        the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters
                        beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At [54]–[56] of the Judgment, the Judge commented on
                    Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law and the role of pleadings in
                    arbitral proceedings as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    … The purpose of the arbitration agreement here, as in
                            other cases, was to bind [the] parties to submit the disputes arising
                            under the [Management] Contract to determination by arbitration. It did
                            not imply that [the] parties would be free at any time during the
                            proceedings to raise material and unpleaded points without having first
                            made an application to amend their pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55    … Under Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law
                            …, one of the grounds on which an arbitration award may be
                            set aside is where the matters decided by the Tribunal were beyond the
                            scope of the submission to arbitration. To determine whether matters in
                            an award were within or outside the scope of the submission to
                            arbitration, a reference to the pleadings would usually have to be made.
                            It is therefore incorrect for [Prima] to argue that jurisdiction in a
                            particular reference was not limited to the pleadings or that there was
                            no rule of pleading that requires all material facts to be stated and
                            specifically pleaded as would be required in court litigation. An
                            arbitrator must be guided by the pleadings when considering what it is
                            that has been placed before him for decision by the parties. Pleadings
                            are an essential component of a procedurally fair hearing both before a
                            court and before a tribunal. I was therefore surprised that [Prima]
                            argued that it was not required to plead material facts because this
                            dispute was being adjudicated by an arbitrator.</p>

                            … states at p 38:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where an arbitration is conducted on the basis of [the] Model Law,
                            art. 23, the arbitrator is bound to decide the case in
                            accordance with the parties’ pleadings, and he is not entitled
                            to go beyond the pleadings and decide on points on which the parties
                            have not given evidence and have not made submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The above statement was adopted from <em>Ng Chin Siau v How
                            Kim Chuan</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 789, a decision that I
                        made in the context of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10,
                        2002 Rev Ed) … The fact that it was incorporated in a
                        text on the Model Law and the [IAA] shows that the principles enunciated in
                        that case are accepted as applying equally to international arbitration
                        under the [IAA]. In that case, I emphasized that abiding by the rule as to
                        the pleading of material facts was essential in arbitration proceedings
                        where the right of appeal was severely limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prima’s case on the pleadings argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before us, Prima’s case is that the Judge’s decision on
                    the pleadings argument is wrong for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Pleadings are not essential in international arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The essence of procedural fairness lies in Art 18 of the Model
                        Law, which does not require the filing of pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Subject to the requirements of Art 18 of the Model Law, an
                        arbitrator is allowed to determine the arbitration procedure to be followed.
                        The Model Law does not fetter an arbitrator’s discretion to decide
                        what the required procedure in an arbitration should be or what the required
                        content (or content specificity) of the pleadings filed in an arbitration
                        should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     The New Management Contract and its legal effect on Kempinski’s
                        claim for damages in general was an issue within the Arbitrator’s
                        mandate as it fell within “the scope of the submission to
                        arbitration” for the purposes of Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of
                        the Model Law. In this regard, Prima reiterates the argument (which was
                        rejected by the Judge) that the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator was
                        determined by the scope of the arbitration agreement in Art 20 of
                        the Management Contract, and not by the respective parties’
                        pleadings. The arbitration agreement in this case, Prima submits, is of the
                        widest possible construction and would cover the relevant facts of the New
                        Management Contract in relation to the continuing viability (or otherwise)
                        of Kempinski’s claim for damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We should add, in relation to sub-para (d) above, that
                    Prima’s submissions on the New Management Contract were directed
                    mainly at the legal effect of that contract on Kempinski’s claim for
                    damages; its legal effect on Kempinski’s alternative claim for
                    specific performance was hardly addressed before this court. The same comment
                    applies to Kempinski’s submissions on the New Management Contract. We
                    shall thus, in the rest of this judgment, discuss the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract predominantly in respect of Kempinski’s claim for
                    damages. It should, however, be noted that our comments and ruling on this issue
                    apply equally to Kempinski’s alternative claim for specific
                    performance as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our analysis of the pleadings argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In our view, the crucial point in relation to the pleadings argument is
                    whether the legal effect of the New Management Contract was part of, or directly
                    related to, the dispute which the parties submitted for arbitration. In
                        <em>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia
                        Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597, this
                    court made the following observations on the jurisdiction (in the sense of the
                    mandate or authority) of an arbitral tribunal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    The law on the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is well
                            established. Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law merely
                            reflects the basic principle that an arbitral tribunal has no
                            jurisdiction to decide any issue not referred to it for determination by
                            the parties. In relation to this matter, we note
                            Lord Halsbury’s observations in <em>London and North Western and Great Western Joint Railway Companies
                                v J H Billington, Limited</em> [1899] AC 79,
                            where he noted, at 81, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I do not think any lawyer could reasonably contend that, when parties
                            are referring differences to arbitration, under whatever authority that
                            reference is made, you could for the first time introduce <em>a new difference after the order of arbitration was
                                made</em>. Therefore, upon that question I certainly do give a
                            very strong opinion. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>London and North Western and Great Western Joint Railway
                        Companies v J H Billington, Limited</em>
                    [1899] AC 79 at 81,
                    Lord Halsbury LC was making a general observation that where
                    an arbitral award had been made on issues that had been submitted for
                    arbitration, one party could not be allowed to introduce a new dispute which was
                    not within the scope of the submission to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The role of pleadings in arbitration and litigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     An arbitration agreement is merely an agreement between parties to submit
                    their disputes for arbitration. The disputes submitted for arbitration determine
                    the scope of the arbitration. It is plain that the scope of an arbitration
                    agreement in the broad sense is not the same as the scope of the submission to
                    arbitration. The former must encompass the latter, but the converse does not
                    necessarily apply, in that the particular matters submitted for arbitration may
                    not be all the matters covered by the arbitration agreement. The parties to an
                    arbitration agreement are not obliged to submit whatever disputes they may have
                    for arbitration. Those disputes which they choose to submit for arbitration will
                    demarcate the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal in the arbitral proceedings
                    between them. An arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to resolve disputes which
                    have not been referred to it in the submission to arbitration. Simply put, a
                    party cannot raise a new dispute in an arbitration without the consent of the
                    other party. These propositions flow inexorably from the consensual nature of
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The role of pleadings in arbitral proceedings is to provide a convenient way
                    for the parties to define the jurisdiction of the arbitrator by setting out the
                    precise nature and scope of the disputes in respect of which they seek the
                    arbitrator’s adjudication. It is for this purpose that Art 23
                    of the Model Law provides for the compulsory filing of pleadings as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">STATEMENTS OF CLAIM AND
                        DEFENCE</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Within the period of time agreed by the parties or determined by the
                            arbitral tribunal, the claimant shall state the facts supporting his
                            claim, the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought, and the
                            respondent shall state his defence in respect of these particulars,
                            unless the parties have otherwise agreed as to the required elements of
                            such statements. The parties may submit with their statements all
                            documents they consider to be relevant or may add a reference to the
                            documents or other evidence they will submit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or
                            supplement his claim or defence during the course of the arbitral
                            proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to
                            allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Additionally, Rule 18 of the SIAC Rules (1997 Ed) also
                    provides for pleadings to be filed by the parties. Accordingly, in order to
                    determine whether an arbitral tribunal has the jurisdiction to adjudicate on and
                    make an award in respect of a particular dispute, it is necessary to refer to
                    the pleaded case of each party to the arbitration and the issues of law or fact
                    that are raised in the pleadings to see whether they encompass that
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Pleadings play a similar role in litigation. A useful summary of the function
                    of pleadings in litigation is provided by Sir Jack Jacob and Iain
                    S Goldrein, <em>Pleadings: Principles and
                        Practice</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1990)

                                due amendment properly made. …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    … To provide a brief summary of the case of each party,

                                of the claim and [the] defence may be easily apprehended, and to
                                constitute a permanent record of the issues and questions raised in
                                the action and decided therein so as to prevent future litigation
                                upon matters already adjudicated upon between the litigants or those
                                privy to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Although there is an important difference between arbitration and litigation
                    in the sense that arbitration is consensual in nature whereas litigation is not,
                    the basic principles applicable to determine the jurisdiction of the arbitrator
                    or the court to decide a dispute raised by the parties are generally the same.
                    In arbitration, the parties can determine the scope of the arbitration; so can
                    the parties in litigation <em>vis-à-vis</em> the issues to
                    be tried. As Dyson LJ observed in <em>Al-Medenni v Mars
                        UK Limited</em> [2005] EWCA Civ 1041 at
                    [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is fundamental to our adversarial system of justice that
                        the parties should clearly identify the issues that arise in the litigation,
                        so that each has the opportunity of responding to the points made by the
                        other. <em>The function of the judge is to adjudicate on
                            those issues alone. The parties may have their own reasons for limiting
                            the issues or presenting them in a certain way. The judge can invite,
                            and even encourage, the parties to recast or modify the issues. Bu[t] if
                            they refuse to do so, the judge must respect that decision. One
                            consequence of this may be that the judge is compelled to reject a claim
                            on the basis on which it is advanced, although he or she is of the
                            opinion that it would have succeeded if it had been advanced on a
                            different basis. Such an outcome may be unattractive, but any other
                            approach leads to uncertainty and potentially real
                            unfairness.</em> [emphasis added]</p>

                    the court cannot dismiss the claim on the ground that there is no contract
                    unless that ground is raised by way of an amended defence (allowed by the court)
                    at any time before the conclusion of the trial (see <em>Loy Chin
                        Associates Pte Ltd v Autohouse Trading Pte Ltd</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 740 at [19]–[21]). Even where a new issue
                    is raised by the court on its own motion as a result of the evidence adduced
                    during the trial, the defence should, for the sake of good order, be amended so
                    that the plaintiff may file an amended reply and, if necessary, call rebuttal
                    evidence on the new issue. This is an established process to ensure fairness to
                    the party affected by the new issue. From the court’s perspective, any
                    issue of fact and/or law that is relevant to the dispute before it will normally
                    be allowed to be raised by way of an amendment to the pleadings so that all the
                    issues relevant to the dispute can be disposed of at the same time in the same
                    trial (subject only to the principle that a proposed amendment to a
                    party’s pleadings, if allowed, must not result in prejudice to the
                    other party which cannot be compensated by way of costs).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The established principles in this area of the law are clear. As
                    Lord Normand succinctly stated in <em>Esso Petroleum Co
                        Ltd v Southport Corporation</em> [1956] AC 218
                    at 238–239:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The function of pleadings is to give fair notice of the case which has to
                        be met so that the opposing party may direct his evidence to the issue
                        disclosed by them. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… To condemn a party on a ground of which no fair notice has
                        been given may be as great a denial of justice as to condemn him on a ground
                        on which his evidence has been improperly excluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in <em>Loveridge, Loveridge v Healey</em>
                    [2004] EWCA Civ 173, Lord Phillips of Worth
                    Matravers MR commented at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is on the basis of the pleadings that the parties decide what evidence
                        they will need to place before the court and what preparations are necessary
                        before the trial. Where one party advances a case that is inconsistent with
                        his pleadings, it often happens that the other party takes no point on this.
                        Where the departure from the pleadings causes no prejudice, or where for
                        some other reason it is obvious that the court, if asked, will give
                        permission to amend the pleading, the other party may be sensible to take no
                        pleading point. Where, however, departure from a pleading will cause
                        prejudice, it is in the interests of justice that the other party should be
                        entitled to insist that this is not permitted unless the pleading is
                        appropriately amended. That then introduces, in its proper context, the
                        issue of whether or not the party in question should be permitted to advance
                        a case which has not hitherto been pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The scope of the submission to arbitration in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, the scope of the parties’ submission to
                    arbitration is delineated by the Notice of Arbitration filed by Kempinski on
                    20 May 2002 in accordance with Art 20 of the Management
                    Contract. After setting out the disputes arising from the Management Contract,
                    Kempinski alleged that the purported termination of the Management Contract by
                    Prima on 6 February 2002 was legally unjustified, wrongful and/or in
                    repudiation of that contract. In consequence, Kempinski sought the reliefs set
                    out at [6] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s reasoning apropos the pleadings
                argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Judge set aside the Third Award on the ground that the New Management
                    Contract had not been pleaded and, thus, its legal effect was not an issue which
                    had been submitted for arbitration. Accordingly, the Arbitrator had no
                    jurisdiction to decide that issue and had acted in excess of his jurisdiction in
                    making the Third Award, which, on account of the New Management Contract,
                    indirectly amended the Second Award. The Judge held that the Arbitrator would
                    have had the jurisdiction to decide what legal effect the New Management
                    Contract had only if Prima had applied for leave to amend its pleadings to plead
                    that new point and thereby allowed Kempinski to amend its pleadings as well to
                    reply to that point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Judge explained her decision at [60]–[64] of the Judgment as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60    In essence, [Prima] had claimed in the italicised portion of its
                            Points of Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim, that the [Management]
                            Contract had become unenforceable and/or incapable of performance after
                            3 May 2000 because of the supervening illegality. This pleading
                            was filed in August 2003 at which point the [N]ew [M]anagement
                            [Contract] had not been entered [into]. It was not in the contemplation
                            of [Prima] at that time, therefore, that the impossibility of performing
                            the [Management] Contract could possibly be due to conflicting
                            contractual obligations voluntarily undertaken by [Kempinski] with a
                            third party. [Prima] was saying only that the [Management] Contract
                            could not be performed because it had been rendered illegal by the Three
                            Decisions or because of the <em>force majeure</em>
                            consequence of the Three Decisions. At that time, [Prima] considered the
                            supervening illegality issue to be a total answer to
                            [Kempinski’s] claim. It was not necessary therefore to
                            consider other points which might make it impossible for [Kempinski] to
                            perform the [Management] Contract. The necessity of doing this only
                            arose when the Arbitrator found, based on Prof Darus’
                            evidence, that there were still three possible ways of performing the
                            [Management] Contract despite the Three Decisions.
                            Paragraph 43C of the Points of Re-Amended Defence and
                            Counterclaim thus does not, was not intended to, and cannot, cover the
                            issue of the effect of the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] on the
                            possibility of performing the [Management] Contract. A related point,
                                <em>ie</em>, the extent to which
                            [Kempinski’s] possible future claim to damages was restricted
                            or adversely affected by the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract], was also not
                            covered by this pleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61    The correct course for [Prima] to have taken when it found out about
                            the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] in 2006 or 2007 was to have applied to
                            amend its pleading to include the allegation that the existence of the
                            [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] was a fact which made it impossible for
                            [Kempinski] to perform the [Management] Contract and therefore to claim
                            damages as from the date the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] came into
                            existence. Such an amended pleading would have allowed [Kempinski] to
                            amend its own pleading in order to set out the possible grounds on which
                            it could contend that the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] would not have
                            such an effect. The Arbitrator would then have been able to take
                            evidence on the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] and the impact it had on
                            the [Management] Contract and would have been able to establish the
                            facts necessary to come to a decision as to whether or not the existence
                            of the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] made it impossible for [Kempinski]
                            to perform the [Management] Contract and/or claim damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62    Instead of doing that, [Prima] raised the [N]ew [M]anagement
                            [Contract] in its letter of 28 March 2007 in which it asked for
                            “clarifications” on the Second Award. In
                            para 9.1 of this letter …, [Prima] asked for
                            clarification on whether [Kempinski’s] application for a PMA
                            licence to carry on the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] was in breach of
                            its active duty of good faith. In para 9.4 of the same letter,
                            [Prima] went on to ask for clarification whether [Kempinski] was
                            entitled after its own repudiation of the [Management] Contract
                                (<em>ie</em>, by entering into the [N]ew
                            [M]anagement [Contract]) to prospectively perform the [Management]
                            Contract by rectifying its prior and existing breaches of the Three
                            Decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">63    In my judgment, [Prima] was not truly asking for clarification on the
                            Second Award by making these queries. Instead, it was raising new issues
                            for the [Arbitrator’s] determination. Indeed, in a later
                            written submission to the court, [Prima] conceded that the wrong
                            nomenclature had been used in the 28 March 2007 letter and that
                            these matters were not matters of clarification. Under the [IAA], there
                            is only a limited residual power for a tribunal to correct or interpret
                            an arbitral award after it has been issued. Under Art 33 of the
                            Model Law, a party to an arbitration may ask the tribunal to correct in
                            an award “any errors in computation, any clerical or
                            typographical errors or any errors of similar nature”. It is
                            further provided that if the parties agree, then one party may ask the
                            tribunal to interpret a specific point or part of the award. The two
                            queries raised by [Prima] in the 28 March 2007 letter (see [62]
                            above) did not fall into either of these categories. The Arbitrator
                            could either have ignored the request or pointed out the error. Instead,
                            unfortunately, he took up the points and this eventually resulted in the
                            Third Award. The issues raised required proper investigation and a
                            determination of the factual matrix. That this was not done was one
                            consequence of the issues being raised as
                            “clarifications” and not in the form of an amended
                            pleading which would have served to identify properly to [Kempinski] the
                            case that it had to meet and reply to, and which would have enabled it
                            to put in the necessary response and evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    In the result, the Third Award must be set aside on the ground that
                            failure to plead the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] resulted in the
                            [Arbitrator] making a decision that was beyond the scope of the matters
                            submitted to [him]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the legal effect of the New Management Contract within the scope
                of the parties’ submission to arbitration?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As mentioned at [31] above, the crucial point in relation to the pleadings
                    argument is whether the legal effect of the New Management Contract was within
                    the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration. This issue may be
                    determined by considering what disputes between the parties were submitted to
                    the Arbitrator for adjudication. Kempinski’s claim against Prima was
                    for damages for breach of contract for “the remainder of the term of
                    the [Management] Contract”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> starting from 6 February 2002 (the date on which Prima
                    terminated the Management Contract) and, in the alternative, specific
                    performance. On its part, Prima counterclaimed for damages for breach of
                    contract by Kempinski, and subsequently amended its Points of Defence and
                    Counterclaim to plead illegality and <em>force majeure</em>
                    arising from the Three Decisions with effect from 3 May 2000. We pause
                    here to mention that “illegality” and
                    “supervening illegality” are both English law concepts and
                    are not so characterised in Indonesian law. The Arbitrator referred to the use
                    of these terms as “an unfortunate facet”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> of the Arbitration that “befuddled the issues to a
                    considerable extent”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In the Arbitrator’s view, “the situation of the
                    [Three Decisions] required consideration of the principles of <em>force majeure</em> rather than that of illegality and should have
                    been considered in these terms from the outset”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> However, he also noted that “[t]his difference in
                    nomenclature ha[d] not significantly affected the outcome as sufficient clarity
                    of the approach of Indonesian law had emerged as the [A]rbitration
                        proceeded.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As mentioned earlier, the Arbitrator made the First Award on
                    18 February 2005 and held that the Management Contract had not been
                    rendered illegal by the Three Decisions, although it had become impossible to
                    perform, save in a manner that was in conformity with the Three Decisions. In
                    the Second Award made on 12 December 2006, the Arbitrator held that
                    based on the expert opinion of Prof Darus (Kempinski’s expert
                    witness), the Management Contract could still be lawfully performed in three
                    ways which conformed with the Three Decisions. After the Second Award was made,
                    Prima discovered that Kempinski had entered into the New Management Contract on
                    28 April 2006, which conduct (it was not disputed) was in breach of
                    Kempinski’s management obligations under the Management
                    Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Consequent upon this discovery, Prima sought
                        “clarification”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> from the Arbitrator as to whether, in view of the New Management
                    Contract, the Management Contract could still be performed by Kempinski in any
                    of the three permitted ways set out in Prof Darus’ opinion.
                    The Arbitrator directed the parties to submit written arguments on this issue.
                    In its written submissions, Kempinski contended that the New Management Contract
                    was irrelevant to the issue of Prima’s liability for breach of the
                    Management Contract and only had a potential bearing on the issue of specific
                    performance and damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the Third Award made on 20 May 2008, the Arbitrator held that
                    Kempinski’s obligations under the New Management Contract were
                    inconsistent with its obligations under the Management Contract, and that as a
                    result: (a) Kempinski could no longer perform its obligations under the
                    Management Contract in any of the three ways that remained possible after the
                    Three Decisions were announced, and therefore could not claim any damages for
                    the period after 28 April 2006 (the date on which the New Management
                    Contract was entered into); but (b) the possibility of damages for the
                    Intervening Period still remained. The Arbitrator explained his reasoning as
                    follows in the Third Award:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The underlying legal basis of the Third Award was that of <em>force majeure</em>, in that Kempinski, by entering into the New
                    Management Contract on 28 April 2006, had breached Art 21 of
                    the Management Contract and had thus made it impossible for itself to thereafter
                    perform the Management Contract by any of the three methods of performance that
                    remained possible after the Three Decisions were announced. In other words,
                        <em>force majeure</em> had operated to terminate the
                    Management Contract as of 28 April 2006. As such, even if Kempinski had
                    succeeded against Prima on the issue of liability and even if specific
                    performance of the Management Contract during the Intervening Period had been
                    theoretically possible, after 28 April 2006, Kempinski’s
                    claim for damages as well as its alternative claim for specific performance were
                    no longer viable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Having regard to the pleaded issues that were submitted for arbitration, which
                    included Kempinski’s claim for damages from 6 February 2002
                    onwards for “the remainder of the term of the [Management]
                        Contract”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and its alternative claim for specific performance, the issue of
                    what legal effect the New Management Contract had on the continuing viability of
                    these two claims after 28 April 2006 was, in our view, within the scope
                    of the parties’ submission to arbitration. Even if Prima had
                    wrongfully terminated the Management Contract, Kempinski’s conduct in
                    entering into the New Management Contract would have prevented damages from
                    accruing with effect from 28 April 2006 as thereafter, Kempinski, being
                    itself in breach of the Management Contract, could not suffer any loss, nor
                    could it purport to be able to perform the Management Contract in any of the
                    three ways that remained possible after the Three Decisions were announced. In
                    our view, any new fact or change in the law arising after a submission to
                    arbitration which is ancillary to the dispute submitted for arbitration and
                    which is known to all the parties to the arbitration is part of that dispute and
                    need not be specifically pleaded. It may be raised in the arbitration, as Prima
                    did when it raised the New Management Contract as part of its <em>force majeure</em> defence to Kempinski’s claim. We should
                    also point out that Kempinski was given sufficient notice of and opportunity to
                    meet Prima’s <em>force majeure</em>
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In our view, the Judge, with respect, took too narrow an approach in
                    determining the extent or scope of the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction under
                    the parties’ submission to jurisdiction. She erred in finding that
                    since the New Management Contract had not been pleaded, its legal effect on
                    Kempinski’s claim in the Arbitration was not within the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration. We take the different view that
                    since Kempinski was seeking either damages from 6 February 2002 onwards
                    “for the remainder of the term of the [Management]
                        Contract”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> (<em>ie</em>, until 15 April 2014) or,
                    alternatively, specific performance of the Management Contract, any new fact or
                    change in the law arising in the course of the Arbitration which would affect
                    Kempinski’s right to these remedies must fall within the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration. In the circumstances, it was well
                    within the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction to decide whether, in the event
                    that Kempinski succeeded against Prima on the issue of liability, the New
                    Management Contract had the legal effect contended for by Prima. The matter can
                    be considered from another perspective. Suppose we were to agree with the Judge
                    and dismiss Prima’s appeal in CA 95 on the ground that Prima
                    should have (as the Judge held) amended its pleadings to specifically plead the
                    New Management Contract and its legal effect, the final outcome of
                    Kempinski’s claim in respect of the period after 28 April
                    2006 (after this matter is remitted for arbitration) would still be the same.
                    Prima would still be entitled, after making the necessary amendments to its
                    pleadings, to adduce evidence of the New Management Contract to show that
                    Kempinski would not be entitled to any damages or to insist on specific
                    performance of the Management Contract after 28 April 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Our conclusion on the pleadings argument provides a different perspective as
                    to whether it was necessary for Prima to further amend its Points of Re-Amended
                    Defence and Counterclaim to plead the defence arising out of the New Management
                    Contract. The Judge held that Prima’s failure to do so resulted in the
                    legal effect of the New Management Contract being outside the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration, and was therefore fatal to the
                    Third Award. However, leaving aside this conclusion (which, with respect, we
                    have held to be an error of law), the crucial question is whether Kempinski was
                    prejudiced by Prima’s omission to amend its pleadings to plead the New
                    Management Contract and its legal effect. The Judge held that Kempinski was
                    prejudiced in that if that issue had been formally pleaded, Kempinski would have
                    been able to reply to Prima’s pleadings on that issue. The Arbitrator
                    would then have been able to (see [61] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… take evidence on the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] and
                        … establish the facts necessary to come to a decision as to
                        whether or not the existence of the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract] made it
                        impossible for [Kempinski] to perform the [Management] Contract and/or claim
                        damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     With respect, we disagree with the Judge’s views on this issue. The
                    evidence on record shows that it was Kempinski which failed to disclose the
                    existence of the New Management Contract when the Arbitrator was considering the
                    four questions (see [15] above) which were the subject matter of the Second
                    Award, thus depriving the Arbitrator of the opportunity to factor in the
                    relevance and materiality of the New Management Contract before making the
                    Second Award. In this regard, we note that although Kempinski had not entered
                    into the New Management Contract yet at the time of the oral hearing relating to
                    the Second Award (that oral hearing took place from 6 to 8 February
                    2006 (see [14] above)), it subsequently entered into that contract <em>before</em> the Arbitrator issued the Second Award. After
                    Prima discovered that Kempinski had entered into the New Management Contract, it
                    raised the issue with the Arbitrator in a letter dated 28 March 2007
                    from its solicitors, and this resulted in an exchange of communications between
                    the parties and the Arbitrator on: (a) 24 May 2007 (letter
                    from Kempinski’s solicitors to the Arbitrator);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> (b) 2 July 2007 (letter from Prima’s
                    then solicitors to the Arbitrator);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and (c) 4 September 2007 (letter from
                    Kempinski’s solicitors to the Arbitrator).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Arbitrator also informed the parties of the issues which he
                    wanted them to address – in particular, the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract – on the following occasions: (a) at the
                    April 2007 Directions Conference (see [16] above); and (b) in his
                    e-mails to the parties dated, respectively, 11 July 2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> 14 September 2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> 14 December 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and 20 February 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Finally, written submissions and expert opinions on the legal effect
                    of the New Management Contract were tendered by both parties. <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the written submissions, Prima and Kempinski filed
                    their first round of written submissions on 26 October 2007;
                    thereafter, Kempinski and Prima tendered their second round of submissions on
                    1 February 2008 and 5 February 2008 respectively. As for the
                    expert opinions, Kempinski’s expert, Prof Darus, submitted
                    eight sets of expert opinion (one on 25 April 2008 and seven on
                    7 May 2008), while Prima’s expert, Mr Fred Tumbuan
                    (“Mr Tumbuan”), submitted his expert opinion on
                    29 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Given the extensive correspondence, written submissions and expert opinions
                    that were exchanged <em>vis-à-vis</em> the legal effect of
                    the New Management Contract, we are of the view that Kempinski had ample notice
                    of Prima’s case on this particular point. That Prima did not amend its
                    pleadings to specifically plead the New Management Contract and its legal effect
                    was, in our view, immaterial. Kempinski did not suffer any prejudice in any way
                    since it was given ample opportunity to address this issue of law. Although the
                    Judge held that Kempinski was deprived of the opportunity to plead that the New
                    Management Contract was not inconsistent with the Management Contract, this
                    holding is, in our view, contrary to the conduct of Kempinski at the
                    Arbitration. The terms of the New Management Contract were within
                    Kempinski’s exclusive knowledge. All it had to do to answer
                    Prima’s case on the New Management Contract was to disclose that
                    contract to the Arbitrator, either with or without redacting the
                    commercially-sensitive clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our ruling on CA 95</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For the above reasons, we hold that the New Management Contract and its legal
                    effect fell within the scope of the parties’ submission to
                    arbitration, and the Arbitrator thus had the jurisdiction to decide that issue.
                    Accordingly, we find that the Judge erred in setting aside the Third Award.
                    Prima’s appeal in CA 95 is therefore allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We shall now consider the merits of the other appeals, beginning with
                    CA 98.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CA 98</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The functus officio argument and the issue estoppel
                argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As mentioned earlier, in CA 98, Kempinski contends that the Judge
                    should have set aside the Third Award and the Fourth Award based on the other
                    arguments set out at [23] above (apart from the pleadings argument) as well.
                        <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the <em>functus
                        officio</em> argument, Kempinski’s case in the court below
                    was that the Arbitrator was <em>functus officio</em> when
                    he made the Third Award and the Fourth Award as the matters determined therein
                    had already been determined in the First Award and the Second Award. In respect
                    of the issue estoppel argument, Kempinski’s case before the Judge was
                    that after the Second Award was made, Prima was estopped from relying on the New
                    Management Contract to challenge Kempinski’s ability to perform the
                    Management Contract. The Judge rejected both the <em>functus
                        officio</em> argument and the issue estoppel argument on the ground
                    that the First Award and the Second Award dealt with matters that were distinct
                    from those determined in the Third Award and the Fourth Award (see
                    [30]–[46] and [48]–[51] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We agree with the Judge’s decision in OS 903 that the
                    issues decided by the Arbitrator in the First Award, the Second Award, the Third
                    Award and the Fourth Award were distinct from one another. The First Award held
                    that, as a matter of law, the Three Decisions did not render the Management
                    Contract illegal, but merely made its performance impossible except in a manner
                    that was in conformity with the Three Decisions. The Second Award held that, as
                    a matter of law, since there were alternative methods of performing the
                    Management Contract in a manner that conformed with the Three Decisions, damages
                    would still be available to Kempinski if it had performed the Management
                    Contract in such a manner. The Third Award held that Kempinski could not claim
                    damages for the period from 28 April 2006 onwards as a result of its
                    entering into the New Management Contract, which conduct made it impossible for
                    Kempinski, after 28 April 2006, to lawfully perform its obligations
                    under the Management Contract in any of the three ways that remained open after
                    the Three Decisions were announced. The Fourth Award held that Kempinski also
                    could not claim damages for the Intervening Period, and, thus, its claim in the
                    Arbitration had wholly failed. For these reasons, we reject both the <em>functus officio</em> argument and the issue estoppel
                    argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The natural justice argument</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Apparent bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the court below, Kempinski also sought to set aside the Third Award by
                    raising the natural justice argument (see [23(d)] above). Among other things, it
                    alleged that there had been apparent bias on the Arbitrator’s part
                    as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     he had entered the fray by asking Kempinski for information on the New
                        Management Contract and by requesting for submissions from the parties on
                        whether an adverse inference should be drawn from Kempinski’s
                        failure to give proper discovery of that contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     he had conducted the Arbitration with a closed mind in that he had reached
                        conclusions on certain matters of Indonesian law without expert evidence
                        having been adduced on those matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Judge reviewed the evidence and held that Kempinski’s allegation
                    that the Arbitrator had entered the fray by asking for information on the New
                    Management Contract was not made out as the existence of that contract had been
                    raised by Prima and the Arbitrator had merely asked Kempinski for more
                    information. As for Kempinski’s complaint that the Arbitrator had
                    entered the fray by requesting the parties to submit on whether an adverse
                    inference should be drawn against it (Kempinski) for failing to give proper
                    discovery of the New Management Contract, the Judge dismissed the complaint on
                    the ground that it was Kempinski’s repeated failure to disclose the
                    material terms of that contract which had given rise to the issue of whether an
                    adverse inference should be drawn. The Judge noted that Kempinski had been given
                    several opportunities to explain its failure to disclose the New Management
                    Contract, but had chosen not to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     With respect to Kempinski’s complaint that the Arbitrator had a
                    closed mind in that he had reached conclusions on certain matters of Indonesian
                    law without expert evidence having been adduced on those matters, this complaint
                    centred on two e-mails from the Arbitrator to the parties dated
                    14 September 2007 and 14 December 2007 respectively. The Judge
                    was of the view (at [83] of the Judgment) that in writing the e-mail of
                    14 December 2007:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he Arbitrator fell into error … This holding is
                        not made because I think that the Arbitrator displayed a closed mind. It is
                        made because the Arbitrator was making decisions which were beyond the scope
                        of the existing pleadings and without the benefit of additional evidence
                        which may have been adduced had both parties submitted proper pleadings on
                        the issue of the [N]ew [M]anagement [Contract]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the Judge went on to hold at [84] of the Judgment as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The SIAC Rules provide that any arbitrator may be challenged
                        if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the
                        arbitrator’s impartiality or independence (r 10.1).
                        [Kempinski] did not seek to challenge the Arbitrator’s
                        impartiality immediately after the issue of the 14 December [2007
                        e-mail]. This may be some indication that at the time [Kempinski] did not
                        consider that that [e-mail], whether taken alone or in conjunction with the
                        14 September [2007 e-mail], showed a closed mind on the part of the
                        [Arbitrator]. The SIAC Rules also provide that a challenge must be issued
                        within 14 days after the relevant circumstances become known to the
                        challenger. It seems to me, although I do not express a concluded view since
                        this point was not argued before me, that [Kempinski’s] failure to
                        challenge the Arbitrator’s impartiality in late 2007 or early 2008
                        should preclude the argument that is now being made on the basis of the
                        [Arbitrator’s e-mails dated 14 September 2007 and
                        14 December 2007].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     For the reasons given by the Judge as set out at [57]–[58] above, we
                    agree with her finding that the Arbitrator did not enter the fray, nor did he
                    have a closed mind with regard to the matters of Indonesian law raised in his
                    e-mails of 14 September 2007 and 14 December 2007. Given that
                    the Arbitrator is a Professor of Law of the National University of Singapore, it
                    is not surprising that he thought of all the possible legal ramifications that
                    could arise from the facts before him and then sought the views of counsel for
                    the parties on those matters. In our view, the Arbitrator’s inquiries
                    would not have given rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension on the part
                    of a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that he
                    (the Arbitrator) was biased or had already made up his mind when he raised the
                    matters of Indonesian law set out in his e-mails of 14 September 2007
                    and 14 December 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Indeed, we note that under Rule 25(e) of the SIAC Rules
                    (1997 Ed), an arbitrator has the power to conduct on his own motion
                    such inquiries as may appear to him to be necessary or expedient. Further, under
                    Art 19 of the Model Law, an arbitrator may conduct an arbitration in
                    such manner as he considers appropriate, including in relation to determining
                    the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The right to be heard – Cross-examination of expert
                witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Before the Judge, Kempinski also alleged, as part of the natural justice
                    argument, that it had been denied the right to be heard before the Third Award
                    was made, in that it had been deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine
                    Prima’s expert witness, Mr Tumbuan, on the legal effect of
                    the New Management Contract. The Judge accepted Kempinski’s argument,
                    but held that it had suffered no prejudice. At [96]–[97] of the
                    Judgment, the Judge explained why, on balance, there had been no prejudice to
                    Kempinski:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96    It is my view … that the [Arbitrator] should have, at the
                            least, asked the parties whether they wished to cross-examine each
                            other’s expert on the new opinions submitted before [he]
                            proceeded to issue the Third Award. The 2005 Procedural Order [<em>viz</em>, the procedural order by the Arbitrator
                            dated 20 September 2005 directing, in essence, that the four
                            questions set out in the quotation at [15] above were to be dealt with
                            by cross-examination of the parties’ expert
                                witnesses],<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> the [Arbitrator’s] insistence on cross-examination
                            in the 28 September 2005 letter, and the vigorous
                            cross-examination of the experts that had previously taken place would
                            have combined to create an expectation that new expert evidence would
                            not be accepted or rejected without giving the experts the opportunity
                            to defend their views on cross-examination. [Prima] put in an argument
                            that, by this stage, the [A]rbitration was akin to a documents-only
                            arbitration. I cannot accept that argument. There was a great deal of
                            correspondence (in fact, far too much), but that did not change the
                            essential nature of the Arbitration especially as [Kempinski] kept
                            emphasising its desire to proceed to a hearing on the facts and to
                            cross-examine the factual witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">97    One of the requirements for an award to be set aside on the ground of
                            breach of natural justice is that such breach must cause prejudice to
                            the rights of the party challenging the award. In this case, in one
                            sense, the breach caused prejudice to [Kempinski’s] rights
                            because the Arbitrator in the Third Award rejected Prof Darus’
                            opinions in relation to this issue: he considered that they conflicted
                            with evidence that she had previously given and that he had accepted.
                            Prof Darus was not given the opportunity to even attempt to
                            reconcile the apparent conflict between her previous and her current
                            evidence. Nor was [Kempinski] able to attempt, by cross-examination, to
                            wring any concessions from Mr Tumbuan on his conflicting
                            opinion. <em>On the other hand, since the breach occurred
                                in the context of an award that was outside the submission to
                                arbitration, even if cross-examination had been allowed the award
                                would still have been invalid.</em> The parties in fact saved
                            costs by not conducting cross-examination. On balance, therefore, I hold
                            that in the circumstances the failure to invite parties to cross-examine
                            each other’s experts could not have prejudiced their
                            rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Kempinski’s argument before us is that the Judge’s finding
                    was that because the New Management Contract was not within the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration, the Arbitrator’s failure
                    to allow it (Kempinski) to cross-examine Prima’s expert witness on the
                    legal effect of that contract did not cause it any prejudice. Hence, Kempinski
                    submits, if this court were to disagree with the Judge and find that the legal
                    effect of the New Management Contract was within the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration, then it must follow that the lack
                    of cross-examination of Prima’s expert witness on this issue had
                    resulted in a violation of Kempinski’s right to be heard and,
                    consequently, Kempinski had suffered prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In our view, Kempinski’s interpretation of the Judge’s
                    reasoning as to why the lack of cross-examination of Prima’s expert
                    witness on the legal effect of the New Management Contract had not caused it
                    (Kempinski) any prejudice (and had in fact saved it some expense) is correct.
                    However, Kempinski’s conclusion that if this court were to hold that
                    the legal effect of the New Management Contract was within the scope of the
                    parties’ submission to arbitration (which is what we have held at [52]
                    above), then it must have suffered prejudice by having been deprived of the
                    right to cross-examine Prima’s expert witness on this point does not
                    necessarily follow. This is because, first, both parties’ expert
                    witnesses had submitted their written opinion evidence on the legal effect of
                    the New Management Contract pursuant to the Arbitrator’s request in
                    his e-mail to the parties dated 17 March 2008 (“the
                    Arbitrator’s 17 March 2008 e-mail”) (see [64]
                    below). Second, there is nothing on record which showed that Kempinski had
                    requested and the Arbitrator had refused to allow Kempinski to cross-examine
                    Prima’s expert witness on the legal effect of the New Management
                    Contract in relation to, specifically, the question set out in the
                    Arbitrator’s 17 March 2008 e-mail. In the circumstances,
                    Rule 22.1 of the SIAC Rules (1997 Ed), in so far as it
                    mandates that “[u]nless the parties have agreed on documents-only
                    arbitration, the Tribunal shall, <em>if either party so
                        requests</em>, hold a hearing for the presentation of evidence by
                    witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for oral submissions”
                    [emphasis added], does not assist Kempinski. Third, even if Kempinski had indeed
                    requested to cross-examine Prima’s expert witness on the issue raised
                    in the Arbitrator’s 17 March 2008 e-mail but had been turned
                    down, it is now too late for Kempinski to complain about the
                    Arbitrator’s failure to allow such cross-examination since Kempinski
                    had not raised any objection when its request was turned down, but had instead
                    tendered two written opinions on the aforesaid issue. In this regard,
                    Rule 34.1 of the SIAC Rules (1997 Ed) provides that a party is
                    deemed to have waived its right to object to any non-compliance with these Rules
                    if it knows that any provision of or requirement under these Rules has not been
                    complied with, and yet proceeds with the arbitration without promptly stating
                    its objection. In our view, Kempinski’s argument that it had been
                    denied the right to be heard, in terms of having been denied the opportunity to
                    cross-examine Prima’s expert witness on the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract (especially in relation to the issue raised in the
                    Arbitrator’s 17 March 2008 e-mail), is nothing more than a
                    veiled attempt to introduce by the backdoor an objection which it has been
                    deemed to have waived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The crucial question <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    Kempinski’s complaint that it had been denied the right to be heard
                    before the Third Award was made is whether each party was given the opportunity
                    to submit its expert witness’s written opinion evidence on the legal
                    effect of the New Management Contract, especially in relation to the question
                    set out in the Arbitrator’s 17 March 2008 e-mail, before the
                    Third Award was made. The question that was put to the parties in the
                    Arbitrator’s 17 March 2008 e-mail was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The opinions should be submitted by 4th April, 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Kempinski submitted the opinion of its legal expert, Prof Darus, on
                    25 April 2008, and Prima submitted the opinion of its legal expert,
                    Mr Tumbuan, on 29 April 2008. Thereafter, Kempinski submitted
                    Prof Darus’ supplementary opinion on 5 May 2008. The
                    Arbitrator rejected Prof Darus’ opinion of 25 April
                    2008 that Kempinski’s entry into the New Management Contract was
                    “legally irrelevant under Indonesian law and ha[d] no effect on the

                    “a change of opinion that ha[d] been given several times over by

                    that even if the Management Contract were indeed valid (<em>ie</em>, even if it were indeed not illegal <em>per
                        se</em> as the Arbitrator had held in the First Award), it nonetheless
                    ended when Kempinski entered into the New Management Contract on
                    28 April 2006 because Kempinski’s conduct in doing so was in
                    breach of Art 21 of the Management Contract, read with
                    Art 22.5 thereof (we note here that Mr Tumbuan actually
                    referred to Art 22.6 of the Management Contract in his opinion, but
                    that was probably an inadvertent error on his part as it is Art 22.5
                    which contains the <em>force majeure</em> clause). The
                    Arbitrator accepted Mr Tumbuan’s opinion and concluded that
                    the New Management Contract was “inconsistent with the obligations
                    [of Kempinski] under the [Management] [C]ontract”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> thereby making it impossible for Kempinski, after 28 April
                    2006, to perform the Management Contract by any of the three methods that
                    remained open after the Three Decisions were announced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Given that the parties clearly had the opportunity to present to the
                    Arbitrator their respective expert witnesses’ written opinions on the
                    legal effect of the New Management Contract, and given that the Arbitrator gave
                    careful consideration to all the written opinions, there is absolutely no merit
                    in Kempinski’s complaint that it had been denied the right to be heard
                    before the Third Award was made. In any event, having regard to the terms of the
                    exclusivity clause in Art 21 of the Management Contract, it is our view
                    that any cross-examination of Mr Tumbuan on the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract could not possibly have reconciled Kempinski’s
                    obligations under the two contracts. Clearly, as opined by Mr Tumbuan,
                    in entering into the New Management Contract, Kempinski had made it impossible
                    for itself, after 28 April 2006, to perform its obligations under the
                    Management Contract in any of the three ways that remained possible after the
                    Three Decisions were announced. Article 21 of the Management Contract
                    provided as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the Term of the [Management] Contract [Kempinski] shall not be
                        permitted to own and/or operate another Kempinski Hotel within Indonesia
                        without [the] prior written consent of [Prima], such consent not to be
                        unreasonably withheld. [Kempinski] shall use its best endeavours to enable
                        [Prima] to participate in any other Kempinski project in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By entering into the New Management Contract without the knowledge of Prima,
                    Kempinski did precisely what it was not allowed to do under Art 21 of
                    the Management Contract. Hence, after entering into the New Management Contract,
                    Kempinski was not in any position to perform its obligations to Prima under the
                    Management Contract by any of the three methods that were theoretically
                    available to it after the Three Decisions came into effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     We should add that although the Judge held that the Arbitrator’s
                    procedural order dated 20 September 2005, which directed (in essence)
                    that the four questions set out in the quotation at [15] above were to be dealt
                    with by cross-examination of the parties’ expert
                        witnesses,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> had created an expectation on Kempinski’s part that
                    cross-examination of the expert witnesses would be permitted for the entire
                    duration of the Arbitration (see [96] of the Judgment (quoted at [61] above)),
                    this finding is not strictly correct because that procedural order had been
                    given specifically with respect to the four above-mentioned questions. That was
                    why the Arbitrator did not seek the views of the parties on whether
                    cross-examination of the expert witnesses on the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract should be allowed. Furthermore, any expectation of
                    cross-examination of the expert witnesses on the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract was negated by the Arbitrator’s correspondence
                    with the parties. This can be seen from his e-mail to the parties dated
                    14 September 2007, in which he wrote (after referring to
                    Kempinski’s failure to comply with the directions given at the April
                    2007 Directions Conference (see [16] above)):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of the above, the [Arbitrator] invites the parties to address
                        the [Arbitrator] as to the disposition of the dispute. <b><em>It is not necessary to hear expert evidence as the law has now been

<p class="Judg-1">In a similar vein, in his e-mail dated 14 December 2007, the

                            of the performance of the [Management] [C]ontract in the three methods
                            that were indicated in the [Second Award]. These three methods were
                            identified after expert evidence. The experts also indicated views on
                            how the three methods would work. <em>This dispenses with
                                the need for further expert testimony on the particular

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    … [A] holding that the [N]ew [Management] [C]ontract closes
                            the possibility of performance [of the Management Contract] in any of
                            the three ways left seems inevitable. It has not been disclosed when the
                            negotiations for the [N]ew [Management Contract] began. But it is
                            evident that on or before 28<sup>th</sup> April
                            2006, the three possibilities of performance [of the Management
                            Contract] ceased. The result is arrived at on the basis of existing
                            expert evidence. [Kempinski] disputes this conclusion. To do so
                            effectively, it must be demonstrated that the three ways of performance
                                <em>are still possible, despite the [N]ew

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We thus find no merit in Kempinski’s complaint that it had been
                    denied the right to be heard (in terms of having been denied the right to
                    cross-examine Prima’s expert witness on the legal effect of the New
                    Management Contract) before the Third Award was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our ruling on CA 98</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     For the above reasons, we reject Kempinski’s arguments in
                    CA 98 and thus dismiss this appeal. We now turn to
                    CA 96.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CA 96</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Before we consider the correctness of the Fourth Award, which is the subject
                    matter of CA 96, we note that it was issued on 20 October 2008
                    and that Kempinski’s application in OS 121 to set it aside
                    was filed on 29 January 2009, which was more than three months after
                    the award was issued. However, no issue of time bar arises as the Fourth Award
                    was only received by Kempinski on 30 October 2008, and, thus, the
                    filing of OS 121 on 29 January 2009 was within
                    “three months … from the date on which [Kempinski]
                    … received the award” as stipulated in Art 34(3)
                    of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In the court below, Prima argued that even if the Third Award were set aside,
                    the Fourth Award could stand on its own. The Judge rejected this argument and
                    instead accepted Kempinski’s contention that if the Third Award were
                    set aside, then the Fourth Award must also be set aside. She reasoned that (at
                    [113] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he [Arbitrator’s] finding [in the Fourth Award]
                        that an award of damages would be contrary to public policy was based on his
                        earlier finding that the [Management] Contract was in violation of the Three
                        Decisions and the opinion that no effort appeared to have been made to
                        effect the changes that would have made performance lawful (at
                        para 62 of the Fourth Award). This opinion was not based on any
                        pleaded case nor had evidence been admitted in relation to this issue. The
                        Fourth Award must therefore be set aside as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We note that in making the above point, the Judge did not specify which
                    country’s public policy she was referring to. It is, however, clear
                    from the Fourth Award that the Arbitrator was referring to the public policy of
                    Indonesia (and not that of Singapore).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the present case, Kempinski did not deny that after the Three Decisions
                    came into effect, it could not lawfully perform its obligations under the
                    Management Contract except by one of the three methods set out at [14] above.
                    This was the opinion of Prof Darus, its own expert. Kempinski chose not
                    to and did not address the Arbitrator on the question of whether, in the event
                    that it succeeded against Prima on the issue of liability, any damages were
                    payable to it for the Intervening Period. On Prima’s part, it said
                    that that question did not arise at all, reiterating its original view that the
                    Management Contract had already ended by operation of law by, at the latest,
                    3 May 2001, one year after the date on which the last of the Three
                    Decisions was issued. Prima also argued that in any event, awarding damages to
                    Kempinski for the Intervening Period would be offensive to the public policy of
                    Indonesia. In our view, public policy is a question of law which an arbitrator
                    must take cognisance of if he becomes aware of it in the course of hearing the
                    evidence presented during arbitral proceedings. As noted in Gary
                    B Born, <em>International Commercial
                        Arbitration</em> (Kluwer Law International, 2009) at vol 1,
                    p 835:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding the importance of party autonomy in international
                        arbitration, and the tribunal’s mandate to resolve those disputes

                        tribunal’s judicial mandate is to resolve the disputes that are
                        submitted to it in accordance with applicable law – including
                        applicable mandatory law – and to render an award on such matters
                        that is binding and enforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Where the parties’ contract raises issues of

                            necessarily include consideration of those issues insofar as they would
                            affect its decision or the enforceability of its award.</em>
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, the Judge erred in setting aside the Fourth Award on the basis that
                    the public policy point “was not based on any pleaded
                    case” (see the Judgment at [113]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     We further note that even though after 3 May 2000 (the date on which
                    the last of the Three Decisions was issued), Kempinski purported to continue to
                    manage the Hotel until Prima terminated the Management Contract on
                    6 February 2002 and removed Kempinski’s nominated general
                    manager from the premises, and even though Prima explicitly endorsed
                    Kempinski’s performance of the Management Contract during that period
                    by remunerating Kempinski for it, the fact remains that Kempinski’s
                    performance of the Management Contract during that period was nevertheless an
                    unlawful mode of performance. Arguably, Kempinski’s unlawful
                    performance would have continued after 6 February 2002 as no visible
                    efforts were made by Kempinski to make the changes that were necessary to render
                    its performance of the Management Contract lawful (<em>ie</em>, in conformity with the requirements of the Three Decisions).
                    In the circumstances, any award of damages in Kempinski’s favour for
                    the Intervening Period would be tantamount to sanctioning a violation of a
                    prohibition imposed by law (specifically, by the Three Decisions). As noted in
                    Chan Leng Sun, <em>Singapore Law on Arbitral Awards</em>
                    (Academy Publishing, 2011) at para 6.152 in a section discussing the
                    setting aside of arbitral awards on the ground of
                    “arbitrability/public policy” (quoting from
                    Michael J Mustill &amp; Stewart C Boyd,
                        <em>Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in
                        England</em> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1989) at

<em>The types of remedies which an arbitrator can award are

                        that he is appointed by the parties and not by the state. For example, he
                        cannot impose a fine or a term of imprisonment, commit a person for contempt
                        or issue a writ of subpoena; <em>nor can he make an award
                            which is binding on third parties or affects the public at

                        land, a divorce decree, a winding-up order … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Therefore, in our view, the Arbitrator was correct in holding in the Fourth
                    Award that he had no power to award any damages to Kempinski for the Intervening
                    Period as doing so would have been contrary to the public policy of
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     For the above reasons, even if the Third Award were indeed invalid, the Fourth
                    Award should not have been set aside. Contrary to the Judge’s view,
                    the validity of the Fourth Award did not depend on the validity of the Third
                    Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CA 94</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As we have allowed Prima’s appeals in respect of the Third Award and
                    the Fourth Award in CA 95 and CA 96 respectively, its appeal
                    in CA 94 in respect of the Costs Award (which relates, <em>inter alia</em>, to the costs of the proceedings leading to
                    the Third Award and the Fourth Award) is also allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Removal of the Arbitrator and remission to a freshly-constituted
                arbitral tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the court below, the Judge, after setting aside the Three Awards, remitted
                    the Arbitration back to the Arbitrator as she found no reason to order the
                    Arbitrator to be removed and the Arbitration to continue before a
                    freshly-constituted arbitral tribunal. In view of our decisions, we agree that
                    there is no basis to consider Kempinski’s request for the Arbitrator
                    to be removed. Accordingly, the Arbitrator will now have to decide how to
                    proceed further with the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In the result, we allow Prima’s appeals in CA 94, 95 and
                    96, and dismiss Kempinski’s cross-appeal in CA 98.
                    Accordingly, we reinstate each of the Three Awards and order that the costs of
                    these appeals and the proceedings below be paid by Kempinski, with the usual
                    consequential orders to apply.</p>
