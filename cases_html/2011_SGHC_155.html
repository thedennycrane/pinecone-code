<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application to set aside an
                    arbitration award on the ground that the award is in conflict with the public
                    policy of Singapore as expressed and embodied in the Securities and Futures Act
                    (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SFA”) and the subsidiary legislation
                    thereunder, namely the Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of
                    Business) Regulations 2002 (Cap 289, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Regulations”) and is thus in breach of Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the United
                    Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) Model
                    Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”)
                    which has been made a part of Singapore law by the International Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The originating summons contained a second
                    ground but at the hearing that was not proceeded with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff (“the Client”), the
                    respondent in the arbitration, is a company incorporated in Australia. The
                    defendant (“the Advisor”), the claimant in the arbitration, is a
                    Singapore company that carries on the business of giving corporate finance
                    advice including in relation to mergers, acquisitions and
                restructuring.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 31 July 2007, the Client and the Advisor
                    entered into a Consultancy Service Engagement Agreement (“the
                    Agreement”). At that time, the Client was listed on the Australian
                    Exchange (“ASX”) and the purpose of the Agreement was, as stated
                    by Mr Nigel Jones (“Mr Jones”), the Advisor’s managing
                    director, to secure a Singapore listing for the Client through either a reverse
                    take-over in Singapore (“Singapore RTO”) or an initial public
                    offering (“IPO”) on the Singapore Stock Exchange
                    (“SGX”) and thereafter to generate additional shareholder value by
                    the possible sale of the listed ASX shell company through a reverse takeover in
                    Australia (“Australia RTO”). The Advisor’s role was to
                    advise the Client on and manage its corporate exercise in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Clause 3 of the Agreement provided that the
                    Client would pay the Advisor the sum of $10,000 per month for the services of
                    the Advisor. The Advisor duly provided its services from August 2007 to April
                    2008 and rendered the Client monthly invoices for the same. The Client paid the
                    invoices for the months of August and September 2007 in full and paid half of
                    the invoice for the month of October 2007. The total paid was $25,000 leaving an
                    amount of $65,000 outstanding as at May 2008. The Agreement was terminated at
                    the end of April 2008 by the Client.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Clause 12 of the Agreement provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Applicable law and dispute resolution</u></b>. The
                        governing law of this Agreement shall be the substantive law of Singapore.
                        Any claim or controversy arising out of this Agreement including any
                        question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred
                        to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the
                        Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
                        (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force which rules are
                        deemed to be incorporated by reference to this Clause. The Tribunal shall
                        consist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed by the Chairman of SIAC. The
                        language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Advisor submitted a Notice of Arbitration on
                    3 July 2009 to recover the amounts due to it. On 10 September 2009, the Chairman
                    of the SIAC confirmed the appointment of Mr Nicholas Stone (“the
                    Arbitrator”) as the sole arbitrator for the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The hearing of the arbitration proceedings took
                    place in Singapore in April 2010 and submissions were completed in June 2010. By
                    the award dated 31 August 2010 (“the Award”), the Arbitrator
                    awarded and ordered that the Client was to pay the Advisor $73,368 in respect of
                    unpaid invoices and interest thereon calculated up to 31 August 2010. He also
                    ordered the Client to pay various sums as legal costs, disbursements and costs
                    of the arbitration. All other reliefs claimed in the arbitration by either party
                    were rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues and decision in the Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Advisor’s claim in the arbitration was
                    straight forward. It claimed the balance amount of $65,000 in respect of the
                    unpaid invoices and a further sum of $11,225 for interest. In its statement of
                    defence, the Client rejected liability on four grounds but, at the hearing, it
                    abandoned two grounds. Consequently, the Arbitrator had to consider only the
                    following defences:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     the assertion that the Agreement was
                        void for illegality; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     the assertion that the Advisor lacked the legal capacity
                        to enter into the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Client also mounted a
                    counterclaim by which it sought restitution of the sum of $25,000 paid to the
                    Advisor, and interest thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Client’s defence was based on the
                    provisions of the SFA. This statute regulates the conduct of business involving
                    the provision of capital market services. Generally speaking, persons who
                    provide capital market services in Singapore need to be licensed under Part IV
                    of the SFA. There is, however, provision for exemption from the licensing
                    requirements provided that certain criteria are met and the business is carried
                    on in a certain way. It was the Advisor’s position that it carried on
                    business as an exempt financial advisor and therefore did not need a capital
                    market services licence. The Client’s contention was that by entering into
                    and performing the Agreement, the Advisor was operating outside the exemptions
                    to which it was subject with the result that the Agreement was void through
                    illegality and/or lack of capacity of the Advisor to enter into it. The specific
                    contentions that the Client made were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Client did not qualify as a
                        “accredited investor” under cl 7 of the Second Schedule
                        of the Regulations; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     the advice given by the Advisor did not meet the
                        criterion that it had to be “advice [that] is not specifically given
                        for the making of any offer of securities to the public by the accredited
                        investor to whom the advice was given”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Arbitrator found against the Client on
                    both counts. First, in relation to the “accredited investor”
                    issue, the Arbitrator noted that under s 4A(1)(a)(ii) of the SFA, the term means
                    a corporation with net assets exceeding $10m as determined by the most recent
                    audited balance sheet of the corporation. He stated that it was not disputed
                    that at the time the Agreement was entered into, namely 31 July 2007, the
                    audited balance sheet contained in the Client’s Financial Report as at 31
                    December 2006 was the most recent audited balance sheet of the Client available
                    in the public domain. This showed the Client’s net assets as being
                    A$9,331,000 which at the time was in excess of $10m. The Client argued that the
                    audited accounts for the period ending 30 June 2007 which showed a net asset
                    balance of less than $10m were available at the time the Agreement was entered
                    into. The Arbitrator found that no evidence had been produced by the Client to
                    substantiate its assertion that these accounts were available but the Advisor
                    had not asked for them. He found that the balance sheet of 31 December 2006 was
                    the most recent audited balance sheet of the Client in accordance with the terms
                    of s 4(a)(1)(ii)(A) and, whilst the 30 June 2007 accounts may have been in
                    the course of preparation, that did not meet the statutory definition.
                    Accordingly, the Client was an “accredited investor” when the
                    Agreement was concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the second issue, the Client had argued
                    that the primary purpose of the rendering of the services by the Advisor under
                    the Agreement was the raising of funds by the Client by making an offer of
                    securities to the public and therefore the Advisor could not provide the
                    services under the exemption set out in cl 7(1)(b) of the Second Schedule
                    of the Regulations. The Advisor’s stand was that the corporate exercise
                    contemplated in the Agreement and the advice that was given by the Advisor
                    involved a range of options and therefore was not specifically given for the
                    making of any offer of securities to the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Arbitrator noted that the second paragraph
                    of cl 2 of the Agreement limited the services to be provided by the Advisor and
                    specifically envisaged that if in the future there was to be an IPO or a
                    Singaporean or Australian RTO, other professional advisors would be appointed to
                    deal with these matters. The Arbitrator also considered that the deal structures
                    contemplated in the Agreement appeared to fall under the exemptions contained in
                    cl 7(1)(c) rather than cl 7(1)(b) of the Second Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After reviewing the evidence, the Arbitrator
                    found that the advice given by the Advisor to the Client was not specifically
                    given for the making of any offer of securities to the public and therefore did
                    not fall outside the exemption contained in cl 7(1)(b)(i) or that in cl
                    7(1)(c)(i). He also found the scope of services contemplated in the Agreement
                    would fall within the exemption set out in cl 7(1)(c).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Clause 7(1)(d) of the Second Schedule of the
                    Regulations provides that a person is exempted from the requirement to hold a
                    capital market services licence if he carries on business in giving advice to
                    another person concerning compliance with or in respect of any laws or
                    regulatory requirements related to the raising of funds not involving any
                    securities. Before the Arbitrator, the Advisor had claimed to be such a person.
                    It said that the advice it gave to the Client related to compliance with local
                    rules and regulations and that it also gave advice in respect of a take-over
                    which would have involved the issuance of shares in the Client to a Chinese
                    company’s principal shareholder. However, this advice on the issuance of
                    securities was not given to the public. Further, the Advisor did not require a
                    licence to provide services under cl 7(1)(d) as the Agreement clearly provided
                    that if securities were to be offered, the Client would have to engage other
                    professionals for that purpose. The Arbitrator agreed with the Advisor and found
                    the advice given did not fall outside the exemption provided by cl 7(1)(d). If
                    the Agreement had come to fruition and funds were to be raised either by reverse
                    take-over or initial public offering, the Agreement expressly provided that
                    other professionals would be engaged for the purpose of issuing securities to
                    raise funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is common ground that the arbitration
                    proceedings at issue in this case were subject to the provisions of the Act. The
                    Act and the Model Law do not permit appeals against arbitration awards. Instead,
                    they provide certain limited grounds on which dissatisfied parties may apply to
                    set aside an arbitration award. Under Art 34(2)(b) of the Model Law as
                    implemented by the Act, an award may be set aside if the court finds that it is
                    in conflict with the public policy of Singapore. In <em>PT
                        Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R)
                    597, the Court of Appeal gave valuable guidance on the situations in which an
                    award might be found to be in conflict with the public policy of Singapore. It
                    said at [59]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the concept of public policy of the State is not defined in the
                        Act or the Model Law, the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion
                        is that public policy under the Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view,
                        it should only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award
                        would “shock the conscience” ... or is “clearly
                        injurious to the public good or ... wholly offensive to the ordinary
                        reasonable and fully informed member of the public” ... or where it
                        violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice ...
                        This would be consistent with the concept of public policy that can be
                        ascertained from the preparatory materials to the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present case, the Client’s
                    contention is that the Award offends the public policy of Singapore because it
                    upholds an illegal contract. The extent to which illegality can found a
                    challenge to an award was considered by Chan Seng Onn J in <em>AJT v AJU</em> [2010] 4 SLR 649. He stated at [15] and [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    Thus, in order for
                            [AJT] to succeed in setting aside the Award on the ground that upholding
                            the Award would be in conflict with the public policy of Singapore, it
                            has to establish, first, that the Tribunal decided erroneously on the
                            issue of illegality of the Concluding Agreement. Next, it has to show
                            that the error was of such a nature that enforcement of the Award would
                            “shock the conscience,” be “clearly injurious to
                            the public good” or would contravene “fundamental notions
                            and principles of
                            justice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    In
                            determining whether the Tribunal decided correctly on the issue of
                            illegality of the Concluding Agreement, the approach of the Court in
                            exercising its supervisory jurisdiction has to be borne in mind. In
                            Robert Merkin and Johanna Hjalmarsson, <em>Singapore
                                Arbitration Legislation</em> Annotated. (London Informa, 2009)
                            the authors stated the following at p 75:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The mere fact that an award contains an error of law is not enough.
                            The cases recognise public policy issues in the following
                            situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    [T]he award is tainted by illegality. If the
                                arbitrators have jurisdiction under the arbitration clause to
                                determine the legality of the underlying contract, and have
                                concluded that the contract is valid under its applicable law, the
                                award is generally enforceable ... Equally, if the arbitrators have
                                ignored ‘palpable and indisputable illegality’ the award
                                will not be enforced. By contrast, if illegality under the
                                applicable law has not been raised before the arbitrators, the court
                                may consider whether the underlying contract was illegal under its
                                applicable law although the presumption is in favour of
                                enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Chan J also considered that the court has the
                    inherent jurisdiction to reconsider the issue of illegality although the
                    arbitral tribunal may have determined that the contract in question was not
                    illegal. At [24], Chan J held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus, on the facts of this present case, while the Tribunal determined
                        that the Concluding Agreement was not illegal, this was not conclusive. In
                        an appropriate case, the court, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction,
                        may examine the facts of the case and decide the issue of illegality. While
                        there is a need to uphold the public interest in ensuring the finality of
                        arbitral awards, the court must also safeguard the countervailing public
                        interest in ensuring that its processes are not abused by litigants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     From the above authorities, it appears that I
                    must first determine whether the Arbitrator came to an erroneous conclusion on
                    the issues relating to illegality under the SFA. If he did, I would have to
                    determine whether the illegality was of such a nature that to enforce the Award
                    would conflict with the public policy of Singapore. In deciding the issue of
                    illegality, I have the power to examine the facts of the case
                afresh.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The submissions made on behalf of the Client</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Aqbal Singh, counsel for the Client, took
                    me through the evidence in the arbitration proceedings in some detail in order
                    to establish the illegality he complained of. Dealing first with the Agreement,
                    he pointed out that it had several references to an IPO in Singapore. First,
                    under cl I of the Introduction, the Client had stated that it wished to
                    consider certain corporate exercises which might lead it to pursuing its own IPO
                    on SGX. In cl II, it was provided that one of the ways in which the
                    Advisor’s assignment would conclude would be with the accomplishment of a
                    successful IPO on SGX. He noted also that the Agreement stated that the Advisor
                    would not be required to provide legal, tax, independent financial advice
                    (“IFA”) or other specialist services and that it envisaged that
                    the Advisor would assist the Client in appointing such additional professional
                    advisors if necessary. The Agreement specifically stated that in the event of an
                    IPO, a Singapore underwriter and Australian IFA would be required. However,
                    counsel submitted, this exclusion left untouched the area of advising generally
                    on the strategy and technique for an IPO. In addition to the $10,000 monthly
                    fee, the Agreement also provided for different levels of success fee depending
                    on what corporate exercise was eventually achieved. If a Singapore IPO was
                    undertaken, the success fee payable for successful listing would be
                    $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Client’s case was that from day one,
                    the Advisor plunged into advising on an IPO in Singapore. The Advisor did not
                    say that it could not give such advice. The Arbitrator had noted at para 36 of
                    the Award that the Advisor’s own account of the work it had done for the
                    Client had the following in respect of the month of August 2007:</p>

                        [Client’s] CEO to review the [Client’s] financial status and
                        eligibility for an IPO in Singapore. The [Client] advised the [Advisor] that
                        it was in discussions to acquire a business in China [this is what the
                        parties referred to as the “Anheal deal”] and that a Singapore
                        listing would be integral to securing the necessary funding to acquire the
                        business. Further, the Chinese acquisition would provide the [Client] with
                        the necessary profitability to meet the Singapore SGX listing
                        criteria.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Client’s managing director, Mr Jones, had in his witness
                    statement for the arbitration, stated that on 12 August 2007, there had been a
                    discussion of the Client’s corporate strategy and this included assessing
                    the pros and cons of securing an SGX listing by way of a Singapore IPO or RTO.
                    Mr Jones had also confirmed the various events that had taken place during the
                    currency of the Agreement. The summary of this account provided to the
                    Arbitrator, included preparing a memorandum in October 2007 giving an initial
                    analysis of the China acquisition, and meeting, together with the Client’s
                    chief executive officer, with a number of Singapore broking firms to discuss the
                    potential for listing the Client on the new SGX Catalist market that was due to
                    be launched in 2008. Then, in November and December 2007, there were further
                    enquiries with the Singapore IPO brokers about the listing rules for the new SGX
                    Catalist market. In February 2008, the Advisor made a presentation to the
                    Client’s board of directors which included updating findings on the
                    potential to move the listing to the SGX Catalist board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Aqbal Singh (“Mr Singh”)
                    submitted that the IPO in Singapore was very important and this is what the
                    advice was required for. He pointed to the management discussion note dated 12
                    August 2007 which contained a whole section entitled “Moving the
                    listing” which dealt with listing on SGX. Then, in a presentation which
                    the Advisor gave to the Client’s board on 17 August 2007, the Advisor
                    discussed the benefits of the Anheal deal and also discussed the various options
                    available to the Client including primary listing on SGX, secondary listing on
                    SGX and dual listing on SGX and ASX. These options were discussed in some
                    detail. Counsel submitted that Singapore IPO advice was constantly reiterated
                    during this presentation and it was inseparable from all the other advice
                    given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There was considerable e-mail correspondence
                    passing between the Client and the Advisor during the currency of the Agreement.
                    Many of these e-mails referred to possible listing plans. In one dated 24 August
                    2007, sent out by one of the officers of the Client, two employees of the
                    Advisor were introduced to a third party as having been engaged by the Client
                    for “funding and listing plans in Singapore”. In an e-mail from Mr
                    Jones sent on 5 December 2007, he asked the Client whether the Advisor should
                    review the Catalist market during its wait for some financial documents from
                    Anheal. In his response the same day, Dr Tan Sze Wee of the Client agreed to the
                    review of the Catalist market and mentioned a firm that was willing to be the
                    Client’s sponsor for a Catalist listing. He also said “We’re
                    aiming for listing sometime in late second quarter or early third quarter next
                    year, so ... we’re not the first few to go out”. In an e-mail to a
                    third person on the preparation of pre-IPO reports, dated 16 January 2008, Dr
                    Tan mentioned the possibility of the Client’s IPO being pushed to
                        “3<sup>rd</sup> quarter 2008 due to the volatility in
                    the market and the clarity of the Catalist sector”. In the same e-mail
                    Dr Tan informed the recipient that he had copied Mr Jones in the e-mail
                    since the latter was the Client’s financial advisor and would get back to
                    the recipient “with further details on [their] listing
                    plans”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Counsel also drew my attention to a
                    presentation which the Advisor had made to the Client sometime in February 2008.
                    Part of the presentation was entitled “Related issues – the listing
                    domain” and dealt with a possible listing on Catalist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Singh emphasised that the evidence of the
                    Advisor itself was crucially important as showing the work that it had done. In
                    this regard, matters were encapsulated in paras 30 and 31 of Mr Jones’
                    witness statement which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    The Agreement very clearly states that ‘[the
                            Client] wishes to consider and review certain corporate exercises which
                            may include either the sale of its business through a Reverse Take-Over
                            in Singapore (“Singapore RTO”) or pursue its own public
                            offer (“IPO”) on the Singapore Stock Exchange
                            (“SGX”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31.    The purport and intention of the [Client] as set
                            out above were very clear in that the [Client] had engaged the [Advisor]
                            to advise the [Client] on the possibility of either a sale of the
                            [Client’s] business through a RTO or an IPO in Singapore. The
                            various presentations, e-mails and notes to the [Client] are all in
                            relation to this aim. From the first meetings with the Singapore
                            stockbroking firms it was clear that the [Client’s] business was
                            too small for a Singapore listing. Accordingly, the [Advisor] was
                            instructed by the [Client’s] CEO (and later confirmed during the
                            Board Meeting in August, 2007) to expedite the Anheal acquisition to
                            give the [Client] the necessary critical size for the SGX
                            listing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Singh submitted that the evidence clearly
                    showed that the advice given by the Advisor to the Client was specifically given
                    for the purpose of a listing in Singapore and therefore was outside the scope of
                    the exemption given to the Advisor. According to the dictionary definition, the
                    word “specific” means “express” or
                    “precise”. It does not mean “only limited to”. In
                    Mr Singh’s submission, the Arbitrator had wrongly interpreted
                    the word “specific” as meaning “exclusive” and that
                    wrong interpretation had led to his erroneous conclusion that the Agreement was
                    not illegal under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It was common ground both in the arbitration
                    and before me that the Advisor’s business was to give advice on corporate
                    finance and that therefore unless it was exempted under s 99 of the SFA, it
                    required a capital markets services licence to carry on such activity. The
                    Advisor’s position was that it was so exempt because it and the advice it
                    gave fell within cl 7(1)(b), or cl 7(1)(c) or cl 7(1)(d). The question
                    before me was whether the Arbitrator had wrongly interpreted cll 7(1)(b) and
                    (1)(c) in relation to the activities of the Advisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The difference between cll 7(1)(b) and (1)(c)
                    is that the first relates to a person who gives advice on corporate finance to
                    accredited investors whilst the second relates to a person who advises another
                    person concerning any arrangement, reconstruction or takeover of any corporation
                    or any of the corporation’s assets or liabilities. There are other
                    conditions to be met which are common to both categories but for present
                    purposes, the important one is that the advice given under sub-cl (b) and sub-cl
                    (c) must in both cases not be “specifically given for the making of any
                    offer of securities to the public”. As can be seen from my summary of the
                    Client’s submissions, the Client did not challenge the Arbitrator’s
                    finding in the Award that it had been an accredited investor at the time the
                    Agreement was entered into or the basis of the Arbitrator’s further
                    holding that the loss of that status subsequently did not invalidate the
                    Agreement. Therefore, I do not have to deal with that issue. What I have to deal
                    with is whether the advice was “specifically given for the making of any
                    offer of securities to the public”. This is an issue of statutory
                    interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this connection, it is worth noting some of
                    what was said in Parliament on 5 October 2001 when the Securities and Futures
                    Bill (“SF Bill”) came up for its second reading. The Deputy Prime
                    Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong) who was presenting the Bill stated, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Part IV of the SF Bill will require an intermediary to hold only a single
                        licence, known as a Capital Markets Services licence, to conduct one or more
                        regulated activities. These regulated activities will include securities
                        dealing, futures trading, leveraged foreign exchange trading, advising on
                        corporate finance, fund management, securities financing and custodial
                        services for securities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The single licensing regime will reduce both capital and compliance cost,
                        and allow our intermediaries to be competitive across a broader spectrum of
                        financial services.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The SF Bill will provide for licensing exemptions so long as these do not
                        compromise the standard of investor protection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     During the ensuing debate, Mr Sin Boon Ann
                    expressed the hope that the conditions to be set up by the Monetary Authority of
                    Singapore relating to the application process for a capital markets licence
                    could be made easier for the boutique firms comprising ex-bankers and employees
                    of financial institutions providing services in the area of corporate finance
                    because such persons performed a useful function by providing advice and
                    services to small and medium enterprises and to clients who might not have the
                    wherewithal to engage the services of merchant bankers or other financial
                    institutions. In response to that point, BG Lee Hsien Loong said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would just like to address one point which Mr Sin raised, which is the
                        issue of boutique firms or individuals who are small and who want to become
                        market intermediaries. It is not our intention to make it difficult for
                        ex-bankers and employees of financial institutions to start up on their own
                        and enter corporate finance or other activities. So we will have a level
                        playing field. And if they are able to do it and if they have the expertise,
                        I think the framework will enable them to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As can be seen from the foregoing extracts of
                    the debate, one of the aims of the SFA was to protect the investing public
                    whilst at the same time allowing for diversity of service providers in the
                    capital markets services sector by ensuring that there were areas within which
                    boutique firms could operate and reach clients who would find it expensive to
                    engage the services of investment banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is in the light of the foregoing intention
                    that I think the phrase “specifically given for the making of any offer
                    of securities to the public” must be interpreted. It is not enough to
                    concentrate on the meaning of “specifically” without bearing in
                    mind the “public” at whom the offer concerned is to be directed.
                    In this case, the public means the investing public who would purchase
                    securities in a listed company. The dictionary definitions of
                    “specific” given to me by both counsel show that generally it
                    means “clearly defined or identified” or “precise”.
                    Counsel for the Client emphasised that “exclusively” is not one of
                    the meanings of the word. That may be so but it appears to me that the way in
                    which “specifically” is used in the phrase in question does imply
                    a degree of exclusivity in that it implies that the advice must be precisely
                    concerned with or directed to an offer of securities to the public which is
                    imminent or ongoing. Thus, the advice must relate directly to an actual offer to
                    the public. If the purpose of the advice is to put a particular company in such
                    a position that it may qualify to subsequently make an offer of securities to
                    the public, it appears to me that such advice would not be specifically given
                    for the making of any offer of securities to the public even though that may be
                    the ultimate purpose for which the advice is taken. The fact that after the
                    advice is implemented, the company concerned may want, and may thereby be in a
                    position, to initiate steps to make such an offer to the public is in my view
                    not material for the purpose of the interpreting cl 7. The exemptions in cl 7
                    are aimed at insuring that when securities are to be sold to the investing
                    public, for the protection of that public, the persons advising the issuer or
                    seller of the securities are qualified to do so and are not persons who are only
                    exempted from the licensing requirement pursuant to that clause. The
                    Regulations, however, do not stop firms like the Advisor from giving advice to
                    clients to put such clients into a position in which they can subsequently
                    consider whether to implement an actual public offering and to hire suitably
                    qualified professionals to advise them on the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As the legislation was enacted, boutique firms
                    like the Advisor were exempted from holding a capital markets services licence
                    as long as they ensured that the business that they did and the clients they
                    serviced fell within the descriptions in cl 7. The Regulations envisage that
                    among the services to be provided by such boutique firms would be the provision
                    of corporate finance including advice on acquisition of corporations. Such
                    advice must of course include the methodology of financing acquisitions. This
                    could take various forms such as cash or the issue of securities or a
                    combination of the two. In financing an acquisition, however, an offer to the
                    public need not necessarily be involved. In this particular case, an offer to
                    the public was not envisaged in relation to the acquisition of Anheal which was
                    the immediate corporate acquisition on which the Advisor was
                working.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     From an examination of the facts, it is clear
                    that the Client had, as one of its ultimate purposes, a listing on a stock
                    exchange in Singapore. Much of the advice given by the Advisor was directed at
                    considering how the Client could be put into a position such that it would be
                    able to go on to apply for a listing. The Advisor determined that the Client
                    needed to acquire another corporation such as Anheal in order to qualify for a
                    Singapore listing and therefore considered in some detail how this could be
                    achieved. In that connection, advice was given for the issue of securities but
                    the securities would not have been issued to the public at large but rather to
                    the owner of Anheal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr Jones in his evidence was quite categorical
                    that the advice given was corporate finance advice on arrangement,
                    reconstruction and takeover and that the Advisor had at all times carried on
                    business within the bounds permitted by cl 7. He emphasised that to the
                    extent that something needed “to touch the public”
                    <em>ie</em> when advice had to be given for the making of
                    an offer of securities to the public, a Singapore underwriter or Singapore
                    broker had to be employed and that what the Advisor did did not touch the
                    public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     If the phrase “specifically given for
                    the making of any offer of securities to the public” is construed in the
                    manner suggested by counsel for the Client, the result would be to greatly limit
                    the scope of work which could be done without a licence pursuant to cl 7. As it
                    is, cl 7 contains a number of restrictions which must be observed by the
                    corporate advisor and I think it would be wrong to further restrict the scope of
                    the advisor’s activities by reading the phrase in the rather wide manner
                    that counsel has suggested. To so interpret it would increase the costs of small
                    and medium sized firms who are in the initial stages of considering listing and
                    prevent them from conducting the necessary investigatory work with the help of a
                    corporate advisor like the Advisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Notwithstanding the events and advice
                    emphasised by counsel for the Client, it is clear that nothing the Advisor did
                    pertained immediately to the issue of securities in the Client which would be
                    offered to the public. There was advice on what steps had to be taken if the
                    Client wanted an IPO in Singapore but that advice related generally to the
                    matters needed to have a successful IPO and did not directly relate to an
                    immediate or actually impending offer of shares to the public. There was also
                    advice on the issuance of securities but the proposed acquirer of those
                    securities was Anheal’s principal shareholder and that proposal could not,
                    in the context of the Anheal acquisition, be considered a proposal of a public
                    offering. Although the Agreement envisaged an IPO in Singapore as one of the
                    ultimate purposes to be achieved, I am satisfied, as was the Arbitrator, that in
                    implementing the Agreement, the advice given by the Advisor was not specifically
                    given for the making of any offer of securities to the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Further, the Agreement, as the Arbitrator
                    pointed out too, envisaged that if the work that the Advisor did under it
                    resulted in the need or desire to raise funds from the public, other duly
                    qualified professionals would be engaged to run the public offering. I do not
                    accept, as counsel suggested, that this provision was simply for show. In my
                    judgment, it indicates not only that the Advisor was aware of the limitations on
                    its ability to advise but also that it wanted to make it plain to the Client
                    that the Client could not look to it for advisory services relating to a public
                    offering and would have to engage a person who was qualified under the SFA to
                    handle such issue. I accept, as did the Arbitrator, that the Advisor acted
                    within the bounds of the exemptions in cl 7 and that it was not wrong to
                    understand the prohibition against giving advice specifically on an offering of
                    securities to the public as allowing it to give the kind of advice that it did.
                    I also agree with the Arbitrator’s holding that the services provided by
                    the Advisor fell more within the remit of cl 7(1)(c) than of cl 7(1)(b
                ).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For the reasons that I have given, there was
                    no illegality involved in the Agreement or in the way that it was implemented.
                    Accordingly, I do not have to consider the next issue which would have been
                    whether the illegality found was against public policy and would justify the
                    setting aside of the Award. This application must be therefore dismissed with
                    costs.</p>
