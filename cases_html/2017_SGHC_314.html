But to set out the issues before me with more granularity, it is first necessary to consider the statutory scheme of s 199 and the well-established common law principles which are applicable to that section.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 A director has a right at common law to “see and take copies of documents belonging to his company” (<span class="font-italic">Burn v London and South Wales</span><span class="font-italic"> Coal Co and Risca Investment </span>Co (1890) 7 TLR 118 (“<span class="font-italic">Burn</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 118) in order that “he might properly perform his duties” (<span class="font-italic">Conway </span><span class="font-italic">and Others v Petronius Clothing Co</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd and O</span><span class="font-italic">thers </span>[1978] 1 WLR 72 (“<span class="font-italic">Conway</span>”) at 86D-H).

I therefore need not say anything further about the common law right of inspection under Singapore law or about its scope or interaction with the statutory right.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The statutory scheme</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The starting point in understanding a director’s statutory right of inspection is s 199(1) of the Act. This section creates the company’s duty to keep accounting and other records in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Accounting records and systems of control</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">199.</span>—(1) Every company shall cause to be kept such accounting and other records as will sufficiently explain the transactions and financial position of the company and enable true and fair financial statements and any documents required to be attached thereto to be prepared from time to time, and shall cause those records to be kept in such manner as to enable them to be conveniently and properly audited. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As I will show (see [159] below), the phrase “accounting and other records” is a recurring theme throughout the Act and in the case law on s 199. For simplicity, unless the context indicates otherwise, I shall use the word “records” as shorthand for the longer phrase “accounting and other records” within the meaning of s 199(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 A director’s statutory right to inspect a company’s records arises under s 199(3). That section provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The records referred to in subsection (1) shall be kept at the registered office of the company or at such other place as the directors think fit and <span class="font-italic">shall at all times be open to inspection by the directors</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The curious thing about s 199(3) is that it creates a duty without specifying on whom the duty lies or how the duty is to be enforced. That is the result of the following three observations which I make about s 199(3): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the part of s 199(3) which deals with inspection is framed in the passive voice. It therefore does not specify on whom rests the express duty to permit a director to inspect the records. By necessary implication, the duty must, at the very least, lie on the company (<span class="font-italic">Wuu</span> at [25]). It is the company which is, by s 199(1), obliged to keep the records in the first place. It is the company which has property in the records. It is the company which has physical control of the records or, at the very least, <span class="font-italic">de jure</span> and very often also <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> control of the means by which to assert physical control over the records. It is also the company in general meeting, through its supervisory powers over the company’s directors and management, which has the power to make the ultimate decision for the company as to whether to open its records for inspection under s 199(3). The question which then arises is whether s 199(3) by implication imposes an additional personal duty on each director to ensure that the records are open for inspection by the directors at all times. That is a question which I analyse, to the extent necessary to determine this application, at [99] to [123] below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, because s 199(3) expressly creates a duty – imposed at the very least on the company – to keep the company’s records at all times open for the directors to inspect, it must also create a right vested in each director to inspect those records. Every duty – to be a duty in the true sense of the word – must have a correlative right. Looked at in that way, s 199(3) creates by necessary implication a correlative right vested in a director. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, s 199(3) – having conferred a right on a director to inspect a company’s records – does not set out any means by which a director aggrieved by being refused inspection of a company’s records may enforce that right. In particular, s 199(3) does not in terms empower a court to make an order compelling a company to permit an aggrieved director to inspect its records. That omission is particularly stark when s 199(3) is compared to s 199(5).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Section 199(5) expressly empowers the court to order that a public accountant acting for a director be allowed to inspect the records, subject to a confidentiality undertaking:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) The Court may in any particular case order that the accounting and other records of a company be open to inspection by a public accountant acting for a director, but only upon an undertaking in writing given to the Court that information acquired by the public accountant during his inspection shall not be disclosed by him except to that director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I make two observations on s 199(5). First, this is the only subsection of s 199 which gives the court any power to make an order for inspection. It expressly confers upon the court a power to issue an order compelling an inspection of the company’s records by a public accountant acting for a director. This power is a free-standing one in the sense that s 199(5) does not make a breach of any duty under s 199 a prerequisite to the court’s exercise of the power. Second, empowering the court in that way is s 199(5)’s only purpose. It does not create a duty to permit a public accountant to inspect the company’s records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Section 199(3) is thus unlike s 199(5) in two respects: s 199(3) <span class="font-italic">does</span> create a duty to permit inspection but it <span class="font-italic">does not</span> empower the court to enforce that duty by ordering inspection. On the other hand, 199(5) <span class="font-italic">does</span><span class="font-italic"> not</span> create a duty to permit inspection but it <span class="font-italic">does </span>empower the court to order an inspection, albeit by a public accountant acting for a director and not by the director himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Section 199(6) makes it a criminal offence to breach any of the duties under s 199:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) If default is made in complying with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months and also to a default penalty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I make two observations on s 199(6):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the offence under s 199(6) extends to a default in compliance with <span class="font-italic">any</span> subsection of s 199. That encompasses on its face a default under s 199(3) as well as under s 199(1). So within the express scope of the offence under s 199(6) is the situation where a director is able to bring himself within s 199(3) but is not permitted to inspect the company’s records. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, criminal liability under that section is the only express consequence which s 199 provides for a default in complying with the duty to keep the company’s records open for inspection by a director under s 199(3). But a criminal conviction following such a default does not, in itself, secure for the aggrieved director the inspection which he seeks. There is nothing within s 199(3) – or indeed within s 199 itself – which expressly permits an aggrieved director to secure specific civil relief in the event of a breach of s 199(3). In that sense, there appears to be a gap in s 199. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 There is one other aspect of the statutory scheme of s 199 which, confusingly, does not appear in s 199. Section 199(3) in terms allows a director only to <span class="font-italic">inspect</span> the company’s records. It says nothing about <span class="font-italic">taking copies</span>. But the plaintiff – as is very common and entirely understandable – applies in these proceedings for an order that he be permitted not only to inspect the company’s records but also to take copies of them (see [9] above). If the plaintiff is correct that he has a right to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3), he undoubtedly has a concomitant right to take copies of those records. That right is found, not in s 199, but in s 396A(3). That section is of general application and allows any person who is given by the Act a right to inspect a company’s records the right to take a copy of the records. That would obviously apply to a director exercising his right to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The common law principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 A set of fundamental principles have developed in the case law on how s 199(3) is to be interpreted and applied (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Wuu </span>at [25]–[33] and <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [13]–[15]).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s written submissions (12 Aug 2016) at para 25; First defendant’s written submissions (12 Aug 2016) at paras 5–7; Second to fourth defendants’ written submissions (12 Aug 2016) at para 36.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It therefore suffices for present purposes simply to state the principles without exposition or analysis:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A director’s statutory right to inspect records is an “absolute” right. But it is absolute not in the sense that it is inviolable. It is absolute in the sense that the director has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> right to inspect the records and does not have to demonstrate any particular ground or need for inspection (<span class="font-italic">Wuu </span>at [27] and [33];<span class="font-italic"> Hau Tau Khang </span>at [15(e)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The purpose of a director’s right to inspect records is to enable him to perform his statutory duties as a director. This extends to all of his duties as a director and is not confined to those duties which relate to the accounts (<span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A director has no right to inspect records if he is exercising the right, not to advance the interests of the company, but for some ulterior purpose or to injure the company. An ulterior purpose is any purpose which is unconnected to the discharge of the director’s duties (<span class="font-italic">Wuu </span>at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [15(e)] and [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) An ulterior purpose suffices, in itself, to defeat the director’s right to inspect the company’s records even if that ulterior purpose will not cause any detriment to the company. It is for this reason that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wuu</span> used an intention to cause detriment to the company as but an <span class="font-italic">example</span> of what would amount to an ulterior purpose (<span class="font-italic">Wuu </span>at [32]) and used the disjunctive “or” in holding that a director’s right “will be lost where it is exercised not to advance the interests of the company but for some ulterior purpose <span class="font-italic">or</span> to injure the company” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Wuu</span> at [33];<span class="font-italic"> </span>see also <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The burden of proving that a director is exercising his right to inspect records for an ulterior purpose lies on those who oppose inspection. Discharging that burden requires “clear proof” which suffices to satisfy the court affirmatively that the director is seeking to inspect the records for an ulterior purpose (<span class="font-italic">Wuu </span>at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [15(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) If a director does provide reasons for exercising his right to inspect records, even though he is under no obligation do so, it is open to the court to examine those reasons to see if they reveal an ulterior purpose. That is the approach which Steven Chong J (as he then was) took in <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I make a small point about terminology. The cases use the term “ulterior purpose” in some contexts and the term “improper purpose” in other contexts. I have used “ulterior purpose” consistently in the synthesis at [20] above and will do so throughout this judgment. I do not consider any of the cases to have drawn a distinction between the two terms insofar as a director’s right to inspect records is concerned. If any distinction can sensibly be drawn, it seems to me that an ulterior purpose, purely as a matter of language, encompasses an improper purpose but is not confined to it. To say that a director is exercising his right of inspection for an improper purpose suggests to me that his purpose is capable of being a wrong in itself, for example, to cause detriment to the company’s interests contrary to his duties to the company. Exercising a right for an ulterior purpose suggests, more broadly, that the director is exercising the right for any purpose which is not its intended purpose, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the director seeks inspection otherwise than to enable him to perform his statutory duties as a director (see [20(b)] above). That would obviously encompass an improper purpose (as I have defined it), but would also include any purpose which might not otherwise be a wrong but which is nevertheless not the purpose for which s 199(3) confers the right.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The elements of an application to inspect under s 199(3)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Returning to the statutory scheme of s 199(3) considered in the light of these fundamental principles drawn from the case law, three elements must be satisfied before a director’s right to inspect the company’s records arises:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The person who wishes to inspect the company’s records must be a director of the company;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The documents which the director wishes to inspect must be the company’s “accounting and other records” within the meaning of s 199(1) or a subset of those records; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The director must seek inspection for a proper purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The burden of proving the first element above must rest on the putative director. It is he who asserts that he is a director. In almost all cases, that burden will be discharged so easily that this element will not even be disputed. Whether or not the party seeking inspection is a director of the company is a matter of record, unless he relies on the extended definition of “director” in s 4(1) of the Act. If that is the case, issues of fact may arise on this element. The burden of proof on those issues of fact should rightly rest on the putative director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The burden of proving the second element must also rest on the putative director. If the director asks only to compel the company to permit him to inspect the company’s “accounting and other records”, thereby tracking the language of s 199(1), then the second element is <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span> established and cannot be disputed. However, if the director chooses to specify the documents which he wishes to inspect, either individually or by categories, it is right that he should have to show that the documents which he wishes to inspect do indeed form part of the company’s “accounting and other records” within the meaning of s 199(1). After all, it is he who has chosen to go beyond the statutory phrase by enumerating <span class="font-italic">a priori</span> the specific documents which he wishes to inspect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The burden of disproving the third element – which is the only element likely to be in issue in the majority of applications – lies squarely on those who seek to prevent the director from inspecting the company’s records (see [20(e)] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be decided</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 With that summary of the factual and legal background, I can now summarise with more granularity the parties’ positions and the issues I have to decide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It is common ground that the burden is on the defendants to show why the plaintiff should not be permitted to inspect the company’s records (see [20(e)] above). To discharge this burden, the Longsheng Directors on the one hand and the company on the other present separate arguments through separate counsel. The bulk of the arguments for the defendants have been, however, presented by counsel for the Longsheng Directors. Counsel for the company confines his separate submissions to the potential for detriment to the company’s interests if the plaintiff’s application were to be allowed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the plaintiff seeks inspection for an ulterior purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The focus of the defendants’ submissions was on the fourth ground. Nevertheless, I shall consider in turn each of the four grounds which the defendants advance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Before I do that, however, it is necessary to address three incidental but fundamental preliminary questions which arose in the course of submissions. These questions warrant closer examination because the answers to them are not settled: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, what procedure should an aggrieved director follow in asking the court to compel the company to permit him to inspect its records? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, what is the standard of proof to be met by a party opposing an aggrieved director’s application for relief? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, what if a director seeks to inspect a company’s records for mixed purposes which are ulterior in part but legitimate in part? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I turn now to analyse these three questions. The analysis which follows assumes that the plaintiff is within s 199(3). In other words, I assume without deciding for the time being that each of the three elements I have enumerated at [22] above are satisfied such that the plaintiff’s statutory right to inspect the company’s records has arisen. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The procedure to be followed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiff brings his application under s 199 of the Act. But he did not, when the application was filed, specify which subsection of s 199 he relied on. Does any subsection of s 199 empower a court to grant the plaintiff the relief he seeks by this application?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s application without procedural basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 There are only two subsections of s 199 which deal with inspection of a company’s records: s 199(3) and s 199(5). But neither provision empowers a court to grant to the plaintiff the relief which he now seeks (see [9] above): an order permitting him to inspect the company’s records. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 That relief does not come within the scope of s 199(3). That provision obliges the company to make its records available for the directors to inspect. But, as I have observed (see [15]–[18] above), it is clear on the face of s 199(3) – especially by comparison to s 199(5) and s 199(6) – that s 199(3) does not empower the court to grant specific civil relief for a breach of the duty under s 199(3). Further, even if one looks beyond s 199(3) to s 199 as a whole, it contains no provision empowering the court to enforce specifically the duty under s 199(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The relief which the plaintiff seeks also does not come within the scope of s 199(5). While that section does empower the court to make an order requiring the company to allow a public accountant to inspect its records on behalf of a director, that is not the relief which the plaintiff asks for in his application as originally framed. He asks for an order permitting him to inspect the company’s records personally. Further, it cannot be said (as counsel for the company contended at one point)

</div> that the purpose of s 199(5) is to provide the only specific relief for a breach of s 199(3). Certainly it is true that if there is a breach of s 199(3), an aggrieved director may as a consequence ask for an order under s 199(5). But it does not follow that the Act intended an order under s 199(5) to be the <span class="font-italic">only</span> remedy available to an aggrieved director. There is no reason why the Act would require a director who has not been permitted to inspect the company’s records personally, as his only recourse, to appoint a public accountant and then apply for an order for that accountant to inspect the company’s records on his behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The only provisions which could conceivably provide specific relief for an aggrieved director are the general enforcement provisions in the Act.

</div> The procedural point appeared to me to be entirely technical. Allowing the amendment did not change the factual or legal basis of the plaintiff’s application. In particular, the amendment did not require any fresh evidence to be obtained and adduced or any fresh legal arguments to be formulated and presented. It is for that reason that the defendants were able to confirm that they would not require the hearing to be adjourned even if the plaintiff’s application to amend were to be allowed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It appeared to me therefore that allowing the plaintiff’s application to amend his application and proceeding to hear it, without adjournment, on the footing that it had been brought under s 399 or s 409A in addition to s 199 would not cause any prejudice to the defendants for which they could not be compensated by an award of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As a result of the amendment, the plaintiff’s application proceeded before me as an application under either or both of s 399 and s 409A of the Act arising from a breach of s 199(3). It was common ground that, for present purposes and on the facts of this case, it is not necessary to distinguish between the scope or effect of these two general enforcement provisions. Either or both of those provisions suffice to give the plaintiff a procedural basis for the relief he seeks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I now turn to consider these two provisions more closely. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 399 and s 409A</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Section 399 of the Act expressly empowers the court to compel an immediate inspection of any document when a person, in contravention of the Act, refuses or fails to permit the inspection of that document:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may compel compliance</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">399.</span>—(1) If any person in contravention of this Act refuses or fails to permit the inspection of any register, minute book or document or to supply a copy of any register, minute book or document the Court may by order compel an immediate inspection of the register, minute book or document or order the copy to be supplied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Section 409A of the Act expressly empowers any person affected by a contravention of the Act to apply to the court for what is, in effect, either a prohibitory injunction to restrain non-compliance with the Act or a mandatory injunction to compel compliance with the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">409A</span>.—(1) Where a person has engaged, is engaging or is proposing to engage in any conduct that constituted, constitutes or would constitute a contravention of this Act, the Court may, on the application of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the conduct,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">grant an injunction restraining the first-mentioned person from engaging in the conduct and, if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, requiring that person to do any act or thing.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (2) Where a person has refused or failed, is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail, to do an act or thing that he is required by this Act to do, the Court may, on the application of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the refusal or failure to do that act or thing,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">grant an injunction requiring the first-mentioned person to do that act or thing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 A refusal or failure to permit a director to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) falls within the scope of s 399(1), s 409A(1) and s 409A(2). The first two of these provisions are expressly premised on a contravention of the Act. The third of these provisions, s 409A(2), is premised on a refusal or failure to do what the Act requires to be done. That type of a refusal or failure necessarily amounts to a contravention of the Act. Section 409A(2) is therefore also premised on a contravention of the Act, albeit implicitly. Section 199(3) in terms imposes a duty on a company to permit a director who comes within s 199(3) to inspect the company’s records. A failure to comply with that duty is a contravention of the Act for the purposes of both s 399 and s 409A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 An academic writer has suggested that it is 409A(1) which provides a means of enforcing a director’s statutory right of inspection (Terence Tan, “A Director’s Statutory Rights of Inspection of Accounts” (1994) 6 SAcLJ 118 (“Tan, <span class="font-italic">Director’s Statutory Rights</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 126–127). But it appears to me more natural to say that an aggrieved director is seeking to compel the company to open the company’s records for his inspection rather than seeking to restrain the company from failing to keep the records open for his inspection. A mandatory injunction under s 409A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is therefore likely to be the most appropriate relief in most cases of this type, rather than a prohibitory injunction under s 409A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relief under s 399 and s 409A is discretionary </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There is one interesting consequence of this analysis. Both s 399 and s 409A use the permissive “may” in empowering the court to grant relief under each section. No doubt that is by analogy with the equitable remedy of an injunction for which those provisions are the statutory analogue, as suggested by the heading to s 409A. The relief under each section is therefore expressly discretionary in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 If my analysis is correct, therefore, it means that the court has a residual discretion to decline relief to an aggrieved director even if he is squarely within s 199(3), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if all three elements set out at [22] above are resolved in his favour. No doubt that residual discretion will be exercised very rarely, given the absolute nature of the director’s statutory right to inspect the company’s records. But that discretion nevertheless exists, albeit at the point at which the court considers the remedy rather than the right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 <span class="font-italic">Conway</span> is perhaps an example of an exceptional case where that discretion could be exercised. The English Companies Act has no equivalent of s 399 or s 409A. As a result, in English law, an aggrieved director enforces his right to inspect the company’s records by commencing an ordinary civil action which seeks a final, mandatory injunction to compel inspection. The director need not wait for his case to be tried, however, in order to secure inspection. In an appropriate case, and on the usual procedural principles, he can either seek an interlocutory injunction in aid of his final relief or seek summary judgment for his final relief on the basis that there is no triable issue as to his right to inspect. <span class="font-italic">Conway</span> was a case in which the aggrieved directors commenced action and applied for an interlocutory mandatory injunction requiring the company to allow them to inspect the company’s books of account before trial. Slade J was not prepared to find as a fact that the directors sought inspection for an improper purpose given that the matter before him was interlocutory (at 84A–D). He nevertheless dismissed the application because a meeting of the shareholders was imminent at which those directors were likely to be removed from office (at 84F–G). That factual scenario is, perhaps, one example where, under our procedure, a residual discretion may sensibly be exercised against a director who is nevertheless within the four corners of s 199(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, nothing turns on this point in the case before me. I have made a finding of fact on an application for final relief that the plaintiff is seeking inspection for an ulterior purpose. The result is that he has no right to inspect the company’s records. But there are statements in the authorities which might, on one reading, suggest that there is no residual discretion to refuse inspection even if a director brings himself within s 199(3) and it cannot be shown by those opposing inspection that he is seeking to inspect the records for an ulterior purpose (see <span class="font-italic">Conway</span> at 90C, <span class="font-italic">Wuu</span> at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang</span> at [15(f)]). If that is the correct reading of those statements, that suggestion may have to be considered more closely when the point arises for decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The standard of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The second preliminary issue is the standard of proof to be met by a party alleging that a director is seeking to exercise his right to inspect for an ulterior purpose. While the parties accept that the authorities are clear that the burden on that issue rests on those who oppose inspection, they also accept that the authorities are “vague” on the standard of proof which that person must meet.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I begin by examining the authorities that have touched on this issue. In <span class="font-italic">Edman v Ross</span> (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 351, Street CJ held that unless there is “<span class="font-italic">clear proof</span> to the contrary” [emphasis added], the court will assume that a director is exercising his right of inspection for the company’s benefit (at 361). In <span class="font-italic">Wuu</span>, the Court of Appeal accepted that the standard is “clear proof” sufficient “to satisfy the court ‘affirmatively’” that the director is exercising his right of inspection for an ulterior purpose (at [34]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no burden on a director to show any particular reason for his request for inspection – this will ordinarily be assumed: see <span class="font-italic">Molomby v Whitehead </span>([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 293. It is for those who oppose the director’s right to inspect to <span class="font-italic">show “clear proof”</span> and to <span class="font-italic">satisfy the court “affirmatively”</span> that the grant of the right of inspection would be for the purpose which would be detrimental to the interests of the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Chong J made the same point in <span class="font-italic">Hau Tau Khang </span>at [35], emphasising that the threshold to establish an ulterior purpose is a “high one”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I do not read these statements as departing from the well-established rule that the standard of proof on all issues in a civil case is proof on the balance of probabilities. The Court of Appeal restated that rule most recently in <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 308 at [159]. The references to “clear proof” and the need “to satisfy the court ‘affirmatively’” in the authorities on s 199 can best be understood by analogy with cases of fraud. The court has often said that making a finding of fraud in a civil case requires cogent evidence because a finding of fraud has serious consequences. That does not, however, raise the standard of proof for an allegation of fraud beyond the usual civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities. It is simply a facet of the principle that the more serious the finding which a court makes, the stronger the proof which the court will require to make that finding. That principle does not require a civil court to seek proof going <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> the balance of probabilities before finding fraud. The standard of proof in civil cases remains at all times proof on the balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo </span>at [161]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 That is also the case where a party alleges that a director is exercising his statutory right of inspection for an ulterior purpose. The statutory right arises from his office as a director. It is extended to him in order to enable him to discharge his duties as a director. Proof of an ulterior purpose requires examining subjectively the director’s state of mind in seeking inspection. State of mind is not susceptible to direct proof. In all but the most unusual of cases, it can be proven only by inviting the court to draw inferences from circumstantial evidence. It is thus unsurprising that the court should indicate that it will not infer or find too readily from the circumstances that a director is exercising his right for an ulterior purpose. To do so would severely inhibit the director’s ability to perform his duties (<span class="font-italic">Wuu </span>at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 That is all that is meant by the references in the authorities to a requirement of clear proof or affirmative satisfaction. Accordingly, the defendants’ burden is to show affirmatively and by clear evidence – but ultimately only on the balance of probabilities – that the plaintiff seeks to inspect the company’s records for an ulterior purpose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mixed purposes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The final preliminary issue is this: what if a director is motivated by mixed purposes, comprising both proper and ulterior purposes, in seeking to exercise his right to inspect the company’s records? Should his application succeed or fail?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I begin by accepting the analysis of Mahon J in <span class="font-italic">Berlei Hestia (NZ) Ltd v Fe</span><span class="font-italic">rnyhough</span> [1980] 2 NZLR 150<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a director’s “right” of inspection under the New Zealand equivalent of s 199(3) is, at least for present purposes, best analysed as being in the nature of a power to inspect rather than a right to inspect (at 165). A director cannot be said to be have a right to inspect if he seeks to exercise that right for an ulterior purpose. The ulterior purpose extinguishes the right even before it can be purportedly exercised. By contrast, a director can be said to have a power to inspect whether or not he exercises it for its proper purposes. The exercise of a power by a fiduciary for ulterior purposes is controlled by the equitable doctrine of a fraud on the power, not by extinguishing the power. As Mahon J said (at 164–165):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a matter of passing comment, it may perhaps be not appropriate to treat a director's right to access to corporate information as being in the strict sense a legal “right”. It is quite correct to say, as a matter of simple logic, that if there is an absolute duty enforceable by penal sanction to see that proper accounts are kept, then there must be a corresponding absolute right to see the records which are the basis of those accounts. That may be nothing more than a simple illustration of the Hohfeld theory of jural correlatives. I think it may be more correct, however, to treat what is described as the director's “right” as really a power. Suppose the case of a director who formulated a dishonest scheme to use corporate information for his own personal profit or for the advantage of a competitor and then, with his corrupt intentions unknown, exercised his right to scrutinise the company's confidential records. It seems a fallacy to suggest that his inspection was in pursuance of any “right” because ex hypothesi the “right” was extinguished as from the moment when he began to put in train the fraudulent scheme. It is for that reason that I would prefer myself to describe the director's position as being one involving a “power” to inspect corporate records as and when thought necessary in order to comply with his statutory and fiduciary obligations towards his company. If in the example previously stated, the inspection took place pursuant to a concealed fraudulent scheme, then the director would still be exercising the “power” and his conduct would be analogous to that proscribed in the equity jurisdiction as being a fraud upon a power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I note in passing that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wuu</span> accepted (at [25]) that a director exercising his right to inspect that company’s records under s 199(3) is, for the purposes of the proper purpose principle, in the same position as a director exercising a power vested in him as a fiduciary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Position in England</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In England, the position at common law is that a director who exercises a power for a combination of proper and improper purposes does so validly only if his primary or dominant purpose in doing so is a proper purpose (<span class="font-italic">Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and Others </span>[1974] AC 821 at 832F–832G <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Wilberforce). This was restated most recently by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs Group Ltd and another v JKX Oil and Gas plc </span>[2016] 1 BCLC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span>”) at [17]–[19] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Sumption and at [51]–[52] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Mance. The court will take the purpose which was the weightiest in the director’s mind as his primary or dominant purpose. In this context, the weightiest purpose is the purpose about which the director feels most strongly in exercising the power (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> at [19]). I shall use the word “weightiest” consistently in this sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 What is notable about <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> is that Lord Sumption was prepared <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> to propose that a director’s primary or dominant purpose for exercising a particular power should henceforth be determined, not by looking at what the director’s weightiest purpose was, but by applying the “but for” test of causation. On this test, an improper purpose will not be a director’s primary or dominant purpose for exercising a power – even if it was his weightiest purpose for doing so – if the director can show that, even if he had had regard only to proper purposes instead of the improper purpose, he would have exercised the power in the same way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Although <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> was a decision on the general duty of a director exercising a power and not specifically about a director seeking to exercise his power to inspect the company’s records under the English equivalent of s 199(3), both counsel before me relied on <span class="font-italic">Eclairs </span>as<span class="font-italic"> </span>indicating the approach which the court should take where a director acts for mixed purposes under s 199(3).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is therefore necessary to consider that case in a little more detail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span>, a company’s directors exercised a particular power under its articles of association by resolving to prevent two minority shareholders from voting at an upcoming general meeting. Each director voted to exercise the power for one or both of two purposes. For convenience, I shall call them purpose A and purpose B. At trial, Mann J found (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs Group Ltd and another v JKX Oil and Gas plc and others </span>[2014] 1 BCLC 202 at [235]) that: (a) one director had exercised the power primarily for purpose A; (b) two directors had exercised the power for both purpose A and purpose B giving equal weight to each, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, with neither purpose being the weightiest purpose; and (c) four directors exercised the power primarily for purpose B.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The minority shareholders challenged the resolution as being the result of an exercise of the directors’ power for an improper purpose. It was common ground at trial that purpose A was a proper purpose for exercising the power. What was in dispute was whether purpose A was the <span class="font-italic">only</span> proper purpose for exercising the power. The directors’ case was that it was not, and that purpose B was equally a proper purpose. Mann J disagreed. He held that purpose A was the only proper purpose. It followed that purpose B was an improper purpose. The result of Mann J’s findings was that the weightiest purpose for a majority of the board (four out of seven directors) in exercising the power was an improper purpose. Mann J accordingly set aside the resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Critically, the directors in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> did not advance at trial a causation argument based on the “but for” test. They did not argue in the alternative that, even if purpose B was not a proper purpose, acting for purpose B had had no causative effect on how the directors had exercised the power because they would have exercised the power in precisely the same way even if they had had regard only to purpose A. It was Mann J who raised this as a possible argument for the first time in the course of closing oral submissions. But he rejected the directors’ attempt to adopt this argument as part of their case at so late a stage. Because it had not been part of their case in the evidential phase, the directors had given no evidence on this hypothetical scenario and the minority shareholders had had no opportunity to cross-examine the directors on it. However, in case he was wrong in declining to allow the directors to adopt this argument as an alternative, Mann J found on the evidence which was available to him – such as it was – that the directors would have exercised the power in the same way even if they had had regard only to purpose A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Before the Supreme Court, the only live argument arising from Mann J’s judgment was his reasoning which I have summarised at [60] above. In particular, the causation argument was not canvassed in argument before the Supreme Court (see <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> at [49]–[50]) because the directors did not appeal against Mann J’s decision refusing to allow them to adopt that argument as part of their case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Lord Sumption delivered the leading judgment in the UK Supreme Court. He agreed (at [41]) with Mann J that: (a) purpose A was the only proper purpose for exercising the power; (b) that purpose B was therefore an improper purpose; and (c) that the directors’ resolution therefore had to be set aside. All of the other Supreme Court justices agreed with Lord Sumption on this part of his judgment. These holdings were all that were necessary to dispose of the appeal in the minority shareholders’ favour given the oral arguments presented on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">ob</span><span class="font-italic">iter dicta</span>, however, Lord Sumption (with whom Lord Hodge agreed) expressed the view that the causation argument which Mann J had raised and addressed in his judgment was correct in law (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs </span>at [21]–[22]). In other words, Lord Sumption was prepared to hold that, where a fiduciary (such as a director) has in mind both a proper and an ulterior purpose in exercising a power, and where the weightiest purpose for doing so is the <span class="font-italic">improper</span> purpose, a challenge to the exercise of the power will nevertheless <span class="font-italic">fail</span> if the fiduciary can prove that he would have exercised the power in the same way even if he had had regard only to the <span class="font-italic">proper</span> purpose. By the same token, where the weightiest purpose for which the fiduciary exercised the power is a <span class="font-italic">proper</span> purpose, a challenge to the exercise of the power will nevertheless <span class="font-italic">succeed</span> if the party challenging it can prove that the fiduciary would have exercised the power in the same way even if he had had <span class="font-italic">no</span> regard to the proper purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This amounts to saying that, where a director exercises a power for both a proper and an improper purpose, his primary or dominant purpose ought to be identified by ascertaining the “but for” cause for his exercise of the power rather than by ascertaining the weightiest purpose for his exercise of the power. As Lord Sumption said (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One has to focus on the improper purpose and ask whether the decision would have been made if the directors had not been moved by it. If the answer is that without the improper purpose(s) the decision impugned would never have been made, then it would be irrational to allow it to stand simply because the directors had other, proper considerations in mind as well, to which perhaps they attached greater importance. … <span class="font-italic">Correspondingly, if there were proper reasons for exercising the power and it would still have been exercised for those reasons even in the absence of improper ones, it is difficult to see why justice should require the decision to be set aside</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Put this way, replacing the “weightiest purpose” test with the “but for” test operates bilaterally: both in favour of and against the fiduciary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Lord Sumption accepted that both tests would often lead to the same result in practice. But he opined that the “but for” test was preferable for two reasons, one conceptual and one practical. The conceptual reason was that adopting the “but for” test assimilated the rule applicable to directors exercising a power with the general rule applicable to all other fiduciaries exercising a power. That rule, based on the equitable doctrine of a fraud on the power, is that a fiduciary’s exercise of his power is invalid unless <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the purposes for which he exercises it are proper purposes. Looked at that way, it is anomalous to uphold the exercise of a director’s power on the basis that his primary or dominant purpose was a proper purpose. That means that a challenge to a director’s exercise of a power will fail even if one of his less weighty purposes was an improper purpose, whereas a challenge to a fiduciary’s exercise of a power in the same context would succeed. By the same token, it is conceptually difficult to justify setting aside a director’s decision merely because his weightiest purpose was an improper purpose if that improper purpose had no causative effect on the exercise of the power (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs </span>at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Lord Sumption’s practical reason for preferring the “but for” test was that that test avoids the forensic difficulty of forcing a director to rank the various purposes for which he exercises a power in order of importance. Not only is it unlikely that a director would actually have done that at the time he exercised the power, any attempt by a director to do so after the fact, in the course of litigation, is likely to be “both artificial and defensive” (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs </span>at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Lord Clarke was inclined to agree with this part of Lord Sumption’s judgment but preferred not to reach a final conclusion on the issue because it did not arise for decision in that case (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs </span>at [46]). Lord Mance too preferred not to express a view on this issue until it arose for decision. But he expressed several doubts about Lord Sumption’s alternative analysis (<span class="font-italic">Eclairs </span>at [50]–[55]). Lord Neuberger agreed with both Lord Clarke and Lord Mance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As I said, this part of Lord Sumption’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> is <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>. In addition, he was in the minority in advocating this approach to identifying a director’s primary or dominant purpose as the approach to be applied to future cases. The position at common law in England remains, therefore, that a challenge to the exercise of a power by a director who has exercised the power for both a proper and an ulterior purpose will turn on whether the director’s primary or dominant purpose in exercising the power was a proper purpose, <span class="font-italic">only</span> in the sense of the proper purpose being the weightiest purpose for which he exercised it (see [56] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Position in Australia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse and another v Carlton Hotel Pty Ltd </span>(1987) 162 CLR 285 (“<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span>”), the High Court of Australia considered the “but for” test in the context of a director’s exercise of a power. Like <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the issue in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span> was also a director’s duty to act for proper purposes generally, and not in the context of exercising his right to inspect a company’s records under the Australian equivalent of s 199(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span>, a director had allotted shares to his two sons. The other shareholders complained that the allotment was for an ulterior purpose, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to prevent them from exercising control over the company (at 288–289). The High Court of Australia agreed with the other shareholders, finding that the allotment of the shares was to favour one group of shareholders over another and therefore an ulterior exercise of the director’s power to allot shares (at 291–292). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In coming to their decision for the majority, Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ noted that the case before them was not one in which the director had acted for a combination of proper and ulterior purposes. Nevertheless, they expressed the view <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that where a director exercises a power for multiple purposes, some of which are proper purposes and some of which are ulterior purposes, the exercise of the power will nevertheless be voidable if the ulterior purpose was the “but for” cause of the director exercising the power as he did, even if the weightiest purposes for his doing so were proper purposes (<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse </span>at 294):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a matter of logic and principle, the preferable view would seem to be that, regardless of whether the impermissible purpose was the dominant one or but one of a number of significantly contributing causes, the allotment will be invalidated if the impermissible purpose was causative in the sense that, but for its presence, “the power would not have been exercised” …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The important point about <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span> is that the majority endorsed the “but for” test as operating only unilaterally, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either as the only ground for setting aside a director’s exercise of a power or as an additional ground for doing so. They did not in terms endorse it operating bilaterally as Lord Sumption did in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as a ground for both upholding and avoiding the director’s exercise of the power (see [65] above). Lord Mance made this very point in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> (at [53]) when he expressed the need for caution in accepting Lord Sumption’s new principle as the principle to be applied going forward in a case in which the issue did not arise for decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on mixed purposes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As I have pointed out, both <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> and <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span> are cases on a director’s general obligation to exercise his powers for proper purposes. I leave aside for the moment, without expressing any view on it, whether the “but for” test suffices to identify a director’s primary or dominant purpose within the sphere Lord Sumption intended his <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> to operate and whether it can do so bilaterally. It suffices only to say that Lord Mance pointed to a number of reasons why Lord Sumption’s analysis was: (a) difficult to reconcile with the existing case law on the exercise of a corporate power by a director as opposed to the exercise of a discretionary power by a trustee (at [51]–[52]); (b) difficult to reconcile with the existing case law on mixed purposes (at [53]); and (c) created at least as many practical difficulties as it appeared to solve (at [54] –[55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 But even if Lord Sumption is correct in advocating the “but for” test within that sphere, it appears to me that there are three difficulties with trying to apply the “but for” test to a director exercising his power to inspect records under s 199(3) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 First, the power under consideration in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> was one which the company’s constitution vested in the directors to exercise for and on behalf of the company as its agent. It is to address the principal-agent problem which arises when an agent exercises a power for a principal that equity requires a director to have the power’s proper purpose as his primary or dominant purpose for exercising it. Further, the exercise of the directors’ power in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> actually altered the company’s legal rights and obligations. It prevented the aggrieved minority shareholders from exercising their right as against the company and as against the company’s other shareholders to vote at the general meeting. That potential to alter a company’s rights or obligations is another aspect of the principal-agent problem which is the reason for equity’s requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The power to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) is not a power which the director exercises for and on behalf of the company as its agent. It is a personal power vested in the director – albeit one given to him to enable him properly to perform his duties as a director – which the director exercises in the first instance for himself alone. Further, a director’s power to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) is – as far as the company is concerned – a legally neutral act. A director exercising the power to inspect does not and cannot in itself alter any of the company’s rights or obligations, whether as between the company and its shareholders, as between the shareholders <span class="font-italic">inter se</span> or as between the company and third parties. Exercising the power merely vindicates the director’s statutory right to inspect the company’s records. All of this suggests that the test for ascertaining a director’s purpose in the usual case of a director exercising a power for and on behalf of the company as its agent to bind the company in its legal relations with third parties is not a useful guide for ascertaining a director’s purpose in exercising the power to inspect records under s 199(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Second, Lord Sumption’s principle makes sense only when it is applied to a power which has actually been exercised. A director’s purpose for exercising a power does not become susceptible to sensible forensic examination until that purpose is irrevocably attached to an actual exercise of that power. Until the power is actually exercised, the director’s purpose remains entirely amorphous and, most importantly, mutable. Any challenge to a director’s <span class="font-italic">future</span> exercise of a power on the grounds that the director <span class="font-italic">intends</span> to do so for an ulterior purpose is entirely hypothetical. It can easily be defeated simply by the director changing his stated purpose for the future exercise. It is only after a power has actually been exercised that it makes any sense at all to ask what was the director’s primary or dominant purpose in exercising the power and to ask Lord Sumption’s further question: “Would the director have exercised the power in the same way if he had acted only for a proper purpose?”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In practical terms, a director’s purpose in seeking to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) will always be analysed before the inspection takes place. If it is found that the director’s weightiest purpose for seeking inspection is an ulterior purpose, his application to compel inspection fails. It makes no sense then, given that the director has not actually inspected the documents, to give the director a second bite of the cherry by asking the further question which Lord Sumption’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> poses: “Would the director still want to inspect the records if he were acting for a proper purpose?”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Third, the incidence of the burden of proof in relation to purpose is different in the two classes of case. In <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span>, as in every case where a director is called upon to justify the exercise of a power for and on behalf of the company, the burden rests on the director to show that he exercised the power for a proper purpose. In the present application, as in every application to inspect a company’s records, the burden rests on those opposing the inspection to show that the director seeks to inspect the company’s records for an ulterior purpose. The innovation of Lord Sumption’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> is to give a director an additional ground on which to <span class="font-italic">justify</span> the exercise of a power. But a director on an application under s 199(3) has no burden to justify the exercise of the power to inspect the records at all. Further, even if one views the majority’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span> strictly – as recognising the “but for” test of purpose either as the only or an additional ground on which to <span class="font-italic">invalidate</span> the exercise of a director’s power where the weightiest purpose is a proper purpose – it would mean that a director’s right to inspect the company’s records would be defeated even if the weightiest purpose for seeking inspection is a proper purpose. That appears to me to be too great an inroad into the director’s <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> right to inspect under s 199(3), particularly when the preceding two points I have made are kept in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For these reasons, I hold that the test to be applied in determining whether a director’s primary or dominant purpose in seeking to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) is an ulterior purpose is to ask whether an ulterior purpose is the weightiest purpose for which he seeks inspection, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the purpose about which he feels most strongly in seeking to inspect the records is an ulterior purpose. I do not consider that there is any scope for the “but for” analysis to apply, either bilaterally in the <span class="font-italic">Eclairs</span> sense or unilaterally in the <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse</span> sense, when considering the director’s power to seek inspection of a company’s records under s 199(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I now turn to consider the defendants’ grounds for resisting this application in the order in which I have set them out at [28] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Has there been a contravention of the Act?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is a condition precedent for granting relief under s 399, s 409A(1) and s 409A(2) that there has been a contravention of the Act (see [43] above). The burden of establishing that the condition precedent for relief under this section is satisfied must rest on the director, as the person seeking the relief. However, consistently with the absolute nature of the director’s right to inspect the company’s records, that burden will be easily discharged where the contravention is a failure to comply with s 199(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The defendants say that there has been no contravention of the Act on the facts. Those facts are as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In June 2015, Kiri Industries commenced a minority oppression suit against Senda and the company seeking relief under s 216 of the Act.

</div> In it, the plaintiff expressly stated that he was writing the letter in his capacity as a director of the company and as a member of its audit committee and of its compensation and remuneration committee. His first complaint was that his past requests for further information on the company’s finances and business had not been addressed. He then asked the company’s management to make available for his review in advance of the next directors’ meeting certain “documents and/or information” which he enumerated in a schedule attached to his letter. The plaintiff asserted that he was entitled to the documents and information and that the entire width of his request was necessary for him to understand the transactions and financial position of the company in order for there to be meaningful discussions at the next directors’ meeting. He concluded the letter by asking to be allowed to review the documents within 14 days, failing which he would “take all necessary steps to enforce [his] rights, including but not limited to filing an application in the Singapore Courts”. I describe the schedule to this letter in more detail at [141]–[143] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The plaintiff’s letter elicited three further letters, all dated 1 August 2015. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first letter was from Senda to the company. Senda took the position, as against the company, that the plaintiff was seeking to review the enumerated documents and information for an ulterior purpose and that whether the plaintiff should be allowed to do so was a matter for the company’s directors to decide as a board in the interests of the company. The implication of that position is that it was not for the company’s management to decide unilaterally whether to supply the enumerated documents and information to the plaintiff.

In the analysis which follows, I assume that the plaintiff sought to review the documents set out in the schedule to his July 2015 letter for a proper purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The first point I make is that at least part of what the plaintiff sought to inspect by his July 2015 letter falls within the scope of the term “accounting and other records” of the company within the meaning of s 199(1). Despite that, he has not yet been permitted to inspect <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the company’s records. That appears to me – at the very minimum – to amount to a “failure” to comply with the Act within the meaning of s 399(1) and s 409A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). A “failure” for the purposes of these provisions can be entirely passive and can be established by an omission to act in the face of a duty to act. That failure suffices, in itself, to enliven my power under both s 399(1) and s 409A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, even if I were to focus on the words “contravention” and “refusal”, within the meaning of s 399(1), s 409A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 409A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, I consider that there has been a contravention of s 199(3) of the Act or a refusal to comply with it even though the Longsheng Directors’ August 2015 letter does not, on its face, refuse inspection. On the assumptions I have made, the plaintiff, acting for a proper purpose, asked by his July 2015 letter to be allowed to review certain documents, some of which at least are the company’s “accounting and other records” within the meaning of s 199(1). He has not been permitted to inspect those records to date. The root cause of that is the condition precedent which the Longsheng Directors attached unilaterally in the concluding paragraph of their August 2015 letter to the plaintiff’s absolute right to inspect, requiring the plaintiff to address their allegation that Kiri Industries was engaging in wrongful competition with the DyStar Group. There is no legal basis for a company or its directors to attach a condition precedent to a director’s exercise of a right to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) (see <span class="font-italic">Wuu</span> at [36]). That right is an absolute right, in the sense I have already described (see [20(a)] above). The Longsheng Directors’ response to the plaintiff’s letter amounted to a constructive refusal even if it did not amount to an express refusal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Further, it seems to me that all of the parties – and, for present purposes, the Longsheng Directors in particular – were disingenuously taking tactical positions in and from January 2015 in order to bolster their respective cases in a simmering shareholders’ dispute. I describe these events in more detail below. That dispute eventually boiled over into litigation in June 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For present purposes, it suffices to say that I am satisfied that the Longsheng Directors, when they wrote their August 2015 letter, had no intention of acceding to any part of the plaintiff’s request in his July 2015 letter. The Longsheng Directors, through their majority on the company’s board, have the power to direct the company’s management. I have no doubt that the Longsheng Directors would never have allowed the plaintiff to inspect anything even if: (a) the plaintiff had provided the explanation sought in paragraph 6 of the August 2015 letter; (b) responded to the Longsheng Directors’ invitation to discuss his request further; and (c) limited his request only to those documents which indisputably fell within the scope of “accounting and other records”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 If the position were otherwise, the Longsheng Directors would not have defended this application root and branch as doggedly as they did. The invitation in paragraph 6 of the Longsheng Directors’ August 2015 letter was a disingenuous attempt to dress up, for future tactical forensic advantage, a door which the Longsheng Directors intended to hold firmly closed as one which they were holding ajar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I find, therefore, that there has been a contravention of the Act sufficient to enliven my power under s 409A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and also a refusal – or, at the absolute minimum, a failure to comply with the Act – sufficient to enliven my power under both s 399(1) and s 409A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Have the Longsheng Directors been correctly joined?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defendants’ second ground of opposition to the plaintiff’s application is that the Longsheng Directors have been incorrectly joined to this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The plaintiff cites <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Leong v Seen Joo Co Pte Ltd and others </span>[2015] 1 SLR 688 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Leong</span>”) to argue that the Longsheng Directors have been properly joined as defendants in this application. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Leong</span>, Tan Siong Thye J held (at [56]–[63]) that the statutory obligation to permit inspection under s 199(3) is – unlike the common law obligation – an obligation not only of the company but also of its directors and managers. He therefore upheld the plaintiff’s decision in that case to bring his application against not only the company but also against its executive directors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The defendants, on the other hand, argue that the statutory basis for Tan J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Leong</span> has changed because a material aspect of s 199(1) on which Tan J relied for his decision has since been deleted by amendment. Tan J held (at [61]–[62]) that the class of persons who were obliged to permit a director to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) must be determined by reference to the class of persons who were obliged to keep those same records under s 199(1). Section 199(1), as it stood when <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Leong</span> was decided, imposed the duty to keep those records expressly on <span class="font-italic">both</span> the company <span class="font-italic">and</span> on its “directors and managers”. That was why Tan J held that the Act imposed a duty not only on the company but also on the directors and managers to permit inspection of those records under s 199(3). Given the wording of s 199(1) then, it was entirely appropriate to hold the directors responsible for contravening s 199(3) and therefore also to join them to an aggrieved director’s application for civil relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 But, the defendants go on to point out, s 199(1) was amended with effect from 1 July 2015 by deleting the phrase “and the directors and managers thereof” from s 199(1). The result is that the duty to keep a company’s records under s 199(1) now rests on the company alone. As a result, the Longsheng Directors ceased with effect from 1 July 2015 – a date before both the plaintiff’s July 2015 letter and this application – to be under any obligation to keep the company’s records under s 199(1). They therefore cannot be held to be in breach of s 199(3) for failing to permit the plaintiff to inspect those records. The Longsheng Directors should therefore never have been joined to this application.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 There is considerable force in the defendants’ arguments. As a matter of the plain meaning of language, the current wording of s 199(1) imposes the obligation to keep a company’s records on the company itself and on no other person. That plain meaning is reinforced by the fact that the current wording of s 199(1) is the result of deleting the phrase “and the directors and managers thereof” from s 199(1). The deletion is evidence of a clear intent to remove a company’s directors and managers from the class of persons subject to the duty to keep the company’s records under s 199(1) in its original form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The legislative history of this deletion from s 199(1) further reinforces the plain meaning of the current s 199(1) as its true construction, being the intended result of the deletion. The deletion was effected by s 114(a) of the Companies (Amendment) Act (No 40/2014) (“the amendment Act”) enacted on 8 October 2014. The amendment Act was the culmination of a seven-year process of law reform which began in April 2007 with the formation of a distinguished steering committee chaired by Professor Walter Woon to review and rewrite the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The steering committee’s Recommendation 4.31 was that s 199(1) of the Act should not be amended (<span class="font-italic">Report of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act</span> (April 2011) at p 29). It took the view that s 199(1) cast the duty to keep accounting records “expressly upon the directors and managers of the company” and that “this duty of directors is still relevant today” (at paras 101–102 on p 4–22.) The steering committee concluded that no reform of s 199(1) was required either to change the class of persons subject to the duty to keep the company’s records (at para 102 on p 4–22) or to provide more detail on what accounting records should be kept in order to comply with the duty (at para 103 on p 4–22).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) accepted the steering committee’s recommendation on s 199(1) (<span class="font-italic">Ministry of Finance’s Responses to the Report of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act</span> (3 October 2012) at paras 237–238). However, MOF’s response did not address the steering committee’s conclusion that no reform was required of the class of persons subject to the duty under s 199(1). Instead, MOF’s response simply accepted the steering committee’s conclusion that no reform of s 199 was required to provide a comprehensive list of the type of accounting records that were to be kept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Up to this point, there appears to have been no positive intention on the part of the government stakeholders driving this suite of reforms to the Act to change the class of persons subject to the duty to keep the company’s records under s 199(1): the duty was to remain upon the company “and the directors and managers thereof” as recommended by the steering committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 That changed in May 2013. That was when the MOF and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) jointly published for public consultation their proposals for amending the Act in order to implement the steering committee’s recommendations. One of the annexes to their joint proposals was a draft amendment bill. That draft proposed, in cl 134(a), to amend s 199 by “deleting the word ‘managers’ in subsection (1) and substituting the words ‘the chief executive officer’”. This proposed amendment did, contrary to earlier indications, suggest changing the class of persons subject to the duty under s 199(1). It proposed to make a company’s chief executive officer the only person subject to that duty in addition to the directors, thereby relieving all other managers from the duty. Another annex to the joint proposals was a table entitled “Implementation of Steering Committee's Recommendations in the Draft Companies (Amendment) Bill 2013”. Curiously, point 154 of that table (at p 66) stated again that s 199(1) of the Act was not to be amended, despite cl 134(a). But this statement must be read in the context of the MOF’s response in October 2012 (see [105] above) which accepted expressly only the steering committee’s conclusion that no reform to s 199(1) was required to specify comprehensively the types of accounting records which were within the scope of the duty it created. That remained the position under this iteration of the draft amendment bill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The next iteration of the draft amendment bill contained a provision which deleted without replacement the phrase “and the directors and managers thereof” in s 199(1). The stated reason for this change was to align the wording of s 199(1) with that of s 199(2A). The latter provision was an entirely new subsection proposed to impose an obligation on a public company and its subsidiaries to devise and maintain a system of internal controls. Crucially, the new duty under the proposed s 199(2A) was to be imposed only on the corporate entities and not on their “directors and managers”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The next step in the law reform process was the reading in Parliament of the proposed amendment bill in its final form. Clause 114(a) of the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill 25 of 2014) (“the amendment Bill”) was enacted without amendment and is therefore identical to s 114(a) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 2014 (No 36 of 2014) (“the amendment Act”). The Parliamentary debates do not, unfortunately, shed light on Parliament’s intention in enacting cl 114(a). The only available source from which to ascertain Parliament’s intention is the explanatory statement which accompanied the amendment Bill into Parliament. The explanatory statement makes clear (at p 311 of the amendment Bill) that the intention behind the decision to put cl 114(a) before Parliament was to impose the obligation to keep a company’s records upon only the company itself:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 114 amends section 199 –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to provide in subsection (1) that the obligation to keep accounting and other records to explain the transactions and financial position of the company is <span class="font-italic">imposed on the company </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only</span>, for consistency with subsection (2A); …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics and bold added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 This explanatory statement suffices to make patent that Parliament’s intent in enacting s 114(a) was to achieve the effect to which the plain meaning of the amended s 199(1) gives rise. And, given that cl 114(a) of the amendment Bill was enacted as s 114(a) of the amendment Act without amendment and with no further statement of Parliament’s intent in doing so, this passage in the explanatory statement remains the definitive and final statement from which Parliament’s intention can be gathered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The strongest counterargument which militates against giving s 199(1) its plain meaning rests on the implications which a plain reading of s 199(1) has on the criminal offence under s 199(6) for default in complying with s 199.  The counterargument is that interpreting s 199(1) as imposing no duty on the officers of a company to keep the company’s records under s 199(1) renders s 199(6) a dead letter as far as the criminal liability of those officers under s 199(6) is concerned. The introductory words of s 199(6) predicate criminal liability under that provision on a default in compliance with s 199. If the company’s officers no longer have any duty under s 199, they can never be in default of s 199 and can never commit the offence under s 199(6). But a reading of a statute which renders a provision otiose and meaningless ought to be avoided (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 at [69]) because Parliament “does not legislate in vain”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [38]) and the courts must accordingly presume that Parliament did not intend “an unworkable or impracticable result” (also at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 It is also the case that Parliament, in enacting the amendment Act, took the express view that a natural person responsible for keeping the company’s records would, despite the amendment to s 199(1), remain liable for the criminal offence under s 199(6). This is clear from MOF’s and ACRA’s explanation which accompanied the proposal to align the wording of s 199(1) with that of s 199(2A) by deleting the phrase “and the directors and managers thereof” from s 199(1) (<span class="font-italic">Table of Proposed Changes in Part 2 of the Draft Companies (Amendment) Bill</span> (October 2013) at pp 17–18, s/no 32):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For consistency with the wordings [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in section 199(2A). The penalty provision under <span class="font-italic">section 199(6)</span> <span class="font-italic">will adequately cover persons who should be responsible for maintaining proper accounting records</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Further, while s 114(a) of the amendment Act relieved directors and managers of their previous duty under s 199(1), s 114(d) of the same amendment Act increased the maximum fine for the offence under s 199(6) from $2,000 to $5,000 and increased the maximum term of imprisonment from three months to 12 months. This indicates that Parliament in passing the amendment Act viewed a failure to keep a company’s records as being a more serious breach of duty than it did previously. More importantly, however, only a natural person can be imprisoned. A company cannot be imprisoned and can only be fined. So it appears that in enacting s 114(d) of the amendment Act and enhancing the maximum term of imprisonment in s 199(6), Parliament expressly considered that natural persons, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a company’s officers, would continue to be liable for the offence under s 199(6). Parliament took that position even though, at the same time in the same section of the same amendment Act, it amended s 199(1) to relieve a company’s directors and managers of the duty to keep the company’s records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 To my mind, this counterargument does not lead to the conclusion that s 199(1) should be given a meaning other than its plain meaning. Parliament’s statement of intent in passing s 114(a) of the amendment Act (see [109] above) makes clear that Parliament intended the amended s 199(1)’s plain meaning to be its actual meaning. The result is that s 199(1) is not susceptible to the purposive and contextual approach to statutory interpretation which the majority in <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 373 favoured (at [18]) over a plain reading of a statutory provision. Giving s 199(1) any other meaning would amount to countermanding the intent of Parliament rather than give effect to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The answer to this counterargument, therefore, is to be found in applying the purposive and contextual approach to s 199(6) and not to s 199(1). A purposive approach to s 199(6) would allow it to be read as imposing criminal liability on an officer of a company which defaults in its obligation under s 199 simply by virtue of his status as an officer of the company and without regard for his personal culpability for the company’s default and despite there being no longer any personal obligation on him to keep the company’s records under s 199(1). On this purposive reading, the words “who is in default” in the phrase “every officer of the company who is in default” are to be read as modifying only the word “company” and not the word “officer”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 That this is how s 199(6) is to be construed is clear from the statutory scheme of the Act. Parliament has consistently relied on the words “every officer of the company who is in default”, on some occasions with minor and immaterial adaptations, to impose criminal liability on company officers under the Act. There are 70 such provisions in the Act. Some of these provisions hold officers criminally liable for a failure to comply with a duty which is not stated expressly to fall on any particular person or class of persons (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 32(8), s 123(4), 132(1), 143(2), 146(4), 175(4)(a), 181(2), 186(4), 203(3A), 210(9), 211(5), 245(4), 363(4) and 396(3)). Some hold officers liable for a failure to comply with a duty which is imposed on the company alone, but for which the company cannot be held criminally liable (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, s 76(5)). Some hold officers criminally liable for a failure to comply with a duty which falls on the directors alone (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 210(9) and 211(5)). Some hold directors criminally liable for a duty which falls on the directors alone (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 205(17) and 205AF(5)). Some make clear that every officer of the company is criminally liable even though it is only the company who is under the duty in question and who is therefore in default of the Act (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 173H, 203A(7), 386, 386AF(12), 386AF(13), 386AG(5), 386AH(5), 386AI(5), 386AL(7) and 386AN(4)). Some hold only directors criminally liable for a failure to comply with a duty which falls on the company, excluding those who are officers of the company without being directors (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 205(17), 205AC(4), 205AD(5), 205A(3) and 206(2)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 But by far the bulk of these provisions – over 40 – hold officers criminally liable for a failure to comply with a duty which falls on the company alone (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ss 22(1AB), 26(2A), 32(6), 40(4), 59(2), 63A(3), 63B(6), 73B(4), 74(5), 75(2), 78B(5) 78C(5), 78F(5), 88(5), 93(7), 93(9), 129(4), 130AB(3), 130AE(3), 133(2), 138(4), 142(2), 164(17), 174(10), 183(7), 186(3), 188(4), 189(3), 190(7), 191(3), 192(4), 196(9), 197(6), 201AA(2), 203(3A), 205(17), 205AC(4), 212(3), 290(3), 296(10), 378(7), 396(3) and 396A(4)). Section 199(6) is one of those provisions. The clear legislative intent of this form of words is that the natural persons identified should be held criminally liable regardless of personal fault and even in the absence of a personal statutory duty to do that which the section requires.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In any event, dealing with the respondent’s second ground of opposition to the plaintiff’s application requires me to conclude only that s 199(1) no longer places an obligation on directors and managers to keep the company’s records. That is indeed my conclusion. I need not arrive at any conclusion as to whether directors and managers, as officers of the company, continue to face criminal liability under s 199(6) for the company’s default in complying with s 199(1). To that extent, my observations above on s 199(6) are only tentative, being unnecessary for this decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For the foregoing reasons, it appears to me that there is no longer any substantive basis in s 199 to justify joining the directors as parties to an application under s 399(1) or s 409A to enforce the duty to permit inspection under s 199(3). Given that there is now no personal duty on directors and managers to keep a company’s records under s 199(1), it would be anomalous to interpret s 199(3) as continuing to impose a personal duty on the directors and managers to permit inspection of those records. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It appears to me also that there is no procedural basis to justify joining the directors as parties to an application under s 399(1) or s 409A to enforce the duty to permit inspection under s 199(3). Any relief which the court, in its discretion, grants under either section will be in the form of an order requiring the company to permit inspection of its records. That order will be enforceable as though it were a mandatory injunction granted by the court in its general civil jurisdiction. The usual way in which a mandatory injunction against a body corporate is enforced is by proceedings for contempt against the body corporate under O 45 r 5(1)(i) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) or against its directors or other officers under O 45 r 5(1)(ii). Of course, it will be necessary to show that the directors or other officers named in the contempt proceedings have a degree of personal responsibility for the company’s breach of the order (see <span class="font-italic">Director General of Fair Trading v Buckland</span><span class="font-italic"> and Another </span>[1990] 1 WLR 920 and <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">ttorney-General of Tuvalu and Another v Philatelic Distribution Corp Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and Others </span>[1990] 1 WLR 926). But that is as it should be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 If directors are no longer under a personal duty to keep the company’s records, are no longer under a personal duty to permit a director to inspect the company’s records and can be punished for their personal fault in causing a breach of the court’s order as a contempt of court, there is not even a procedural reason to construe s 199 as permitting an aggrieved director to join any of the company’s directors to his application under s 399 or s 409A. Of course, a director who wishes to be heard before any order is made may nevertheless apply to intervene and be heard under O 15 of the Rules of Court on the usual procedural principles. But an aggrieved director who names his fellow directors as co-defendants together with the company to an application such as this will be at risk for those directors’ costs even if he succeeds in his application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122  Having said that, I should point out that my conclusion on the true construction of s 199(1) is not necessary for me to dispose of the plaintiff’s application. I say that for two reasons. The first reason is that whether or not the Longsheng Directors have been properly joined to this application cannot be fatal to the application as a whole. The joinder issue affects only two aspects of this application, one substantive and one procedural. Neither aspect is a basis on which to dismiss the application in its entirety. The substantive aspect is which of the defendants is or are to be the subject of any order which I might make. It is only those defendants who will be bound by the decision and its findings, and who will be liable in their own personal capacity for a breach of that order. The procedural aspect which arises from joinder is the issue of costs. That issue arises only if I agree with the plaintiff and make the order which he seeks, but make that order against only some of the defendants. In that event, even though the overall event in this application would be in the plaintiff’s favour, the event in relation to specific defendants would not. Those defendants who are not subject to the order would have a legitimate basis on which to seek the costs of the application against the plaintiff. Neither the procedural nor the substantive aspect is a ground for dismissing the application outright. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The second reason I do not have to decide this point in order to dispose of the plaintiff’s application, of course, is that I have dismissed the plaintiff’s application entirely on the defendants’ fourth ground of opposition. That outcome makes it unnecessary for me to distinguish between the four defendants either procedurally or substantively. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is the request is too wide?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 On the third ground, the defendants argue that the plaintiff's request is too wide, too vague, and outside the ambit of s 199(3) of the Act.

</div>
</div> I do not consider that that ground can, in and of itself, ordinarily justify dismissing outright an application to compel a company to permit inspection of its records under s 199(3). That consequence could follow if the request is drawn so widely that: (a) the categories cannot be reformed either by the applicant or the court without changing fundamentally and entirely the nature and the basis of the application; or (b) it is possible to draw an inference that the plaintiff seeks to exercise his right of inspection for an ulterior purpose from the excesses of the request. In all other cases, it appears to me, this ground of objection is better addressed by reforming the request to remove its excesses, with the necessary costs consequences, rather than by dismissing the application outright and requiring the plaintiff to incur the time and costs of applying again with a reformed request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The defendants do not suggest that the categories in the plaintiff’s request cannot be reformed. And point (b) uses the width of the categories not as an independent ground for dismissing the plaintiff’s application but as evidence to support the defendants’ fourth ground: that the court ought to dismiss the plaintiff’s application because he brings it for an ulterior purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 It is therefore the defendants’ fourth ground which is fundamental to the outcome of this application. It is to that ground that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Does the plaintiff have an ulterior purpose?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The defendants submit that the plaintiff seeks to exercise his <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>right to inspect the company’s records: (a) to advance Kiri Industries’ interests in the ongoing minority oppression suit against Senda;

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I accept the defendants’ first point. There is compelling circumstantial evidence that the plaintiff’s weightiest purpose in seeking to exercise his right to inspect the company’s records is to embark on a fishing expedition to gather information to be deployed to advance Kiri Industries’ interests in the ongoing minority oppression suit. That information is not necessarily confined to the company’s accounting or other records or even to documents already in existence. The plaintiff’s purpose is an ulterior purpose because it is unrelated to his duties as a director of the company and is instead directed to advancing Kiri Industries’ specific interests in that minority oppression litigation. Further, because the ulterior purpose is the plaintiff’s weightiest purpose, it is also his primary or dominant purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I do not, however, accept the defendant’s second point. I cannot go so far as to find that the plaintiff’s ulterior purpose includes assisting Kiri Industries to compete with the DyStar group in breach of the non-competition obligation in the shareholders’ agreement. There is insufficient evidence before me to satisfy me affirmatively on that point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Three sets of circumstances lead me to conclude that the plaintiff’s primary or dominant purpose is to assist Kiri Industries in its ongoing minority oppression suit against Senda and the company. First, this application has been closely synchronised with the minority oppression suit. Second, the categories of documents and information which the plaintiff originally sought to inspect are so wide and so unrelated to the scope of s 199(3) as to invite an inference of an ulterior motive. Third, the categories of documents and information which the plaintiff now seeks to inspect by his new schedule closely tracks both a failed discovery application by Kiri Industries in the minority oppression suit and the issues in that minority oppression suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In order to explain why I have found that the plaintiff’s primary or dominant purpose in seeking to exercise his right under s 199(3) is an ulterior purpose, it is necessary at this point to sketch the factual background in more detail than I have above. I will then turn to analyse the three sets of circumstances in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factual background in more detail</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Events preceding the minority oppression suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In 2009, Kiri Industries incorporated the company as a wholly-owned subsidiary to be a vehicle to acquire certain assets from an insolvent German company in the textile dyeing industry. Kiri Industries approached the Longsheng Group to participate in the acquisition. The Longsheng Group agreed. As a result, Well Prospering acquired one share in the company together with a convertible bond. The company completed the acquisition with the proceeds of the bond. Even at that time, when Well Prospering was only a minority shareholder in the company, the shareholders’ agreement provided that it was entitled (as I have pointed out at [7] above) to majority representation on the company’s board. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In 2013, Senda acquired the convertible bond from Well Prospering and exercised the option to convert the debt which it represented into equity in the company. As a result, Kiri Industries’ majority interest in the company was diluted into a minority stake, and Senda became the company’s new majority shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 It is common ground that the company’s fortunes turned around between 2010 and 2015. The Longsheng Directors claim that they are responsible for effecting the turnaround by restructuring the company’s business. I need not determine whether that is true. Be that as it may, it is the case that from 2010 to 2015, neither Kiri Industries nor its appointed directors voiced any unhappiness about how the Longsheng Directors were managing the company or how Senda was exercising its rights as a majority shareholder.

</div> I have summarised the contents of that letter at [86] above. The company and the Longsheng Directors responded in their separate letters dated 1 August 2015. I have summarised the contents of their responses at [87] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I pause at this point to make three observations about the schedule attached to the plaintiff’s July 2015 letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 First, there is considerable force in the concern which the Longsheng directors expressed at the time about the broad-ranging nature of the plaintiff’s request for documents and information in his July 2015 letter. It is true that the request was limited in time for most categories to the first six months of 2015. But it extended to 2014 for some categories and for the past three years for one category. The main point, though, is not about the temporal scope of the request but about the width of the categories themselves. The request comprised 21 very wide categories of closely specified documents and information.

</div>
</div>
</div> Further, the plaintiff’s request was not confined to the company itself, but extended across the entire DyStar group. Thus, for example, the schedule sought in relation to each parent and subsidiary company in the DyStar group:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a detailed breakdown of each line item in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet of each company, expressed in US dollars; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) details of loans obtained and granted by each company, including copies of the loan documentation, again expressed in US dollars;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) details of selling, general and administrative expenses for each company;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) an ageing analysis of the debtors and the creditors of each company; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) details of product sales and inventory of each subsidiary; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) details of interested party and related party sales and procurement transactions between each company and associated or group companies, which the plaintiff defined to capture essentially the Longsheng Group of companies; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) details of the remuneration paid to the board of directors and to management and, in particular, paid to the Longsheng Directors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 My second observation is that the plaintiff’s stated reason for seeking the documents and information set out in the schedule was because “[i]t is important [that] board members [are] kept apprised of the financial affairs <span class="font-italic">and management</span>” [emphasis added] of the company.

</div>
</div> It is because the plaintiff’s aim in his July 2015 letter was to learn more about the management of the company that he went well beyond asking simply to see the company’s existing accounting and other records. Thus, for example, some of the categories enumerated in the schedule to his July 2015 letter – for example (a), (b) and (f) at [141] above – required the company’s management to extract, collate, analyse and summarise information for him in wholly new documents which he expected them to bring into existence “for [his] review, in advance of the next board meeting”.

</div> His request was, by its very nature and width, more akin to a request for discovery and interrogatories than a request to be permitted to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Finally, it is probably for the two foregoing reasons that the plaintiff did not frame his July 2015 letter as a request under s 199(3) of the Act to inspect the company’s accounting and other records. The plaintiff began the letter by stating that he wrote it in his capacity as a director of the company and as a member of its audit and compensation committees. He concluded the letter by foreshadowing an application to court if his request was not met. But nowhere in the letter is there any statement of the legal basis of his foreshadowed application. In particular, nowhere in the letter does he assert a right under s 199(3) to inspect the 21 categories of documents and information enumerated in the schedule. His letter does not even allude to s 199 by tracking its language in framing the request as one to inspect the company’s “accounting and other records”. Instead, what he sought was for the company’s management to produce the documents and information to him for his review. Further, the headings in his schedule recognised that he was not merely asking for documents but also for information by characterising each category blandly, albeit accurately, as “Categories of Documents / Information Required”.

The synchrony is strong circumstantial evidence that the plaintiff’s primary or dominant purpose in making this application is to advance Kiri Industries’ case in the minority oppression suit rather than any proper purpose. I refer in particular to two aspects of the timing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 First, the plaintiff asked for detailed information about the company’s related-party loans and transactions with Longsheng for the first time very soon after Mr Manishkumar was rebuffed in his suggestion that the company declare dividends for the financial year 2014 (see [137] above). It is impossible to believe that the plaintiff’s requests for information were not linked to Kiri Industries’ unhappiness over the Longsheng Directors’ refusal to declare dividends. The focused nature of the information which the plaintiff sought in his three requests from February 2015 to May 2015 is also significant: the target of his inquiry was not the general financial state of the company but the company’s specific dealings with the Longsheng Group and whether those dealings had been properly approved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Second, the plaintiff’s July 2015 letter asking the company to produce a very detailed schedule of documents and information for his review came less than a month after Kiri Industries commenced the minority oppression suit. That schedule was then annexed, with minimal modification, to this application, taken out about three months after Kiri Industries commenced the minority oppression suit (see [138]–[139] above) and when pleadings in that suit were about to close. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Width of categories sought in original schedule</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 That brings me to my second point: the width of categories which the plaintiff originally sought to inspect under this application, as set out in the schedule originally annexed to this application. Although the plaintiff withdrew and replaced the original schedule before I retired to consider my decision, the original schedule remains evidence before me. In particular, I consider it to be valuable evidence of the plaintiff’s purpose in seeking to exercise his right under s 199(3) at the time he filed this application in September 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I begin my analysis of this set of circumstances by first making some observations about the scheme of s 199 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">“Accounting and other records”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The first observation is that the company’s duty to keep records under s 199(1), and therefore the scope of the records which a director has a right to inspect under s 199(3), are inextricably linked to records which explain the company’s financial position and which enable the company to prepare its financial statements and have them audited. That observation arises from the context to be gathered both from s 199(1) itself and also from the other sections in the Act which adopt the phrase “accounting and other records”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The term “accounting and other records” is introduced by s 199(1) but is defined nowhere in the Act. The starting point to gather the meaning of the term is therefore s 199(1) itself. That section links the phrase to two particular purposes. Those purposes are: (a) to “sufficiently explain the transactions and financial position of the company” and (b) to “enable true and fair financial statements and any documents required to be attached thereto to be prepared from time to time”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 After s 199(1) introduces the phrase “accounting and other records”, it becomes a recurring theme arising in other provisions in the Act. The meaning of the phrase can therefore also be gathered from the context in which it is used in those other provisions. The phrase appears in s 201A (dormant companies exempt from duty to prepare financial statements), s 205B (dormant company exempt from audit requirements) and s 207 (powers and duties of auditors as to reports on financial statements). What this group of provisions has in common is that they all relate to a company’s obligation to prepare financial statements and to have them audited. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The connection between “accounting and other records” and the company’s financial statements and the requirement to have those financial statements audited is reinforced by the appearance of the term “true and fair financial statements” in s 199(1). That term alludes to the requirement under s 201(2) that the financial statements which the directors of a company are obliged to lay before the members annually under s 201(1) must “give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the company”. It alludes also to the requirement under s 207(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) that the auditors opine in their report on the financial statements whether those statements give a true and fair view of the company’s financial position.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The scope of the phrase is wide but not infinite</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 At the highest level of generality, therefore, “accounting and other records” within the meaning of s 199(1) are records which explain the company’s financial position and which enable the company to prepare its financial statements and to have them audited. I do not make this point to suggest that the meaning of “accounting and other records” in s 199(3) is narrowly confined only to that irreducible core of records which a company’s management, under the supervision of its directors, relies upon to draw up its financial statements much less those which a company’s auditor reviews in order to prepare its audit report under s 207. The term is undoubtedly wider than that. Judith Prakash J (as she then was) recently considered the scope of s 199(1) of the Act in <span class="font-italic">Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd </span>[2016] 2 SLR 366 (“<span class="font-italic">PNG</span>”). The central issue before Prakash J was the meaning of the phrase “books of account and other records” in a company’s articles of association (at [149]). However, she analysed in this part of her judgment a number of English, Australian and Singapore cases on provisions <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 199(1) of the Act. She noted that the word “accounts” encompasses secondary sources such as ledgers and that the word “records” encompasses primary sources of information such as the underlying source documents (at [162]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The phrase “accounting and other records” is therefore of wide scope. It is not my intention to suggest otherwise. But I make three points about the scope of the phrase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 First, although undoubtedly wide, the phrase is not of infinite scope. In <span class="font-italic">PNG</span>, Prakash J accepted that the scope of “accounting and other records” is not so wide as to encompass “financial records”, being derivative documents prepared using judgment or prediction and involving the interpretation of the underlying financial data (at [169]). <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, the phrase does not mean simply any record which the company has in its possession, custody or power, even if the record relates to the company’s financial position or its financial statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 It was suggested in 1994 that directors, being the appointed managers of a company, ought to have the right to inspect any document under the company’s ownership or control, even if that document is not necessary to understand the company’s financial position or to prepare the company’s financial statements, and that one way to do this would be by interpreting s 199 to cover even documents which have an indirect financial impact (Tan, <span class="font-italic">Director’s Statutory Rights </span>at 122). This may be the scope of a director’s common law right of inspection as described in <span class="font-italic">Burn</span> ([11] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). But in my view, it is not possible to interpret s 199 so widely without doing violence to the scheme of s 199 and of the Act as a whole. A director’s statutory right to inspect documents under s 199(3) arises only in respect of an “accounting record” or an “other record”, and it must be a record which the company is obliged to keep for one of the two purposes set out in s 199(1). That is why, for example, s 138(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act was amended with effect from 2016 specifically to deem an instrument which creates a registrable charge to form part of the company’s records which it is required to keep under s 199(1). If s 199(1) was so wide as to require no more than an indirect connection to the company’s financial position or financial statements for a document to fall within the scope of “accounting and other records”, this amendment to s 138(1A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would not have been required. A document creating a registrable charge would have come within the scope of the phrase even without a deeming provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Second, only a “record” falls within the finite scope of the phrase. The word “record” is not defined in the Act. The meaning of that word, of course, goes beyond paper records. It is apt to encompass any permanent representation of information in any medium, whether physical, magnetic, electronic or otherwise. Electronic record-keeping is specifically envisaged and authorised by s 396A(2) and (4) of the Act. The definition of “document” and “electronic record” in the Evidence Act would probably be a good starting point if it were ever necessary to arrive at an exhaustive definition of the word “record” for the purposes of s 199. But for present purposes, it suffices to note that the word “record” is not apt to encompass pure information, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, information which is not represented in a permanent form. The word “record” therefore excludes information or knowledge which resides only in the heads of the company’s directors or the company’s management team. It also excludes information which is latent in the “accounting and other records” and which can be made patent only by extracting, analysing or manipulating the information in those records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166  Third, s 199 requires the accounting and other records actually to exist. Thus, for example, if a company has failed in its duty under s 199(1) to keep “accounting and other records”, s 199(3) does not go so far as to empower a director to get a court order under s 399 or s 409A to require the company to bring those records into existence in order to comply with s 199(1) just so the director may then inspect the newly-created records under s 199(3). Such a wide interpretation of s 199(3) is not necessary to support the company’s duty under s 199(1) or to deter a breach of it. It is the criminal offence under s 199(6) which performs that function. <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, it cannot be the intent of s 199(3) to oblige a company to bring into existence documents which it is not obliged to keep under s 199(1) simply because a director asks it to do so under s 199(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Counsel for the plaintiff rightly accepted

</div> that a director’s statutory right of inspection extends only to documents that are in existence. If a director’s exercise of his right of inspection reveals any gaps in the company’s accounts and records, the remedy for the breaches of duty that have led to those gaps lies elsewhere, for example in s 199(6), under the Act’s general enforcement provisions or at common law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s original schedule went well beyond the width of s 199(3)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The schedule which the plaintiff originally annexed to his application went well beyond the width of his right to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3). That schedule listed again, verbatim, each of the 21 categories of documents and information that the plaintiff had asked the company to produce for his review by his July 2015 letter. This time, however, the heading in the schedule no longer described each category as “Documents / Information Required”. Belatedly tracking the language of s199, the heading described each category as “Categories of Accounting and Other Records Required”. In addition, and for good measure, the plaintiff added two new categories.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Merely taking the schedule which the plaintiff annexed to his July 2015 letter and amending the heading in this way before attaching it to this application was nothing but a transparent attempt to shoehorn a wide-ranging request for documents and information related to the finances and management of the company which the plaintiff made by his July 2015 letter into a request under s 199(3) of the Act to inspect the company’s records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Because the plaintiff’s original schedule in this application was (save for the two new categories and the headings) identical to the schedule attached to his July 2015 letter, my comments on the width of that earlier schedule set out at [141] above apply equally to the plaintiff’s original schedule attached to this application. Drawing on that analysis, I now summarise the respects in which the original schedule went beyond the scope of s 199(3):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The schedule comprised 23 very widely-drawn and closely-specified categories of documents and information. Insofar as it related to information, it was wholly outside the scheme of s 199. Insofar as it related to documents, it was outside the scope of s 199(3) in that some of the documents enumerated had no connection to the company’s financial position or financial statements. I point out in particular that the plaintiff’s stated reason in July 2015 for seeking to review virtually the same schedule was his desire to be kept “apprised of the financial affairs <span class="font-italic">and management</span>” [emphasis added] of the company. Documents which relate to the management of the company and which are not otherwise related to its financial position or its financial statements are not within the scope of s 199(3).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The schedule was not confined to the company itself, but extended across the entire DyStar group seeking, in large part, both documents and information relating to the DyStar Group’s dealings with the Longsheng Group. I note that Mr Leendertz has explained that the accounting software used by the company is not used to store supporting documents concerning transactions that the company’s subsidiaries have entered into.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The original schedule required the company’s management to create wholly new documents for the plaintiff to inspect rather than simply to produce for his inspection “accounting and other records” which were already in existence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The original schedule was not limited to records but extended also to information.

But when all the discrepancies are taken together and when they are considered in the round with all the other circumstances which I have identified and will now go on to identify, the inference is irresistible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Just like the schedule which the plaintiff attached to his July 2015 letter, the original schedule which the plaintiff attached to this application was, by its very nature and width, more akin to a request for discovery and to administer interrogatories than a request to be permitted to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The new schedule </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 This brings me to the final point. As I have mentioned (see [150] above), in November 2016, in correspondence with the defendants’ solicitors, the plaintiff withdrew the original schedule which had been attached to his application from the time it was filed and which I have considered in the preceding section. Instead, from November 2016, the plaintiff sought an order that either he or a public accountant acting for him be allowed to inspect an entirely new schedule of documents.

It is notable that the plaintiff’s new schedule also includes a request to inspect documents relevant to a new issue (at [179(e)] above) which was inserted into the pleadings in the minority oppression suit in December 2016, after the plaintiff first put this schedule forward to Longsheng’s solicitors in correspondence. All that the plaintiff says is that he cannot “confirm or deny” this coincidence and that the new schedule of documents was prepared with the assistance of his public accountant.

Instead, it brings to mind a director who has engaged an accountant to advise him and who has secured from that accountant a laundry list of documents and information which the accountant says he will need to review in order to construct a case of impropriety. Particularly ominous is the suffix “Preliminary” which the plaintiff attaches to both sub-categories in his new schedule.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 I do not doubt that a director of a company who learns that a minority shareholder has made allegations of oppressive conduct under s 216 of the Act against a company, its directors, shareholders or management may be justified in seeking to ascertain for himself whether those allegations have any credibility by exercising his <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> right to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3). I am even prepared to accept that that may be part of this plaintiff’s purpose in seeking to inspect the company’s records. But I do not accept that that is the plaintiff’s primary or dominant purpose in the sense of being his weightiest purpose. For the reasons I have given above, I find that his weightiest purpose is the ulterior purpose I have already adverted to. In the alternative, in the event that I am wrong and the “but for” test can operate to validate the plaintiff’s exercise of his power to inspect, I also find that the plaintiff would not have brought this application but for his ulterior purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 It would be quite different if, for example, the company had three genuinely independent shareholders (A, B and C) with A holding 51% and B and C holding the remaining 49% between them and with each of them having a nominee on the company’s board. If, in that situation, B alone were to bring a minority oppression suit against A alone, a director appointed by C may well want to inspect the company’s records for himself to ascertain the truth of those allegations and to consider what steps to take in the company’s best interest. In ascertaining the company’s best interests, he would be perfectly entitled to examine those interests from C’s perspective (see <span class="font-italic">Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and other appeals</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 304 at [58] cited in <span class="font-italic">Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another v Justlogin Pte Ltd and another</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 675 at [31]). In that situation, it would be difficult to deny the director appointed by C his <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> right to inspect the company’s records under s 199(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 But that is not the case here. In my example, C’s appointed director seeks inspection independently of either party to the minority oppression proceedings. In the application before me, and on the facts before me, I do not accept that the plaintiff is acting independently of Kiri Industries. The plaintiff asserts that he is independent of Kiri Industries because Mr Manishkumar is an employee and an executive director of Kiri Industries whereas the plaintiff is neither.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> That factor alone does not suffice to establish that the plaintiff is independent of Kiri Industries. It is outweighed by three other factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 First, it is significant to me that the plaintiff is Kiri Industries’ appointee to the company’s board. That indicates both a pre-existing, pre-appointment relationship between Kiri Industries and the plaintiff and an ongoing, post-appointment relationship between them. Second, Kiri Industries could, at any time, remove the plaintiff and replace him with another appointee. I do not, by pointing that out, suggest that Kiri Industries would be acting in any way improperly in doing so. Appointing two directors of its choice to the company’s board is its unqualified right under the shareholders’ agreement. The same is true as between Longsheng and the three Longsheng Directors. But Kiri Industries’ right to remove the plaintiff at any time for any reason does mean that the plaintiff cannot credibly assert that he is independent of Kiri Industries’ control, whether in a positive sense or in a negative sense. Finally, it is significant to me that the plaintiff has on occasion expressly chosen to speak for and on behalf of Kiri Industries. One example is in his response to the Longsheng Directors’ August 2015 letter (see [89(c)] above), where he framed his denial of wrongful competition in their letter as a denial made “on behalf of Kiri Industries”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 For the foregoing reasons, I cannot accept that the plaintiff has acted independently of Kiri Industries or that he is in fact independent of Kiri Industries in bringing this application or that the company’s interests alone are the plaintiff’s primary or dominant purpose in seeking to inspect the company’s records. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I have therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s application to inspect the company’s accounting and other records. I ought to add that I have considered whether it would be more appropriate for me to try and carve out of the plaintiff’s request a narrower subset of records which clearly fall within ss 199(1) and 199(3) of the Act. I have decided not to do so for two reasons. First, the ulterior purpose which I have found taints the plaintiff’s entire application. Second, the plaintiff’s overreach both in his original schedule and in his new schedule (which counsel for the plaintiff claims is a “narrowed” one (see [173] above)) would mean that any further narrowing by the court would amount to rewarding the overreach. A director seeking inspection under s 199(3) cannot come to the court with a laundry list and expect the court to sort, wash and fold his laundry for him so that it comes within s 199(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I have also considered whether my concerns about the plaintiff’s ulterior purpose could be addressed by undertakings from the plaintiff, Kiri Industries, and even the plaintiff’s counsel. But those undertakings will be difficult to police and enforce. That is not least because the plaintiff is not resident in Singapore and also because the same firm of solicitors represents the plaintiff in this application and Kiri Industries in its minority oppression suit. Any undertakings will also not address the real concern, which is not the overt deployment of the records in the minority oppression suit but the covert use of the documents for an ulterior purpose, whether that is the ulterior purpose I have found in advancing Kiri Industries’ interests in the minority oppression suit or other connected ulterior purposes, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to advance Kiri Industries’ interests in other litigation brought in relation to the same shareholders’ dispute or in negotiations to resolve those disputes without recourse to litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Accordingly, I have dismissed the plaintiff’s application with costs. The plaintiff shall pay to the company the costs of and incidental to this application, such costs fixed at $10,000 including disbursements. The plaintiff shall also pay one set of costs of and incidental to this application to the Longsheng Directors, with such costs fixed at $25,000 excluding disbursements. Such disbursements are to be taxed if not agreed, save only that the fees of the Longsheng Directors’ expert witness shall not be recoverable. That expert gave evidence of the records which an auditor would review in performing an audit. While that evidence was no doubt accurate, it was of no assistance to me in ascertaining the scope of the phrase “accounting and other records” in s 199. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Dinesh Dhillon Singh, Lim Dao Kai, Ivan Lim, and Nigel Yeo (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>See Chern Yang and Teng Po Yew (Premier Law LLC) for the first defendant;<br/>Nandakumar Ponniya Servai, Wong Tjen Wee, Lucas Lim, Liu Ze Ming and Daniel Ho (Wong &amp; Leow LLC) for the second, third, and fourth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
