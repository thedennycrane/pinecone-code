        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On the night of 17 February 2008, two
                    persons, Wu Jun and Cao Ruyin were walking along a pathway in an open space near
                    Geylang Drive after their dinner. Whilst they were making their way peacefully,
                    they were set upon by the two accused persons, Galing Anak Kujat
                    (“Galing”) and Jabing Kho (“Jabing”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Cao Ruyin (“the deceased”)
                    suffered severe head injuries, which led to his death on 23 February 2008,
                    and was also robbed of his handphone. Wu Jun escaped with minor
                injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Galing and Jabing were prosecuted before me on
                    the charge that they:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[o]n or about the 17<sup>th</sup> day of February 2008, at
                        about 8.19 p.m., at the open space near Geylang Drive, Singapore ... in
                        furtherance of the common intention of both of [them], committed murder by
                        doing an act which caused the death of one Cao Ruyin, male 40 years old,
                        which death took place on 23 February 2008, and [they] have thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under section 302 read with section 34 of
                        the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Galing and Jabing were not arrested for several
                    days after the assault. The records of the deceased’s handphone enabled
                    the police to conduct investigations and arrest the two accused persons and
                    their friends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There were only three persons who gave direct
                    evidence of the attack, namely, Wu Jun, and the two accused persons. At the
                    trial, the prosecution tendered in evidence seven statements taken from Galing
                    and six statements from Jabing. All these statements were admitted in evidence
                    without objection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Galing’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statement dated 26 February 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The first statement recorded from Galing was
                    recorded by Senior Station Inspector Razali bin Razak (“SSI
                    Razali”). In this statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Galing recounted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 17/02/2008 at about 10:00 pm plus, my friends namely Vincent, Jabing,
                        two Sarawak guys whose name I could not remember and I walked along Lorong 4
                        Geylang going to Lorong 12 Geylang for drink. Whilst we were walking along
                        the road, suddenly Jabing cross the road. Seeing this, I also crossed the
                        road to follow him while the others did not cross the road. Jabing then told
                        me to look at two male Chinese walking beside the road. I then asked Jabing
                        what we are going to do. Jabing replied that we robbed the two male Chinese.
                        I told Jabing not to do it. Jabing did not reply and just walked behind the
                        two male Chinese. I then saw Jabing took a piece of wood near a tree. After
                        a few steps, Jabing used the wood to hit on the male Chinese who has a
                        bigger built on his head. The other smaller male Chinese wanted to beat
                        Jabing and I approached the smaller Chinese and took out the belt that I was
                        wearing belonging to my friend and used the belt to beat the smaller male
                        Chinese at his face.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    Afterwhich, I saw the bigger size male Chinese try
                            to run but Jabing continue to beat him. I then chased the smaller male
                            Chinese for quite a distance but he managed to run away. I then turn
                            around and walk towards Jabing. I then saw the bigger male Chinese was
                            already on the ground. After that I saw the smaller male Chinese came
                            back towards me. Jabing then chased the smaller male Chinese and I let
                            him do so. I then took the handphone belonging to the bigger male
                            Chinese on his right waist. After taking the handphone I ran and shouted
                            to Jabing not to chase the smaller male Chinese anymore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Jabing then stopped chasing the smaller male Chinese
                            and followed me use the overhead bridge to cross the opposite side of
                            the road to meet up with Vincent and the two Sarawak guys who were
                            waiting for us. After that the five of us walked to Lorong 24 Geylang.
                            When we reached the coffee shop were order tiger beer to drink. I then
                            told Jabing, Vincent and the two Sarawak guys that I want to sell away
                            the stolen handphone. Vincent told me not to sell and I asked who wants
                            to use the handphone. Vincent told me that he wants to use the handphone
                            first and I asked Vincent whether he got any money. Vincent said he got
                            money and I asked for $300/- to use for drinking. Vincent then took out
                            cash of $300/- to me and I gave Vincent the N73 handphone. I told
                            Vincent that he used the handphone first and at the end of the month I
                            will take back the handphone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Vincent then opened the cover of the handphone to
                            remove the SIM card and I open my handphone cover and took out my SIM
                            card and I insert it into the N73 handphone. I then switched on the N73
                            handphone and find out that it has a pin number. I tried to key in any
                            number as the pin number but was not successful. Vincent then took the
                            N73 handphone and try for few times but also was not successful. Vincent
                            told me that the N73 handphone must be sent to a handphone shop. I then
                            told Vincent to do it and asked back for my SIM card. After we finished
                            drinking till morning about 6:00 am, I left the coffee shop leaving the
                            four of them behind. At about 6:15 am, I took a bus and go back to my
                            working place at Sebarok Island.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(The person referred to as “Vincent” is also
                    referred to as “Vencent”, and his full name is Vencent Anak
                    Anding.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cautioned statement dated 26 February 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A cautioned statement was recorded from Galing
                    later on the same day in response to a charge that he, Vencent Anak Anding and
                    three other persons had murdered the deceased. The statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not have the intention to commit murder but my friend Jabing was too
                        violent when hitting the Chinese man until he bled profusely. I saw him
                        hitting the Chinese man several times and his head cracked open. Jabing used
                        a piece of wood which he picked up from the road side. While the Chinese man
                        was holding his head, I took a handphone from his waist pouch. When I was
                        taking this handphone, Jabing chased after another Chinese man. This man is
                        thin. I shouted at Jabing to stop chasing the Chinese man. He stopped, and
                        we took the overhead bridge to join three other friends who were across the
                        road. I suggested to the four of them to follow me to Lor 24 Geylang for
                        drinks. We drank about six bottles of Tiger Beer. Before we started drinking
                        I told them that I wanted to sell the handphone. My friend Vencent then
                        informed me that he would keep the handphone and advance a sum of three
                        hundred dollars. He took out three hundred dollars and gave it to me. I told
                        Vencent that I will return three hundred dollars to him and collect the
                        phone back when I have the money. I gave fifty dollars each to Vencent,
                        Jabing and two other friends. I do not know their names. I also used some of
                        the money to pay for the bottles of beer. I wish to say again that I have no
                        intention to kill the Chinese man. I did not expect the Chinese man to die.
                        I really regretted that Jabing hit him so many times until he died. I am
                        sorry. I have no intention to kill him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Investigation statements recorded on 3, 4 and 6 March
                    2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Investigation Officer of the case, Senior
                    Station Inspector Zainal Abidin Ismail (“SSI Zainal”) recorded
                    investigation statements from Galing on 3, 4 and 6 March 2008 with the service
                    of a Malay interpreter, Marriana. In these statements Galing recounted that on
                    17 February 2008, Vencent had proposed to him that they rob two Bangladeshi
                    persons. Galing agreed, and went to Tiong Bahru where the robbery was to take
                    place. Other persons, namely, Jabing and Anthony Anak Jaban also agreed to join
                    them in the scheme. The robbery was aborted because the group could not find the
                    two targets. Another person, Alan Anak Ajan, joined the group, and they consumed
                    liquor known as “Narcissus Ginseng Wine Tonic”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Eventually they left Tiong Bahru and went to
                    Geylang. Galing stated that his intention was to meet some friends there and to
                    drink with them. Galing’s account of the events that followed merits
                    reproduction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    Past 7.00 pm, we arrived at Kallang MRT and all of
                            us alighted there. From Kallang MRT we walked towards Lor 4 by foot.
                            Jabing and I were walking in front of the Vencent, Alan and Anthony. We
                            walked past by block of flats and shops. We crossed the road using the
                            pedestrian crossing and walked into Lor 4 Geylang Road. Once at Lor 4,
                            Jabing and I walked to the other end of Lor 4 towards Lor 12. Suddenly,
                            I saw Jabing crossed the road towards the open space. [Established to be
                            Sims Way]. On seeing this, I followed him and caught up with Jabing at
                            the centre of the road divider. I asked him what was going on. He
                            pointed tome 2 male Chinese who were walking along the cemented path
                            across the open field. Both of them were walking towards the other side
                            of the road where there were several lorries were parking. Jabing told
                            me that he wanted to rob those 2 persons. I told him not to do so but he
                            ignored me. Jabing was walking slightly ahead of me. I saw him picked a
                            wood from the ground which look like a tree branch that had just been
                            cut from the trees. The said wood is about 2 feet long. Jabing carried
                            it with his right hand by his side and walked hurriedly towards the rear
                            of the 2 male Chinese. I would like to say that one of male Chinese was
                            smaller in built whist the other was bigger built. When Jabing neared
                            both of them, he used both his hands and swung the wood towards the
                            right side of the bigger built make Chinese. On being hit, that said
                            male Chinese held his head and ran forward. The other smaller built male
                            Chinese stepped aside and ran but he turned back and ran after Jabing
                            who was chasing the bigger built male Chinese. On seeing this, I took
                            the belt I was wearing and I rolled part of the belt with my left hand
                            with its buckle exposed. I swung the buckle of the belt towards the
                            smaller built male Chinese.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    I struck part of the smaller built Chinese’s
                            face with the belt and he ran towards the main road. I chased him but he
                            ran very fast and I could not catch up with him. I gave up the chase and
                            turned back towards Jabing who was hitting the other Chinese with the
                            wood in his hands repeatedly at the end of the open space where there is
                            an electricity sub station. I joined Jabing to hit the said bigger built
                            male Chinese with the belt I was holding. I struck the belt at the front
                            part of the body once. By then the said male Chinese knelt and
                            subsequently fell on the ground holding his head. He was facing up. When
                            this was going on, the smaller built male Chinese came back towards us.
                            Jabing rushed towards him and he ran back to the main road. I took the
                            handphone of the bigger built male Chinese from the pouch at his right
                            waist that was already lying face up on the ground. I notice there was
                            blood on his face. After taking the handphone, I rant to the overhead
                            bridge and shouted to Jabing to stop chasing the other smaller built
                            Chinese. Jabing and I then crossed the road by the overhead bridge where
                            Vencent, Alan and Anthony were waiting for us near the temple at Lor 4.
                            On seeing us, the three of them walked towards Lor 12. Jabing and I
                            followed them a distant away within sight. Midway along Lor 12, Jabing
                            and I took another route and walked to Lor 24. Before Jabing and I
                            parted company with the three of them I told the three of them to meet
                            us at the coffee shop at Lor 24.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Jabing and I arrived at the coffee shop ... . I
                            told the rest that Jabing had beaten one of the male Chinese very badly
                            and the male Chinese could have died. I told Jabing off that his action
                            was not warranted to that extend by beating the man so badly.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Galing went on to state that Vencent paid him
                    $300 for the stolen handphone, and he distributed $50 of that to each member of
                    the group and used the remaining $50 to pay for their food and drinks.
                    (Subsequently, Vencent sold the handphone to a dealer, and that enabled the
                    police to trace and apprehend him, Jabing and the others.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Galing added in his statement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    I wish to add that Jabing, Vencent, Alan, Anthony
                            and I never have anytime planned to commit robbery in Geylang when the
                            plan to rob at Tiong Bahru failed. We did not discuss anything about
                            committing robber in Geylang. I just happened spontaneously when Jabing
                            rushed to attack the 2 male Chinese.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When he was questioned by the recording
                    officer about the targeting of the two victims at Geylang, Galing
                    explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was Jabing. Jabing was walking along the main road beside Lor 4. I was
                        walking inside Lor 4 in parallel with Jabing. Vencent, Alan and Anthony were
                        behind me. When I saw Jabing crossed the road, I followed suit. Like I said,
                        I caught with him at the centre road divider and both of us crossed the road
                        together towards the open space. When both of us had reached the open space,
                        Jabing pointed to me of the 2 male Chinese walking ahead of us. After Jabing
                        had picked the wood on the ground and started to attack them, I took out my
                        belt from my waist and chased after the smaller built male Chinese.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Jabing’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statement of 26 February 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The first statement of Jabing was recorded on
                    26 February 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> by SSI
                    Zainal. In the statement, Jabing recounted that Galing, Vencent, Anthony and
                    Alan were planning to rob two Bangladeshi persons in Tiong Bahru, but were
                    unable to carry that out because they could not find the two men.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     He then went on to say that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    ... Since, their intended target had gone, we
                            suggested amongst ourselves to go to Geylang to rob and all of us
                            agreed. We shared and bought another bottle of Chinese ginseng and all
                            of us consumed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    At about 6.30 pm, the 5 of us took the train at
                            Tiong Bahru MRT Station and headed towards Geylang. I used my EZlink
                            card and the others might have used their own EZlink cards. I am not
                            very sure. We arrived at Kallang MRT station at about .00 pm and all of
                            us alighted. We crossed the road infront of Kallang MRT and walked
                            towards Lorong 4 Geylang Road. We loitered around Lorong 4 Geylang Road
                            to look for a suitable victim. This was the
                                1<sup>st</sup> time I followed them to commit
                            robbery. They told me that they preferred Bangladeshi which I do not
                            know the reason why. We walked in a small group of 2 and 3. I was
                            walking with Galing ahead of them. Vencent, Alan and Anthony were behind
                            us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    About ½ hour after we loitered at Lor 4, Galing
                            signalled to me towards 2 male Chinese who were walking from Lor 4
                            towards Kallang. Both of the male Chinese were crossing the road and
                            walking towards the open space. Galing immediately ran and crossed the
                            road. I followed suit. I did not turn back to look at the rest of us. I
                            wish to say that Galing had earlier taken out his belt and held it on
                            his right hand. I knew that Galing was wearing a belt with a metal
                            buckle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Whilst running after the 2 male Chinese, I picked up
                            a wood which I found on the ground. It was a branch of a tree that was
                            cut and was being left there. The length of the wood is about a foot and
                            it was not that heavy. Having picked up that wood, I saw Galing was
                            about to strike one of the male Chinese with his belt in his hands. The
                            other male Chinese ran and I chased after him. Halfway running, I gave
                            up and turned back towards Galing who was wrestling with the other male
                            Chinese. Both of them were standing facing each other and were
                            struggling. I came from behind and joined Galing to attack the male
                            Chinese. On seeing this, Galing broke free from the said male Chinese
                            and retreated few steps behind. I then swung the wood towards the head
                            of the male Chinese. I am not sure I swung it at the back of the front
                            of his head. Upon being struck by the wood, he fell to the ground facing
                            up. Galing then hit him with the belt buckle on the head and I could see
                            blood coming out from the head. I then swung the wood on the head again.
                            After that, I ran and crossed the road towards Lorong 4. Whilst running,
                            I threw the wood on the ground and I did not turn back. I ran through
                            the back lanes and reached a coffee shop at Lor 24. I wish to say that
                            Vencent had called me that they were waiting for me there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and that Galing sold the handphone to Vencent for $300, and each
                    of them received $50 from the proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cautioned statement of 27 February 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     A cautioned statement was recorded from Jabing
                    in response to a charge of murder of the deceased in further of a common
                    intention of him, Vencent, Galing, Alan and an unknown person. Jabing’s
                    statement was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have no intention of killing the victim. My intention is only to rob
                        him. After I had reached Kallang MRT, the 5 of us walked and looked out for
                        victims that is easy to rob. About half an hour later, we met the victim. At
                        that time, I and the rest, followed the victim from behind. After that, I
                        and ‘Galing’ followed the victim. The 3 remained behind. When we
                        reached at the place of the incident, me and ‘Galing’ attack
                        victim. After I had hit victim twice, I ran off. When I was running away, I
                        noticed ‘Galing’ was still behind hitting the victim, using his
                        belt. ‘Galing’ had taken the victim’s handphone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Investigation statements recorded on 4, 7 and 13 March
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     SSI Zainal recorded the investigation
                    statements from Jabing on 4, 7 and 13 March 2008 with the help of the Malay
                    interpreter, Marriana. These statements form parts of a continuing
                    narration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Jabing recounted that when the robbery at
                    Tiong Bahru was aborted, Anthony suggested to the rest of the group that they go
                    to Geylang to rob because there was an open field opposite Lorong 4 which was an
                    ideal place for a robbery as it was dark and secluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Jabing then referred to the events leading to
                    the attack. He stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    I wish to add that when the robbery plan at Tiong
                            Bahru failed, Anthony was the one who suggested that all of us go to
                            Geylang to rob. He told us that he knows of a place where many vehicles
                            are park and there is an open field. Anthony had suggested that we only
                            targeted victim walking towards the open field opposite Lor 4. Anthony
                            added that this place is an ideal place to rob since it is dark and
                            secluded. When Anthony said this, Vencent, Galing, Alan and I were still
                            at the multi-purpose hall at Tiong Bahru. All of us agreed to his idea.
                            I decided to join them since I was drunk and I needed money
                        too.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    ... When we arrived at Kallang, the five of us
                            walked together towards Lor 4. I am familiar with Lor 4 Geylang since I
                            have been there many times. The five of us loitered around Lor 4 to look
                            for a suitable victim to rob. What I meant a suitable victim is, a
                            person walking alone or in twos. We targeted foreigners immaterial of
                            their nationalities. Since there were five of us, we can outnumber any
                            foreigners walking in small group.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    ... I was walking behind Galing along the main road
                            beside Lor 4. Vencent, Alan and Anthony were walking inside Lor 4 and we
                            were walking in parallel position. There is a green fencing that
                            separates the three of them and both of us. Galing spotted 2 male
                            Chinese crossing the road and signalled to me. I saw 2 male Chinese
                            crossing the road towards the open field. On seeing this opportunity
                            that we were looking for, I crossed the road behind Galing. I caught up
                            with Galing at the centre road divider and both of us then crossed the
                            road together. I did not turned back to look at Vencent, Alan and
                            Anthony. I now draw the sketch of the place and the event that took
                            place that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    Like I have stated in my earlier statement, soon
                            after Galing and I crossed the road to the open field, I picked a wood
                            which I found on the ground. When I looked up, I saw a smaller built
                            victim was running away and I started to chase him. By then Galing had
                            started to hit the other male Chinese who is bigger built. I gave up the
                            chase and turned around to help Galing who was by then was struggling
                            with the said male Chinese. I came from behind and used the wood that I
                            was holding on the head of the bigger built male Chinese. I am not sure
                            whether I swung it hard or not since I was drunk. The single blow on the
                            head by me caused the said male Chinese to fall onto the ground facing
                            up. Galing then used his belt with the buckle of star shape and hit that
                            person. I am not sure how many times Galing hit that man. Whilst the
                            said man was already lying face up, I was standing on his right side, I
                            swung the wood that I was holding onto his head one more time. I am not
                            sure of the force of the blow onto his head this second time as I was
                            drunk. As I was about to run, I threw the wood that I was holding. I
                            turned around and saw Galing was searching the pockets of the victim who
                            was lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Wu Jun’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Wu Jun was a construction worker from China.
                    The deceased was from his same village in China. On 17 February 2008, the
                    deceased had visited him. They had dinner, and when it was time for the deceased
                    to return to his lodging, Wu Jun accompanied him to the Kallang MRT
                    station.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As they were walking along a paved pathway at
                    the open field, he was hit at the back of his head by something hard like a
                    metal object. (He was subsequently brought to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for
                    treatment and was found to have a left ear laceration and abrasions in the
                    temporal region of his head.) He ran a few steps forward, turned round and saw a
                    male person wearing a cap coming towards him in a menacing manner with a
                    clenched fist, and he carried on running as fast as he could. He heard the
                    deceased groaning in pain. However, he did not know whether he or the deceased
                    was attacked first, how the deceased was attacked or who attacked the
                    deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After running about forty steps he stopped. He
                    called for the police on his handphone and retraced his steps along the
                    pavement. He found the deceased lying unconscious on the grass alone. The
                    deceased had blood on his face and was vomiting blood. Wu Jun noticed that the
                    deceased’s handphone which was usually kept in his waist pouch was
                    missing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The deceased’s injuries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The deceased was brought from the scene of the
                    attack to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
                    Dr Ho Chi Long (“Dr Ho”), the physician who saw the
                    deceased and operated on him certified that on admission, the deceased was in a
                    deep coma and had facial injuries. The deceased had sustained life threatening
                    injuries. CT scans revealed several depressed skull fractures including multiple
                    comminuted, displaced and depressed fractures involving the frontal, bilateral
                    parietal and occipital bones with fractured ethmoid septae, and swelling of the
                    brain. He underwent surgery on that day, and further surgery on the following
                    day, but he did not recover and died on 23 February 2008. Dr Ho was of
                    the view that the primary cause of death was the severe head
                injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Dr Ho was unable to tell if the head
                    fractures were caused by a blunt or a sharp instrument, but they were caused by
                    a huge force that could have come from several blows. In answer to a question
                    from Mr Chandra Mohan, counsel for Galing, Dr Ho stated that it was
                    impossible for the injuries to have been sustained from a fall from a standing
                    position. In response to a question from Mr Johan, counsel for Jabing,
                    Dr Ho could not say whether the head injuries could have been sustained by
                    the deceased falling forwards after being hit from behind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Pathologist Dr Teo Eng Swee
                    (“Dr Teo”) performed the autopsy on the deceased. In his
                    autopsy report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> he noted
                    that there were fourteen fractures of the skull with three areas of severe
                    haemorrhage, and that the brain was soft and severely oedematous (swollen).
                    Dr Teo certified the cause of death to be severe head injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Dr Teo explained that the severe head
                    injury recorded in his autopsy report did not refer to the fractures of the
                    skull. The fractures by themselves were not the fatal injury. The fatal injury
                    was the injury to the brain. The brain was very swollen, and the swelling
                    decreased the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. The lack of oxygen supply
                    to the brain is known as hypoxia. The swelling of the brain also caused it to
                    shift position in the skull, and that is known as herniation. The hypoxia and
                    the herniation together with brain contusions and brain haemorrhage made up the
                    severe head injury, and the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of
                    nature to cause death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Dr Teo was of the opinion that the skull
                    fractures could have been caused by five impacts or more, and that one fracture
                    could have resulted from a blow or a fall on the back of the head, and that the
                    initial fragmentation of the skull required severe force, but when the skull was
                    fractured, the further fractures could be caused by less severe
                force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The prosecutor showed Dr Teo the belt and
                    buckle that Galing used in the assault, and sought Dr Teo’s
                    assistance to make connections between the buckle and the deceased’s
                    injuries, but Dr Teo was cautious and declined to draw any
                    conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When Dr Teo was informed of
                    Galing’s account in his statement that a severed tree branch about two
                    feet long was used by Jabing to strike at the deceased, Dr Teo agreed that
                    such a weapon was capable of causing the injuries that were found on the
                    deceased’s skull.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     When Mr Johan sought to get Dr Teo
                    to develop on his conclusion that one of the fractures may have been the result
                    of a fall, Dr Teo put the matter into context and explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not rule out definitively that this fracture ... is due to a fall,
                        but taking the injuries that I see in totality and not [that fracture] in
                        isolation, the injuries are due to blunt force.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">and he clarified in re-examination that a fall could not cause all the
                    fractures that were sustained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The accused persons’ statements and the
                    medical evidence was the core of the prosecution’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Neither counsel submitted that there was no
                    case for his client to answer. When I called on both accused persons to enter
                    their defence both of them gave evidence, but did not call any
                witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence of Galing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Galing is 25 years old and he had come to
                    Singapore to work. He helped to load oil onto ships.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     He relied on his statements as his defence.
                    His defence was that he did not cause the death of the deceased and that the
                    death was not caused in the furtherance of the common intention of him and
                    Jabing. He began his evidence saying that he had borrowed the belt that he wore
                    and used from Anthony on the morning of 17 February 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     He then recounted that Vencent had proposed
                    robbing two Bangladeshis who had just received their salary. He agreed, and went
                    to Tiong Bahru with Anthony. At Tiong Bahru they met up with Vencent, and
                    subsequently Jabing and Alan joined them. The five of them had bought and drank
                    ginseng liquor after the robbery was called off. After they had their drinks, he
                    told the others that he was going to continue drinking with his friends in
                    Geylang, and the others agreed to go to Geylang with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     They went from Tiong Bahru by the MRT to the
                    Kallang MRT station. Upon arrival at the Kallang MRT station, they proceeded to
                    Lorong 4 Geylang. He first went to a hotel, the Yunnan Hotel, to change into
                    fresh clothes that were kept there. He then rejoined the group and told the
                    others that he was going to Lorong 12 to have drinks with friends there, and
                    they went on together towards Lorong 12. Along the way, they split into two
                    groups. He and Jabing were walking along a higher stretch of the road, and the
                    other three were walking along a lower stretch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     After he and Jabing passed an overhead bridge,
                    Jabing crossed the road. He followed Jabing, and when they were on the middle
                    road divider, he asked Jabing where he was going, and Jabing told him that he
                    wanted to rob two Chinese men who were on the other side of the road. He told
                    Jabing not to do that, but Jabing ignored him and continued to cross the
                    road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Galing was still on the road divider when he
                    saw Jabing pick up something from the ground and went towards the two Chinese
                    men, and hit one of them. The other Chinese man wanted to fight with Jabing.
                    Galing took off his belt and went to Jabing’s assistance. He rolled up the
                    belt in his left hand, and hit one of the Chinese men once at the back part of
                    his body, and that man ran away and Galing chased him. (Galing confirmed in
                    court that that person was Wu Jun). When Galing failed to catch up with Wu Jun,
                    he retraced his steps. As he came to the deceased who was seated and was getting
                    up, he hit the deceased on the area of the chest but he did not think that it
                    could cause serious injury or death to the deceased. After hitting him, he
                    noticed the deceased’s handphone and he took it. In the meantime, Jabing
                    was chasing after Wu Jun who had apparently returned to the scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     He went on to Lorong 12 to look for the
                    friends he intended to meet, but did not find them. Subsequently, he joined the
                    other members of the group at a coffee shop at Lorong 24. He showed the
                    handphone to the others, and Vencent paid him $300 for it. With the $300, he
                    paid $50 to each member of the group and left the remaining $50 to pay for the
                    food and drinks they were having.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     During cross-examination he qualified parts of
                    his statements relating to his taking of the deceased’s handphone and
                    Jabing’s assault on the deceased. When Mr Johan questioned him on his
                    cautioned statement where he stated “... I saw him [Jabing] hitting the
                    Chinese man several times and his head cracked open” he gave inconsistent
                    answers. He said “As far as I can recall, I did not say
                        that”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and “The IO told me that the
                    person was already dead. I was frightened ... so I said all these
                        things.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     More inconsistencies were to follow when he
                    was cross-examined by the prosecutor. He admitted that he took the
                    deceased’s handphone but said that it was on the ground. When it was
                    pointed out to him that he had stated in his cautioned statement “While
                    the Chinese man was holding his head, I took a handphone from his waist
                    pouch” his explanation was “... I was frightened and I was told by
                    the officer that I must cooperate. That is why I said this in my
                    statement” and “It was a suggestion made by the IO. I merely
                    agreed to the suggestion.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Galing had stated on three occasions in his
                    statements that he had taken the handphone from the deceased’s waist or
                    waist pouch.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He did not offer any reason for insisting in
                    court that it was on the ground when he took it. In any event, the legal
                    character of his action was similar whether the handphone was taken from the
                    deceased’s waist, or from the ground after the deceased dropped it during
                    the assault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When Galing persisted that he had seen Jabing
                    hit the deceased once, the prosecutor referred him to his first
                        statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> where he
                    had stated “... Jabing used the wood to hit on the male Chinese who has a
                    bigger built on his head” and “... I saw the bigger size male
                    Chinese try to run but Jabing continue to beat him” and to his cautioned
                    statement which recorded that “I saw him hitting the Chinese man several
                    times and his head cracked open” and his investigation
                        statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    that “Jabing who was hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands
                    repeatedly ...”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Galing’s explanation was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I told the IO that Jabing hit the deceased only once but the IO told me,
                        “How can one strike result in the head being cracked open?” So
                        I had to tag along with him and say that Jabing hit the deceased several
                            times.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">When the prosecutor also referred him to another part of his
                    investigation statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> where it
                    was recorded “I gave up the Chinese and turned back towards Jabing who
                    was hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands repeatedly ...”
                    he gave a similar explanation that “... I did say this in my statement
                    but I also remember the IO saying that it must be several blows. But I recall
                    ... seeing Jabing hitting only once.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the course of cross-examination by the
                    prosecution, Galing agreed that he should proceed along the side of Sims Way
                    that he was on to go to Lorong 12, and that when he crossed Sims Way and went
                    onto the open ground as he did, he was going out of the way.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In re-examination by his counsel, Galing added
                    confusion to the matters. He stated that no one had suggested the use of
                    “continue” in his first statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and that the recording officer SSI Razali
                    was not involved in the use of the word.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     No issue on the accuracy of the recording and
                    interpretation of the statements were raised when the statements were admitted
                    into evidence during the prosecution’s case. After they were raised in the
                    course of defence case, Mr Chandra Mohan applied for three officers SSI
                    Razali, who recorded the first statement, SSI Zainal, who recorded the
                    investigation statements and Marriana, the Malay interpreter who assisted SSI
                    Zainal in the recording of the investigation statements, to be recalled for
                    further examination, and they were recalled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Counsel put to them Galing’s allegations
                    on the recording of the statements, but they rejected each allegation and
                    maintained that the statements faithfully and accurately recorded what Galing
                    had said. I accepted their evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence of Jabing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Jabing is 24 years old and is from Sarawak. He
                    was working in Singapore for a <em>karung guni</em>
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     He did not dispute the admissibility and the
                    accuracy of his statements which were admitted in evidence. When he gave his
                    evidence in chief, he kept to his statements and elaborated on parts of his
                    account of the events. Notably, he said that after he consumed the ginseng
                    liquor with his friends at Tiong Bahru, he was ‘high’. Nevertheless,
                    he confirmed that the group had gone to Geylang to rob and that he and Galing
                    had trailed the two Chinese (i.e. Wu Jun and the deceased) because they wanted
                    to rob them. He confirmed that he had picked up a tree branch about a foot long,
                    but he could not explain why he did that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     His evidence on his assault of the deceased
                    was that he hit the deceased on the head, but he did not know the force he used,
                    or the part of the head he hit because he was drunk. He also said that he had
                    not aimed for the deceased’s head because his mind was blank and it just
                    happened that he hit the head. He recalled that when the deceased fell, and
                    turned his body to face upwards, he hit the deceased again, but he cannot
                    remember where the second hit landed. Jabing maintained that he had no intention
                    to hit the deceased on the head, and did not intend to kill him. Mr Chandra
                    Mohan questioned him on the involvement between him and Galing in the assault.
                    Jabing agreed that there was no planning on the execution of the robbery, no
                    agreement on the location of the robbery or the division of functions, no common
                    intention on the use of weapons, and no common intention to assault or
                    kill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     When the prosecutor cross-examined him, Jabing
                    was unable to explain why he followed Galing when he crossed the road. He
                    acknowledged when he trailed the victims, he intended to rob them. He claimed
                    that his intention was to punch the victims, but when he saw the branch, he
                    “just took it”. He also agreed that he did not gave the deceased
                    any forewarning of his approach, and had not issued any threats before he hit
                    him. He also maintained that he did not aim for the deceased’s head when
                    he struck, and it was only when the deceased fell to the ground holding his head
                    that he realised he had struck the deceased’s head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evaluation of the evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In every case, there will be disputes over
                    some facts. The disputes may arise between the prosecution and the accused
                    persons or between the accused persons themselves. Some areas of disputes could
                    be material, and others less so, depending on the circumstances of the case. In
                    this case, there are two areas of dispute that are material and have to be
                    addressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a common intention to rob the deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Jabing admitted that he and Galing had spotted
                    Wu Jun and the deceased and they had intended to rob them, but Galing denied
                    that he had any intention to rob. He admitted that he had intended to rob the
                    two Bangladeshis in Tiong Bahru. When that was aborted, he went with his friends
                    to Geylang with the intention to seek out other friends in Lorong 12 and to
                    drink with them. He did not want to rob the two Chinese men, and had told Jabing
                    not to do it, but was nevertheless drawn into the events that
                followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I did not accept Galing’s explanation
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_i"></a>(i)     he was prepared to rob, and had
                        intended to do that in Tiong Bahru;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     his claim that he was on the way to Lorong 12 was
                        inconsistent with his action because he should not have crossed Sims Way and
                        gone onto the open field if he wanted to proceed to
                    Lorong 12;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     he knew that Jabing was going to rob, and he stayed on with Jabing and
                        assisted him in attacking the victims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     he completed the robbery by taking the
                        deceased’s handphone; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_v"></a>(v)     he shared the proceeds on the sale of the handphone with
                        Jabing and the others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These facts showed that he was a
                    willing participant in the robbery with Jabing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Galing and Jabing knew that death was likely to be
                caused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The evidence of Dr Teo indicated that the
                    deceased’s death resulted from the head injuries. Although Galing did not
                    inflict those injuries, he saw Jabing picking up the tree branch. He also armed
                    himself with the belt buckle which he used as a weapon. It was clear that Galing
                    and Jabing intended to use their weapons in the robbery because they did not
                    seek to obtain the victims’ possessions by demand or the threat of
                    violence, but had proceeded immediately to use their weapons on them. Their
                    intention was to rob their victims by the use of force. It was telling that
                    Galing had not said in his statements and his evidence that he was surprised
                    when Jabing held the branch in both hands and struck the deceased with it. I
                    find that Galing knew that when he and Jabing robbed the deceased, the deceased
                    would be assaulted and serious injuries might be inflicted on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the case of Jabing, he admitted in his
                    first statement of 26 February 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that he swung the branch towards the head
                    of the deceased. He also recalled in his investigation statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> that the single blow
                    caused the deceased to fall onto the ground. Galing, his accomplice, recalled in
                    his cautioned statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> that the
                    deceased’s head cracked open when Jabing hit him on the head. In his
                    investigation statement, Galing had also narrated that Jabing had beaten the
                    deceased so badly that he could have died.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Jabing’s narration of the events showed
                    that he was not so drunk that he did not know or remember his actions, and he
                    knew what he was doing. In any event, he could not plead drunkenness as a
                    defence because s 85(2) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by
                        reason thereof the person charged at the time of the act or omission
                        complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or did not
                        know what he was doing and –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the state of intoxication was caused without his consent by the
                            malicious or negligent act of another person; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the person charged was, by reason of intoxication, insane,
                            temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and he had not satisfied conditions (a) or
                (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Against this background, I find that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_i"></a>(i)     the two accused persons had the
                        common intention to commit robbery;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     each of them knew that it was likely that serious injury
                        might be inflicted on the victims in the course of the
                    robbery;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     that
                        Jabing intentionally inflicted head injuries on the deceased;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the injuries
                        inflicted were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death
                        and did cause the deceased’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Galing and Jabing had the necessary common intention under
                s 34 of the Penal Code</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The law relating to common intention and
                    s 34 was thoroughly reviewed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Chez Kee v PP</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447. In the leading
                    judgment, V K Rajah JA concluded in the “Summary of the correct
                    interpretation of section 34 of the Penal Code” that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">253    Thus, I can now summarise what I
                        regard as the correct interpretation of s 34 of the Penal Code, taking
                        into account the typical requirements to make s 34 of the Penal Code
                        applicable, viz, (a) a criminal act; (b) participation in the doing of the
                        act; (c) a common intention between the parties; and (d) an act done in
                        furtherance of the common intention of the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)     Criminal act: Section 34 does not
                            refer to the actual crime committed only. It is essential to realise
                            that the expression "criminal act" is not synonymous with "offence" as
                            defined in s 40 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)     Participation: Presence at the scene
                            of the criminal act, primary or collateral, need no longer be rigidly
                            insisted on for s 34 of the Penal Code to apply. In a "twin crime"
                            situation [eg robbery and murder], there is no need for participation in
                            the collateral criminal act as well as the primary criminal act;
                            participation in the primary criminal act would be sufficient for
                            liability to fix on all subsequent secondary offenders. The crux of the
                            section is participation, and presence may or may not provide the
                            evidence for participation; this is a question of fact to be decided in
                            each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)     Proving the common intention: To
                            prove the common intention between the parties, inferences must be made
                            from the circumstances of the case to show that the criminal act was
                            committed in furtherance of a pre-arranged plan such as the conduct of
                            the parties, the weapons used and the nature of the wounds inflicted.
                            However, such inferences should never be made unless it was a necessary
                            inference deducible from the circumstances of the case. All the
                            circumstances, including antecedent and subsequent conduct, are relevant
                            in inferring the common intention of all involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d)     In furtherance of the common
                            intention: There is no need for the common intention of the parties to
                            be to commit the offence actually committed in a "twin crime" situation,
                            otherwise the words "in furtherance" would be superfluous. The Mimi Wong
                                [<em>Wong Mimi &amp; Anor v PP</em>
                            [1971-1973] SLR(R) 412]approach to the interpretation of
                            s 34 of the Penal Code is justified by the historical underpinnings
                            of the Indian Penal Code and the doctrine of common purpose in English
                            law. The additional mens rea required of the secondary offenders is that
                            of a subjective knowledge on the part of the secondary offender in
                            relation to the likelihood of the collateral offence happening. To be
                            more precise, the secondary offender must subjectively know that one in
                            his party may likely commit the criminal act constituting the collateral
                            offence in furtherance of the common intention of carrying out the
                            primary offence. There is no need to have known of the actual method of
                            execution in a murder situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the common intention of Galing and Jabing was to
                    rob, and not to kill, they knew that there was the likelihood that serious
                    injury might be inflicted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether murder was committed in furtherance of the common
                intention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Was the common intention sufficient to support
                    a charge of murder? Section 300 of the Penal Code states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is
                        murder —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)   if the act by which the death is caused is done
                            with the intention of causing death;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)   if it is done with the intention of causing such
                            bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of
                            the person to whom the harm is caused;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)   if it is done with the intention of causing
                            bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be
                            inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d)   if the person committing the act knows that it is
                            so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or
                            such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act
                            without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death, or such
                            injury as aforesaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The intention to cause death specified in limb (a) and the
                    knowledge of the likelihood of death specified in limb (b) are not
                there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     However, the prosecution was putting its case
                    under limb (c). This effect of s 300(c) of the Penal Code is settled law.
                    The <em>locus classicus</em> is the decision of the Supreme
                    Court of India in <em>Virsa Singh v State of Punjab</em>
                    AIR 1958 SC 464 where Bose J reviewed the elements of the provision and
                    declared at [12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is
                        present;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely
                        objective investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that
                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or
                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds
                        further and,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described
                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in
                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective
                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the
                        offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and at [16] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious
                        injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that
                        is proved to be present. If he can show that he did not, or if the totality
                        of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent
                        that the section requires is not proved. But if there is nothing beyond the
                        injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible
                        inference is that he intended to inflict it. Whether he knew of its
                        seriousness or intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there. The
                        question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended
                        to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but
                        whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and once the
                        existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed
                        unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite
                        conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">His analysis has been affirmed and applied by our Court of Appeal in a
                    succession of cases, the most recent being <em>PP v Lim Poh
                        Lye</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Jabing had struck the deceased on the head in
                    order to rob him. Jabing held the branch in both hands and swung it at the
                    deceased’s head with such force that Galing saw his head crack open.
                    Dr Teo found that the head injuries inflicted on the deceased were
                    sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and he certified the
                    injuries to be the cause of death. Jabing’s actions fell within
                    s 300(c).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I find Galing and Jabing to be guilty of the
                    charge against them. They are convicted and sentenced to suffer the mandatory
