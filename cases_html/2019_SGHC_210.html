The Recorder’s statement thus amounted to an inducement for the Accused to agree to what was put so the statement recording could be completed, and the Accused could then rest.

Such an approach would not accord with the legislative purpose that a confession brought about as a result of an inducement, threat or promise is unreliable and therefore should be excluded (at [42]). The Court of Appeal went on further to opine that in the course of obtaining a confession, a threat to have an accused person beaten up, or even to have his siblings beaten up, would have the requisite reference to the charge against him (at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It is clear that the same reasoning applies with equal force to statements of the accused person sought to be admitted under s 258 of the CPC.

</div> On a strict and literal construction, such an exhortation would have no reference to the charge.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The first question to weigh was whether <span class="font-italic">Dahalan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>survived the introduction of Explanation 2 to s 258 of the CPC, as there was no equivalent provision in either the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Rev Ed) or Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) in force at the time of the decision in that case. I did not find that Explanation 2 was meant to overrule <span class="font-italic">Dahalan</span>. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> identified the discretion exercised by the court in <span class="font-italic">Dahalan</span> as the same common law discretion to exclude prejudicial evidence that it went on to apply in excluding the accused person’s statement (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [53]). Such statements are not excluded because they are involuntary <span class="font-italic">per se </span>(as the Defence appeared to argue), but rather because of the serious concerns with their reliability (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [55]). While the version of the CPC in force at the time of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> did not contain Explanation 2, I did not think that its insertion overruled the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>discretion to exclude prejudicial evidence with respect to statements obtained while an accused person is allegedly labouring under the effects of drug withdrawal. During the second reading of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Bill No 15 of 2010), Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam clarified the scope of Explanation 2 (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (19 May 2010) vol 87 at col 556):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Kumar asked if it was fair to use statements made by a person who is so intoxicated that he has not realised the implications of the statements. and the short answer is this: if the person did not know what he was saying, either because he was intoxicated or because of language difficulties, then that is not his true statement and it cannot be used against him. the Court has the task of deciding whether the maker knew what he was saying, and that the statement was made voluntarily.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Even if I had accepted the Prosecution’s argument that the term “intoxicated” in Explanation 2 encompassed drug withdrawal symptoms, Explanation 2 did not leave the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>discretion with no room to operate where an accused person’s statement is disputed on grounds of drug withdrawal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It was thus clear that flowing from <span class="font-italic">Kadar,</span> the court retains a discretion separate from the statutory provisions, to exclude otherwise relevant evidence if it is prejudicial, and such prejudice could arise from the effect of drug withdrawal symptoms. But whether any prejudice arose in the present case would depend on the evidence adduced.

Though they were not specifically concerned with the identification of withdrawal symptoms, they would have, assuming they performed their examinations properly, been expected to observe at least some of the possible symptoms of withdrawal.

During this, he was assessed daily by a different doctor for drug withdrawal symptoms utilising the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (“COWS”).

</div> This was in the moderate range for drug withdrawal symptoms. As noted by the Defence, while this was an assessment of the physical symptoms, it would involve both objective and subjective elements, which could lead to differences in the conclusions.  On the facts of the case here, what was pertinent was that the COWS score was apparently, when it was administered, at the peak around the 25 June 2016, two days after the contemporaneous statement was given on 23 June 2016.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 There was disagreement about the COWS score to be given for 26 June 2016, the second day of the drug withdrawal assessment.

Furthermore, the Accused was according to his own testimony able to function, carrying out his daily activities at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I preferred the Prosecution’s medical evidence. In any event, there was no significant difference in the assessments of Dr YC Lim and Dr Lee. The evidence of both doctors was that withdrawal symptoms did not operate immediately once consumption of diamorphine stopped: there would have been a time lag before withdrawal symptoms start to manifest. Dr YC Lim’s testimony was that the onset of withdrawal symptoms could occur within six hours, with symptoms peaking within 72 hours before subsiding.

</div> This was compared to Dr Lee’s timeframe of eight to 12 hours for the onset of withdrawal symptoms, with the peak at 24 to 48 hours. The primary difference related to when peak withdrawal symptoms would occur, with Dr YC Lim stating that they could occur anywhere between six and 72 hours, and Dr Lee taking the position that they peaked between 24 and 48 hours.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 To my mind, what mattered most was the severity of the withdrawal symptoms, if any, that the Accused was suffering from at the time of the giving of the contemporaneous statement. Here, the Defence’s position that the Accused was indeed suffering from such severe symptoms ran up against the absence of any observation of such symptoms.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>The arresting officers, Dr Raymond Lim and Dr Yak all testified to not having witnessed such symptoms from the Accused. The Defence argued that the Prosecution witnesses were not reliable on this score as they were not trained medical experts specialising in drug withdrawal. This missed the point: their evidence here was sought not on the basis of the medical expertise or knowledge, but just on whether they did in fact observe anything that could have been withdrawal symptoms. The absence of such evidence pointed against the Defence version of events. The Defence was also unable to show that these witnesses were giving false evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I did not accept portions of the medical expert evidence of Dr YC Lim, particularly his backwards extrapolation of the Accused’s COWS scores to conclude that he would have been suffering from more severe withdrawal symptoms at the time of the taking of the contemporaneous statement. Dr YC Lim’s arguments in favour of an extrapolation was not supported. He did not conduct the examinations in question on the Accused. His extrapolation was also contradicted by the observations of Dr Raymond Lim and Dr Yak. It seemed to me unlikely that the Accused could have been suffering from severe withdrawal on 23 June 2016 when the contemporaneous statement was recorded, demonstrate no observable withdrawal symptoms on 24 June 2016, and then exhibit withdrawal symptoms again from 25 – 27 June 2016. This went against his own account of how withdrawal symptoms typically manifest in a sigmoid curve, with the symptoms going up “very fast” before declining at a gentle pace.

This was based on the Accused’s own reporting, which was the very thing to be proven.

</div> It was argued by the Defence that this showed that the Accused was indeed not able to give his statement voluntarily. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This evidence was not relied upon substantially in the Defence’s submissions. In any case, Zainudin’s observations had to be weighed up against the other evidence examined above. Zainudin’s testimony essentially was that the Accused appeared tired and sleepy.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>This did not indicate that the Accused was suffering from drug withdrawal, much less drug withdrawal of the sort that would have cast doubts on the reliability of the contemporaneous statement. Zainudin’s testimony also had to be seen against the testimony of Dr Yak and Dr Raymond Lim, who had examined the Accused the next day on 24 June 2016 and did not observe him to have been suffering from any withdrawal symptoms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(3) <span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the withdrawal symptoms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I was not persuaded that the Accused was indeed suffering from any withdrawal symptoms at the time of the making of the contemporaneous statement. As noted above, I preferred the evidence of the Prosecution as regards the medical evidence. There was insufficient evidence supporting the Accused’s version that would raise any reasonable doubt. Turning then to the drug withdrawal, I accepted that this could operate as a separate ground on which a court could exercise its common law discretion to exclude evidence where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value, as indicated by the guidance given by the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>.  However, the mere fact that an accused person is suffering from drug withdrawal is not by itself sufficient to give rise to relevant prejudice, but must be such as to raise serious doubts as to the reliability of the statement (<span class="font-italic">e.g.</span> if there are doubts whether the statement is in fact that of the accused person).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I accepted the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses that the Accused was not at the point of the recording of the contemporaneous statement in such a state. The arresting officers and medical examiners were clear on this. Other aspects of the evidence adduced, including that of the Accused at the exhibit room, could be explained on other grounds. I thus found that the statement was given voluntarily.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I should also note that the Prosecution had relied on the cogency of the very statement that was to be admitted to show that the Accused was not suffering from any withdrawal symptoms.

The drugs in question were not hidden away as a secret stash: they were found in a drawer in a wardrobe used by the Accused. His clothes and various other personal effects were elsewhere in the wardrobe. That room he was in was also the only room that he occupied in the rented flat. His bed, where he appeared to spend a considerable time in while in the room was right next to the wardrobe, and the packages would have been in his direct line of sight.

</div> The drugs forming the subject of the charge against the Accused had a gross weight of 1520.23 grams and were found to contain 52.75 grams of diamorphine. This was more than three times the amount required to attract capital punishment. While the Accused claimed to have had some of the drugs in question for consumption, this was not substantiated by any evidence from him. Indeed, any defence of consumption would have contradicted the Accused’s claim that he did not know of the three packets containing the drugs in question (comprising 49.86 grams of diamorphine).
