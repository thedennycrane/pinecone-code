<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1          In this case, the primary issue was whether there was a binding agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant for the supply of steel bars by the defendant to the plaintiff. After hearing the evidence, both documentary and oral, and arguments, I concluded that the plaintiff’s claim that there was indeed a binding agreement between the parties had not been established. My grounds now follow.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Facts</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2          On 18 September 2003, the plaintiff, reportedly a large construction contractor, was awarded the main contract (“the main contract”) for the construction, completion and maintenance of the Singapore Management University City Campus – Victoria Project. After the award of the main contract, the plaintiff sent out various requests for quotations to a number of companies, including the defendant, for the supply of high tensile steel reinforcement bars (“rebars”). The request sent out by the plaintiff was somewhat brief and it merely mentioned that the contract period was “23 Months” and the quantity required was “Approximate 3600 ton [<i>sic</i>]”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3          The defendant responded to the plaintiff’s request, by its letter dated 9 October 2003. In so far as is material, the said letter reads as follows:</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4          Subsequently on 17 October 2003, the defendant, admittedly upon the request of the plaintiff, amended the quoted price for 12M straight bars from $570 to $560 per metric ton for 10mm to 32mm and R10 to R13 bars, and from $585 to $575 per metric ton for 40mm bars.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9          There followed an exchange of letters between the parties as to their respective positions and legal proceedings were threatened. In the end, on 1 April 2004, the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Pleadings</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10        In its Statement of Claim (amended subsequently), the plaintiff averred that the agreement between the parties was contained by or was to be inferred from the documents referred to earlier, in addition to a few mill certificates forwarded by the defendant to the plaintiff on 23 October 2003. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant by its letter dated 7 January 2004 repudiated the agreement between the parties and the plaintiff accepted the said repudiation by its letter dated 28 January 2004</span><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[1]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">and claimed damages to be assessed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11        The defendant’s defence simply was that there was no concluded agreement between the parties and that the documents referred to and the conduct relied on by the plaintiff did not give rise to any inference that there was any concluded agreement between the parties. The defendant further contended that there was no consideration to support the alleged agreement. In any event, the prices quoted were subject to revision, the agreement was subject to contract and the payment terms were not agreed upon.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12        There were five witnesses for the plaintiff. Most of their evidence revolved around the background facts. One significant aspect in the testimony of Goh Koon Suan (“Goh”), the managing director of the plaintiff, was in relation to a meeting allegedly held during the first week of November 2003. In this respect, his evidence, as appears at paras to 7 to 9 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), reads as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7.         Subsequent to the confirmation of the Defendants as the Plaintiffs’ steel supplier, I was informed by Tresa that the Defendants’ Jimmy Lim wanted to have a meeting with me. Accordingly, a meeting was fixed sometime on or about the first week of November 2003.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8.         When the Defendants’ Jimmy Lim came to my office for the meeting, coincidentally, a friend of mine, one Peter Chan was also in my office at the same time. Peter Chan also knew the Defendants’ Jimmy Lim and stayed during the whole of the meeting between Jimmy Lim and I [<i>sic</i>].</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9.         The Defendants’ Jimmy Lim informed me that he wanted to meet up with me to discuss the source from which the Defendants’ supply of steel would come from. He informed me that the Defendants had several sources and wanted to know whether the Defendants could supply the steel from these various sources. On this point, I called in Tresa to confirm the point on the Defendants’ source of steel as I recalled seeing some Mill Certificates being provided by the Defendants. Tresa confirmed that the Mill Certificates were from Natsteel and Eastern Steel. I highlighted to Jimmy that the Project Consultants might not approve if the supply of steel came from many sources due to the difference in the quality of the steel. Therefore, I informed Jimmy that we only require steel from a single source of supply which must comply with the Main Contract Specification. I then informed the Defendants’ Jimmy Lim that the Plaintiffs’ contract for the supply of steel was for a period of 23 months and the 1<sup>st</sup> purchase order would in all likelihood only be made only in January 2004, so the Defendants had time on their hands to ensure that they had the steel from the sources which they had contracted for. The Defendants’ Jimmy Lim agreed with this point and Tresa was dismissed from the meeting. I recall asking Jimmy whether he was having any problem in supplying the steel to the Plaintiffs for this contract. He replied that there was no problem and even cited an example of how he had continued his supply of steel to one local main contractor incurring loss of a few thousand dollars per truckload. With that, the meeting ended.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13        Another witness for the plaintiff was Peter Chan Chong Sin (“Chan”), an old friend of Goh. He claimed that he was also acquainted with Jimmy Lim (“Lim”), the defendant’s managing director. He testified that he happened to be visiting Goh, sometime on or about the first week of November 2003 and was present when Goh and Lim were having a conversation in Goh’s office. He said that Goh and Lim were talking about the price of steel being confirmed at $560 and that Lim assured Goh that the defendants would still abide by the contract with the plaintiff should the price of steel increase.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14        For the Defence, there were two witnesses, Desmond Han Boon Kwang (“Han”), the assistant sales manager of the defendant and Lim. In so far as Han’s evidence was concerned, his comments as regards the plaintiff’s letter dated 23 October 2003, as appear at paras 13 to 16 of his AEIC, bear reproduction. They read as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13.        My comments on the 23 October fax are as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(1)        At no time did I commit the Defendants to supplying the Plaintiffs with 12m Straight Bars at $560 per M/Ton for 10mm to 32mm and R10 to R13 and at $575 per M/Ton for 40mm;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2)        At no time did I commit on behalf of the Defendants that the prices quoted by me are “confirmed throughout the whole duration of [the] project”;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(3)        At no time did I agree with Tresa on behalf of the Defendants that the payment term is fixed at 60 days from the date of invoice; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(4)        As far as I am aware the Defendants did not receive any “Letter of Award” from the Plaintiffs at any time whilst I was still under their employ.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14.        I wish to inform this Honourable Court that it was never made known to me by anyone what was the whole duration of the SMU project. I did not and I still do not know when the project started and when it was supposed to be completed. Without such confirmation I could never have committed the Defendants to hold the prices of the rebars for “the whole duration of the project.” If the Plaintiffs’ allegations are true, which I wholly deny, it means that I had agreed on behalf of the Defendants to offer to sell the Plaintiffs rebars at a fixed price for an unknown and indeterminate period at a time when market prices of steel products in Singapore were most volatile. I could not and would never have done that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15.        As for the alleged 60 day payment term, I stress that there was absolutely no discussion between Tresa and I [<i>sic</i>] on this issue in our telephone conversations. The Defendants’ standard payment term at all times was 30 days. This is clearly stipulated in the quotation dated 9 October 2003, the amended 9 October quotation and the 30 October quotation. It would not have been possible for me to extend the payment term from 30 days to 60 days as such an important change would have required the consent of Jimmy, which I did not have.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16.        When I received the 23 October fax, Jimmy was not in the office. I believed that he had already left on a business trip to China. When he returned on 29 October 2003, I brought the 23 October fax to his attention. Jimmy is the one who would do the sourcing. It was not part of my duties to do it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15        Lim’s evidence was that the defendant was only a “middleman”. He said that the defendant did not stock steel bars because the price of steel was highly volatile and to do so would require substantial capital investment. As such, before any contract to sell steel “rebars” was entered into by the defendant, it would first have to secure a back-to-back contract with one of its suppliers at a price with a profit element built in. It was for that reason that the defendant always inserted terms and conditions in its quotations to the effect that the orders were subject to final confirmation and that the prices quoted were subject to revision without prior notice. He added that the defendant could only confirm a sale at a certain price after it had obtained a similar commitment from a supplier. As regards the meeting with the plaintiff’s Goh, he said that meeting was on 3 November 2003. His testimony in this regard, as averred by him in paras 16 and 17 of his AEIC, reads as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16.        Thereupon on the evening of 3 November 2003, I met with Mr Goh at his office together with Desmond and Peter. Tresa joined the meeting after it had already started. I related to Mr Goh the difficulty I had encountered in trying to secure a contract for the rebars. I told him that I could only deal with LiSteel as they were the only major steel suppliers entitled to supply steel products to the SMU peoject. I explained that LiSteel refused to supply the rebars at the prices set by the Plaintiffs and that by reason thereof the Defendants could not do the job at the prices the Plaintiffs wanted. I further told him that even at $575 per M/Ton for the smaller rebars and $595 per M/Ton for the 40mm rebars, I was not even sure I could still do the job as the smaller major suppliers were reluctant to supply the rebars through dealers like the Defendants.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17.        Mr Goh then chastised Desmond for offering to supply rebars at prices the Defendants were unable to honour. He also indicated had he been any other customer he would sue the Defendants. As I did not wish to antagonise Mr Goh and get into an argument with him over his statement, I kept quiet. I told him that I could not make any promises but I would try my best to talk to LiSteel to see whether they could supply the rebars at the prices set by the Plaintiffs. I promised Mr Goh that I would call him to tell him whether I have been successful. The meeting ended on that note.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Arguments in a synopsis</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16        It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that there was a concluded contract between the plaintiff and the defendant as at 23 October 2003 and that the said contract was contained in or evidenced by or was to be inferred from the documents referred to in [3] to [8] above. He submitted further that in pursuance of the said contract the plaintiff placed an order for 60 tonnes of steel bars on 6 January 2004, but the defendant repudiated the contract on 7 January 2004.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17        The contention by counsel for the defendant was that the quotation dated 9 October 2003 and the amended quotation on 17 October 2003 submitted by the defendant were nothing more than a mere supply of information by the defendant in response to the plaintiff’s inquiry as to the price. He, in this connection, invited the court’s attention to the following express provisions in the quotation which stated that: (a) “Note: Order are [<i>sic</i>] subject to final confirmation” and (b) “prices quoted above do not include GST and are subject to revision without prior notice”. These express words, according to the defendant’s counsel, were fatal to the plaintiff’s allegation that there was a legally enforceable agreement in existence between the parties. It was further submitted on behalf of the defendant that even if the quotation of the defendant were to be construed as an offer, the plaintiff’s letter dated 23 October 2003 did not constitute an acceptance in law. He further argued that the plaintiff’s so-called acceptance letter was the plaintiff’s attempt at binding the defendant to a bargain without, however, wanting to commit itself to the defendant in any way.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18        In determining the issue whether there was indeed a binding contract between the contestants, two main documents played a central role in this case. The first was the purported quotation from the defendant dated 9 October 2003, amended only as to price on 17 October 2003. The second was the so-called acceptance letter dated 23 October 2003. In the said quotation, apart from a Delphic note that the order was “subject to [the defendant’s] final confirmation,” it also stated that the “prices quoted … are subject to revision without further notice”. Such qualifications in the quotation, in my view, imported an element of ambiguity and uncertainty particularly as to price. The plaintiff, no doubt, did not seem to have recognised the ambiguity. The plaintiff’s acceptance letter equally fared no better. Apart from other troubling aspects, which would be dealt with later in these grounds, it ended with the sentence: “We shall follow up with a Letter of Award to you subsequently.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19        According to <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> (6th Ed, 1990), the word “award”, amongst other things, is used in the sense of “one awards a contract to the bidder”. However, in the case at hand, the plaintiff did not follow up with any letter of award. When asked why no letter of award was forwarded to the defendant, contrary to the statement that the plaintiff would follow up with a letter of award, Goh said that he did not deal with such matters and deflected the question to Chong Wai Swee (“Chong”), the senior construction manager of the plaintiff.</span><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">When Chong was later questioned, he said</span><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[3]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">that for simple products the plaintiff did not have a letter of award. I must presently observe that the attempted answer was glib and entirely sidestepped the question asked.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20        In my view, quite apart from the unsatisfactory nature of the quotation and form of its purported acceptance, the failure by the plaintiff to follow up with a letter of award was fatal to its claim. In fact, upon perusing a specimen letter of award of the plaintiff in relation to another contractor</span><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[4]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">it would seem that the letters of award of the plaintiff usually contained detailed provisions and left little room for ambiguity. In my evaluation, the present claim would not have arisen if the price of steel did not climb steeply since October 2003. If the price had indeed fallen, and if the defendant were to insist that the plaintiff should accept delivery of the stated amount of steel at the price stated, it would have been probable for the plaintiff to say that until and unless a letter of award was issued by it, no contract was afoot. In my analysis, the purported letter of acceptance was merely an indication of the plaintiff’s intention to enter into a contract with the defendant and nothing more.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21        In <i>Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd</i> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 601 at 619, Lloyd LJ summarised the principles of law in relation to the construction of contracts concluded by way of correspondence in the following terms:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As to the law, the principles to be derived from the authorities, some of which I have already mentioned, can be summarized as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(1)        <i>In order to determine whether a contract has been concluded in the course of correspondence, one must first look to the correspondence as a whole</i> (see <i>Hussey v Horne-Payne</i>).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2)        <i>Even if the parties have reached agreement on all the terms of the proposed contract, nevertheless they may intend that the contract shall not become binding until some further condition has been fulfilled. That is the ordinary “subject to contract” case.</i></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(3)        <i>Alternatively, they may intend that the contract shall not become binding until some further term or terms have been agreed;</i> see <i>Love and Stewart v Instone</i>, where the parties failed to agree the intended strike clause, and <i>Hussey v Horne-Payne</i>, where Lord Selborne said at p 323:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">… The observation has often been made, that a contract established by letters may sometimes bind parties who, when they wrote those letters, did not imagine that they were finally settling the terms of the agreement by which they were to be bound; and it appears to me that no such contract ought to be held established, even by letters which would otherwise be sufficient for the purpose, if it is clear, upon the facts, that there were other conditions of the intended contract, beyond and besides those expressed in the letters, which were still in a state of negotiation only, <i>and without the settlement of which the parties had no idea of concluding any agreement</i>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(4)        Conversely, the parties may intend to be bound forthwith even though there are further terms still to be agreed or some further formality to be fulfilled (see <i>Love and Stewart v Instone</i> per Lord Loreburn at p 476).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(5)        <i>If the parties fail to reach agreement on such further terms, the existing contract is not invalidated unless the failure to reach agreement on such further terms renders the contract as a whole unworkable or void for uncertainty</i>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(6)        It is sometimes said that the parties must agree on the essential terms and that it is only matters of detail which can be left over. This may be misleading, since the word “essential” in that context is ambiguous. If by “essential” one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true: the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract. If by “essential” one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract, then the statement is tautologous. If by “essential” one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail, the statement is untrue. It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and, if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant. It is the parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the the Judge, “the masters of their contractual fate”. Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. It happens every day when parties enter into so-called “heads of agreement”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">22        In my determination, the intention that the contract should not become binding until the said letter of award was issued was unmistakable. In the premises, the plaintiff’s contention, that there was in existence a binding contract between the parties as of 23 October 2003, was unsustainable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23        Proceeding further, there were other deficiencies in the plaintiff’s acceptance letter. In the quotation letter, the defendant had stipulated the term of payment to be 30 days from the date of invoice. But the acceptance letter varied it to 60 days from the date of invoice. On this, the plaintiff’s evidence was that the variation was inserted with the consent of the defendant’s Han. But Han denied this. In the absence of any written confirmation or contemporaneous documentary evidence from the plaintiff to support the variation, I found it difficult to hold that the plaintiff had established that there was any agreed variation.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">24        The issues were further compounded when the defendant wrote on 30 October 2003 to increase the price. Such an act by the defendant did not seem to have produced any immediate protest or written demurrer from the plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25        As regards the claim by the plaintiff that during the first week of November 2003, Lim agreed to affirm and stand by the terms of the original contract, this was swiftly denied by the defendant. Although Chan attempted to corroborate the claim of the plaintiff in relation to this aspect, I found the claim of the plaintiff to be highly suspect, since the plaintiff not only seemed to have omitted to record the alleged oral confirmation in any exchange of letters between the plaintiff and the defendant but also this alleged oral confirmation was singularly absent in the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. I did notice, however, that in para 2 of the Statement of Claim there was a cryptic reference to the conduct of the defendant. However, the alleged conduct was not particularised and remained a mystery until the hearing. Be that as it may, in my evaluation, the phraseology employed by both parties in their respective letters did not lend itself to the inference that there was any concluded contract between the parties. In fact, the plaintiff was hoist with its own petard when it deliberately chose to end its so-called letter of acceptance dated 23 October 2003, with the statement that it would follow up with a letter of award, which it never did. In any event, before any letter of award was issued, the defendant by its letter dated 30 October 2003 revised the terms of its earlier quotations and this development effectively put paid to any argument that the order issued by the plaintiff on 6 January 2004 could be construed as a valid acceptance of the defendant’s earlier offer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26        In my conclusion, inasmuch as the plaintiff did not follow up with its letter of award, the contract, as submitted by counsel for the defendant, remained incomplete. Additionally, the terms as to time of delivery, delivery of location, delay in delivery, the party responsible for unloading at site, were all yet to be agreed upon between the parties. According to the plaintiff’s witnesses, the said terms were all important. If the letter of award were to be issued, these terms would most naturally have found their place in it, as could be viewed from the specimen letter of award of the plaintiff produced at the trial.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">27        After reviewing all the evidence adduced at the trial and after considering all the arguments presented, I was of the opinion that the plaintiff had not on a balance of probabilities established its claim. As observed by me earlier, there was no concluded contract between the parties and consequently there was no breach on the part of the defendant. In the premises, the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed with costs.</span></p>
