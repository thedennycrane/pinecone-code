Contractor Pte Ltd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are also not involved in this litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendant was their subcontractor who, in turn, engaged the plaintiff as its subcontractor.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant was for a sum of $538,568.52 being the balance of $730,000 which was the original contract sum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendant demurred that the plaintiff had not performed the contract and was therefore not entitled to payment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It further asserted that by reason of the plaintiff’s failure to perform the contract the defendant had to carry out the work itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This resulted in the additional costs of $37,140.64 which the defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition to this sum, the defendant also claimed liquidated damages at $100 a day from 16 June 2001 to 7 February 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendant also claimed a sum of $1,861.42 being “administrative charges”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> When the trial commenced before me, the pleadings from both parties were totally inconsistent with the opening statements of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The statement of claim then was a mere two-paragraph statement to the effect that the plaintiff was claiming money due from the defendant for services rendered at the defendant’s request.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The case that the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Tan, sought to make out at trial was more complicated than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defence and counterclaim<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> complicated issues because of its reference to a contract made up of several documents of various dates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was, in short, no consensus as to what was in fact the contract in question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Counsel then applied to amend their respective pleadings and the trial resumed after they had amended their respective cases.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The cases for the plaintiff and defendant respectively were nonetheless presented more complicatedly than they should.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In order that the true issues can be appreciated, it is important to first ascertain what the original contract was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Following oral negotiations between Mr Ho, the managing director of the plaintiff and Mr Ng Chee Wee, the managing director of the defendant, the plaintiff submitted a quotation dated 19 September 2000 to the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This quotation was signed by Madam Wee Bee Hua, a director of the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She is also the wife of Mr Ng Chee Wee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After her signature she added the following words in her own hand:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">“We accept this quotation S$730,000 exclude 3% GST as a lump sum contract based on the drawing No. 85, 86, 87, 88.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We will temporarily sign on your quotation &amp; kindly wait for our work, contract agreement &amp; work schedule.” (sic)</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> After that, the defendant sent a works order dated 1 November 2000 to the plaintiff incorporating all that was set out in the plaintiff’s quotation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This became known as the “first works order”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition to that works order the defendant attached a set of its own terms and conditions of contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendant maintained at the trial that the contract between the plaintiff and defendant “included” the defendant’s terms and conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In my view, it does not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The plaintiff’s quotation of 19 September 2000 was a document capable of forming a valid and complete contract if accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was done by Madam Wee’s signature in affirmation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendant disputed such a contract because it was written by Madam Wee that it only “signed temporarily”, but I see no commercial meaning in such a phrase and cannot impute any from the circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All that was required to seal the contract was the signature of the defendant in acceptance and its purchase or works order to commence work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The plaintiff, however, had unnecessarily muddied the case from the outset by its failure to identify the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Even after the pleadings were amended, it continues to believe that the contract was an oral one made between Mr Ho and Mr Ng “just after they had finished works for the defendant at another project”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was borne out in paragraph 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The plaintiff then averred that it was prevented from proceeding to complete the work because the work of other subcontractors employed by the main contractors were still in progress. On 11 June 2001 the defendant issued a second works order for work not originally contracted for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This averment was disputed by the defendant who contended that the second works order covered, work originally set out in the plaintiff’s quotation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Its witnesses testified that the second works order was issued to raise the morale of the plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> But prior to the second works order, that is, on 8 June 2001, there was a meeting between Mr Ho of the plaintiff and Mr Ng of the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What actually transpired is not clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The only consensus from counsel before me was that the agreement reached at this meeting was that the defendant would take over the balance of the work that had not been completed as at 8 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although the plaintiff had been paid various progress payments till date, there were complaints by the defendant regarding the quality and speed of the plaintiff’s work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was no mention of payment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the absence of any indication to the contrary, the only conclusion arising from the 8 June 2001 agreement, in the specific circumstances, is that the plaintiff would not be entitled to any payment unless it is for work requested after 8 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It will be noted that there was no reservation of rights of either party arising from the 8 June 2001 agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Following from this event, the plaintiff says that it had done work that justified its claim for $538,568.52 which included work specified under the second works order as well as some further variation work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the other hand, the defendant says that the plaintiff had already been paid for all work done by it till date that is, 8 June 2001, and that came to $298,468.64.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It further alleged that pursuant to the 8 June 2001 agreement the defendant had completed the rest of the work at its own cost, and that impliedly meant that it should be entitled to claim any amount in excess of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> the contract sum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendant then claimed that that excess came to $37,140.64.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The meeting of 8 June 2001 was a crucial event in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is obvious that whatever contract preceded it, the parties had orally agreed to vary their agreement and had subsequently acted largely in accordance with that variation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The quarrel between them that led them all to court arose from the interpretation of the true import of that variation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The persons involved in this oral agreement were Mr Ho Ah Kow the managing director of the plaintiff and Mr Ng Chee Wee, the managing director of the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Ho’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief stated that –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">“earlier on 8 June 2001, there had been an agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the defendants would finish the installation of 20 riser ducts themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Originally the plaintiffs were supposed to do the installation of 22 riser ducts but there was a change in circumstances.”</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Further on, he continued (at [12]) as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">“it was agreed at the meeting that due to the time constraints caused by the circumstances, the defendants would finish the works as described earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The plaintiffs would complete 2 nos. of the riser ducts and the rest of the other works which they were committed to completing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the completed date of 15 July 2001, it was agreed that we should try our best to meet that date as I had already explained that given the circumstances, the completion date must be realistic.”</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The circumstances referred to were delays caused by the main contractors and other subcontractors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The other person to the oral agreement, Mr Ng Chee Wee, significantly, did not give evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was therefore no one from the defendant who could give evidence to the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, Mr Teo Chye Huat, the defendant’s general manager acknowledged that there was an agreement made on 8 January 2001 to vary the contract and under cross-examination stated that the situation was forced upon them, in the sense that it was inevitable given the circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> What the parties had agreed to do thereafter was clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What was not expressed was the revision of price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is not a case in which price, being central to a commercial agreement, had not been reached and therefore no contract can be said to have formed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this case, the parties revised the scope of work of a partially performed contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There are two contending arguments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The plaintiff’s counsel Mr Tan submitted that the variation agreement envisaged that the plaintiff be paid for the work it had done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That, he says, came to $538,56.52 less what they had already been paid ($298,468.64).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Chia argued on behalf of the defendant that the variation agreement was evidenced in writing in the form of AB144.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was a letter dated 9 June 2001 from the defendant to the plaintiff referring to the meeting of 8 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The letter sets out the items which the plaintiff was to continue and complete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Chia’s submission at [74] contended that “it was understood and agreed that the defendant would deduct the costs of works not carried out by the plaintiff from the lump sum figure of $730,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Parties proceed (sic) with the common intention of completing the works as soon as possible”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the evidence available, and equally important, the lack of critical evidence, I form the view that the oral variation of the contract on 8 June 2001 had the following effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The plaintiff was to carry out the work specified in AB144 and the defendant was to complete the rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That much was clear and expressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the absence of any agreement as to further payment, the circumstances do not justify an implication of terms that the plaintiff would be paid pro rata with the original contract price of $730,000 as the basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It had been paid a substantial amount on progress payments due and submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Neither, in my view, would the defendant be entitled to claim for costs incurred by them in carrying out their part of the varied agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is important that the 8 June 2001 variation be considered in context and the circumstances forced upon both sides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were delays, some of which were of no fault of the plaintiff, but because of the delays the plaintiff was unable to complete the work on schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The parties thus agreed to make the best of the situation and that resulted in the agreement of 8 June 2001 whereby the defendant, in effect, cancelled the subcontract with the plaintiff in respect of the rest of the work in order to perform the work itself.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I am of the view that additional work had been requested by the defendant after the 8 June 2001 meeting in the form of the second works order (issued on 15 July 2001).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a request for additional work and not for work already stipulated under the first works order as the defendant contended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Its only basis for saying so was that it issued the second works order merely to “motivate the plaintiff”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From the items specified in the two works orders and the evidence of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> plaintiff’s witnesses, especially that of Cheong Yeong Soon, a witness whom I regard as the most reliable from either side, I conclude that the defendant’s contention cannot be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, Mr Cheong admitted that only 50% of this work was completed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The work involved in the second works order appear to be requested because the defendant was a little too optimistic that it could take back the remaining work entirely from the plaintiff after 8 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In my view, the variation agreement on 8 June 2001 formed a separate contract and cannot be considered as a lump sum contract to which the doctrine of substantial performance can be applied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There will be judgment for the plaintiff for half the sum of $69,525.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The plaintiff’s claim for work outside the first and second works orders had not been sufficiently proved and that part of the claim is disallowed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> For the reasons above, and in particular, the absence of evidence from Ng Chee Wee, the defendant’s counterclaim, including the claim for liquidated damages and administrative charges, which were not proved, is dismissed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Costs of the action and the counterclaim shall be taxed if not agreed, and paid by defendant to plaintiff to the extent of one-third of the taxed costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Costs in respect of amendment of pleadings shall be costs thrown away to defendant and fixed at $5,500.</span></p>
