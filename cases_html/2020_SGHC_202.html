Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, I concluded that the application was properly made, that all the statutory requirements under the LTSA and the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC”) were complied with and that the transaction was in good faith taking into account the method of distributing the proceeds of sale. I also found that there was no credible evidence to support the defendant’s assertion that there was an absence of good faith on the part of the CSC or its marketing agent in arriving at the method of apportioning the sale proceeds of the Development.

</div> Under MOA1, the sale proceeds would be paid out (a) first, based on the market value of the 36 individual strata lots and (b) for the net balance of the sale proceeds to be distributed to each subsidiary proprietor in equal shares.  This was on the basis of an assumption that the common property was owned jointly or severally by all the subsidiary proprietors as tenants-in-common and therefore divisible equally based on their individual share value holdings.   It is relevant to point out at this juncture that the share value structure of the Development was unusual in that all subsidiary proprietors were assigned one share value, irrespective of the size of their units (see table at [3] above).  As will become apparent later in these grounds, this factor was one of the main reasons contributing to the defendant’s objections to the sale.

The minutes then recorded various comments and suggestions by various CSC members. For example, one unnamed CSC member commented, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that ultimately the premium received by each unit must be fair and equitable. The minutes also recorded, by way of a comment by another CSC member as a preliminary suggestion on an apportionment formula, that most of the CSC members were familiar with MOA1 as it had been discussed in a previous unsuccessful collective sale exercise, and that it was “quite a good formula”.

</div> If the formula could generally be agreed on, this CSC member felt that they would have “some solid ground to start working on”. Another CSC member commented that first “…we agree on an apportionment method then we shall all abide by the method and respect the professional valuation reports…”. After further discussion by the CSC members, the minutes recorded the 1st Plaintiff, in her capacity as the chairperson, concluding that there was a “need to consult the professionals to see whether the apportion [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] method mentioned by the CSC members is workable”, to “ensure that it stands [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the scrutiny of the Strata Title Board”. Lastly, the minutes recorded that Mr Albert Ching, representing The Singapore Cancer Society (the “Society”) informed the rest of the CSC that the Society would not be supporting the collective sale.

Mr Mitchell also explained that the STB’s role is to mediate, and if objections to a sale are not withdrawn, the STB would issue a Stop Order.

Mr Mitchell cautioned the CSC that it would be difficult for the sale to proceed if the independent valuation expert did not support whichever was the chosen method of apportionment. The chosen method had to be fair and equitable as an application to the STB would be required and there was also the possibility of an application to the High Court. Several apportionment permutations were then presented to the CSC for discussion and deliberation.

In a nutshell, the premium variance is the difference between the highest premium that a subsidiary proprietor would obtain and the lowest premium that another subsidiary proprietor would obtain in the same development based on a particular collective sale price and the chosen method of apportionment of the proceeds from the collective sale. In simple terms, a premium is represented mathematically as follows:

</div>:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The underlying principle behind the [premium variance test] is to narrow the premium variance so as to ensure that all owners gain near-similar premiums from this collective sale. A large premium variance would suggest that certain units are obtaining far more premium from the sale price than the other units, which may make it inequitable to these other units. In short, a large premium variance suggests that certain units are enjoying an advantage at the expense of others. It is a good indicator of whether the MOA chosen is fair. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This explanation is, I note, consistent with the analysis undertaken by Tan Siong Thye J in <span class="font-italic">Deorukhkar Sameer Vinay and others v Quek Chin Kheam</span> [2018] SGHC 171 (“<span class="font-italic">The Albracca</span>”), at [49]–[54]. Applying the premium variance test, MOA1 would give a premium variance of 130% based on the original reserve price of $165 million, and a premium variance of 106% based on the revised reserved price of $148 million (see [22] below). In contrast, MOA2 would result in a premium variance of 53% based on the original reserve price, and a premium variance of 48% based on the revised reserved price.

</div> In any event, the CSC considered the advice rendered by C&amp;W alongside other information. The premium variance test was a helpful tool in deciding whether a proposed method of apportionment was fair to the subsidiary proprietors. The CSC clearly exercised independent judgment, demonstrated by the fact that it eventually adopted MOA2, notwithstanding that it had a premium variance that exceeded the 20% threshold recommended by C&amp;W. The CSC debated on the method of apportionment to be adopted amongst themselves and also with C&amp;W, to ensure that the method adopted would be fair to all the subsidiary proprietors.

Whilst the specific issue under consideration in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu Ville </span>was whether the sale price was fair, the Court of Appeal’s comments above are, in my view, equally applicable when a court is determining whether a transaction has been made in good faith based on any of the factors enumerated in s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) LTSA, including the method of distributing the proceeds of sale which was in issue in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sub-issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 There are three sub-issues which arise from the arguments made by the parties in relation to the defendant’s first objection.

</div>
</div> His evidence was that the premium variance test was not a mandatory test. In his opinion, it was not correct that if a premium variance of 20% was not achieved, the STB would not approve the collective sale application. He did not, however, say that the STB will not scrutinise applications or that it would not consider the premium variance test in its deliberations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As correctly submitted by the plaintiffs, the STB has a clear statutory duty under the LTSA (s 84A(6) read with s 84A(9) LTSA) to ensure that transactions are made in good faith, particularly when there are no objectors but no unanimous consent. There was therefore every possibility that the STB would indeed scrutinise the application and transaction in this case. This scrutiny by the STB is also implicitly acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kok Yin Chong </span>([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [71] where after commenting on the question of burden of proof, Tay Yong Kwang JA, delivering the judgment of the court, noted that “the above seems to us to be a practical guide as to the burden of proof <span class="font-italic">before the Board</span> [the Board being the STB] or the High Court” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I am therefore of the view that Ms Sim and the 1st plaintiff had correctly and legitimately raised the point to the CSC that the method of apportionment adopted would need to be able to withstand scrutiny by the STB.  At that time, no one knew if 100% consensus would be achieved or whether any owner would object either to the method of apportionment put forward or to the terms of the CSA. Even if there were no objections to the collective sale but no unanimous consent, an application to the STB would still be necessary under s 84(6) LTSA.  In reviewing the application, the STB would consider the factors set out in s 84A(9) LTSA. As I noted above, when the CSC meetings were being held, the 1st plaintiff and Ms Sim could not possibly have known whether there would be unanimous consensus to the collective sale, such that an application to the STB would not need to be brought. In properly discharging their responsibilities to the subsidiary proprietors, the 1st plaintiff and Ms Sim had to ensure that should an application be brought to the STB, the method of apportionment adopted would be able to pass the scrutiny of the STB. Therefore, this entire line of argument by the defendant with regard to the STB only mediating disputes and not scrutinising applications missed the mark.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The defendant also submitted that the premium variance test was advanced by Ms Sim and the 1st plaintiff so as to reach a method of apportionment that benefited the owners of larger units at the expense of the owners of the smaller units. However, I did not think there was any credible evidence which supported the defendant’s case on this. The evidence given by Ms Sim, and both parties’ expert witnesses, is that the premium variance test is a methodology that can be used to determine if the method of distribution of sale proceeds from a collective sale was fair. The plaintiff’s expert Mr Liaw testified that the premium variance test is a “useful tool that we do look at”, even though it was not mandatory that it be used.

In my view, there was nothing inherently suspect or wrong about the use of it. Indeed, its use by Jones Lang Lasalle Property Consultants Pte Ltd, who were the marketing agents in <span class="font-italic">The Albracca</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), is indicative to me of its prevalent use in the industry as a yardstick by which to assess the fairness of a method of apportionment in a collective sale scenario. Its usefulness is not diminished even for a property with unique configurations or features, as was, for example, the case in <span class="font-italic">The Albracca</span>. There is, in my opinion, no reason why the STB, if it were to scrutinise the application under s 84A(6) LTSA, would not have regard to the premium variance test, as did the High Court in <span class="font-italic">The Albracca</span>, and as have I in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As to whether the STB would not an approve an application for a collective sale if the premium variance was above 20%, there was insufficient evidence to enable me to come to any conclusion on this point. It was in any event unnecessary for me to do so. Suffice to say, the parties’ experts did not disagree that the lower (or “tighter”) the premium variance was, the better were the prospects of demonstrating that the chosen method of apportionment was fair and reasonable to all the owners as the circumstances of the case would permit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is undisputed that the 1st plaintiff was one of the owners of one of the larger units in the Development, and it is undisputed that MOA2 would give owners of the larger units a more favourable distribution of the sale proceeds in comparison with MOA1.  However, in and of itself, that is not evidence that there was a lack of good faith on the part of the 1st plaintiff in advocating for MOA2.  The 1st plaintiff testified that the CSC members took the premium variance test as a guide to determine whether the distribution of proceeds was fair and reasonable.

</div> Having examined the evidence and observed the 1st plaintiff, I did not find that there was any lack of good faith on the part of the 1st plaintiff in adopting the premium variance test and supporting MOA2 on that basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The good faith in the adoption of MOA2 is also demonstrated to some extent by the justification for the 1st plaintiff’s criticism of MOA1. I address this in greater detail later when considering the defendant’s second objection.  In summary, when the actual figures (based on the revised sale price of $148 million) were plugged into the MOA1 two-tier formula, it was clear that MOA1 was inequitable, not just to the larger retail/F&amp;B units <span class="font-italic">but also</span> to the larger office units. Under MOA1, the smallest office units would gain significantly, and unfairly. Therefore, even if MOA2 was not the perfect apportionment method, it was <span class="font-italic">overall</span> more even-handed and equitable to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the subsidiary proprietors, and supported the plaintiffs’ case that the adoption of MOA2 was not tainted by bad faith. In this regard, I bore in mind that the task of the court is, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to assess if the method of distribution adopted is rational and designed to be <span class="font-italic">as fair as</span> <span class="font-italic">possible</span> to <span class="font-italic">all the subsidiary proprietors as the </span><span class="font-italic">circumstances of the case would permit</span> (<span class="font-italic">Lim Li Meng Dominic and others v Ching Pui Sim Sally and another and another matter </span>[2015] 5 SLR 989 at [61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In attacking the conduct of C&amp;W, the defendant pressed the argument that Ms Sim had made a false representation to the CSC that the premium variance had to be less than 20% in order to pass scrutiny by the STB. In this regard, the defendant emphasised that Mr Liaw’s evidence was contrary to Ms Sim’s advice to the CSC (see [30]). Mr Liaw testified that there was no fixed premium variance standard to determine whether a method of apportionment was acceptable, and that an acceptable premium variance could be different in every case depending on what was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

</div> and that the variance should be as close as possible to 20%.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my opinion, even though Mr Liaw had his views, this could be explained as a difference in opinion between two industry professionals as to whether there was such a rule of thumb. Ms Sim may (and I would put it at no higher than that) perhaps have displayed a level of overexuberance in pitching the 20% figure as a threshold that needed to be reached or the perceived difficulty in finding a valuer to endorse an MOA with a variance of more than 20%. However, it did not, in my view, transcend to deliberate falsehoods or misstatements by Ms Sim calculated to deceive, as was argued by the defendant. Nor did it evidence any collusion between Ms Sim and the 1st plaintiff in order to influence the CSC to adopt MOA2 and abandon MOA1, as was also argued by the defendant. In this regard, I also had regard to the evidence of the defendant’s expert Mr Chan. Mr Chan did not, either in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief or oral evidence, state categorically that Ms Sim was wrong in referring to a threshold or “rule of thumb” of 20% that needed to be met to satisfy the STB. In his expert report, he only went so far as to say that neither the STB, nor the guidelines issued by the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (“SISV”), mandated the use of the premium variance test or have any hard and fast rules in adopting the test.

</div>
</div> Mr Chan’s oral evidence touched on the usefulness or accuracy of the premium variance test in this case (see [46] above). However, he did not proffer any evidence on the specific point about whether it was incorrect or false for Ms Sim to pitch the minimum 20% figure as a threshold or rule of thumb that needed to be achieved. I could not therefore say that the totality of the evidence showed clearly and credibly that Ms Sim falsely represented the existence of the 20% threshold/rule of thumb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The defendant further contended that Ms Sim intended to benefit the larger unit owners by making the alleged false representation.  I found this contention fanciful. There was no evidence of any such intent and no motive was proffered by the defendant on why Ms Sim would harbour any such intent. For one, Ms Sim raised the issue of the 20% premium variance threshold when the CSC discussed <span class="font-italic">both</span> MOA1 <span class="font-italic">and</span> MOA2. There was also no reason for Ms Sim to side with the owners of the larger units.

He stated that the 1st plaintiff was evasive and lied on the stand about not receiving an email discussing MOA1 that had been sent by the 3rd plaintiff to various owners in July 2017, including the 1st plaintiff.

The 1st plaintiff was the only CSC member who knew that choosing the method of apportionment would be a challenge, because she already had a plan to compel the CSC to abandon MOA1. Finally, the 1st plaintiff supported Ms Sim’s false representations during the CSC meetings, which is further evidence of collusion between them.

Even if the 1st plaintiff received the July 2017 email sent by the 3rd plaintiff and was aware of discussions relating to MOA1 in 2017, it merely indicated that MOA1 was an option being considered at that point in time. I did not find that the 1st plaintiff was evasive or untruthful as a witness. As I explained above at [44], the caution given to the CSC by the 1st plaintiff and Ms Sim that the method of apportionment must stand up to the scrutiny of the STB was both accurate and properly made in the discharge of their duties to the subsidiary proprietors. I also did not accept that the CSC (or for that matter a majority of owners) had already decided on or accepted MOA1 at the commencement of the discussions regarding the collective sale, as I elaborate below at [63]–[65]. The 1st plaintiff could, as CSC chairperson, endorse the premium variance test and MOA2 on the basis that it would be the more equitable option, taking into consideration Ms Sim’s <span class="font-italic">and</span> D&amp;B’s professional advice. That does not lead to the conclusion that she must have colluded with Ms Sim. During cross-examination, the 1st plaintiff said that prior to the 2nd CSC meeting, she had never met or spoken to Ms Sim, or had any dealings with C&amp;W.

</div> I saw no reason to disbelieve this evidence.

The defendant’s allegations on collusion and prior communication between the 1st plaintiff and Ms Sim were at the heart of his case that the 1st plaintiff and Ms Sim did not act in good faith. Yet, somewhat troublingly, these allegations were not put to the plaintiff’s witnesses during cross-examination in the course of the evidentiary hearing. Nor were they clearly flagged up in the defendant’s affidavit or his Opening Statement. Raising such serious allegations for the first time in his closing submissions amounted to litigation by ambush.

When MOA1 was discussed in the previous attempts to achieve a collective sale for the Development, the “greater concern”, according to the defendant, was the valuation of the units (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the first tier in the two-tier formula envisaged by MOA1), and that there was allegedly no issue with the division of the balance sale proceeds by share value (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the second tier in MOA1).

This email, according to the defendant supported his contention that the collective sale process proceeded on the basis that there was “wide support” for MOA1.

</div> These different pieces of evidence indicated to me that in the previous unsuccessful attempts at a collective sale, there were major difficulties faced in reaching an agreement on MOA1 <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>, including its second tier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As such, on the totality of the evidence, the defendant’s argument that the 1st plaintiff and the other big unit owners abruptly changed their minds only when Ms Sim “abandoned” MOA1 and put forward MOA2 on the back of various deliberate false representations simply could not stand. The various CSC meeting minutes did not bear this out. The 1st plaintiff and the CSC were trying their best to steer through what was clearly a prickly issue, in order to arrive at an apportionment method that was fair and equitable to all owners as far as the circumstances would permit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Further, it was only possible for the CSC members to reach a considered decision on whether MOA1 should be adopted after they had sight of the actual figures in play. Coming back to the email sent by the 3rd plaintiff on 28 July 2017 (see [8]), he gave the following example of a distribution under MOA1:

Of a total assumed net sale proceeds of $120m, $102m (or 85%) represented the hypothetical market values of the units and the remaining $18m (or 15%) would be the second tier distributed equally to all 36 units based on their equal one share value. Based on these hypothetical figures, one might even say that this iteration of MOA1 gave a lot more prominence to valuation (and inferentially, size and use of the units) and significantly less prominence to share value. However, the landscape altered dramatically once the actual numbers were applied to MOA1, based on the revised reserve price of $148m. Of this sum, the total valuation of the 36 units in the Development amounted to $71m (or 48% of the revised reserve price, <span class="font-italic">down</span> from 85% in the hypothetical example above). The balance of $77m (which had now <span class="font-italic">increased</span> from 15% in the hypothetical to 52%) was to be distributed by share value.

I come back to this at [102] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The evidence indicated that the CSC members exercised independent judgment, taking into account the representations made by Ms Sim and/or the 1st plaintiff. The method of apportionment was discussed over multiple CSC meetings, and debated by the CSC members. It can be seen from the meeting minutes that the CSC members referenced C&amp;W’s recommendations and adopted the premium variance test as a methodology to determine the fairness of a proposed apportionment method. As explained above, C&amp;W’s advice regarding using the premium variance test as a tool was unobjectionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It would be useful at this juncture to go into greater detail as to what transpired at the 4th CSC meeting, when the majority of the CSC members provisionally accepted MOA2. The meeting minutes show that Ms Sim had initially suggested a method of apportionment constituting 80% valuation and 20% share value. Mr Phee then suggested that MOA1 be adopted, and he was supported by the defendant and the 3rd plaintiff. Mr Daryanani and Mr Alex Seah disagreed with MOA1 as it “severely disadvantaged the retail units”. Ms Sim gave her opinion that MOA1 was inequitable, due to its wide premium variance. This opinion was shared not just by the 1st plaintiff but also by another CSC member Ms Poh Khim Hong, representing the owner of several office units on the 11th floor. The minutes also record that during the meeting, other permutations of apportionment methods were tested to reduce the premium variance. The 1st plaintiff suggested that strata area be a component added into the method of apportionment, in response to the defendant’s suggestion that only valuation and share value be considered in the apportionment method. The minutes record that eventually, after much deliberation and discussion, the CSC members tentatively accepted MOA2 which had a smaller premium variance compared to MOA1.

In doing so, I am satisfied that they exercised independent judgment as opposed to placing blind faith or trust in C&amp;W’s opinions. The defendant claimed that Ms Sim had “threatened to resign”, such that the CSC had “no alternative” but to use the premium variance test and vote for MOA2.

</div> I pause here to mention that the defendant could have called Mr Phee or any of the other CSC members as his witnesses to buttress or corroborate his claims that the CSC was, effectively, duped or forced into agreeing to MOA2 or that there was unhappiness or turmoil within the CSC on MOA2, but he did not do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 There was also no evidence to suggest that the CSC members were coerced in any way to adopt the premium variance test, or to vote for MOA2. Ms Sim testified that she informed the CSC that if a method of apportionment adopted was skewed and unfairly advantaged some owners, she would have to discharge herself. If the CSC members wished to adopt MOA1, or any other apportionment method, they were at liberty to vote accordingly and discharge Ms Sim.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 To my mind, this somewhat robust response by Ms Sim demonstrated resolve by C&amp;W as the marketing agents to ensure that they discharged their responsibilities without fear or favour, even if it meant causing unhappiness amongst the CSC members. I digress slightly here. A lot of the difficulties in this case quite possibly stemmed, in my opinion, from a preconceived view among a number of the owners and CSC members that MOA1 was inherently fair and a good formula to work with. However, once the actual figures were available (see [66] above), the premium variance test, among others, demonstrated quite starkly that this was not the case and that MOA1 was inherently unfair. The revelation by Ms Sim to the CSC of the unfairness of MOA1 may have caught a number of CSC members by surprise. Whilst it may have been a somewhat bitter pill to swallow for some of the CSC members when told that MOA1 would not pass muster, this did not mean they were misled or coerced by Ms Sim or the 1st plaintiff into abandoning MOA1 and adopting MOA2. Indeed, the CSC was given more time to reflect on MOA2 and the figures as it was only tentatively adopted at the 4th CSC meeting. At the 5th CSC meeting and only after yet further discussions on the apportionment method, the CSC decided to move forward with MOA2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defendant also complained that MOA2 was voted on in less than two hours, which according to him, was a “record speed and achievement”.

</div>
</div> However, this is not entirely accurate. MOA2 was first discussed and deliberated on in detail at the 4th CSC meeting, which lasted for about 2 hours 10 minutes. At that meeting, MOA2 was tentatively agreed upon. At the 5th CSC meeting which also lasted some 2 hours 10 minutes, the discussions continued and the CSC then decided definitively to move forward with MOA2. In fairness, one should consider at least the total amount of time taken at the 4th and 5th CSC meetings. Of the approximately 4 and a half hours in total, I surmise the lion’s share would have been taken up by discussions and debate on the apportionment method. I thus disagreed that in the circumstances, the decision to vote on and proceed with MOA2 was one taken by the CSC “willy nilly” or with a lack of good faith.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In my judgment, there was no credible evidence that MOA1 was abandoned because of false representations made by Ms Sim and/or the 1st plaintiff. The minutes from the relevant CSC meetings show that involved and robust discussions had taken place on the methods of apportionment at more than one meeting. Having assessed the evidence in its entirety and holistically, it was clear to me that the decision-making process of the CSC was conducted in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Alleged abrogation of duties as members/chairperson of the CSC</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The defendant also submitted that the 1st plaintiff should have called for another professional opinion to test Ms Sim’s representations, and that the other members of the CSC did not act in the interests of all the subsidiary proprietors.  However, in my view, the other CSC members, like the 1st plaintiff, could legitimately refer to the premium variance test. Utilising that test as a tool, they could reasonably hold the view that MOA2 was fair and equitable. The other CSC members were also legitimately entitled to rely on the advice given to them by experienced professionals from reputable organisations, just as the 1st plaintiff was. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It can be seen from the discussion above that the defendant levelled all manner of criticisms against the 1st plaintiff and other CSC members. However, it bears repeating that the defendant was himself also a member of the CSC. If the defendant had doubts about the premium variance test or was of the view that another professional opinion was necessary, he could have raised it during the CSC meetings, but did not.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As I have detailed above, the evidence demonstrated that the CSC members sought professional advice from a reputable property marketing agent, had the benefit of legal advice, and carefully considered the advice given to them in coming to their decision to adopt MOA2. In light of all this evidence, it could not be said that in the circumstances, the 1st plaintiff or the CSC members abrogated their duties to the subsidiary proprietors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For all of the foregoing reasons, the CSC and its appointed marketing agent did, in my judgment, fulfil their duties as fiduciaries in good faith in adopting MOA2 as the method of distributing the sale proceeds from the collective sale of the Development. Their conduct did not in any way fall foul of any of the obligations spelt out in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers</span> ([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and as summarised in <span class="font-italic">The Albracca</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [27]–[28]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Second Objection: MOA2 was not fair, reasonable or equitable </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defendant’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The defendant’s second objection was that MOA2 was not a fair, reasonable or equitable method of apportionment.

</div> The two-tier apportionment method in MOA1, so the defendant argued, distributed the premium from the sale proceeds based on the share value of each subsidiary proprietor, such that they would each receive 1/36 of the premium value. This ensured that the share value of the subsidiary proprietors would not be “diluted”.

</div>
</div> Given the defendant’s definition of “common property”, and his claim that the subsidiary proprietors are entitled to a 1/36th share of the common property, the two-tier apportionment method in MOA1 was fair and equitable.  It gave due recognition to the subsidiary proprietor’s inalienable right to the land as tenants-in-common in accordance with their share value. MOA2, on the other hand, sought to unfairly and wrongly dilute that right.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendant further submitted that the allotment of the share value in the Development is unique, as it did not correlate with the size of the units. As each unit had one share value, each unit’s owner paid an equal amount towards the maintenance and sinking funds irrespective of size. As a result, the smaller units had been paying a disproportionate sum of maintenance over the past 49 years.

</div> According to the calculations made by Mr Liaw, the premium variance based on a revised reserve price of $148 million was 106% under MOA1. This large premium variance “suggests that certain units are obtaining far more premium from the sale price at the expense of other units, which may make it inequitable to the latter”.

</div> For example, the difference in premium between a retail unit such as #01-01, and the defendant’s unit #10-02, which was one of the smallest office units, was about 107% (144% for the defendant’s unit less 37% for unit #01-01).

The common market understanding is that a ground floor retail/F&amp;B unit would have a higher market value psf compared to an upper floor office unit. However, under MOA1, the psf (as a function of the sale proceeds) for the smallest office units was higher than that of the larger retail and F&amp;B units, and also that of the larger office units. The owners of the larger units and the majority of the office units therefore would not therefore accept MOA1.

In <span class="font-italic">Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2645 </span>[2018] 1 SLR 790 at [61], the Court of Appeal held that “any area or installation in respect of which the management corporation had assumed a duty to control, manage, administer or maintain would presumptively be taken to have satisfied the second limb” of s 2(1) BMSMA, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that the part of the land and building was used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots or proposed lots, unless shown otherwise. The Court of Appeal also noted at [51] that the LTSA and BMSMA were enacted to ensure the proper upkeep of common areas (see also <span class="font-italic">Frontfield Investment Holding (Pte) Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 938 and others </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 410 at [29]<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the High Court recognised that the management corporation has a responsibility to maintain common property for the benefit of all proprietors). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It cannot, therefore, logically be the case that the management corporation has a responsibility to repair and/or maintain the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> area reflected in the CT, including the land comprised in strata lots or the entire land on which the Development sits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Second, the land strata title scheme does not lend itself to the division of the land or the common property between subsidiary proprietors, and each subsidiary proprietor therefore cannot claim to own a specific portion of the land or common property. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Abraham Aaron Isaac v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 664 </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 287 at [22]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…Section 13(1) of the [LTSA] provides that: “…the common property shall be held by the subsidiary proprietors as tenants in common proportional to their respective share value and for the same term and tenure as their respective lots are held by them”. As such, all the subsidiary proprietors have unity of possession, and no subsidiary proprietor can claim possession of a separate part of the property against another: <span class="font-italic">Poh Kiong Kok v MCST Plan No 581 </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 617.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiffs also pointed me to the second reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill 1998 (Bill 28 of 1998) (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(31 July 1998) vol 69) at col 632 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law)), where it was noted by the Minister that a person “buys into … a strata lot. He buys into common property. He is designated share values in common property. <span class="font-italic">He has no specific land lot</span>.” (emphasis added). I was also referred to the third reading of the same bill (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(4 May 1999) vol 70 at col 1342 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Law)), where the Minister stated that: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In strata title, there is no delineation of the subsidiary proprietor’s <span class="font-italic">identifiable plot of land. There is no such thing</span>. You have, in common with the other subsidiary proprietors, a certain share value of the land area as well as a share value of all the common properties, and when we talk about common properties, it covers a whole range from carparks, the pool, the garden, lifts, corridors, external walls, columns, roads, drainage, sewerage and gas pipes and electric cables serving the development. So there is a distinction. When we talk about strata titles, the concept is different [from that of landed property]. You are having an identifiable airspace but with respect to land and other common properties, you have common ownership together with the rest of the subsidiary proprietors according to the share values. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Third, the way in which certificates of title are issued was, in my view, consistent with and supported the conclusion that common property does not constitute the entire land area reflected in the certificate of title on which the strata development stands. As explained by Professor Teo Keang Sood in his article <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation: Common Property and Structural Defects </span>(2016) SJLS 149 at pp 153–154: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… Under the LTSA, the common property is held by the unit owners as tenants-in-common. While a subsidiary strata certificate of title is issued for a unit, <span class="font-italic">no such certificate of title is to be issued for the common property</span>. The certificate of title in respect of the land on which the strata development stands is to be retained by the Registrar of Titles after the issuance of the relevant subsidiary strata certificates of title. Following from the above, it is clear that the common property is vested in the unit owners as aforesaid and not in the management corporation. <span class="font-italic">Accordingly, it is to be noted that a unit owner’s subsidiary strata certificate of title issued in respect of his unit shall also certify therein his share in the common property and there is no separate certificate of title issued for the common property</span>… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Thus, the defendant was, in my view, working on a flawed starting premise to support his position that MOA2 was not fair or equitable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 With regard to the concern raised by the defendant that the maintenance fees had not been fairly or proportionately split between the units as a result of each unit having one share value regardless of strata area, this point was not, in my view, relevant to whether the method of apportionment chosen was fair and equitable. In any event, the defendant’s argument that the smaller units had been subsidising the larger units due to the unfair split in maintenance fees did not stand up to scrutiny. The defendant alleged that the larger units would necessarily consume more of the common utilities, as they had a “bigger place to maintain”,

</div> but it is not clear why that would be the case. On this point, the 1st plaintiff testified that each unit paid for their own electricity.

</div> Also, the ground floor retail units would have had no or little use for the lifts but would have had to pay for their maintenance when the biggest users would have been the 32 office units. Similarly, the 32 office units would collectively consume more of the central air-conditioning than the retail/F&amp;B units. Overall, I found the contention that the smaller units had been subsidising the larger retail/F&amp;B units over a number of decades unconvincing and somewhat one-sided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Despite the defendant’s contention that it was not his case that MOA1 was fairer than MOA2 (see [79] above), it was nevertheless relevant, in my view, to compare MOA1 with MOA2. This is because the comparison assisted in informing whether the CSC’s decision to adopt MOA2 and put it to the EGM was made in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 On this comparison, I found Mr Liaw’s evidence to be logical and persuasive. Mr Liaw compared MOA1 and MOA2, and explained that under MOA2, the range of premium per unit (in psf terms) was relatively small within each group of units (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, shops vs office). On the other hand, that range was much larger under MOA1.

</div>
</div> Next, Mr Liaw pointed out that under MOA1, the office units obtained a premium in percentage terms substantially above the average while the retail units obtained a premium in percentage terms substantially below the average. In contrast, the range of premiums was narrowed in the case of MOA2.

</div>
</div> Finally, Mr Liaw used the premium variance test as a tool to stress test both methods, and it showed that a much smaller variance was obtained under MOA2 than under MOA1. MOA2 also demonstrated one of the tightest premium variances and served to confirm Mr Liaw’s opinion that MOA2 was fair and equitable. Importantly, under MOA2, the spread of premium over valuation was more evenly distributed whether by use types or size and in percentage terms, the office units still enjoyed a higher level of premium relative to their valuations.

They also lent credence to the plaintiffs’ case that the process (or transaction) was carried out in good faith. Overall, I preferred the evidence of the plaintiffs’ expert Mr Liaw to the defendant’s expert Mr Chan – the latter’s answers were in parts not entirely logical.

</div> at the EGM. There was no suggestion by the defendant of any coercion or undue influence being exercised during the voting. That level of support for MOA2 at the EGM did, in my view, go some way to indicate that the CSC members had been able to arrive, as best as they could, at an apportionment method that was a fair and equitable option to all the subsidiary proprietors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 A final word on MOA1. Having heard the evidence and considered the parties’ arguments, I agreed that MOA1 was, objectively, unfair. It was unfair not only unfair to the retail/F&amp;B units, but also to the largest office units such as #04-03 to #11-03, each with a strata area of 121 square metres. The disparity in the premium received by the smallest office units as compared to the largest office units (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> 28%) was not marginal or insubstantial (see [84]). The defendant did not address this point in his closing or reply submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For completeness, the defendant also suggested, in his closing submissions, that there were other possible modifications that could have been made to MOA1 had the CSC been given the opportunity to explore them. For example, the defendant suggested that the four largest retail units could be given a “top-up” to their valuations from the second tier pool of funds, and for the remaining proceeds to thereafter be distributed equally by share value.

</div> In my view, this was a submission made on hindsight and as an afterthought. The defendant did not raise this option at any of the CSC meetings even though the CSC members were then testing out different permutations of apportionment methods. It was also not raised in his affidavit or put to any of the plaintiff’s witnesses when they gave evidence. I placed no weight on this argument which was raised very late in the day and say no more about it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For the foregoing reasons, I also rejected the defendant’s second objection.  MOA2 was in my judgment not unfair, unreasonable or inequitable.  On the contrary, it was fair and equitable to all the owners of the Development, as far as the circumstances would permit. It achieved a distribution of the sale proceeds that did not significantly favour <span class="font-italic">or</span> disfavour any particular owner in the Development.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For the above reasons, and after having carefully considered all of the evidence holistically, I found that the transaction was made in good faith, taking into account the method of distribution of the sale proceeds.
