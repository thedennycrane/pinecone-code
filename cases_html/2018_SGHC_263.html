</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Plaintiff filed the present suit to seek firstly an order of specific performance to compel the 1st and 2nd Defendants to purchase its shares in the 3rd Defendant at the price of $1.2m; or alternatively, an award of damages in the sum of $1.2m.  The Plaintiff asserted that it had exercised its put options in respect of these shares on 25 August 2016, pursuant to cl 2.2 of the POAs. Under cll 2.3 and 3 of the POAs, the 1st and 2nd Defendants were obliged to purchase its shares at 80% of the aggregate purchase price paid by the Plaintiff (which came to $1.2m), but the 1st and 2nd Defendants had failed to do so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Secondly, the Plaintiff also sought in this suit an order of specific performance to compel the Defendants to pay it a sum of $35,952.18 which it claimed represented its share of the total dividends of $311,544 declared by the 3rd Defendant for the year ending 31 January 2016.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Defendants denied the validity of the Plaintiff’s put option notices.  The Defendants asserted that on 4 September 2015, they had notified the Plaintiff of the occurrence of a Default Event as defined in the COAs: namely, the “failure of the [Plaintiff] to refer (through itself and / or Nanyang Travel Planner Pte Ltd [a related company] … at least sixty (60) clients to the [3rd Defendant] within a consecutive six (6)-month period from the date of [the COAs]”.  The Defendants asserted that the Plaintiff had itself admitted the occurrence of the Default Event, as well as the consequence of such a Default Event, which was that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were entitled to exercise their respective call options – pursuant to cll 2 and 3 of the COAs – to purchase the Plaintiff’s shares in the 3rd Defendant for $1.  Subsequently, on 6 May 2016, the 1st and 2nd Defendants exercised their respective call options under the COAs to purchase the Plaintiff’s shares for $1.  The effect of this exercise by the two Defendants of their call options was to terminate the POAs, pursuant to cl 7(iii) of the POAs.  As the Plaintiff had failed to execute the relevant share transfer forms forwarded by the Defendants, the 1st and 2nd Defendants counterclaimed in the present suit for an order of specific performance to compel the Plaintiff to transfer its shares to them for the price of $1 (payable by each Defendant).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 As to the Plaintiff’s claim in relation to its share of the dividends declared by the 3rd Defendant, the Defendants stated that the sum of $311,544 represented the total dividends declared for the financial periods ended 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2016 respectively, and that the sum was broken down as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $261,544 for the period ended 31 January 2015;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $50,000 for the period ended 31 January 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Defendants asserted that as the Plaintiff had become a shareholder of the 3rd Defendant only on 13 February 2015, it was entitled only to share in the $50,000 dividends for the period ended 31 January 2016, which worked out to a sum of $5,769.24.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claims and allowed the Defendants’ counterclaim for an order of specific performance to compel the transfer of the Plaintiff’s shares to the 1st and 2nd Defendants for $1 (per Defendant).  As the Plaintiff has filed an appeal against my decision, I am setting down my reasons in these written grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The competing claims in relation to the disposal of the Plaintiff’s shares in the 3rd Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant contractual clauses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I will first address the Plaintiff’s claim and the Defendant’s counter-claim in relation to the disposal of the Plaintiff’s shares in the 3rd Defendant.  Parties were agreed that the central dispute concerned whether, on 6 May 2016, the 1st and 2nd Defendants could have validly issued call option notices to purchase the Plaintiff’s shares for $1.  I will refer to the exercise of such call options as “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">default call options</span>”.  If this question were to be answered in the affirmative, it meant that the Plaintiff could not have validly exercised its put options on 25 August 2016 because the POAs would have been terminated upon the valid exercise of the two Defendants’ call options – as provided by cl 7(iii) of the POAs (which I set out below).

</div>  On the other hand, if the question were to be answered in the negative, the Defendants’ objections to the Plaintiff’s exercise of its put option on 25 August 2016 fell away.  Much of the argument in this trial thus revolved around the interpretation of the contractual clauses which delineated the scope of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ right to exercise their call options on 6 May 2016 on the basis of a “Default Event” as defined in the COAs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 For ease of reference, I set out below the relevant clauses from the COAs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1 DEFINITIONS</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.1 The following words and phrases, wherever used in this Agreement, shall have the following meanings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">“Call Option”</div></td><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">shall mean the right of the Purchaser to purchase from the Grantor, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the Call Option Shares at the Exercise Price</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">“Call Option Period”</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">...</div></td><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">shall mean the period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of this Agreement, or such other period as may be mutually agreed between the Parties;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">“Completion Date”</div></td><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">shall mean the date falling ten (10) Business Days after the date of the Notice, or such other date as may be mutually agreed between the Parties;</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">“Default Event”</div></td><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">shall mean such failure of the Grantor to refer (through itself and/or Nanyang Travel Planner Pte.

The Plaintiff did not deny that a Default Event had indeed occurred in this case: as at 13 August 2015, it had referred only 20 clients to the 3rd Defendant.

According to the Plaintiff, the effect of the Settlement Agreement was “to preserve parties’ respective rights and obligations under the Put Option Agreements”.  Hence, even if the “Purported Default Call” of 6 May 2016 was valid at the time it was exercised, the effect of the Settlement Agreement was to “render the Purported Default Call subsequently invalid, and reinstate the Put Option Agreements and the rights and obligations of the parties therein”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Further and/or in the alternative, the Plaintiff contended that cl 2, read with cl 3(b) of the COAs is “oppressive and / or unconscionable and / or comprise penalty clauses, and are thereby void or unenforceable or liable to be set aside” by the court, or “otherwise of no legal effect by way of the common law”.

As the COAs defined a Default Event as the Plaintiff’s failure to refer at least 60 clients to the 3rd Defendant in these first six months, parties could only determine whether a Default Event had occurred when the six-month period had expired on 13 August 2015.  It was illogical, if not impossible, for the 1st and 2nd Defendants to purport to exercise their call options based on the occurrence of a Default Event before the expiry of the six-month period.  Moreover, the COAs defined the Call Option Period as the period of 24 months from the date of the said agreements, and nothing in the COAs stipulated that a call option based on the occurrence of a Default Event could only be exercised within the first six months from the date of the COAs.  According to the 1st and 2nd Defendants, upon the occurrence of a Default Event, they had between 14 August 2015 and 13 February 2017 to exercise their call options to purchase the Plaintiff’s shares for $1 under cl 3(b) (the latter date being the last day of the 24-month period from the date of the COAs).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Just as the Plaintiff had attempted to rely on the Term Sheet of 18 June 2014 in support of its arguments on the period in which a call option based on a Default Event could be validly exercised, the Defendants too cited the Term Sheet – as well as the earlier drafts of their various agreements – as evidence of the understanding between the parties.  According to the Defendants, the commercial bargain struck between the parties even before 13 February 2015 included provision for the 1st and 2nd Defendants to buy back Nanyang Ventures’ shares in the 3rd Defendant for $1 if it could not refer at least 60 patients within the six months from the signing of the agreements.  This commercial bargain recognised that the “value proposition and commercial justification” for the 1st Defendant’s agreement to collaborate with Nanyang Ventures was the latter’s purported ability to grow the 1st Defendant’s business through its referral of a “steady stream of patients from China”.  Indeed, according to the Defendants, the figure of 60 patients within the first six months was substantially lower than Nanyang Ventures’ original representation that it would be able to “refer a conservative estimate of 20 patients per month” with each spending an average of $5,000 to $8,000 on plastic surgery and cosmetic treatments.

</div>  Under the draft Default Call Option Agreement, a “default” was defined as being a failure by Nanyang Ventures to refer 60 or more patients to the 3rd Defendant within a consecutive period of six months from the date of the agreement.  The Call Option Period in the draft Default Call Option Agreement was also stated to be “24 months [from] the date of this option” – which was the same period stated for the Call Option Period under the draft Call Option Agreement.  In subsequent discussions with the Plaintiff’s lawyers, M/s Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP (“Shook Lin”), the draft Call Option Agreement and the draft Default Call Option Agreement were merged into a single document named the Call Option Agreement (“COA”).

The Defendants also denied that these clauses constituted a penalty clause or that they were in any way oppressive or unconscionable.  Instead, the Defendants contended that the Plaintiff’s conduct subsequent to 6 May 2016 demonstrated that it was aware that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were entitled to exercise their call options to purchase its shares for $1, and it was seeking their “indulgence not to exercise this right as yet” while it tried to refer more patients to the 3rd Defendant (albeit without any eventual success).

The plan was for Yoyo to advertise the medical products and services offered by a Singapore clinic to the high net worth individuals in China.  Yoyo, together with Nanyang Ventures, would also provide concierge services and travel packages to facilitate the patients’ visit to the said Singapore clinic.

According to Dr Fan, he was “prepared to take this risk” because he realised that agreeing to the 60 Patients Requirement would “give the 1st and 2nd Defendants the assurance and / or confidence” that he was “serious about seeing this business collaboration succeed”, and he also believed there was “much more to be gained from the profit-sharing agreement that was encapsulated in the Shareholders’ Agreement”.  Moreover, given his “extensive network in China”, he did not foresee any problems in meeting the 60 Patients Requirement, especially since the agreements between the parties did not require a minimum spend by each patient referred.  Indeed, the Plaintiff was not even restricted to referring patients from China: any patients referred would count towards the 60 Patients Requirement, “regardless of nationality”.  “Most importantly”, he was of the view that the “Default Call Option was only exercisable within a period of 6 months” such that his “‘risk window’ was only for a short period of 6 months”.

</div>  This email noted that as at 4 September 2015, the total number of patients referred to the 3rd Defendant stood at 27.  The email referred to cl 3(b) of the COAs, and stated that based on cl 3(b), the 1st and 2nd Defendants had the right to purchase the Plaintiff’s shares in the 3rd Defendant at $1.  The email concluded by asking if there were “any active marketing programs in progress to meet the number of referral of the remaining patients”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Dr Fan claimed that the contents of the above email were conveyed to him over the phone by Anqi who told him “that the Plaintiff was in default and that the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ representative had raised this as an issue”.  He claimed that she did not mention the possibility of the shares being bought back for $1, and that at that point, his main concern was that the 1st and 2nd Defendants would terminate the agreements between them “by exercising<span class="font-italic"> </span>the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Non-Default Call Option</span>” [emphasis added].

The email concluded by stating that the Plaintiff had opened up “many distribution channels”, that there would be “more patients coming in the near future”, that the Plaintiff wished “to seek [the 1st Defendant’s] understanding” and recognition of its efforts, and that it would “continue with more diversified and active marketing programs in acquiring more patients”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On 9 September 2015, Anqi also sent the 1st Defendant a Whatsapp message in which she stated: “… we are still trying to meet the 60 patients commitment.

I appreciate your efforts.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 According to Dr Fan, based on the above communications, the 1st and 2nd Defendants had “clearly represented that they would refrain from exercising [their] call options, so long as the Plaintiff agreed to undertake marketing efforts to refer more Chinese patients to the 3rd Defendant”. It was in the light of these “representations” that the Plaintiff had “proceeded to engage in diversified and active marketing programs in order to refer more patients to the 3rd Defendant and meet the 60 patient target referral”.  Dr Fan cited a Nanyang Ventures marketing video as the evidence of these alleged efforts.

In this letter of 12 October 2016, the 1st Defendant reiterated that the Plaintiff had failed to refer 60 patients “within the Default Period” (that is, the period of 6 months from the date of the COAs), and had “accepted” that the Defendants could exercise their call options “for $1.00 as a result of [the Plaintiff’s] default”.

Nanyang Ventures would also take charge of marketing efforts in China, while charging a “10% marketing and administrative fee on the price of treatments for the patients” they referred.  The 1st Defendant would continue running his own practice but would have to relocate his clinic from Gleneagles Hospital to the Orchard area.  Anqi informed the 1st Defendant that Nanyang Ventures enjoyed a “wide network” in China which would enable it to refer “a steady stream of patients from China to Singapore for cosmetic treatments and/or plastic surgery”.  Anqi represented that Nanyang Ventures would be “comfortable” referring an estimated “20 patients per month from China, with an average spend of S$5,000 to S$8,000 per patient”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The 1st Defendant was interested in the prospect of a steady stream of new patients and of being able to tap on the potential in the China market.  He saw this as being “the value proposition of a collaboration with Nanyang Ventures”.  At the same time, he recognised that Nanyang Ventures might not live up to its promises, especially since it did not have a “specific track record in aesthetics medicine”.

He conveyed to Anqi, therefore, his concern that Nanyang Ventures “needed to show [him] its commitment to this proposal, and its confidence in adding value to and growing [his] business”.

If Nanyang Ventures failed to meet this “low threshold of 60 patient referrals within 6 months, this would be an event of default which would give [the 1st and 2nd Defendants] the right to buy all of Nanyang Ventures’ shares in [the 3rd Defendant] for S$1.00”.

He therefore suggested to Anqi that “as a first step”, the 1st and 2nd Defendants would exercise the default call, and upon receiving the shares back from the Plaintiff, hold the shares “in escrow” pending the parties’ negotiation of “a fresh business arrangement” and new “targets” for the Plaintiff.  If the Plaintiff met these new targets, the shares held “in escrow” would be sold back to it at $1.

In early April 2016, the 1st Defendant realised that the Plaintiff had only referred 58 patients to the 3rd Defendant in the entire period between 13 February 2015 and end-March 2016.  He also realised that many of these patients had come for consultation and not for cosmetic procedures, and that the consultation fees they paid ($120 to $180 each) was nowhere near the average spend of $5,000 to $8,000 previously mooted by the Plaintiff.  He met Anqi on 13 April 2016 to discuss the proposal he had made in October 2015, but the meeting did not result in any firm commitments from the Plaintiff.

He decided to check if the Plaintiff wanted to “buy in” to the proposed IPO.  This was without prejudice to his existing right to the transfer at $1 of the shares in respect of which he and the 2nd Defendant had exercised default calls.  At the two meetings with Chee and Doreen in August 2016, he shared with them the opportunity presented by the potential IPO.  At the same time, he reminded them that the Plaintiff’s shares in the 3rd Defendant already belonged to him and the 2nd Defendant pursuant to their default call notices.  Neither Chee nor Doreen disputed this.

His statement that he was “disappointed to hear that [the Plaintiff] no longer wishes to continue as shareholders” of the 3rd Defendant was a response to its decision not to participate in the IPO, because the discussion at the August meetings had involved “the mechanism” by which the Plaintiff could participate in the IPO, and one proposed mechanism was for it to “come in again as shareholders” of the 3rd Defendant.

After all, in the preceding months, the Plaintiff’s position – as demonstrated through its conduct and through Anqi’s representations – had been one of acceptance of the valid exercise of the default calls; and Dr Fan had been fully aware of the default calls whilst “trying to negotiate his way out of it”.

When Anqi received Melissa Hee’s email of 4 September 2015 stating that the Plaintiff had failed to meet its patient referral commitment and that the Defendants now had the right to purchase the Plaintiff’s shares at $1, this was in line with her understanding of the Defendants’ rights under the COAs.

She confirmed that she had a meeting with the 1st Defendant on 13 April 2016, at which – pursuant to instructions from Dr Fan – she informed the 1st Defendant that the Plaintiff wanted to carry on the partnership with him, that the Plaintiff would “try its best to refer more patients to him in order to ‘prove [itself]’”, and that they “hoped very much that he would not exercise his right to buy back [the Plaintiff’s] shares”.  Anqi also confirmed that the 1st Defendant had reserved his right to exercise the default call while expressing willingness to “listen to other proposals on how to continue the business relationship on [an]other platform”.

</div>  In mid-July 2014, she met with the 1st Defendant to discuss how best to proceed.  By then, the Plaintiff recognised that the Defendants “had the right to exercise the Call Option”, which was why Dr Fan wanted her to help negotiate with the 1st Defendant for a higher purchase price for the Plaintiff’s shares.  Anqi recalled that the 1st Defendant proposed a figure out of “goodwill”, though she could not recall what figure it was, and that he also proposed that parties enter into a new agreement.  She reported these proposals to Dr Fan.

He gave evidence that the 1st Defendant emailed him on 1 March 2014 about Nanyang Ventures’ investment proposal.  Kam assisted the 1st Defendant to draft a Term Sheet which the parties signed in mid-June 2014 after several round of discussions and amendments.  Kam then assisted the 1st Defendant to draft the various agreements while his BMI colleague Melissa Hee assisted Shook Lin with the due diligence exercise vis-à-vis the 1st Defendant’s practice.  As seen earlier, the draft agreements forwarded to Nanyang Ventures in August 2014 included a draft Call Option Agreement and a draft Default Call Option Agreement.  According to Kam, the draft Default Call Option Agreement made it clear that a default event would be constituted by the investing party’s failure to refer at least 60 patients within a consecutive six-month period from the date of the agreement (what Kam called the “60/6 Obligation”, and which I have termed the 60 Patients Requirement at [33] above). It was also made clear that on the occurrence of a default event, the Defendants would have the option to purchase all of the investing party’s shares for $1 within 24 months from the date of the agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The draft agreements forwarded by BMI in August 2014 went through several rounds of negotiations and amendments.  These amendments did not affect the 60 Patients Requirement.  Moreover, although Shook Lin subsequently merged the draft Call Option Agreement and the draft Default Call Option Agreement into a single Call Option Agreement, this revised document continued to be entirely consistent with the 60 Patients Requirement.

Sometime in April 2016, Kam was informed by the 1st Defendant that the Plaintiff had failed to refer at least 60 patients to him despite more than a year having passed from the signing of the agreements.  On 13 April 2016, he and the 1st Defendant met with Anqi.  At the meeting, the 1st Defendant made it clear that while he was open to “a new business arrangement with [the Plaintiff] based on new targets”, he “would not compromise on his right to exercise the Default Call”.  On its part, the Plaintiff wanted to carry on working with the Defendants, but no firm landing was reached on any new business arrangement.  Shortly thereafter, the 1st and 2nd Defendants exercised the default calls on 6 May 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Kam was present at the first meeting which the 1st Defendant held with Chee and Doreen in August 2016.  He confirmed that at this meeting, the 1st Defendant reminded Chee and Doreen that the Defendants had already exercised the default calls and that the Plaintiff’s shares belonged to them.  The 1st Defendant told Chee and Doreen that he was “considering a new business arrangement” and wanted to know if the Plaintiff was “interested to come along”, so that he could “re-align and re-configure the business”.  Neither Chee nor Doreen raised any issues about the validity of the Defendants’ default calls, nor did they mention exercising put options.

If the Defendants’ default call notices were valid, then the Plaintiff could not have validly exercised its put options on 25 August 2016 – because the POAs would have been terminated upon the valid exercise of the Defendants’ call options.  On the other hand, if default call notices were invalid, then the Defendants’ objections to the Plaintiff’s exercise of its put option on 25 August 2016 fell away.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The key task I faced, therefore, was the interpretation of the contractual clause(s) relevant to the Defendants’ exercise of the default calls.  I explain below why I arrived at an interpretation that favoured the Defendants’ case.  I start by summarising the principles which Singapore courts have adopted to guide our approach to the task of contractual interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Singapore courts’ approach to contractual interpretation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Our Court of Appeal (“CA”) has in a number of cases comprehensively summarised the law on contractual interpretation in Singapore.  In <span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Tin Yong v Ang Boon Chye and another</span> [2012] 1 SLR 447 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Tin Yong</span>”) at [11], the CA stated the following: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clearly, an objective approach must be taken to determine the intentions of the contracting parties as expressed in the document.  What must be sought is the meaning that the contract conveys to a reasonable person having the background knowledge that would have been reasonably available to him.  A holistic approach must be taken and regard must be had to the commercial purpose of the contract and circumstances in which the contract was made … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen</span> [2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”), the CA elaborated at [30]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he purpose of interpretation is to give effect to the objectively ascertained expressed intentions of the contracting parties as it emerges from the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language.  Embedded within this statement are certain key principles: (a) first, in general both the text and context must be considered … ; (b) second, it is the <span class="font-italic">objectively ascertained intentions of the parties</span> that is relevant, not their subjective intentions … ; and (c) third, the object of interpretation is the verbal expressions used by the parties and so, <span class="font-italic">the text of their agreement is of first importance</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> went on to lay down the following guiding principles (at [37] to [39]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 … Among the powerful insights that the modern contextual approach provides, as stated by Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</span> [1998] 1 WLR 896 (“<span class="font-italic">ICS</span>”), is that the meaning of a word should not be confused with the meaning that would be conveyed by the use of that word in a document.  The former, as he said, was “a matter of dictionaries and grammars”; the latter is the proper domain of contractual interpretation, which is about discerning the meaning that the expressions in the document would convey to a reasonable person with the relevant background knowledge …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 However (and this is where we come back to the importance of the text), in ascertaining the meaning that the words of a contract would convey to a reasonable person with the relevant background knowledge, the words used by the parties occupy primacy of place. In <span class="font-italic">Arnold v Britton</span> [2015] 2 WLR 1593, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC (with whom Lord Sumption and Lord Hughes JJSC) agreed) explained the reason for this as follows (at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The exercise of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable reader, and <span class="font-italic">save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision</span>.  Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties have control over the language they use in a contract.  And, again save perhaps in a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 The verbal expressions in a contract are the vehicle through which meaning if conveyed.  As we recently observed in <span class="font-italic">Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd v HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1069 at [2], “absent the text, the contract cannot be constructed out of context alone” …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In considering the primacy of the contractual text and the interaction between text and context, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd) </span>[2015] 2 SLR 1187 (“<span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B</span>”) noted that whilst there might often be more than one immutable meaning to words, and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, to phrases, it was “not inconceivable that the <span class="font-italic">text</span> itself might be <span class="font-italic">plain and unambiguous inasmuch as it admitted of one clear meaning</span>” [emphasis added]. This would also mean that there is a “<span class="font-italic">coincidence</span> between both text and context inasmuch as there is nothing untoward in the context which militates against what is the plain language of the text itself” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B</span> at [31].   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B</span> proceeded to observe (at [31]) that if, however, the meaning of the text concerned was plain and unambiguous but would lead to an absurd result “based on the objective evidence available (this would include, in a commercial case, arriving at a result which demonstrated an absence of business common sense)”, then the court concerned would have to undertake a very careful analysis of the text and context in order to ascertain whether the text was indeed plain and unambiguous. This was because if the text was in fact plain and unambiguous, giving effect to it would usually not (simultaneously) engender an absurd result; generally, the law ought to lead to a just and fair result (as opposed to an absurd one).  The important caveat in all this, however, was that whilst both text and context tended to interact with each other, there had to be a balance struck: the context could not be utilised as an excuse by the court concerned to <span class="font-italic">rewrite</span> the terms of the contract according to its (<span class="font-italic">subjective</span>) view of what it thought the result ought to be in the case at hand. The CA highlighted once more the significance of the objective evidence in the following terms (at [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To this end, the court must always base its decision on <span class="font-italic">objective</span> evidence.  More specifically, whilst there is a need to avoid an absurd result, the aim cannot be pursued at all costs; it must necessarily give way if the objective evidence clearly bears out a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">causative connection</span> between the absurd result or consequences on the one hand and the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract on the other … Put simply, the court <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must</span> ascertain, based on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all the relevant objective evidence</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the intention of the parties </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">at the time they entered into the contract</span>.  In this regard, the courts should <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ordinarily</span> start from the working position that the parties did not intend that the term(s) concerned were to produce an absurd result.  <span class="font-italic">However</span>, this is <span class="font-italic">only</span> a <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> – <span class="font-italic">and no more</span>. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In <span class="font-italic">Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd v HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1069 (“<span class="font-italic">Lucky Realty</span>”), the CA agreed with the Judge below that the contextual approach to contractual interpretation was to be carried out by starting with the parties’ words in the specific part of the contract in question (at [38] and [49]).  The second step was to consider the rest of the contract.  The third step was to consider extrinsic evidence.  In respect of the last, it is clear that “ambiguity is no longer a prerequisite for the court’s consideration of extrinsic material … [and] neither is absurdity or the existence of an alternative technical meaning”: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”) at [130]. Nonetheless, the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for the purpose of contractual interpretation remains subject to a number of restrictions.  The CA in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> summarised these restrictions as follows (at [42]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The pleading requirements set out at [73] of <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>, which require the nature, particulars, and effect of the extrinsic evidence sought to be used to be pleaded with specificity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The exclusionary provisions of the EA [Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)], chiefly those found at ss 95 and 96, which act as an absolute bar to the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in certain cases (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [65(c)].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The continued bar against the admissibility of parol evidence of the drafters’ subjective intentions at the time of the conclusion of the contract outside situations in which there is latent ambiguity (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [59] and [65(d)].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The general requirement that the extrinsic evidence sought to be admitted must be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and relate to a clear or obvious context (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [132(d)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Two categories of extrinsic evidence, in particular, have been the subject of reservations expressed by the CA: prior (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pre-contract) negotiations and subsequent (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, post-contract) conduct.  In respect of the former, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) noted academic commentary favouring a departure from “the seemingly blanket exclusionary rule against the admissibility of prior negotiations” (at [75]). That said, the CA expressly limited its decision on this point in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We prefer to leave for another occasion the consideration of whether this argument is to be accepted in principle; and if so, whether evidence of prior negotiations should nonetheless be excluded as irrelevant or unhelpful for the policy reasons set out by Lord Hoffman in <span class="font-italic">Chartbook</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… or on the ground that it may amount to parol evidence of subjective intent and not fall within ss 97 to 100 of the EA.  Whichever way that may eventually be resolved, any further attempt to rely on such material should be made with full consciousness of the concerns already expressed and in compliance with the pleading requirements we have just prescribed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan v Geng Changqing</span> [2015] 3 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span>”), the CA had to interpret a clause (“cl 1”) in an agreement for the sale and purchase of shares to determine whether the Respondent was contractually obliged to transfer to the Appellant legal ownership of the shares in all the relevant entities of her business (referred to as “the Apple Plus business”).  The CA found that there was such an obligation on the Respondent’s part, and in so finding, it referred <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> to previous drafts of the agreement and held that evidence of these previous drafts was consistent with its analysis of cl 1 of the agreement.  It is crucial to note, however, that the CA took pains to make it clear that its analysis of cl 1 was “in fact sufficient, in and of itself, to resolve the issue being considered … (centring around the interpretation of cl 1)”, and that “the evidence of the prior drafts [performed] more of a <span class="font-italic">confirmatory </span>(and, hence, supplementary) function compared to situations where the evidence of prior negotiations plays a pivotal role” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> at [68].  Referring to the passage cited above from <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>, the CA also noted (at [69]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(W)hether or not there should – in the Singapore context – be a principle that evidence of prior negotiations ought to be generally admissible is a legal issue that is still an open question and … caution should therefore be exercised in this particular regard … The precise legal status (in particular, the limits (if any) and/or safeguards) of a situation involving evidence of prior negotiations remains to be worked out in a future case (when full argument has been heard), although there ought, in our view, to be no difficult in satisfying the three requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> where the situation concerned … is extremely clear <span class="font-italic">and</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in any event, in a case such as the present, the evidence of prior negotiations merely serves as a <span class="font-italic">confirmatory</span> (and hence, complementary as well as subsidiary) function.  Much would, of course, depend very much on the precise facts before the court. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As to evidence of subsequent conduct, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> also sounded a note of caution, pointing out that it had already observed in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>(at [132](d)) that “the relevance of subsequent conduct remains a controversial and evolving topic that will require more extensive scrutiny by this court at a more appropriate juncture”: <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan </span>at [73].  In <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span>, the court held (at [74]) that “even if it were accepted that there was no blanket prohibition against the admissibility of such evidence”, the respondent’s attempt in that case to rely on evidence of the appellant’s post-contract failure to enforce her strict legal rights was largely without merit, as such omission on the Appellant’s part was probably “a result of ignorance of the legally-prudent course she should take”, as opposed to an understanding that there was no obligation on the Respondent’s part to transfer all her shares in the Apple Plus business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is also useful at this juncture to recap the “usual canons and techniques of contractual interpretation” which a court will draw upon in deciding the exact interpretation to be assigned to the provisions of a contract.  These have been summarised by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> (some of these interpretive canons having been subsequently reiterated in the cases cited above) (at [131]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The aim of construction</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, the aim of the exercise of construction of a contract or other document is to ascertain the meaning which it would convey to a reasonable business person.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The objective principle</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Secondly, the <span class="font-italic">objective principle</span> is therefore critical in defining the approach the courts will take.

Thus, in cl 9.1(i), it was stipulated that the parties agreed and undertook that “as soon as practicable” after completion of the Shareholders’ Agreement, “the [1st and 2nd Defendants] and [the Plaintiff] shall enter into a call option agreement, in substantially the form as set out in Schedule B [to the Shareholders’ Agreement]”.  The recitals to the COAs themselves expressly stated that the Plaintiff (referred to as the “Grantor” of the call options) and the 1st and 2nd Defendants (referred to as the “Purchaser” of the call options) had agreed to enter into the COAs “on the terms and subject to the conditions set out” in the said agreements, and that the Defendants’ call options would be “exercisable in accordance with the terms contained in this Agreement”.

The Call Option Period overlapped with the “Default Period”, which was defined as the period of six months from the date of the COAs.  A call option notice could be exercised within the Default Period as well.  This was the meaning achieved by the words “the right to exercise the Call Option at any time during the Option Period (<span class="font-italic">or the Default Period, as the case may be</span>) over the Call Option Shares” [emphasis added] in cll 2.1 and 2.2.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whilst a call option may be exercised at any time during the 24-month Call Option Period, including the Default Period constituted by the first six months, the aggregate Exercise Price for the Call Option Shares would differ depending on whether or not a Default Event had occurred (see cl 3).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If no Default Event had occurred, the aggregate Exercise Price would be either 120% of the aggregate purchase price paid by the Plaintiff for the shares (less all dividends received by the Plaintiff up to the date of exercise of the call options), or the purchase price offered by an unrelated third party for the shares in relation to a proposed purchase of the 3rd Defendant’s entire issued and paid-up share capital (whichever was the higher of the two) (see cl 3(a)).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If a Default Event had occurred, the aggregate Exercise Price for the Call Option Shares would be $1 (see cl 3(b)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 A Default Event occurred when the Plaintiff failed to refer to the 3rd Defendant at least 60 patients within a consecutive six-month period from the date of the COA (13 February 2015).  Put another way, this meant that the Plaintiff had the full six months from the date of the COA in which to achieve the minimum 60 referrals.  It was not disputed that the last day of this six-month period was 13 August 2015.  Whether or not a Default Event had occurred, therefore, could only be determined upon the expiry of this six-month period: that is, <span class="font-italic">after</span> 13 August 2015, and not before.

</div>  In his AEIC, Dr Fan took the position that “by late July 2015”, it should already have been “apparent to the 1st and 2nd Defendant[s] that the Plaintiff would not be able to reach the 60 Patient[s] Requirement”; and that it was therefore open to them “from late July 2015 onwards to exercise the Default Call Option”.  In its closing submissions, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants “could also have served” the default calls on the last day of the six-month Default Period, that is, “on 13 August 2015”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In my view, the proposition that the Defendants were required to serve their call option notices before the actual expiry of the Default Period – whether “by late July 2015” or “on 13 August 2015” or “by 3 August 2015” – was devoid of merit.  The Plaintiff’s interpretation must be rejected for the simple reason that the meaning it sought to ascribe to the term “Default Event” was not one which the contractual language could reasonably bear.  The Plaintiff’s interpretation meant that one would be able validly to say – for example – that 20 patient referrals by 3 August 2015 would qualify as a “Default Event”.  Yet, when one looked at the contractual clause in which the Default Event was defined, it expressly required that there must have been “failure by [the Plaintiff] … to refer … at least sixty (60) clients to the Company within a consecutive six (6)-month period from the date of this Agreement”.  Something had clearly gone wrong with the language if the Plaintiff were correct in claiming that 20 patient referrals by 3 August 2015 could also constitute a Default Event under this definition.  To quote the CA from its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> (at [31]), “(w)hile the court is entitled to depart from the plain and ordinary meaning of the expression used, there is a limit to what the court can legitimately do in the name of interpretation.”  Whether or not this limit has been transgressed is, as the CA put it, “sometimes a matter of nicety”, but in this case (as in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>), “the line was plainly crossed here” (<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [31]).  The unambiguous – indeed, peremptory (“<span class="font-italic">shall</span> mean” [emphasis added]) – reference to “at least sixty (60) clients to the Company within a consecutive six (6)-month period from the date of this Agreement” simply did not leave wriggle room to argue that failure to refer  a certain number of patients by a date <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> the expiry of the six months could also constitute a Default Event.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Plaintiff’s conception of the “Default Event” was not only contrary to the plain words of the relevant contractual clauses; it would go against good commercial sense, in that it would expose the parties to intolerable uncertainty about when a certain number of referrals might be deemed sufficient to trigger default calls before the expiry of the Default Period.  This was all the more so because in the Plaintiff’s formulation, the number of patients which could signify such failure was not expressly or clearly pre-determined.  In this connection, I noted the approach of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Tin Yong</span>, where the court – in construing a retirement deed between the respondent and the other partners to a partnership – rejected an interpretation of the deed which would entitle the respondent to retain some interest in the partnership even after executing the retirement deed, noting that such a construction “would go against good commercial sense and the plain terms of the Deed” (<span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Tin Yong</span> at [13]).  In the same vein, I concluded that the Plaintiff’s interpretation would violate good commercial sense in the uncertainty and confusion it would introduce into the parties’ contractual arrangements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Plaintiff argued that if default call options entitling the Defendants to acquire its shares for $1 could be exercised after the six-month Default Period, this “would render the references to ‘<span class="font-italic">Default Period</span>’ in clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of the Call Option Agreements wholly superfluous and otiose” [emphasis in original].

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  The Plaintiff did not explain the basis for this proposition, and, with respect, I found it to be devoid of merit as well.  On a plain reading of cll 2.1, it was apparent that the words “the right to exercise the Call Option at any time during the Option Period (or the Default Period, as the case may be) over the Call Option Shares” were intended to make it clear that the Defendants could exercise call options at any time during the 24-months Call Option Period, without waiting to see if a Default Event had occurred (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without waiting for the Default Period to expire).  Similar language was used in cl 2.2. As cl 3 went on to make clear, however, the price at which they would be able to acquire the shares would differ substantially, depending on whether or not a Default Event had occurred.  There was thus nothing “superfluous” or “otiose” about the references to “Default Period” in cll 2.1 and 2.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 As alluded to earlier, the Plaintiff also argued that cl 9.1(i) of the Shareholders’ Agreement provided support for its proposition that default call options were only exercisable within the six months from the date of the COAs.  The Plaintiff relied on the following phrase: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the right … to purchase all the shares held by [the Plaintiff] at the relevant point in time either (a) upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the Call Option Agreement) during a period of 6 months from the Completion Date; or (b) at any time during a period of 24 months from the Completion Date, at the relevant agreed exercise prices …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to the Plaintiff, this phrase – and the word “during” in particular – meant that default call options could only be exercised within the six months from the date of the COAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I have earlier made it clear that in ascertaining parties’ intention on the issue of when the Defendants could exercise the default call options, the first port of call must be the relevant clauses of the COAs which were expressly stated to be the agreements providing for the terms and conditions on which call options could be exercised.  Conversely, cl 9.1(i) of the Shareholders’ Agreement was the provision which created the contractual obligation for the parties to enter into these separate agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 This did not mean that I disregarded cl 9.1(i) of the Shareholders’ Agreement in interpreting the COA provisions.  Following the contextual approach to contractual interpretation, I did examine the said clause in considering the exact interpretation to be assigned to cll 2.1, 2.2, and 3(b) of the COAs.  I did not find that cl 9.1(i) provided any support for the Plaintiff’s case.  I would point out that the Plaintiff’s argument that cl 9.1(i) provided for “<span class="font-italic">2 ‘relevant point(s) in time’</span> during which the 1st and 2nd Defendants may exercise their call options” [emphasis added]

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> regrettably misquoted the provision.  Clause 9(1)(i) expressly provided for a singular “relevant <span class="font-italic">point</span> in time” [emphasis added]: the Plaintiff itself added the letter “s” in parentheses” in the closing submissions.  In my view, the phrase “at the relevant point in time” was with reference to the holding of shares by the Investor (the Plaintiff), and not the exercise of call options, having regard to the relevant sentence in which this phrase appeared: “the right but not the obligation to purchase all the shares held by the Investor at the relevant point in time”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Leaving aside the submission that cl 9.1(i) provided for “<span class="font-italic">2 ‘relevant point(s) in time’ </span>during which the 1st and 2nd Defendants may exercise their call options” [emphasis added], much of the Plaintiff’s remaining arguments on cl 9.1(i) hinged on the use of the word “during” in cl 9.1(i): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… either (a) upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the Call Option Agreement) <span class="font-italic">during</span> a period of 6 months from the Completion Date; or (b) at any time <span class="font-italic">during</span> a period of 24 months from the Completion Date, at the relevant agreed exercise prices … [emphasis added]  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to the Plaintiff, the use of the word “during” must mean that a <span class="font-italic">default call option</span> could only be exercised “during” the six months from the completion of the COA, because it would not make sense to speak of the <span class="font-italic">default event</span> – premised as it were on the 60 Patients Requirement – occurring “during” this 6-month period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Plaintiff’s argument failed to address the following.  Firstly, as I have noted, cl 9.1(i) clearly pointed to the COAs as the source of parties’ rights and obligations insofar as the exercise of call options was concerned; hence, for example, the reference to the COAs as the source of definition of an “event of default” for the purposes of exercises of call options.  Secondly, the Plaintiff’s argument ignored the fact that the definition of the “Default Event” in the COAs – read in conjunction with cll 2.1, 2.2, and 3 of the COAs – made it impossible both as a matter of law and of logic to say that a Default Event had occurred until the first six-month period had expired, and not before.  In the circumstances, the above sentence was at best ambiguous: it certainly could not amount to an unambiguous stipulation that a default call option be validly exercisable only within the first six months from the COAs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I would add, in any event, that the COA clauses were specifically drafted to provide for the terms on which call options could be exercised: insofar as cl 9.1(i) could be said to be inconsistent with the provisions of the COA, the COA provisions must prevail.  I refer in this respect to the tenth canon of contractual interpretation elucidated by the CA at [131] of <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see above at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ attempts to rely on extrinsic evidence in interpreting the relevant contractual clauses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In approaching the interpretation of the relevant contractual clauses in this case, parties have also sought to rely on extrinsic evidence in the form of pre-contractual negotiations and (in the Defendants’ case) post-contractual conduct.  Before I address the key pieces of extrinsic evidence cited by the parties, two preliminary points should be made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Firstly, it must be remembered that the COAs and the other agreements were <span class="font-italic">not</span> documents drafted by laypersons.  Although early drafts had apparently emanated from Kam and his BMI colleagues (who are not lawyers), there is no dispute that the final versions executed by the parties were drafted by the Plaintiff’s lawyers, Shook Lin.  As such, this was not a case in which one would “eschew the strict construction of the structure and language” of the relevant contractual clauses (<span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> at [50]).  As the CA indicated in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [74]), where the contract in question was drafted by lawyers, one would generally expect them to have expressed themselves with “the exactitude that might be expected of experienced legal draftsmen”.  As I noted earlier, in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> (at [74]), the CA also took pains to explain that its remarks in <span class="font-italic">Xia Zheng Yan</span> – that the court should “eschew the strict construction” of the contractual language and adopt instead a “more common-sense approach that considers the reasonable and probable expectations that parties would have had” (<span class="font-italic">Xia Zheng Yan</span> at [50]) – were to be understood in the context of the facts in that case, where the contract in dispute had been drafted in Mandarin by laypersons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Secondly, both the Plaintiff and the Defendants have attempted to rely at one point or another on witnesses’ stated opinions of how the relevant contractual clauses should be understood.

</div>  Insofar as these were attempts to rely on parties’ subjective intentions to elucidate the meaning of the relevant contractual language, they were impermissible and had to be disregarded: <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [30] and [64].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As to the Defendants’ attempt to rely on evidence of subsequent conduct, given the reservations expressed by the CA about the feasibility of relying on such evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [132(d)], <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S.

Bearing in mind the CA’s injunction in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> that any extrinsic evidence sought to be admitted must be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties and relate to a clear or obvious context, it was apparent that the evidence of subsequent conduct cited by both sides failed to satisfy – at the very least – the third of these requirements.  The Defendants sought to rely on Anqi’s email of 6 September 2015 as an “admission’” by the Plaintiff of the Defendants’ right to exercise default call options,

</div>
</div>  In my view, however, the 6 September 2015 email was somewhat equivocal. Although it referred to the “difficult situations” the Plaintiff had found itself in, promised “more diversified and active marketing programs”, and requested the 1st Defendant’s “understanding” and recognition of its “effort”, it also completely skirted around the issue of the Defendants’ right to buy-back its shares for $1.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As to pre-contractual negotiations, I did not find the email evidence cited by both sides to be compliant with the requirements of the contextual approach as elucidated in the cases discussed earlier at [81] to [84].  Insofar as both sides sought to argue that the way in which the prior drafts of the various agreements developed demonstrated either that the default call option had to be exercised within the first six months from completion of the agreement, or that it was exercisable only upon the expiry of the six months until the end of the 24 months from completion, it was by no means clear that such reliance on prior drafts would be permitted as a matter of course.  I refer in this respect to the observations of the CA at [60] of <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span>.  It should also be noted that in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span>, the CA opined that the evidence of the prior draft agreements was consistent with its analysis of the disputed cl 1, but caveated that this evidence performed “more of a <span class="font-italic">confirmatory</span> (and, hence, supplementary) function compared to situations where the evidence of prior negotiations plays a pivotal role” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [68]). The CA in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> was able to take such an approach because it had found that the contractual language was sufficient in and of itself to resolve the dispute over the interpretation of cl 1.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The CA’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> as to what might suffice for evidence of prior negotiations to be admissible, and its reference to the English case of <span class="font-italic">A&amp;J </span><span class="font-italic">Inglis v John Buttery &amp; Co</span> (1873) 3 App Cas 552 (“<span class="font-italic">Inglis</span>”), were also instructive.  <span class="font-italic">Inglis</span> was a case concerning a contract for works on a ship for a fixed sum of £17,250.  In the draft contract circulated between the shipbuilders and the shipowners, the following provision on iron work was set out: “Iron work. – The plating of the hull to be carefully overhauled and repaired, <span class="font-italic">but if </span><span class="font-italic">any new plating is required the same to be paid for extra</span>…” [emphasis added].  Subsequently the agent for the shipowners wrote to the shipbuilder to ask that the latter “erase all the stipulations after the word ‘repaired’”, stating that the shipbuilders understood their draft agreement clearly to stipulate “that the sum of £17,250 covers lengthening, new engines, &amp;c., and all repairs and alterations necessary to class the steamer A1 100 at Lloyds”.  The shipbuilder agreed to the proposed deletion, and before the contract was signed, the stipulation was deleted by an ink line across it, with the added authentication of a marginal note stating “fourteen words deleted”.  The marginal note was also signed by both parties.  The CA in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan</span> (at [69]) described <span class="font-italic">Inglis</span> as an “extremely clear” case where there would have been “no difficulty in satisfying the three requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”.  The same could not be said of the evidence of pre-contractual negotiations cited by the present parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Indeed, in respect of some of the evidence cited by the Plaintiff, it was not clear to me that the evidence even existed.  I noted, for example, that the Plaintiff claimed that in the negotiations preceding the signing of the 13 February 2015 agreements, “in proposing their amendments to the August 2014 drafts by BMI, Shook Lin proposed a shorter time period for the exercise of the Default Call Options”.

</div>  As far as I could see from the email evidence adduced, there was no such proposal expressly put forward by Shook Lin, nor did the Plaintiff point to any email containing such a proposal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It appeared that all that the Plaintiff meant was that Shook Lin had made amendments to the drafts forwarded by BMI which included amendments to the drafts providing for call options – but this was very different from a specific assertion that “Shook Lin proposed a shorter time period for the exercise of the Default Call Options”.  Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the draft Default Call Option Agreement forwarded by BMI made it clear that a default event would be constituted by the investing party’s failure to refer at least 60 patients within a consecutive six-month period from the date of the agreement, and that on the occurrence of a default event, the Defendants would have the option to purchase the investing party’s shares for $1 within 24 months from the date of the agreement.  Nowhere in the email correspondence following the transmission of this earlier draft was there a statement by Shook Lin that the period available for the exercise of such a default call option was to be shortened to the first six months from the date of the merged COA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for the finalised Term Sheet which the Defendants sought to rely on,

In particular, whilst referring in general terms to “Events of Default”, the finalised Term Sheet did not define what would amount to a “Default Event” entitling the Defendants to “exercise the Call Option… to call the shares to purchase from [the Plaintiff] at S$1”.

</div>  In other words, while Dr Fan recognised that the default call mechanism represented a risk for the Plaintiff, it was apparent that at the point of entering into the various agreements, he believed it was a risk the Plaintiff could comfortably undertake.  Importantly, moreover, it should be noted that neither the COAs nor any of the other agreements required that there be any minimum spend per each of the 60 patients referred.  Indeed, cl 1 of the COAs expressly stipulated that for the purposes of defining the “Default Event”, the referral of patients by the Plaintiff (or Nanyang Travel Planner) to the 3rd Defendant was to be without regard to “whether any agreement [was] ultimately entered into” with the patients referred.  On its own admission, the Plaintiff did not foresee or expect the problems it later encountered, such as difficulties in obtaining visas for its Chinese patients to travel to Singapore.  It would appear that Dr Fan himself had also hoped that the Defendants would “be understanding” even if a Default Event occurred

To put it another way, the above arguments failed to recognise that the key issue in contention between the parties was whether, assuming a Default Event had occurred, the 1st and 2nd Defendants could validly exercise default call options to acquire the Plaintiff’s shares for $1 after 13 August 2015 – or whether default call options exercised after 13 August 2015 were out of time and thus invalid.

</div>  I did not find this position to have been substantively altered or contradicted by the responses in the FBP.  Thus, for example, having regard to the definition of “Default Event” in the COAs, it would not be inconsistent to say that if the Plaintiff failed by the end of the day on 13 August 2015 to refer at least 60 patients, this failure would constitute the occurrence of a Default Event on 13 August 2015 (albeit at the end of that day) – <span class="font-italic">and</span> that the window of time in which the Defendants could exercise the default call options was immediately thereafter, on 14 August 2015 up to the end of the last day of the 24-month period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 13 February 2017).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In any event, the purpose of a party furnishing particulars of its pleadings is really to ensure that the opposing party is clear as to the case it has to meet and is not unfairly caught by surprise at trial (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span> vol I (Foo Chee Hock editor-in-chief) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) at para 18/12/12).

It was not clear to me from the responses in the FBP that such concession was made by the Defendants.  However, even assuming for the sake of argument that such concession had been made, for the reasons explained in [89] to [100], I found that the contractual language of the relevant clauses simply could not bear the meaning which the Plaintiff said it did.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of my decision on the interpretation of the contractual clauses relating to default call options</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 To sum up this section: for the reasons explained in [74] to [116], I rejected the Plaintiff’s argument that the 1st and 2nd Defendant could only exercise their default call options within the first six months from the date of the COAs, and that the default call option notices of 6 May 2016 were invalid.  The 1st and 2nd Defendant could exercise default call options and invoke the exercise price of $1 if and when a Default Event as defined in the COAs had occurred.  A Default Event as defined in the COAs occurred only if and when the Plaintiff was unable to refer at least 60 patients to the 3rd Defendant within the first six months from the date of the COAs – which meant that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had to wait until the expiry of this six-month period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, up to the end of the last day in that period, 13 August 2015) before they could say that a Default Event had occurred which entitled them to exercise default call options.   Once a Default Event had occurred, they had the entire Call Option Period as defined by the COAs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 24 months from the date of the COAs) in which to exercise the default call options.  Accordingly, and for the reasons set out above, the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ default call option notices of 6 May 2016 were not “out of time” and certainly not invalid.  This also meant that the Plaintiff’s purported put option notices of 25 August 2016 were invalid, because the POAs would have been terminated upon the exercise by the Defendants of the call options on 6 May 2016: see cl 7(iii) of the POAs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the Plaintiff’s alternative argument that cll 2 and 3(b) of the COAs amounted to unenforceable penalty clauses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I will next deal with the Plaintiff’s alternative argument that the Defendants’ exercise of default call options pursuant to cll 2 and 3(b) of the COAs were invalid because these provisions amounted to penalty clauses which should not be enforced.  I did not accept this argument and I explain below my reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 At the outset it should be stated that this was a rather odd argument for the Plaintiff to make.  Considering that the COAs were vetted and drafted by the Plaintiff’s own lawyers, one would have thought it quite improbable (to say the least) for its lawyers to have drafted a penalty clause (operating against itself) into the agreement.  In this respect I refer to the judgement of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (“UKSC”) in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square Holding BV v </span><span class="font-italic">Makdessi and another appeal</span> [2016] AC 1172 (“<span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square</span>”), in which Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC and Lord Sumption JSC had specifically observed (at [35]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a negotiated contract between properly advised parties of comparable bargaining power, the strong initial presumption must be that the parties themselves are the best judges of what is legitimate in a provision dealing with the consequences of breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Nevertheless, I did consider carefully cll 2 and 3(b), and the parties’ submissions on whether they amounted to a penalty clause.  Insofar as the governing principles in this area were concerned, parties were agreed that the <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">classicus</span> was <span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square</span>.  It will be useful to consider the principles stated by the UKSC in the following extract from the judgement of Lord Neuberger PSC and Lord Sumption JSC.  Having stated that a contractual provision could not be a penalty unless it was a provision operating on a breach of contract, their Lordships stated (at [12] to [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 … As a matter of authority the question is settled in England by the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Export Credits Guarantee Department v Universal Oil Products Co</span> [1983] 1 WLR 399 (“<span class="font-italic">ECGD</span>”).  Lord Roskill, with whom the rest of the committee agreed, said, at p 403:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“perhaps the main purpose, of the law relating to penalty clauses is to prevent a plaintiff recovering a sum of money in respect of a breach of contract committed by a defendant which bears little or no relationship to the loss actually suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the breach by the defendant.  But it is not and never has been for the courts to relieve a party from the consequences of what may in the event prove to be an onerous or possibly even a commercially imprudent bargain.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 This principle is worth restating at the outset of any analysis of the penalty rule, because it explains much about the way in which it has developed.  There is a fundamental difference between a jurisdiction to review the fairness of a contractual obligation and a jurisdiction to regulate the remedy for its breach.  Leaving aside challenges going to the reality of consent, such as those based on fraud, duress or undue influence, the courts do not review the fairness of men’s bargains either at law or in equity.  The penalty rule regulates only the remedies available for breach of a party’s primary obligations, not the primary obligations themselves.  This was not a new concept in 1983, when <span class="font-italic">ECGD</span> was decided.  It had been the foundation of the equitable jurisdiction, which depended on the treatment of penal defeasible bonds as secondary obligations … And it provided the whole basis of the classic distinction made at law between a penalty and a genuine pre-estimate of loss, the former being essentially a way of punishing the contract-breaker rather than compensating the innocent party for his breach …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 This means that in some cases the application of the penalty rule may depend on how the relevant obligation is framed in the instrument, i e whether as a conditional primary obligation or a secondary obligation providing a contractual alternative to damages at law.  Thus, where a contract contains an obligation on one party to perform an act, and also provides that, if he does not perform it, he will pay the other party a specified sum of money, the obligation to pay the specified sum is a secondary obligation which is capable of being a penalty; but if the contract does not impose (expressly or impliedly) an obligation to perform the act, but simply provides that, if one party does not perform, he will pay the other party a specified sum, the obligation to pay the specified sum is a conditional primary obligation and cannot be a penalty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 … [T]he classification of terms for the purpose of the penalty rule depends on the substance of the term and not on its form or on the label which the parties have chosen to attach to it …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 Payment of a sum of money is the classic obligation under a penalty clause … However, it seems to us that there is no reason why an obligation to transfer assets (either for nothing or at an undervalue) should not be capable of constituting a penalty …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Locally, the analysis applied by the UKSC in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square</span> has been endorsed by our High Court: see for example <span class="font-italic">Allplus</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Phoon Wui Nyen (Pan Weiyuan)</span> [2016] SGHC 144 (“<span class="font-italic">Allplus</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">iTronic</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon &amp; anor</span> [2016] 3 SLR 663 (“<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span>”).  The facts of the latter case are especially helpful for illustrative purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 <span class="font-italic">iTronic</span> involved convertible loan agreements by which the plaintiffs agreed to extend loans to the defendant to assist his bid to list his company.  In return, the plaintiffs were granted the option of converting the value of the loans to shares in the said company upon its successful listing.  In the event that the listing did not materialise by a stated date, the defendant was to repay the principal loans together with certain compensation sums.  When the listing did not materialise, the plaintiffs sued for repayment of the loans and the compensation sums.  Having found that the monies in question had not in fact been repaid, the High Court also considered the issue of whether the compensation sums amounted to penalties.  Applying the reasoning of the UKSC in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square</span>, the High Court held (at [169] to [173]) that notwithstanding the label “Compensation Sum”, the said “compensation sums” were not actually stipulated as a remedy for a breach of a primary obligation.  This was because the agreement between the parties did not impose any obligation on the defendant (whether expressly or impliedly) to procure listing on the stock exchange by the stated date.  Since there was no obligation to list, it followed that the failure to list by the stated date was not an event of breach.  Since the defendant’s repayment obligation did not arise upon an event of breach, it was not a secondary obligation.  Instead, the defendant’s repayment obligation was better characterised as a conditional primary obligation which crystallised upon the occurrence of an event, that is, the failure of the company to list by the stated date.  Upon this occurrence, the convertible loan agreements reverted to simple loan agreements under which the defendant was contractually obliged to repay what he had borrowed.  Seen in this context, it was evident that the “compensation sums” were “intended as interest to compensate – even if rather generously – the plaintiffs for the loss of use of their money (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the cost of money)” (<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span> at [173]).  These “compensation sums” therefore constituted part of the defendant’s primary obligation to repay the debt owed to the plaintiff; and in the circumstances, the rule against penalties did not bite.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Applying the above analysis to the present facts, the Plaintiff had the onus of persuading me that cll 2 and 3(b) of the COAs amounted to a secondary obligation which was capable of being a penalty.  However, apart from making the general assertion that these clauses were “secondary obligations” because their purpose was to “state the consequence of non-compliance with the primary obligation on the Plaintiff to refer 60 patients to the 3rd Defendant within 6 months from the date of” the COAs,

</div>  The COAs did not impose (whether expressly or impliedly) a contractual obligation on the Plaintiff to refer at least 60 patients to the 3rd Defendant within the first six months from the date from the agreements.  To put it another way, failure by the Plaintiff to refer at least 60 patients to the 3rd Defendant within the first six months would not constitute an event of breach under the COAs.  The COAs simply provided – via cll 2 and 3(b), read together with the definition of “Default Event” in cl 1 – that if the Plaintiff did not refer at least 60 patients to the 3rd Defendant within the first six months, the 1st and 2nd Defendants would be entitled to exercise call options to acquire the Plaintiff’s shares at the price of $1; and in the event that they did exercise such call options, the Plaintiff would have to transfer its shares to them for $1.  The obligation to transfer its shares to the 1st and 2nd Defendants upon their exercising the call options was therefore a conditional primary obligation; and being a conditional primary obligation, it could not be a penalty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Having made the above findings, I did not find it necessary to deal with the Defendants’ submissions on the application of the <span class="font-italic">Dunlop</span> test.

Having considered the evidence, however, I did not accept the Plaintiff’s argument that it disclosed a Settlement Agreement.  I will explain my reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Both the Plaintiff and the Defendants cited <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Ing</span>”) as the authority for the elements of a valid compromise agreement (or “Settlement Agreement”, to use the Plaintiff’s expression).  In <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Ing</span>, the CA – citing, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, David Foskett, <span class="font-italic">The Law and Practice of Compromise</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2005) – set out the following requirements (at [43] to [71]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 [A] compromise is essentially founded on contract.  Before a compromise can be reached between two parties, there must, of necessity, be an <span class="font-italic">actual or potential dispute</span> between parties that can be disposed of …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 [A] compromise will not arise unless certain requirements are fulfilled; these include … what is, in fact, traditionally required under the general common law of contract, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an identifiable agreement that is complete and certain, consideration, as well as an intention to create legal relations …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 <span class="font-italic">First</span>, there must be an identifiable agreement, which is complete and certain.  Essentially, this means that negotiations between the parties must have crystallised into a contractually-binding agreement in which there is no uncertainty as to the terms of the contract concerned.  The traditional tools of analysis centre around the concepts of offer and acceptance ...:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An offer, capable of being converted into an agreement by acceptance, must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64 Another pre-requisite is that of consideration …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Very generally put, consideration signifies a return recognised in law which is given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 On a more specific and precise level, the traditional definition adopted is the ‘benefit-detriment analysis’.  It also functions as a practical approach …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 There is also the requirement that there be an intention to create legal relations on the part of the parties concerned.  Put simply, it must be demonstrated that there was an intention on the part of both parties that the transaction entered into was to <span class="font-italic">have</span> <span class="font-italic">legal effect</span> before a valid contract can be said to have been formed.  Put another way, the parties must have intended that, if a disagreement arose or the contract was not honoured subsequently, the aggrieved party could invoke the assistance of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Based on the Plaintiff’s own case, I found that it could not cross even the first hurdle of showing the existence of an actual or potential dispute.  The Plaintiff did not in the course of the trial and its closing submissions elaborate on the nature of the alleged dispute which it claimed the parties reached a compromise on via their emails of 24 August and 25 August 2016.  Logically, if the Plaintiff’s case as to a compromise or Settlement Agreement were to make sense, there must have been a dispute regarding the validity of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ default call option notices of 6 May 2016.  The Plaintiff appeared to accept this implicitly since it claimed that the first term of the Settlement Agreement was that “<span class="font-italic">(n)</span><span class="font-italic">otwithstanding the Call Option Notices served on 6 May 2016</span>, the Plaintiff would sell its shares in the 3rd Defendant back to the 1st and 2nd Defendants pursuant to the Put Option Agreements” [emphasis added].  Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, however, it had also asserted <span class="font-italic">vide</span> its letter of 3 October 2016 to the Defendants that it was “not aware” of the “purported exercise” by the 1st and 2nd Defendants of their call options at the time it issued its put option notices on 25 August 2016, and that it had only “recently retrieved” the letter of 6 May 2016 sent by BMI in relation to the default call options. This letter of 3 October 2016 was in response to the 1st Defendant’s letter of 2 September 2016 asserting the validity of the default call notices, and which called for the Plaintiff’s execution of the share transfer forms forwarded with those notices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 From the above, it was plain that just taking the Plaintiff’s own assertions at face value, its case was internally inconsistent.  If the Plaintiff had in fact been unaware of the default call option notices at the point in time it issued its put option notices on 25 August 2016, there could not logically have been any dispute in existence between the parties over the validity of those default call option notices at the time the emails of 24 August and 25 August 2016 were exchanged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I must add, though, that I did not actually accept that the Plaintiff was unaware of the default call option notices until shortly before it sent the letter of 3 October 2016.  In cross-examination, Dr Fan admitted that he was informed of the default call option notices around 6 May 2016, via a telephone call from his staff.

</div>  However, I did not find Chee’s testimony credible.  Firstly, Dr Fan’s admission that he had been informed of the default call option notices around 6 May 2016 was consistent with Anqi’s testimony that she had seen the letter from BMI sometime in May 2016 when she returned to the office, and that she had informed Dr Fan about it.

</div>  Anqi was not challenged on this part of her testimony.  Secondly, the affidavit filed by Doreen Cheong on 26 October 2017 in connection with the Defendants’ application for security for costs in Summons No 4717 of 2018 also conceded the service of the default call option notices on 6 May 2016 while seeking to raise issues as to their validity.  Oddly, the Plaintiff elected not to call Doreen, even though it was not disputed that she was still its employee, and was physically available in Singapore.  Thirdly, if Chee and Doreen had been told by the 1st Defendant about the default call option notices on 16 August 2016 (as Chee himself admitted), it seemed incredible that they should have left it until <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Plaintiff’s purported exercise of the put options on 25 August 2016 before they “retrieved” the default call option notices.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 On the evidence before me, I concluded that the Plaintiff was in fact aware of the exercise by the 1st and 2nd Defendants of their default call options on 6 May 2016.  This was why – according to Anqi – she had several discussions with the 1st Defendant between May/June 2016 and July 2016 to try to “negotiate for a higher figure i.e. more than $1, to be paid to Nanyang for their shares”.

</div>  Contrary to what the Plaintiff appeared to assume, the fact that there were such negotiations did not demonstrate the existence of a dispute between the parties regarding the validity of the default call option notices.  Rather, <span class="font-italic">it was apparent that the Plaintiff did not challenge the validity of the Defendants’ exercise of default call options, but </span><span class="font-italic">was hoping to persuade the 1st Defendant to pay something more than $1 for the shares</span>.

Even on Chee’s evidence, the main purpose of these meetings was to discuss the 1st Defendant’s plans for the 3rd Defendant’s IPO.  It should also be remembered that Chee himself recounted the terms of the 1st Defendant’s IPO plans as follows: the 1st and 2nd Defendants would purchase the Plaintiff’s shares in the 3rd Defendant for $1; they would then sell these shares back to the Plaintiff for $1 so that the Plaintiff could remain shareholders of the 3rd Defendant and profit from its IPO; and at the same time parties would negotiate new agreements for their business collaboration, including new terms for patient referrals by the Plaintiff.  <span class="font-italic">On Chee’s evidence, therefore, the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Defendant’s IPO plans were premised on the Defendants’ entitlement to acquire the Plaintiff’s shares for $1 before selling them back to the Plaintiff for $1</span>.

</div>  Whilst Chee claimed that he informed the 1st Defendant that the default call notices were “out of time”, I did not find any credibility in these claims.  If Chee had been so certain that the default call notices were out of time, it was unbelievable that he should nonetheless have agreed to convey the 1st Defendant’s IPO plans to Dr Fan instead of pointing out to the 1st Defendant that the very premise for his IPO plans was non-existent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Even assuming for the sake of argument that the Plaintiff could prove a dispute with the Defendants over the validity of the default call notices, it was clear that it could not prove “an identifiable agreement” that was “complete and certain”.  The Plaintiff argued that Doreen’s 24 August 2016 email constituted the “settlement offer” which was accepted by the 1st Defendant’s email of 25 August 2016.  However, the 24 August 2016 email said nothing at all about the default call notices of 6 May 2016.  Instead, it merely thanked the 1st Defendant for sharing his IPO plans before stating that the Plaintiff had decided “after much consideration” to sell its shares back to the 1st and 2nd Defendants “in accordance with the Put Option Agreements”.

</div>  As for Doreen’s reference to selling the shares back under the POAs, the 1st Defendant testified that although he was taken by surprise, he believed that the Plaintiff would not be able to exercise their put options because the terms of their agreements provided for the POAs to be terminated once the Defendants exercised their call options, and that was why his reply to Doreen stated that they would “follow according to the terms and conditions” of their “shareholder’s agreement”.  This might not have been the most ideal response from a litigation perspective, but I had to bear in mind the fact that the 1st Defendant was not legally represented at this stage.  The bottom-line remained, in any event, that the 24 and 25 August 2016 email exchange could not in any way be said to constitute a clear offer on the one hand of a compromise subject to certain specified terms, and a “final and unqualified” assent on the other hand to such terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As for the other elements of consideration and an intention to create legal relations, these were not dealt with in the Plaintiff’s closing submissions, and I did not find them to be made out on the basis of the evidence adduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 For the reasons set out above, I rejected the Plaintiff’s alternative argument that parties had – via the email exchange of 24 August and 25 August 2016 – entered into a valid and binding Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the Plaintiff’s alternative argument that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were estopped from exercising the default call options</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The Plaintiff also argued in the alternative that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were estopped from exercising the default call options.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was an exchange of Whatsapp messages between Anqi and the 1st Defendant on 6 December 2015, in which Anqi had stated that the Plaintiff was “still trying to meet the 60 patients commitment” and requested the 1st Defendant to “allow [it] sometime till end October”.  The 1st Defendant had replied: “… No problem. I appreciate your efforts.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Plaintiff referred 37 new patients to the 3rd Defendant between September 2015 and May 2016.  The 1st and 2nd Defendants did not exercise the default call options in that period, until 6 May 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I did not find the above to be sufficient basis for finding that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had made a clear and unequivocal promise not to exercise the default call options.  Although the Plaintiff cited <span class="font-italic">Oriental Investments</span> in support of its argument of a promissory estoppel, the facts of that case were patently different and distinguishable from the Plaintiff’s.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In <span class="font-italic">Oriental Investments</span>, the plaintiff – who was a tenant of the defendant landlord – had erected certain structures on the tenanted premises without the requisite approval of the Urban Redevelopment Authority.  In offering to renew the first tenancy, the defendant included in the second tenancy a condition precedent that the unauthorised structures had to be removed prior to the renewal of the tenancy.  This was not done.  The defendant subsequently informed the plaintiff that there was no valid renewal of the first tenancy, re-entered the premises to take vacant possession, and dismantled the unauthorised structures.  In the claim brought by the plaintiff for (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) wrongful repudiation of the second tenancy, an issue arose as to whether the defendant was estopped from relying on the condition precedent without first giving the plaintiff an opportunity to remedy the breach in order to satisfy the condition precedent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Philip Pillai J, in finding for the plaintiff, noted that the defendant had not taken any steps during the first tenancy to enforce a clause in that tenancy agreement (cl 3.7) which prohibited any alterations and additions without prior consent from the landlord.  Pillai J noted that although the defendant had sent the plaintiff a letter on 20 November 2006 purporting to put on record its objections to the plaintiff’s breach of cl 3.7 and reserving “all rights to terminate” the tenancy”, there had been inaction on the Defendant’s part after sending this letter.  Pillai J held that such silence or mere inaction would not ordinarily amount to a clear and unequivocal promise by a party to refrain from insisting on its strict legal rights.  In this case, however, he held that there was a strong and unequivocal promise, firstly, because he believed the evidence of the plaintiff’s director, who testified that the defendant’s general manager had expressly assured him that the 20 November 2006 letter was merely “to serve as a record” and had “no real consequences” (<span class="font-italic">Oriental Investments </span>at [86]).  Moreover, Pillai J noted that not only was the defendant “generally nonchalant” about the unauthorised structures, the defendant’s general manager had actively recommended a contractor to the plaintiff for the erection of these structures, and had also been very much involved in assisting the plaintiff to apply for approvals for the structures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In this case, the conduct described above at [141(a)] and [141(c)] really amounted to no more than silence and inaction.  As for the Whatsapp exchange, the Whatsapp message from Anqi merely requested the 1st Defendant to allow the Plaintiff some time “till end October” to try to refer more patients, and the 1st Defendant’s statement “No problem” was specifically in response to this request.  I did not find it possible to read this statement as an unambiguous promise that he and the 2nd Defendant would avoid exercising the default call option “provided that the Plaintiff continued to make efforts to refer the remaining patients to the 3rd Defendant”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The Plaintiff’s own conduct following the issuance of the 6 May 2016 notices was also inconsistent with its having received a clear and unequivocal promise by the Defendants not to exercise the default call option “so long as the Plaintiff continued to make efforts to refer patients”.

</div>  Upon being served with these notices, the Plaintiff did not protest that the Defendants had gone back on their purported promise.  On the contrary, Anqi’s evidence – which the Plaintiff did not dispute – was that she held several discussions with the 1st Defendant between May/June 2016 and July 2016 to try to “negotiate for a higher figure i.e. more than $1, to be paid to Nanyang for their shares”.

In this respect, the Plaintiff claimed that it had acted in reliance on the purported promise by engaging in “more diversified and active marketing programs” to acquire more patients for the 3rd Defendant.  However, the only item which Dr Fan cited to demonstrate the Plaintiff’s “more diversified and active marketing programs” was a marketing video

When confronted in cross-examination with evidence that the said video had been uploaded on YouTube as early as 3 May 2015, Dr Fan conceded that the video must have been made “roughly” within the period April/May 2015.  He also stated that Anqi and Doreen were the persons who “would be able to answer questions about the video”.  However, the Plaintiff elected not to call Doreen as a witness, and when Anqi was asked about the video, she confirmed that it was produced in April 2015.

</div>  Clearly, therefore, the marketing video could not have been undertaken in reliance of any purported promise by the Defendants not to exercise the default call options.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As to the Plaintiff’s claim that the continued referral of patients to the 3rd Defendant demonstrated its “reliance” on the purported promise by the Defendants not to exercise default calls, I found this claim to be unsustainable on the evidence adduced.  In order to show “reliance”, the Plaintiff had to show that it had changed its position on the faith of the purported promise, by doing or omitting to do something which it would otherwise have not done or omitted to do as the case may be: see for example the Privy Council’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Emmanuel </span><span class="font-italic">Ayodeji Ajayi v RT Briscoe (Nigeria) Ltd</span> [1964] 1 WLR 1326 at pp 1330 to 1331.

</div>  Case law and academic commentary have suggested that this requirement may be met by evidence of detrimental reliance by the promisee, or evidence of dishonesty by the promisor in inducing the promisee to act on his promise, or improper behaviour on the promisor’s part (such as the exercise of undue pressure on a promisee whom the promisor knew to be financially vulnerable): see in this regard <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at paras 4.086 to 4.087.

For the reasons explained in [74] to [116], I found that the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ exercise of the default call options was valid, and that pursuant to cll 2 and 3(b) of the COAs, the Plaintiff was obliged to sell its shares back to them at the aggregate exercise price of $1.  The POAs were terminated upon the Defendants’ exercise of the default call options on 6 May 2016, and the Plaintiff’s purported exercise of put options on 25 August 2016 was thus invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Accordingly, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim for specific performance to compel the 1st and 2nd Defendants to comply with its put option notices and to purchase its shares for $1.2m.

Unfortunately, his testimony on this aspect of the case was vague and unsatisfactory.  At one point he claimed that the figure of $261,544 was “interim dividends based on management accounts”, and that at the time these management accounts were reviewed, there “were sufficient profits made for the dividends to be made up from”.

In other words, the Plaintiff’s own stated position, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the dividend payments were akin to an unauthorised return of capital, appeared to be at odds with its seeking an order that it be given a share of these “unauthorised” dividend payments.
