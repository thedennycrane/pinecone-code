It suffices to explain that the Suit is in relation to the beneficial interests of Evelyn in the shareholding of Supratechnic Pte Ltd (“Supratechnic”) against the Kasenda family, who comprise some of the defendants. In particular, the Suit concerns the claims of Evelyn’s Estate and the estate of Mr William Phoa (“William” and “William’s Estate”) (collectively, “the Estates”) to such interests. Supratechnic is in turn a private company incorporated in Singapore on 11 April 1968, with 300 shares originally subscribed to.

Thus, until and unless Eugene has done so, the defendants submitted that Eugene has no standing as the personal representative of the Estates to bring the Suit in either Evelyn’s Estate’s or William’s Estate’s name.

</div> The extraction remained pending because Singapore still imposed estate duty tax for deaths in 1981. Thus, as Eugene himself explains, in order to extract the “Singapore probate papers”, the Commissioner for Estate Duty (the “CED”) of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) must either provide a certification of payment or a certificate of postponement (the “Certificate of Postponement”) of the tax concerned.

</div> Since the Kasendas did not reply to that email, Eugene instructed his solicitors to resume communications with the CED from September 2011. The purpose of those communications was, as with before, to procure the CED to issue a Certificate of Postponement. According to Eugene, he received a last communication from the CED on 5 September 2012, where the CED provided an estimated amount of estate tax.

However, from Eugene’s perspective, there was “nothing required of the Phoas or [their solicitors] in order for [the CED] to make its decision” and that “they may have overlooked issuing a response entirely”.

On 15 August 2023, SILLC tendered another letter to court, in which it requested for an extension of time to file the reply submissions due to their lead counsel’s bereavement. By way of a letter to the parties dated 15 August 2023, I allowed the parties to file their reply submissions only on 21 August 2023.

This suggests that Eugene’s standing in his personal capacity applies to both Evelyn’s Estate and William’s Estate. However, because the parties disputed only on Eugene’s capacity to bring the Suit in respect of Evelyn’s Estate, I focus only on that part of the prayer. Indeed, this is also evident from the stated grounds for the Amendment Application, where Eugene explains (at para 3) that “he has always been additionally suing in his personal capacity as [a] one-fifth beneficiary of [Evelyn’s Estate]”, without stating the same with regard to William’s Estate.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 With this preliminary point in mind, it is helpful to first understand Eugene’s position in the present applications. As Eugene explains in his submissions, he has a four-tiered response to the defendants’ challenge on his standing to bring the Suit:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Eugene’s primary case is that he <span class="font-italic">already</span> has standing to bring the Suit in his capacity as a personal representative of Evelyn’s Estate. This is by virtue of the Canadian LA, which vested authority in him to act in such a capacity.

More specifically, this court should stay the proceedings pending the extraction of the grant of resealing in P 129.

</div> In my view, Eugene’s characterisation creates the wrong impression that the court should accept his evidence unquestionably as he is simply fulfilling his duty to the court. While I accept that litigants can have such a duty of disclosure, that scope of disclosure must be limited to the case that a party has run. Thus, a party cannot rely on this duty to introduce evidence about a case that the party had never previously run. There can be no duty of disclosure in relation to such evidence because the issue was never before the court. Otherwise, that party would be allowed the opportunity to salvage its case after having had the advantage of seeing the counterparty’s witnesses and submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I turn now to the applicable law to govern the admission of further evidence after trial. In the Malaysian Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Prince Court Medical Centre </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Germguard Technologies (M) Sdn Bhd </span>[2016] 4 MLJ 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Prince Court</span>”), one party sought to reopen its case to adduce further evidence after the trial had concluded and before judgment was pronounced. The court observed (at [9]) that “the discretion to reopen a trial before judgment is entered is an unfettered discretion but one that should be used sparingly … and has its purpose the correction of what would otherwise be a miscarriage of justice”. In <span class="font-italic">Prince Court</span>, the court dismissed the application to reopen the trial to admit further evidence. The court explained (at [10]) that, if the application were allowed, it would “allow the appellant to rectify, repair or cover up any loophole in their case after having the benefit of evaluating the evidence of the respondent’s witnesses and the respondent’s submissions”. This would “not be fair to the respondent and is not how litigation should be conducted in our adversarial system of justice” (at [10]). The court further held (at [11]–[12]) that the “discretion to allow a party to reopen its case is a discretion that should be exercised sparingly”, and the “policy consideration behind this is obvious, and that is to avoid opening the floodgates for similar applications in the future”. Instead, the court stressed (at [12]) that this discretion “should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances and to prevent a miscarriage of justice”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Accordingly, the test of “exceptional circumstances” governs whether to allow a party to reopen its case to adduce further evidence. While the court in <span class="font-italic">Prince Court </span>did not explain what constitutes “exceptional circumstances”, I agree with the defendants that guidance can be taken from the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>requirements.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this regard, the courts have consistently imposed the threefold requirements set out in the seminal English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>[1954] 1 WLR 1489 (“<span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>”) to govern the admission of further evidence on appeal (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Court of Appeal decisions of <span class="font-italic">Toh Eng Lan</span> <span class="font-italic">v </span><span class="font-italic">Foong Fook Yue and another appeal</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 833 at [34], <span class="font-italic">ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax and another and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 499 at [99], and <span class="font-italic">Anan Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v VTB</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank (Public Joint Stock Co)</span> [2019] 2 SLR 341 (“<span class="font-italic">Anan</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]). In this regard, the three requirements in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> are: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial or hearing; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>requirements do not apply with full force in all appeals. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anan Group </span>set out a two-step analysis that a court should adopt in dealing with an application to adduce fresh evidence on appeal. At the first stage, the court should consider the nature of the proceedings below and evaluate the extent to which it bore the characteristics of a full trial. At the second stage, the court should determine whether there are any other reasons for which the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>requirements ought to be relaxed in the interests of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Anan Group </span>at [37]–[55]). In any event, the court should conduct a balancing exercise between the interests of finality and the right of an applicant to put forth relevant and credible evidence, having regard to the considerations of proportionality and prejudice (see <span class="font-italic">Anan Group </span>at [59]). However, given that the present applications concern an attempt to adduce evidence <span class="font-italic">after </span>trial when there is nothing left except for the pronouncement of judgment, the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>requirements should apply very strictly. This is because if those requirements apply strictly when an attempt is made to adduce evidence on appeal against proceedings below that approach a full trial, then they must all the more apply even <span class="font-italic">more</span> strictly when a party is seeking to adduce evidence in respect of a trial that has already closed, and for which there is no pending appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In this regard, because the Further Evidence Application involves the admission of further evidence after trial, instead of the admission of further evidence on appeal, I do not think that the two-step analysis set out in <span class="font-italic">Anan Group </span>(see [25] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is applicable here. However, in my view, the three requirements in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>(see [24] above) are applicable in the present case as requirements to aid a court in deciding whether there existed “exceptional circumstances” to allow a party to reopen its case to adduce further evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The process for extracting a resealed grant of foreign letters of administration</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I have referred to the extraction of the resealed grant of letters of administration several times thus far. It is therefore apt for me to set out how this process operates. The process for the extraction of sealed grant of letters of administration has been helpfully summarised by the learned Assistant Registrar Wong Hee Jinn (“AR Wong”) in <span class="font-italic">Chye</span><span class="font-italic"> Hwa Luan and others v Do, Allyn T </span>[2023] SGHCR 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Chye</span><span class="font-italic"> Hwa Luan</span>”), as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To begin with, a person who dies with a valid will dies testate, while a person who dies without a valid will dies intestate. The term “personal representative” comprises both an executor (or executrix) – who executes the deceased’s will – and an administrator (or administratrix), who administers the deceased’s estate (see <span class="font-italic">Chye</span><span class="font-italic"> Hwa Luan </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the context of an intestate death, a grant of letters of administration must first be obtained. The procedural steps that must be taken can be located in the Probate and Administration Act 1934 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “PAA”), the Family Justice Rules 2014, and the Family Justice Court Practice Directions dated 1 January 2015. In particular, an application for a grant of letters of administration must be made by an originating summons filed without notice supported by an affidavit exhibiting a statement in Form 51. The applicant must, within 14 days of filing the application, file an affidavit verifying the information in the Statement, exhibiting the Statement, the Schedule of Assets and all other supporting papers as the Registrar may require. The grant of letters of administration, which bears the court’s seal, may be extracted after estate duty formalities have been completed (see <span class="font-italic">Chye</span><span class="font-italic"> Hwa Luan </span>at [34]–[35]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An administrator’s authority to act on behalf of the deceased’s estate is derived from the grant of letters of administration. Until the grant of the letters of administration, the deceased’s real and personal estate vests in the Public Trustee, pursuant to s 37 of the PAA. There is thus a distinction between: (i) the grant of the application for letters of administration; and (ii) the extraction of the sealed grant of the letters of administration. It is upon the former that the property of the intestate is vested in the administrator, but only upon the latter that authority is conferred upon the administrator to administer the deceased’s estate (see <span class="font-italic">Chye</span><span class="font-italic"> Hwa Luan </span>at [36]–[40], and the authorities cited therein, such as the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Gems Co v Personal representatives of the estate of </span><span class="font-italic">Akber Ali Mohamed Bukardeem, deceased </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 362, where Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) observed (at [19]) that “an administrator has not clothed himself with that status until he has <span class="font-italic">extracted</span> the grant” [emphasis added]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In contrast, the extraction of resealed grant of <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> letters of administration differs because of the foreign origin of such letters. As provided for in s 47 of the PAA, where letters of administration are granted and sealed by a foreign court, they may be subsequently sealed by the FJC in Singapore (see s 47(1)). This process gives the letters of administration force and effect as if granted by the General Division of the High Court in Singapore (see s 47(2)). The nomenclature of “reseal” is used because the foreign letters of administration would have been sealed once by the foreign court, before they are resealed by the Singapore court. Further, foreign letters of administration will not <span class="font-italic">automatically </span>be resealed by the Singapore court, as the court will have to determine whether the deceased person was, at the time of their death, domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court from which the grant was issued. If the deceased person was not, at the time of their death, domiciled as such, the seal shall not be affixed unless the grant is such as the General Division of the High Court would have made (see ss 47(3)–47(4)). It remains, however, that until the resealed grant of foreign letters of administration are extracted, the administrator has no authority to administer the deceased’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Therefore, in respect of all letters of administration, the process for an administrator to be clothed with authority to administer the deceased’s estate requires: (a) the court to grant and <span class="font-italic">seal</span> the letters of administration; and (b) the administrator to <span class="font-italic">extract</span> the sealed grant of letter of administration, or the resealed grant of foreign letters of administration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Eugene could have obtained the further evidence with reasonable diligence for use at the trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 With these principles in mind, I turn to the first <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>requirement about whether Eugene could have obtained the further evidence with reasonable diligence for use at the trial. It goes without saying that Eugene is seeking to adduce evidence that is of recent origin or has not even been produced (that is, documents to be issued up to when the order for resealing in P 129 is extracted). As such, Eugene may well argue that he could not have obtained the further evidence in time for the trial because they never existed until after trial. I reject this argument to the extent that Eugene made it before me. This is because I am concerned with whether Eugene <span class="font-italic">could have</span> obtained these documents by taking steps leading to their creation by the time of the trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Eugene knowingly commenced the Suit only in his capacity as the personal representative of Evelyn’s Estate</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my judgment, Eugene knowingly commenced the Suit only in his capacity as the personal representative of Evelyn’s Estate. As such, it is entirely his own doing that he failed to extract the resealed grant of the Canadian LA before commencing the Suit. First, Eugene has always been advised on this issue before the Suit. Indeed, he confirmed on the stand that he had been advised on this matter by his former Singapore solicitors:

I did not want to be caught in a situation whereby I decided to -- I decided for whatever reason to go ahead and I could not do so because we did not have letters of administration. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Now, this is -- this is contrary to the English position. The English position basically is that there is the doctrine of relation back, which allows you to commence action and then once you get letters of administration, the terms will be imposed I think with the assistance of the court in England to relate back to -- to the grant to the commencement of the action. But apparently that's not the position here. And the advice I received is that that Malaysian decision would be considered good law in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Thus, although Eugene knew before he commenced the Suit that he needed to extract the resealed grant of the Canadian LA, he did not do so. Nor has he provided any good reason why he commenced the Suit without having done so. Indeed, the evidence shows that Eugene could have procured the CED to issue the Certificate of Postponement. By his own admission in his AEIC, the CED’s letter of 5 September 2012 did not indicate that “nothing [was] required of the Phoas or [Eugene’s former Singapore solicitors] in order for [the CED] to make its decision” on whether to issue a Certificate of Postponement.

</div> To the contrary, while the letter states that Eugene’s request for a Certificate of Postponement was “being considered”, the CED did advise Eugene’s former Singapore solicitors “to make some payment to account of estate duty early to prevent interest from accumulating”.

</div> Therefore, it was certainly open to Eugene to pay the estate duty, resolve the matter with the CED, and extract the resealed grant of the Canadian LA before commencing the Suit. In this regard, it does not matter whether Eugene had the means to pay or not, but I do note that he had offered a banker’s guarantee as security to secure the payment.

</div> it is puzzling that Eugene did not even follow up with the CED prior to commencing the Suit in November 2020. It is not right, to the extent that he does, that Eugene now casts the blame on the CED for not responding to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Moreover, it is clear that Eugene did not disclose the post-2012 communications with the CED and the FJC in his AEIC even though these were plainly material to his standing to bring the Suit. In this regard, the documents show that on 15 June 2021, the CED wrote to SILLC to say that there is no need to request for the Certificate of Postponement.

</div> However, Eugene took about eight months after that to request the FJC to extract the Grant of Probate on 14 March 2022. After the FJC refused his request on 30 March 2022, Eugene took no action until 26 May 2023 to follow up with the CED to repeat his request for a Certificate of Postponement. It is inexplicable why Eugene would choose to do this, when he knew that he had to extract the resealed grant of the Canadian LA before commencing any legal action in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Accordingly, I find that it is entirely Eugene’s own doing that he failed to obtain the resealing before commencing the Suit.

This is because the provision does not indicate that the resealing has retrospective effect.

The executrix commenced proceedings in England and Wales as the personal representative of the deceased’s estate. The executrix only subsequently extracted the resealed grant of the Australian probate pursuant to s 2 of the CPA. It was against this background that the English Court of Appeal held that s 2 does not apply retrospectively, though the court found that the executrix did not have to first obtain a grant of probate in England and Wales before proving that she had title to the deceased’s estate, because she had been named as executrix in the deceased’s will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, s 47 of the PAA is substantially similar to s 2 of the CPA.

</div> However, it remains Eugene’s burden to establish that he has the standing to commence this Suit. Indeed, a claimant’s legal standing to commence an action is of paramount importance to the sustainability of the action and a failure to establish this can result in an action being struck out due to its disentitlement to the reliefs sought (see <span class="font-italic">Chye</span><span class="font-italic"> Hwa Luan</span> at [19]–[26]). In this regard, the learned<span class="font-italic"> </span>AR Wong had said as follows (at [26]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having surveyed the cases above, it is apparent that a plaintiff’s legal standing to commence an action is of paramount importance to the sustainability of its action and a failure to establish this can result in an action being struck out due to its disentitlement to the reliefs sought. The corollary, as a matter of legal principle, must equally be true. For a defendant that has does not possess the requisite standing, there would be simply no basis on which the court can grant the reliefs sought or make the orders sought against that defendant, nor does the defendant have the legal capacity to comply with any orders made against it. In my view, when determining whether a reasonable cause of action has been disclosed, the court can and should consider both the plaintiff’s as well as the defendant’s legal standing (or lack thereof) to prosecute and defend an action, respectively. In either case, where such legal standing has not been shown, the legal basis for the plaintiff’s claim is inherently flawed. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, as the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation) v Rajah</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal</span> [2022] 2 SLR 253 (at [15]), striking out is warranted when there is an absence of legal standing, such that proceedings ought not, and indeed could not validly, have been brought at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, Eugene cannot say that the defendants kept this point until the end of trial. The defendants are not mounting a fresh defence, for which they bear the burden of proving. Instead, Eugene knowingly commenced this Suit despite not extracting the resealed grant of the Canadian LA. Indeed, there seems to be evidence that he knew this could be an issue. Thus, it does not lie in his mouth to complain that the defendants did not bring this issue up early enough for him to respond. Indeed, a court can always bring up issues of standing on its own accord because the court has to be satisfied that the parties before it are competent to advance their claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any event, I do not think the defendants were, as Eugene puts it, “aware of the obstacle in extraction of the order for [resealing] the grant since September 2019”.

The Further Evidence Application is contrary to this arrangement. Also, if the further evidence is admitted, the defendants would be prejudiced because it is now not open to them to cross-examine various parties, including Eugene, on the issue of Eugene’s standing to bring the Suit. It may be relevant, for example, for the defendants to call the relevant IRAS officer to give evidence as to why the Certificate of Postponement was not granted. But more fundamentally, the defendants have now shown their hand in relation to the issue of Eugene’s standing. It would go against all sense of fair play if Eugene were now allowed to make up that point by adducing evidence after trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For all the reasons above, I dismiss the Further Evidence Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Appointment Application should be allowed</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I turn now to the Appointment Application, which Eugene argues should be allowed because the four requirements in O 15 r 15(1) of the ROC 2014 are satisfied.

In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, the plaintiff claimed to have married the deceased in accordance with Chinese customary rites in 1952, while the defendant married the deceased at the Registry of Marriages in 1964. When the deceased passed away intestate in 1995, the plaintiff was granted letters of administration to the deceased’s estate, but they were not extracted. The plaintiff claimed this was because she was unable to file an estate duty affidavit as she could not specify the properties belonging to the estate that were held by the defendant. The plaintiff commenced an action as administratrix of the deceased’s estate. The defendant applied to dismiss the writ of summons, which the High Court granted. This was for the primary reasons that: (a) the plaintiff failed to extract the grant of letters of administration, and therefore did not have authority to deal with the property of the deceased; and (b) the requirements in O 15 r 15(1) were not satisfied because the plaintiff had sued in her purported capacity as administratrix of the deceased’s estate, but O 15 r 15(1) was meant to apply to a person who was a party to existing proceedings in a separate capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiff appealed the decision in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the primary issue was whether the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">qua </span>a beneficiary of the deceased’s estate was entitled to institute an action against the defendant to protect the assets of the deceased’s estate. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal because it disagreed with the High Court’s finding that there was no evidence of the plaintiff having asked the defendant to furnish details of the deceased’s assets. Instead, the Court of Appeal found that because of the acrimony between the parties, it is unlikely that the defendant would have been forthcoming with any disclosure, and indeed there was no such disclosure until the defendant was ordered to file an affidavit disclosing her assets to the court. The Court of Appeal therefore held that the plaintiff’s inability to extract the grant of letters of administration was not of her own doing. These were special circumstances that enabled her to bring the action <span class="font-italic">qua </span>a beneficiary and on behalf of her children as beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>provide the relevant background to understand the applicable principles. To begin with, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>observed the purpose behind O 15 r 15(1) to be as follows (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It appeared to me that <span class="font-italic">O15 r</span><span class="font-italic"> 15(1) is directed at the situation where after an action had been started and both plaintiff and defendant were litigating it, it became apparent that a deceased person who was neither the plaintiff nor the defendant and thus not a party to the litigation had an interest in the subject matter of the litigation and therefore his estate should be represented in the action. This was not the case here because when the suit had started, the plaintiff had sued in her purported capacity as administratrix of the deceased’s estate</span>. She had brought an action on behalf of the deceased and not an action on her own behalf. There was no pending proceeding between third parties in which the deceased had an interest because the plaintiff was in fact the deceased in other clothing. The plaintiff could not, therefore satisfy this requirement of the rule.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From this, it is clear that a party who wishes to rely on O 15 r 15(1) must have originally been a party to the proceedings in their personal capacity. This is since the very purpose of O 15 r 15(1) is to provide a remedy when it later becomes clear that a deceased person had an interest in the subject matter of the litigation and therefore his estate should be represented in the action. If a party is part of the proceedings in their representative capacity, then O 15 r 15(1) is nugatory, since that party was part of the proceedings as “the deceased in other clothing”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, as discussed in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>there is an exception to the four requirements in O 15 r 15(1), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that if there are special circumstances justifying the delay or failure to extract the grant of letters of administration. The court must then consider all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the assets, the position of the personal representative, and the reason for the default of the personal representative, to see whether the circumstances made it “impossible, or at least seriously inconvenient for the representatives to take proceedings” (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [28]). In this regard, special circumstances are not confined solely to cases where the personal representative had defaulted in acting to recover the property, because such a rule would be too inflexible and may lead to injustice (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy (CA)</span> at [24]). One example is where “the executor’s position has been compromised in some way”, such as where there is “a failure, excusable or inexcusable, by the [executors] in the performance of the duty [owed] … to protect the … estate or to protect the interests of the beneficiary” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Kao Chai-Chau Linda and others </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1018 at [8], citing the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Joseph </span><span class="font-italic">Hayim Hayim v Citibank NA </span>[1987] AC 730 at 748F).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Eugene has commenced this Suit as a personal representative of Evelyn’s Estate and not in his personal capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 With the above principles in mind, Eugene’s reliance on O 15 r 15(1), and correspondingly, the Appointment Application, fails for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 First, it is clear that Eugene has commenced this Suit as a personal representative of Evelyn’s Estate and not in his personal capacity. This is fatal to Eugene’s reliance on O 15 r 15(1) because to rely on that provision, he needs to have <span class="font-italic">originally</span> been a party to the proceedings in his personal capacity (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [20]–[24]). Indeed, when filing the present action, Eugene indicated his representative capacities in the title-in-action:

This is because Eugene had not asked for an apportionment of any damages or disgorgement sought. If Eugene was suing in his personal capacity, it would have made sense for him to seek his apportioned share of these awards (if so granted). However, because he has not asked for such apportionment, he must be suing in his capacity as the personal representative of Evelyn’s Estate. Indeed, this would explain why he is seeking 100% of any damages or disgorgements awarded. Also, Eugene would not have a right to William’s Estate as he is not a named beneficiary for that Estate. Yet, Eugene has not maintained any distinction in his claims as such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Above all, Eugene, who is a lawyer with the distinction of being appointed a King’s Counsel, confirmed on the stand that he was not suing in his personal capacity.

</div></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Q: You have brought this action in two capacities: as the personal representative of your mother’s estate and of William Phoa’s estate. You will see that in the title in action.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">A: Yes.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Q: You are not bringing this action in your personal capacity; correct?</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">A: No -- well, yes and no. I'm also one of the heirs of my mother’s estate.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Q: But that’s not the capacity you have named; correct? As a plaintiff?</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">A: I -- I don’t know what -- yes, you are right. It doesn't actually say “in his personal capacity and as personal representative”. You are right. Technically speaking, you are right. But you are asking the question, but you are not bringing this in my personal capacity. To some extent I am because I’m an heir of my mother’s estate as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 While Eugene qualified his answer by saying that he is bringing this Suit in his personal capacity “[t]o some extent”, I do not regard that as decisive. Rather, it is clear that Eugene admitted that “technically”, which I take it to mean “legally”, he is bringing this Suit in his capacity as the personal representative of the Estates. As a highly experienced lawyer, Eugene must have understood the implications of his answer when he said that “technically” he was suing only as Evelyn’s personal representative and not in his personal capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Second, Eugene’s reliance on O 15 r 15(1) also fails because he lacks standing to bring the Suit due to his failure to extract the resealed grant at the time of the filing of the Suit. Therefore, Eugene has no standing at all in the Suit. In this regard, the court in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>had said (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… according to r 15(1), the application had to be made by a person who was already a party to the existing proceedings. The applicant here was Madam Wong Moy, the plaintiff. Technically, however, as I had found her action to be a nullity she was no longer a party to any existing proceedings. Further she was not the independent third party whose participation in the proceedings would constitute them pre-existing proceedings for the purpose of the rule. She thus did not have the status to make such application. In any event, what she wanted was to substitute her status as representative of the deceased’s estate for her status as administratrix and thus she would be effecting a change of plaintiff, which is not something contemplated by this rule. The purpose of the rule is to allow an additional party who may be affected thereby to have a say in the litigation and not to replace one party to the litigation by another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Applying this reasoning, since the Suit is a nullity owing to Eugene’s failure to extract the resealed grant at the filing of the Suit, it follows that he is not a party to these proceedings. He is therefore not able to satisfy the requirement under O 15 r 15(1) of being a party to the existing proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There are no special circumstances for Eugene to rely on the exception in </span>Wong Moy (CA)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For completeness, Eugene would also not be able to rely on the special circumstances exception laid down in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the present case, for the reasons that I have already explained earlier, there was nothing to prevent Eugene from procuring the Certificate of Postponement and the resealing to clothe him with the powers to sue in his representative capacity. There are thus no special circumstances for this court to permit Eugene to bring an action as a beneficiary on behalf of the Estates. In any event, I mention the exception for completeness only because Eugene has confirmed in his 16th Affidavit filed on 28 September 2023 that he does not rely on this exception in relation to the Appointment Application.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  16th Affidavit of Eugene Phua filed on 28 September 2023 at para 60.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For all these reasons, I dismiss the Appointment Application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Amendment Application should be allowed</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I turn finally to the Amendment Application. Eugene seeks to amend the title-in-action to clarify that he is suing in his personal capacity. The defendants object to this for a number of reasons which are related to the reasons they have advanced in respect of the Further Evidence Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision: the Amendment Application is dismissed</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I begin with the applicable principles. In <span class="font-italic">Wang Piao v Lee Wee Ching </span>[2023] SGHC 216 (“<span class="font-italic">Wang Piao</span>”), the High Court set out the following analytical framework with respect to applications for an amendment of pleadings (at [40]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should determine the stage of proceedings at which the amendments are sought. This would affect how the general principles apply. More broadly, the later an application is made, the stronger would be the grounds required to justify it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should consider whether the amendments sought would enable the real question or issue in controversy between the parties to be determined. It is relevant to consider whether the application is made in good faith, and whether the proposed amendments are material.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court should consider whether it is just to allow the amendments, by assessing, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the amendments would cause any prejudice to the other party which cannot be compensated in costs, and whether the applying party is effectively asking for a second bite of the cherry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 While these principles were laid down in relation to the amendment of pleadings, they can be sensibly applied to the Amendment Application, which concerns the amendment of a title-in-action. When these principles are applied to the Amendment Application, I conclude that it should be dismissed for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">By Eugene’s own case, the amendments are not necessary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 First, if necessity is the bedrock behind a court allowing a party to amend, then Eugene’s own case shows that the amendments are not necessary. This is because Eugene has always maintained that he is suing in his personal capacity regardless of what the title-in-action says. Thus, it is for the court to interpret the documents to ascertain if Eugene is indeed suing in his personal capacity. Since it is for the court to ascertain this by an objective interpretation of the documents, it follows that the amendments are not necessary to allow the real question in controversy between the parties to be determined. By Eugene’s own case, I find that the proposed amendments are not necessary and hence dismiss the Amendment Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The amendments have come too late with no good reason</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Second, the amendments have come too late with no good reason for the lateness. I have already explained why Eugene provided no good reason and will not repeat myself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 This also means that, on balance, the defendants will be prejudiced by any amendments, if they would effect a substantive change in the Suit. In this regard, the amendments will allow Eugene to repair his lack of standing after evaluating the defendants’ case. This cannot be the reason on which to allow the amendments nor, to be fair to Eugene’s counsel, Mr Raeza Ibrahim (“Mr Raeza”), constituted what was argued before me. Moreover, if the amendments are needed, the defendants would fairly be given the chance to amend their pleadings and take consequential actions. This will delay the resolution of the Suit even further, which is a consequential fact given that many of the defendants are old and in poor health.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For all these reasons, I dismiss the Amendment Application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For all these reasons, I dismiss all three applications before me. The parties are to submit on the costs of these applications when dealing with costs of the entire action in the round.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 During the hearing of these applications, Mr Raeza suggested that if I should reserve my decision in relation to these applications and decide them together with judgment in the Suit. I have, instead, dealt with the applications separately in this judgment because they raise some issues that are discrete from those raised in the Suit. It is therefore neater, to my mind, to deal with these applications here. This also means that I will issue my judgment in relation to the Suit shortly after this judgment.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Raeza Khaled Salem Ibrahim, Hoon Wei Yang Benedict and Kimberly Ng Qi Yuet (Salem Ibrahim LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Sien Liang Joseph, Chan Junhao Justin, Ow Jiang Meng Benjamin, Yong Walter, Ling Ying Hong Samuel and Dyason Isabel Mary (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the first to fifth defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The sixth to eight defendants absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
