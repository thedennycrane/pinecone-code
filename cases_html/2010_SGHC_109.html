<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    Assistant Registrar dated 18 February 2010 in Summons No 6033 of 2009
                    filed in Suit No 167 of 2009 ordering that:</p>

                            Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed);

                            forthwith by the plaintiff to the defendants.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The only issue before me was that of <em>forum non conveniens, viz</em>, whether the Singapore court
                    should adjudicate this dispute or decline to exercise jurisdiction in favour of
                    another more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff was a company incorporated in
                    India, with expertise in mining and marketing of iron ore. The first defendant
                    was a company incorporated in United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) with a
                    representation office in Jakarta, Indonesia. The second defendant was an
                    Indonesian citizen and a director and shareholder of the first defendant. The
                    third defendant was an Indian national who had been residing in Indonesia since
                    1995. Both the second and the third defendants were representatives of the first
                    defendant, and hence were included in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The factual matrix</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The second defendant was the President and
                    Director of an Indonesian incorporated company, PT JIO Energi Resources
                    (“PT JIO Indonesia”), which held Indonesian iron ore concessions.
                    It was apparent in this appeal that the second defendant, was the common
                    directing mind behind each of the Indonesian, Singapore and UAE JIO companies.
                    His purpose in establishing the offshore companies in Singapore and then UAE,
                    was to procure offshore mining and marketing expertise, as well as funding, for
                    PT JIO Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The joint venture agreement of 7 April 2006 between the
                plaintiff and JIO Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 7 April 2006, the plaintiff entered into
                    a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) with a Singapore incorporated
                    company, JIO Corporation Pte Ltd (“JIO Singapore”), to assist PT
                    JIO Indonesia in mining its Indonesian iron ore concessions. At all material
                    times, the second defendant was a director and controlling shareholder of JIO
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under the JVA the plaintiff was to provide the
                    equipment and other technical support for mining, whilst JIO Singapore was to
                    procure an exclusive agreement for the marketing of such iron ore to be
                    purchased from its Indonesian counterparty, PT JIO Indonesia, for sale in
                    international markets for the benefit of the joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Paras (D) and (E) of the preamble to the JVA
                    state that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(D)    The parties are desirous of entering into a joint
                            venture to jointly assist PT JIO [Indonesia] in mining iron ore in the
                            locations licensed to PT JIO [Indonesia] and subsequently to purchase
                            the said iron ore at a price to be determined with PT JIO [Indonesia]
                            and to market the iron ore for sale in international markets for the
                            benefit of the joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(E)    The parties propose to incorporate a joint venture
                            company in the Republic of Singapore as their joint venture vehicle for
                            the abovementioned purposes. The joint venture company shall be named
                            MEL-JIO PTE LTD (the “Company”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The principal terms of the JVA required the
                    plaintiff to pay US$300,000 to JIO Singapore and to deposit an escrow sum of
                    US$1.7m in a bank in Singapore to be paid to JIO Singapore on or before
                    “completion”, which was defined in the JVA as the completion of
                    the establishment of the joint venture company named MEL-JIO Pte Ltd (the
                    “JVA Company”). One of the conditions to completion was for JIO
                    Singapore to procure the marketing rights over at least 1 million tonnes of
                    iron ore from Indonesia for the JVA Company and for the plaintiff’s
                    verification of such deposit with the JVA Company. On completion the plaintiff
                    and JIO Singapore would each subscribe for 50% of the shares in the JVA
                    Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Article 9 of the JVA provided that JIO
                    Singapore’s obligation was to ensure that all necessary permits, licences
                    and regulatory approvals for the exploitation and mining of iron ore by the JVA
                    Company at any mining area within Indonesia were obtained and to ensure that JIO
                    Singapore granted the right to market iron ore mined in Indonesia to the JVA
                    Company. The plaintiff’s obligation was to provide technical know-how,
                    equipment and expertise to the JVA Company and PT JIO Indonesia in relation to
                    the mining and marketing of minerals and metals, to ensure full assistance was
                    rendered to the JVA Company for the sale of the iron ore at the best prevailing
                    market price for the JVA Company, and to bear all costs associated with the
                    operation of the JVA Company until such time when the JVA Company was able to
                    bear such operation costs with its internal or external financing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Article 24 of the JVA provided for
                    dispute settlement under the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration
                    Centre and Art 25 of the JVA provided for Singapore law to be governing
                    law. Curiously, Art 25 also provided that each of the parties to the JVA
                    irrevocably submitted any legal actions or proceedings to enforce the JVA or
                    arising out of or in connection with the JVA to the jurisdiction of the
                    Singapore courts and waived any objection to the proceedings in the Singapore
                    courts on the grounds of venue or on the grounds that the proceedings had been
                    brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The JVA was amended on 9 May 2006 to
                    provide that the plaintiff would pay JIO Singapore US$300,000 in Singapore and
                    pay US$1.7m into an escrow account in a bank in Singapore under the name of JIO
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Subsequently, the plaintiff and the second
                    defendant appeared not to have proceeded further with the JVA and the
                    incorporation of the JVA Company. Instead, for reasons of procurement and other
                    efficiencies as described in the letter of offer in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> below, the first defendant was formed in the
                UAE.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">UAE Exclusive Irrevocable Exploration, Exploitation, Mining and
                Marketing Agreement of 7 August 2006 between first defendant and PT JIO
                Indonesia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 7 August 2006, the first defendant and
                    PT JIO Indonesia entered into an Exclusive Irrevocable Exploration,
                    Exploitation, Mining and Marketing Agreement (“Exclusive Mining
                    Agreement”). Under this Exclusive Mining Agreement, PT JIO Indonesia
                    appointed the first defendant as the sole agent with exclusive and irrevocable
                    rights of exploration, exploitation, mining and marketing of iron ore concession
                    in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Pursuant to Art 3.1, the sole agency

                    tonnes of “+65 Fe” iron ore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Article 13 of the Exclusive Mining

                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The final document which was the subject
                    matter of this legal action was a letter of offer (“Letter of
                    Offer”) dated 12 September 2006 between the plaintiff and the first
                    defendant. This Letter of Offer by the first defendant was signed by the second
                    defendant as “President Director” of the first
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Letter of Offer stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have formed a Company based in AJMAN – FZ (Dubai) which will
                        basically source raw material for steel globally particularly from Latin
                        America, Australia, and Eastern Europe, to supplement our production in
                        Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We chose Dubai for this activity is [sic] because of its strategic
                        location to various destinations. Our business model is initially exporting
                        the mined material from Indonesia to China directly. However, the equipment
                        and machinery required for mining will be purchased / invested by the
                        proposed FZCO in Ajman. All billing, banking and other administrative
                        activities will be from the FZCO.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PT. JIO [Indonesia] through its “Exclusive Marketing Rights to JIO
                        Minerals FZC established in Dubai-Ajman” - Offers a Joint Venture

                        Enterprises Limited, for a 50% direct equity participation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While we have the Mines and other resources, we need your technical
                        expertise and market reach for creating a proper mine plan and carry out
                        activities in a professional manner in which your esteem [<em>sic</em>] company has been doing for many years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this backdrop with our collaboration and strategic alliance we can
                        achieve a cutting edge quality and price advantage in the International
                        Market as well as become a major player in the Iron Ore industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We therefore offer 50% shareholding of our company JIO Minerals FZC

                    US$0.5 million”. The Letter of Offer contained no clause providing a
                    choice of law or a choice of forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The offer was accepted and implemented by the
                    transfer of 50 shares in the first defendant (20 shares from the third
                    defendant and 30 shares from the second defendant) to the plaintiff for a
                    total consideration of US$1,725,695 as confirmed by a certified true copy of the
                    general meeting of the first defendant of 25 September 2006. The
                    consideration was remitted to the second and third defendants’ bank
                    accounts in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Letter of Offer and acceptance constitute
                    the foundation of the plaintiff’s action in Singapore against the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Subsequently, a dispute arose between the
                    plaintiff and the defendants. The plaintiff claims to have found scant deposits
                    of iron ore in the mining sites, not the amount which was represented to it. The
                    plaintiff demanded the return of its investment amount of US$1,725,695, of which
                    in March 2007, the defendants returned to the plaintiff the sum of
                    US$697,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff sought a declaration that it had
                    validly rescinded the agreement, the return of the balance of their investment
                    amount and damages to be assessed. In the alternative, the plaintiff claimed

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendants applied for a stay of this
                    action on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>,

                    action. The Assistant Registrar granted the stay and the plaintiff appealed
                    against that decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Law of forum non conveniens</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The law of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> has been extensively expounded in several Singapore
                    Court of Appeal and High Court decisions. It is founded on seven propositions
                    set out in the English case of <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation
                        v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] 1 AC 460 (“<em>The Spiliada</em>”). The propositions are set out in
                        <em>Dicey, Morris and Collin on the Conflict of
                        Laws</em> vol 1 (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    14th Ed, 2006), which states at pp 475 – 477:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The following propositions may be derived from the speech of Lord Goff of
                        Chieveley, which has been applied in many subsequent cases. <b>First</b>, in general the legal burden of proof rests on
                        the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a
                        stay, although the evidential burden will rest on a party who seeks to
                        establish the existence of matters which will assist him in persuading the
                        court to exercise its discretion in his favour. <b>Secondly</b>, if the court is satisfied by the defendant that
                        there is another available forum which is clearly a more appropriate forum
                        for the trial of the action, the burden will shift to the claimant to show
                        that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires
                        that the trial should nevertheless take place in England. <b>Thirdly</b>, the burden on the defendant is not just to show
                        that England is not the natural or appropriate forum, but to establish that
                        there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than
                        the English forum; accordingly, where (as in some commercial disputes) there
                        is no particular forum which can be described as the natural forum, there
                        will be no reason to grant a stay. <b>Fourthly</b>,
                        the court will look to see what factors there are which point in the
                        direction of another forum as being the “natural forum”,
                            <em>ie</em>, that with which the action has the
                        most real and substantial connection. These will include factors affecting
                        convenience or expense (such as availability of witnesses) and such other
                        factors as the law governing the transaction and the places where the
                        parties reside or carry on business, and also whether the claim is part of a
                        larger overall dispute which would be damaged by being fragmented. <b>Fifthly</b>, if the court concludes at that stage that
                        there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the
                        trial of the action, the court will ordinarily refuse a stay. <b>Sixthly</b>, if, however, the court concludes that there
                        is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate,
                        it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of
                        which justice requires that a stay should not be granted. In that enquiry,
                        the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including
                        circumstances which go beyond those taken into account when considering
                        connecting factors with other jurisdictions. <b>Seventhly</b>, a stay will not be refused simply because the
                        claimant will thereby be deprived of “a legitimate personal or
                        juridical advantage”, provided that the court is satisfied that
                        substantial justice will be done in the available appropriate forum.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In Singapore, the <em>Spiliada</em> propositions have been succinctly distilled in
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>
                    vol 6(2) (LexisNexis Singapore, 2009) at paras 75.083 and 75.084:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The basic principle in <em>The Spiliada</em> is to
                        identify the court which should adjudicate the dispute most suitably for the
                        interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Because it is applying
                        its own domestic law, the court can only decide whether it wants to hear the
                        dispute; it cannot decide whether another court should or should not hear
                        the case. Thus, the issue is posed as whether the Singapore court will
                        adjudicate a dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nevertheless, the practical approach is to consider the question of
                        appropriateness in the two distinct stages described under the previous
                        heading. In Stage One, the court is concerned principally with identifying
                        the forum with the most real and substantial connection with the dispute,
                        where the trial could be held at least inconvenience and expense. In Stage
                        Two, all circumstances will be taken into consideration, including factors
                        that go beyond those considered in Stage One. The principal concern at Stage
                        Two is whether the plaintiff will be deprived of substantial justice if the
                        trial were conducted abroad.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal has also observed that the test for the identification
                        of the forum where the case ought to be tried for the interests of the
                        parties and the ends of justice is not mechanical, but ‘really a
                        simple and commonsensical’ one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The crux of the matter has been crystallised
                    by Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu
                        Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 104 at [17] in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ultimate question remains the same: where should the case be suitably
                        tried having regard to the interest of the parties and the ends of
                        justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The nature of the analysis has been well
                    stated by V K Rajah J in <em>Peters Roger May v
                        Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 381 at [20] and
                    [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court has to take into account an entire multitude of factors in
                        balancing the competing interests. The weightage accorded to a particular
                        factor varies in different cases and the ultimate appraisal ought to reflect
                        the exigencies dictated by the factual matrix. Copious citations of
                        precedents and <em>dicta</em> are usually of little
                        assistance and may in reality serve to cloud rather than elucidate the
                        applicable principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In granting a stay application the court must be persuaded
                        that compelling reasons have been advanced precipitating the conclusion that
                        the interests of the parties seeking justice can be more appropriately
                        secured in some other jurisdiction. As Lord Sumner aptly put it in <em>Société du Gaz de Paris v Société Anonyme de Navigation
                            “Les Armateurs Français”</em> 1926 SLT 33
                        at 37:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The object under the words “<em>forum non
                                conveniens</em>” is to find that <em>forum</em> which is the more suitable for the ends of
                            justice, and is preferable, because pursuit of the litigation in that
                                <em>forum</em> is more likely to secure those
                            ends.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Finally, the law accords the plaintiff the
                    freedom of choice of the forum where its choice is challenged by <em>forum non conveniens</em>, subject only to the following
                    considerations, as stated by Judith Prakash J in <em>Focus Energy
                        Ltd v Aye Aye Soe</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1086 at [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where more than one forum is appropriate, the plaintiff does not have to
                        affirmatively choose the forum that might be marginally more appropriate
                        than the other(s) to bring its claim. The plaintiff has the right to elect
                        to bring its claim in a forum where the court has jurisdiction, provided
                        only that there be no other forum that is <em>clearly or
                            distinctly</em> more appropriate. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With these principles in mind, I considered
                    the defendants’ and plaintiff’s arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendants’ submission that there was another more
                appropriate forum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The issue before me in this appeal was whether
                    the defendants were able to establish that there was another forum which was
                    more appropriate for this action to be suitably tried, having regard to the
                    interest of the parties and the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendants submitted that Indonesia was
                    the more appropriate forum, for the reasons which will be set out hereafter.
                    Interestingly, they did not submit that the law of UAE would be the more
                    appropriate forum in light of the fact that the Letter of Offer was an offer to
                    acquire a 50% shareholding in an UAE company which in turn had an exclusive
                    agency agreement with PT JIO Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It was common ground that the burden of proof
                    was on the defendants to establish that Indonesia was the more appropriate forum
                    for this action. It was again common ground that the court would only consider
                    connecting factors material and relevant to the claim and the issues in dispute.
                    I noted and adopted the observations of Belinda Ang Saw Ean JC in <em>Yeoh Poh San and another v Won Siok Wan</em>
                    [2002] SGHC 196 (“<em>Yeoh Poh
                    San</em>”) at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It must be remembered that the court is required to consider what forum
                        the issues have the closest connection with and will not simply weigh
                        factors without reference to the likely issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Similarly I noted and adopted the observations
                    of Andrew Phang JC in <em>Q &amp; M Enterprises
                        Sdn Bhd v Poh Kiat</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 494
                        (“<em>Q &amp; M Enterprises Sdn
                    Bhd</em>”) at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to note that it is not the mere literal or factual
                        geographical connections that are important (which the plaintiff raised in
                        the context of Singapore). There must be legal significance, so that the
                        mere number of geographical connections <em>per se</em>
                        is not conclusive by any means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Having noted the above, I then proceeded to
                    consider the defendants’ arguments that by reason of the factors they had
                    raised, there was a more appropriate forum for this action to be suitably tried,
                    in the interests of the parties and the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Connecting factors to another more appropriate forum</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Geographical factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The defendants first argued that Indonesia was
                    the more appropriate forum because the dispute had its closest connection with
                    Indonesia. The dispute involved concessions located in Kalimantan, Indonesia,
                    and the parties engaged in visits and discussions in Indonesia. They pointed to
                    these further connecting factors: (i) that the second and third defendants were
                    residents in Indonesia, (ii) the alleged false representations were made there,
                    (iii) the first defendant, whilst a UAE company, had a representation office in
                    Indonesia and (iv) its extraordinary general meeting resolutions recording the
                    transfer of 50% shares to the plaintiffs were passed in Indonesia. As per Andrew
                    Phang JC in <em>Q &amp; M Enterprises Sdn
                        Bhd</em> at [21], it was not simply literal or factual connections
                    that were important but there had to be legal significance. Of all the factors
                    lined up by the defendants, I found the legally significant factors to be the
                    location of the concession in Indonesia and the Indonesian residency of the
                    second defendant who was the directing mind behind the corporate structures and
                    documentation. The weight I attached to these factors and the reasons for so
                    doing are set out later in [40].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Imputed choice of law of Letter of Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In a stay application, it is appropriate, at
                    this interlocutory stage before all the evidence has been heard, for the court
                    to form a <em>prima facie</em> view of the governing law
                    (see <em>Banco Atlantico SA v British Bank of the Middle
                        East</em> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 504, per

                    Indonesia was the more appropriate forum based on their argument that the
                    imputed choice of law of the Letter of Offer ought to be Indonesian law,
                        <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Choice of law issues are relevant even to a question of jurisdiction. The

                        governed by a foreign <em>lex causae</em>, the forum
                        would be less adept in applying this law than the courts of the jurisdiction

                    governing law of the Letter of Offer, the court would have to consider to which
                    system of law the transaction had its closest and most real connection, taking
                    into consideration the place of contracting, the place of performance, the

                            that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There are three stages in determining the governing law of a contract.
                            The first stage is to examine the contract itself to determine whether
                            it states expressly what the governing law should be. In the absence of
                            an express provision one moves to the second stage which is to see
                            whether the intention of the parties as to the governing law can be
                            inferred from the circumstances. If this cannot be done, the third stage
                            is to determine with which system of law the contract has its most close
                            and real connection. That system would be taken, objectively, as the
                            governing or proper law of the contract. …</p>

                            ascribed the proper weightage to the relevant factors, the next step
                            would be that enunciated in <em>Las Vegas
                                Hilton</em> at [40] (namely, the third stage). In that case,
                            Chao J went on to cite (at [42]) the following passage from
                                <em>The Assunzione</em> [1954] P 150 at 179 by
                            Singleton LJ:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[O]ne must look at all the circumstances and seek to find what just
                            and reasonable persons ought to have intended if they had thought about
                            the matter at the time when they made the contract. If they had thought
                            that they were likely to have a dispute, I hope it may be said that just
                            and reasonable persons would like the dispute determined in the most
                            convenient way and in accordance with business efficacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We agreed with Chao J's observation in <em>Las Vegas
                            Hilton</em> at [44] that the "closest and most real connection"
                        test (<em>id</em> at [40]) was the same as the
                        objective test of the reasonable man adopted in <em>The
                            Assunzione</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In my view, the defendants in lining up the
                    Indonesian connecting factors (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above) appeared to have ignored a
                    significant counter connecting factor to the UAE insofar as the substance of the
                    Letter of Offer was an offer to acquire shares in a UAE company. The
                    determination of what reasonable persons ought, in the context of this Letter of
                    Offer, to have intended if they had thought about which law would govern the
                    Letter of Offer, at the time the agreement was made, was not to be conducted
                        <em>in vacuo</em> but in light of the business
                    objectives of the parties as expressed in the Letter of Offer. The Letter of
                    Offer expressly stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have formed a Company based in AJMAN – FZ (Dubai) which will
                        basically source raw material for steel globally particularly from Latin
                        America, Australia, and Eastern Europe, to supplement our production in
                        Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We chose Dubai for this activity is [<em>sic</em>]
                        because of its strategic location to various destinations …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the location of the concession was in Indonesia and the second
                    defendant was resident in Indonesia, it was open to the second defendant, who
                    was the directing mind behind both PT JIO Indonesia and first defendant, to have
                    made this offer to the plaintiff, to invest onshore in any suitable Indonesian
                    incorporated company, whether a newly incorporated company or PT JIO Indonesia.
                    Nevertheless he structured this Letter of Offer for the investment to be made in
                    a UAE company. It was also significant that previous to this the second
                    defendant had utilised and later abandoned a Singapore company for the same
                    objective. The second defendant appeared to have planned at least two offshore
                    vehicles and arrangements first in Singapore and then in the UAE, through which
                    to source the offshore expertise and financing to produce and market PT JIO
                    Indonesia’s iron ore concession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the light of these actions and decisions
                    which revealed a business objective to establish an offshore vehicle for
                    financing and marketing of the iron ore hoped to be mined from the PT JIO
                    Indonesia concession, it was not a compelling conclusion that the governing law
                    to be imputed to the Letter of Offer was Indonesian law. The facts that UAE law
                    was expressly chosen to govern the Exclusive Mining Agreement between the first
                    defendant and the plaintiff and that Singapore law was to govern the JVA between
                    the plaintiff and JIO Singapore indicated that the reasonable persons in their
                    shoes would not have, in order to give business efficacy to their arrangements,
                    concluded that Indonesian law was to govern this Letter of Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Governing law of alternative claim for misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendants next submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s alternative claim, <em>viz</em>, the tort
                    of fraudulent misrepresentation, was governed by Indonesian law by reason that
                    the representations were made in Indonesia. The defendants submitted that the
                    place where a tort occurred was <em>prima facie</em> the
                    natural forum for determining the claim and that the tort occurred in Indonesia
                    (see <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd</em>, at [37] –
                    [40]). He additionally cited <em>Wing Hak Man and another v
                        Bio-Treat Technology Ltd and others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 446
                    at [26] for the proposition that in order to determine where the alleged tort
                    has been committed, the court should “look back over the series of
                    events” constituting the elements of the tort and ask where in substance
                    the cause of action arose. The defendants submitted that “looking back
                    over the series of events”, the representations were made in Indonesia
                    and hence Indonesia law would apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     They further submitted that for the matter to
                    be heard in Singapore, the double actionability rule must apply<em>, ie</em>, for the Singapore court to find liability, the
                    tort would have to be actionable in both jurisdictions. These did not, in my
                    view, present insurmountable obstacles. Double actionability would first need to
                    be raised at trial. Second, the court would need to find that the
                    representations were in fact made in Indonesia. Third, expert evidence of
                    Indonesian law would need to be adduced. The first two would present no
                    difficulty for the trial court. As for Indonesian law the trial court would
                    determine this either by expert evidence adduced or in the absence of its proof,
                    the law of the forum would apply by default (see <em>Rickshaw
                        Investments Ltd</em>, at [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Location of witnesses and documents necessary for trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendants next raised questions of
                    witnesses and documents which they submitted pointed towards another more
                    appropriate forum. He cited <em>Rickshaw Investments
                        Ltd</em>, at [19] in support:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, the importance of the location and the compellability of the
                        witnesses depends on whether the main disputes revolve around questions of
                        fact. If they do and, for example, the judge's assessment of a witness's
                        credibility is crucial, then the location of the witnesses takes on greater
                        significance because there would be savings of time and resources if the
                        trial is held in the forum in which the witnesses reside and where they are
                            <em>clearly</em> compellable to testify. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The defendants then submitted that the
                    witnesses who would be able to give evidence relating to the extent of drilling
                    carried out by the plaintiff’s drilling team included two Indonesian
                    nationals and residents. They submitted also that many of the relevant documents
                    were likely to be in Bahasa Indonesia which would need to be translated, and
                    that was a factor in favour of the stay application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The plaintiff submitted in response, citing
                        <em>Yeoh Poh San</em> at [18] that this court was
                    required to consider which forum the issues of the action had the closest
                    connection with, and could not simply weigh factors without reference to the
                    likely issues. The principal witnesses required for this action would be the
                    plaintiff’s representatives and the second and third defendants
                    themselves. In addition, the relevant documents in such an action were, as she
                    submitted, primarily agreements, correspondence and related documents in English
                    between the plaintiff and the defendants. No issue was raised as to the
                    availability of the plaintiff’s representatives, the second and the third
                    defendants themselves. One question of fact that might be raised related to the
                    iron ore content of the concession site. In relation to this, the defendants
                    raised one potential difficulty, <em>viz</em>, that the
                    defendants might require evidence relating to the extent of drilling conducted
                    by the plaintiff from two Indonesian nationals and residents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     At this stay application stage, in the
                    totality of the likely issues in the trial, the defendants were not able to show
                    whether the evidence of the two Indonesian nationals and residents would be
                    material, whether the defendants would require these two witnesses at the trial,
                    whether they would be available, and whether or not other available witnesses
                    would be able to provide the same evidence. Accordingly I was unable to conclude
                    that the non-compellability of these two possible witnesses, in light of the
                    undisputed availability of the parties and the English language communications
                    and agreements established that there was another more appropriate
                    forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I had considered the relevant connecting
                    factors in their totality, taking into account the substance of this
                    cross-border joint venture, the business efficacy and objectives of the parties,
                    the absence of a choice of law or forum in the Letter of Offer which was the
                    subject matter of the plaintiff’s action against the defendants and the
                    likely issues at the trial and the witnesses and evidence in light of such
                    likely issues. On balance, I did not think that the defendants had shown that
                    there was another more appropriate forum. Considering all the circumstances of
                    this offshore arrangement, I was of the view that allowing the action to proceed
                    in Singapore would meet the interests of the parties and the ends of
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the light of the above, I allowed the
                    appeal and fixed the costs of the hearings here and below at S$9,000 inclusive
                    of disbursements.</p>
